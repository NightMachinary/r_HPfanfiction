:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's been a really long time since I read this so I'm a bit blurry on the details, but it's something where Harry returns to Hogwarts, I think maybe apprentices under Snape, and then Snape just has him rebuilding the castle? Like Harry gets really annoyed because he's not doing anything interesting or whatever

That's all I remember, sorry it's so vague.


** I only know of the One-Shot linkffn(12371783) which has a similar premise (Apprentice under Snape) though it's in a potions shop and has nothing to do with Hogwarts.

Fair warning though that it's a Harry/Severus slash pairing.

  Two years after the war, Severus runs a potions shop, and Harry works as his assistant, each of them hiding their feelings for the other. Then Draco Malfoy asks Severus out and changes everything.

** Is the story you are looking for snarry? There's one I can think of where Harry has a bunch of excess power so he's rebuilding the castle and buildings in hogsmeade to use his power. Severus is helping teach Harry control. If you think that might be it let me know and I'll try to locate the title.
