*** Yeah I thought there was a nice variety but I do think this was mostly about what stories have the most stats for their respective tropes.

** There was a Dramione section, which left me little hope for the quality of the list. The rest of the list did little to convince me otherwise. Methods of Rationality is on there for god's sake. Harry/Draco is a section with stuff like "Draco is a veela". I would exclude everything except like 4 fics.
