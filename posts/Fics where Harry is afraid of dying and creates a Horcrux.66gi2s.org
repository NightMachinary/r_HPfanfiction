** It's a pretty big spoiler for the second installment, but this happens in For The Price of a Soul.

Linkffn(9265719)

It's a crossover with Supernatural, but you the Supernatural elements are well explained and I think you could get through the majority without knowing the show.

** I haven't seen stories like this mainly because realistically it would never happen, in the series Harry has been shown to not fear death at all, it's one of the reasons he becomes the master of death. Death is seen as a release for him, he gets to see his family and friends again, compare that to Voldemort who feared death and tried to prevent it. Albus is another character who didn't fear death, he viewed it as the next great adventure. It's why Stories where he makes a horcrux is hard to swallow.

Also harry wouldn't kill a person just to stave off death, he has a very strong moral compass and it's one of the things that makes harry who he is.

*** Not too sure about that, realistically, Harry SHOULD have feared death as for him it's just another thing he can't control, just like his entire life, just like where he goes and what he does, he always has to be everyone's errand boy. I think if he didn't fear death he would still hold a great amount of animosity towards it for how many people it has taken from him.

***** Harry's character as we know it does indeed disallow the oppertunity, but considering the circumstances in Harry's life, diverging from canon in this method is not immersion breaking, and you could make a decent case for it as a fanfic plot.

****** Harry was never 'Everyones errand boy'. Harry didn't have much respect for authority, though there were plenty of authority figures he respected. Harry always did his own thing guided by his strong set of morals.

If you want to write a fic about Harry who is completely OC you could. But don't pretend canon has anything to do with it.
