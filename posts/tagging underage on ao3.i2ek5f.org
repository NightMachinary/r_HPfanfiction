** [[https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#ratings_and_warnings][AO3 docs]] say: "Underage refers to descriptions or depictions of sexual activity by characters under the age of eighteen (18)."

** I mean, Age of Consent is 16 in Britain and 17 in Ireland. It's 14 in some places in Europe (Germany, I think?). Vatican City is technically 16 for males and 14 for females, but only if they're married. So, 'underage' is legally relative depending on your nation of origin. I believe Ao3 operates on New York law, so that would likely be your benchmark for whether it's legally underage or not. I have no idea what it is in that state, I'm afraid - I only know any of the other AoCs because it came up in an argument once and I like to research. :D

I have no input on whether it should be underage based on HP canon or underage based on Real World law though. Smut is really not my field of interest.

*** Is it actually the age of consent that matters? Because while yes, it is 16 in Britain, you'd still have to be 18 for porn, right? But now I'm not sure if writing smut counts as porn...

I guess I'll just tag it as underage, just to make sure.\\
Thank you for your answer!

**** Happy to help. I do love to research, so... :)

You do have to be 18 for porn, yeah. But I got curious about whether it did count and did some googling and apparently, unless you're writing RPF, they're not real people and so there doesn't seem to be any comment on age there. Everything I've found on porn definitions in both the UK and the US only ever talks about visual imagery, never written stuff. One of our legal codes even uses the term 'photographs'. :D

Like, written stuff doesn't get counted by child porn laws in the US - which surprised the heck out of me, but apparently there was a big case about it that got ruled in the favour of not counting it ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition]]) since, to paraphrase, they're not real people and thus nobody is actually harmed by it.

I think the UK is the same way (regarding written stuff not being porn, I mean), though there's apparently no actual legal definition of Pornography here. We do have a thing called the 'Obscene Publication Act' that regulates written porn, but it doesn't seem to have an age thing in it either?

So, technically 'underage' isn't a legally mandated tag on Ao3? But that doesn't really matter all that much anyway - Ao3 apparently use 18 as a mandated limit on their site ([[https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq]]). Check the link and search for 'What do you mean by "underage" in the Archive tags' to find their answer.

TL:DR - age doesn't matter, since written stuff doesn't count as porn and none of them are real anyway. But Ao3 defines underage as anything under 18.

***** Oh wow haha I hope I didn't make you feel like you had to look that up with my more or less rhetorical questions, but this is very interesting nonetheless!

I did read about what they meant with their warnings but the "please just use your best judgement." part kinda threw me off, and I was curious to know what people thought counted as underage regarding the wizarding world specifically.

Though I realise now I never really specified that in my ask. But oh well haha

Thank you for all the research!

****** Ah, right. No, you definitely didn't specify that. Phrased it more like a tagging mechanics question than a worldbuilding one, I'm afraid. :)

Well, I did kind of have to - not because you asked, but because my brain intensely dislikes unanswered questions and would irritate me for the next week until I did google. :D

And in answer to your actual question, I imagine it'd either be 17 as well, since Rowling seems to have Magical British adopt at least some modern mentalities, or whatever basically-tween age it was back in 1690-whatever when the statute was signed.

** Some years back, Canada and Australia both had a crackdown on fanfic that had under-18 sex scenes, classifying it as kiddie porn. Arguments that it was fictional characters fell on deaf ears. Some people got around that by raising the age of all Hogwarts classes by a year, so first years were 12 and 7th years were 18.

Honestly, the only reason I think JKR made her wizarding age of adulthood be 17, was to make the 7th years become legal adults on their birthdays (meaning September for Hermione). She did claim to have at least an outline of the whole thing in her head from the beginning, so maybe the trace disappearing during the horcrux hunt was always going to be an important plot point.

** If you tag it as underage, you're automatically going to lose a whole chunk of readers. It's one of the most common filters, afaik. For me, it depends on how it's written. If it's written as erotica, with the intent to arouse, then it should absolutely be tagged. If it's not, then you can probably leave it untagged. Think of the difference between hardcore porn and a sex scene in a mainstream movie where you don't see any of the naughty bits.
