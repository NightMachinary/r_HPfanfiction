I heard of a fic before and never thought about it, but now the thought interests me.

The post I saw it on basically said all of this, Harry finds ancient and mythical beasts, which he then kills, absorbing their magic and adding it to his own. He sells the stuff from them to gringotts, and creates a new magical house.

Anyone know of this???
