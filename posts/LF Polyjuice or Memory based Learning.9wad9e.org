Saw a Fic where Malfoy's Squib older brother was Harry's bodyguard, and he gave people Muscle Memory by performing Martial Arts whilst Polyjuiced as them, and then someone extracted his memory of doing that, and put the memory in the head of the person he was Polyjuiced. I can't remember the name of the Fic, but I'd like to see any other fics that use Polyjuice and extracting memory, to teach. "I remember myself doing it, even if it wasn't me, so doing it myself is a lot easier" logic.
