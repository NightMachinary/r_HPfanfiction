There's one thing that's always driven me crazy about quidditch robes. In nearly every drawing I've seen of them, there's a long trail of fabric waving behind them in the air. Not very aerodynamic, could get caught on your broom, someone else's broom, a bludger could get caught in it and literally rip you off the broom...! Though they to get mashed in the face by the, so fair I guess? I'm half tempted to use this as a method to beat the living daylights out of quidditch players... c'mon, magical kids playing aerial sports with half sentient iron balls. Someone's getting hit in the face.

Wait, how sentient are those balls? They're enchanted to follow players, but how do they target a player, switch targets, can they choose to switch targets or bully one person the whole game? They clearly can be tampered with (thank you Dobby), but what about the enchantments on the ball itself?

And the brooms. Why is there not a rule for everyone to have the same model? It's kind of unfair if Harry's got a Firebolt and everyone else is riding Nimbus series. He outpaces everyone just by his broom, not any particular skill (though he definitely has it)!

The Snitch should have a smaller point value and possibly not used to end the game. If the Snitch is caught in the first five minutes, that's boring. If it's not caught for a week or so, WAY too long. Didn't Wood tell Harry the record was THREE MONTHS???

Thanks for listening


** I read a fanfic YEARS ago that dealt with Harry as a seasoned professional seeker, who was absolutely dominant in the game for years. And he advocated the change to the rules that addressed many of the issues you have laid out here (mostly the rules surrounding seekers and snitch capture).

â€‹

In the fic, the rules changed as follows

1. The game would end under one of two conditions: a certain amount of time had passed (I want to say 2 hours or so); or the Snitch had been captured a total of three times.
2. As part of the second endgame condition, scoring via snitch capture changed. The first capture was worth 25 points, the second worth 50, and the final capture was worth 75 and ended the game.

** I've always like the idea that the quality of brooms have improved rapidly and the rules of Quidditch have yet to be changed to reflect this. Better brooms theoretically mean faster Snitch captures, especially if the Snitch's design hasn't been tweaked. The grueling Quidditch matches that took weeks or even months probably happened due to slower medieval brooms and shoddy seeker play. The length of Quidditch games at Hogwarts suggests that the Snitch probably needs to be faster and/or more elusive.

 

Other changes to the rules are probably necessary. The size of Quidditch goalposts could be increased, more Quaffles, or additional Chasers to increase scoring. Maybe even use magic so the goalposts can be scored on from any direction. The point value of capturing the Snitch probably won't change due to the history behinds its point value, but the value for scoring a goal with a Quaffle could be increased. The International Confederation of Wizards Quidditch Committee has a lot of work cut out for them in improving Quidditch.

** I will say, you think too hard about it.

The long trail of fabric is there for a simple reason. It looks nice, and probably way better than some aerodynamic body suit. Also Magic, they may as well be spelled to be aerodynamic, as much as someone on a broom can be.

The balls are also spelled. I guess they either target everyone on a defined playing zone, or there is some kind of marker on either the robes or the brooms to make them targets.

For the brooms, 2 reasons. The first one is for the plot (if everyone had the same brooms, you would loose some stories like how Draco bribed his way onto the team ). The 2nd is that different role has different role. A keeper need a broom for fast latteral movements, a seeker a fast one with quick acceleration. Unless a pkayer have a top of the line broom (nimbus or firebolt ), they will use different model or brands.

The importance of the seeker is for the plot. It's because Harry is the seeker that Rowling gave it this importance (cant have the hero do his best and yet still loose because his seeker lost ). Yet most of the tentatives to change the rules in fanfic were pretty annoying to read.

** This is one of the points in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, where Harry also points out that quidditch is dum.
