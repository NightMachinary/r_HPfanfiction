What i want to know are Fics that have Harry/Fleur not really as a Pair, but it definetely involves them and its about their interaction between. It can be Post Canon (whether she is with Bill or not) or AU. I imagined, that Harry would possibly be charmed by her Beauty, when he first saw her Canon-wise, but then he got used to her and its nothing special in her appearance anymore, but then post war at some event or occasion, something in his Mind switched and he is again attracted to her Beauty. He would even confess it to her, but she would kindly reject him, telling him that she doesnt reciprocrate his feelings (althoguh she admires that he has a thing for her). They remain good friends, however. A possible Night stand of them at some Point wouldnt be eliminated, though.

I would like these Fics to start after Voldemorts defeat, but i take school fics aswell.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

**** Almost not even remotely what the OP is looking for but still in a way the closest and it's a great fic besides.
