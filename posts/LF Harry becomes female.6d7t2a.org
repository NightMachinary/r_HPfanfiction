Basically to cut to the chase, Harry turns into a girl. She's called Melania or something like that? At first he's like 'yo dumbles turn me back' but he's like 'gotta give it some time sonny' then after a summer Harry likes being a girl?

I know I'm not giving you much to go on, but if someone knows what I'm going on about that would be grand.

Edit: if anyone has any recommendation for decent gender switch fics then I'd greatly appreciate them.

*** That's it all right, thanks man.

Not sure if I even want to read it again, just woke up and couldn't remember what it was called.
