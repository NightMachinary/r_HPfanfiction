Currently reading linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane), and quite enjoying it. However, this passage just about gave me hysterics:

#+begin_quote
  A lemon drop was ported directly from a small pouch on his belt into his mouth; courtesy of a nifty little charm he had invented for such formal situations where sticky fingers had to be avoided.
#+end_quote

Talk about magic being used for the most trivial things! Porting sweets into your mouth!

So, what's your favourite bit of Fanfiction dealing with Albus the Lemon Drop fiend? What's the most ridiculously humorous? Or just most ridiculous? Are there any where it's a tragic note, like them being Ariana's favourite?


** In the classic linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux by melindaleo), which predicted most of the major plot points in Deathly Hallows before it came out, Harry and co. are speaking to Dumbledore's portrait. The portrait straight up admits he knew Harry was different because "in all his time at Hogwarts, Harry was the only one to ever accept a lemon drop when Dumbledore offered them one in his office."

#+begin_quote
  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

*** Haha forgot about that! Makes one think...what if the real reason he disliked and distrusted Tom from the start was because young Tom not only accepted the sweets, but took a huge handful!

**** I think Dumbledore might have been more suspicious of him when he discovered the kid had been using magic to control, torture, steal from, and kill other living things as a pre-teen.

That would have jumped out more to me honestly.

** Linkffn(3695087) due to improper facts involving false storys about Snape abusing Albus in various ways Minerva is worried about him and thinks he shouldnt be doing his duties as headmaster anymore so she and a few others convince Hermione and Harry to lie to dumbledore and make him believe Voldemort is diabetic and that he should focus on searching the world for lemon drops and tasteing each one until he finds or creates the perfect one which can defeat voldemort. Minerva only does this of course because she cares for him and thinks it is the best for him do to the abuse she thinks he suffered. All in all I enjoyed the story and it had quite a few funny momemts in my opinion.

  Lily's sacrifice did a lot more for Harry than protect him from Voldemort. It protected him from the worst of his relatives' abuse, too. But when Dumbledore tells him the whole story, he decides he's had enough and takes control of his life. Set in sixth year.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
