I don't remember much from it but this is what I do:

Harry and ginny had some kind of bond or something and ginny left harry when he was in some sort of coma in the hospital and met some other man at the park(I think). Harry moves to a place and works as a muggle. Ginny then sets out to find him and meets the guy harry works for and the man tells her where he is and they meet and there are many times where there are heart to hearts between harry and ginny with one being around the fire with harry asking why and all. Im fairly sure there was a child in this too who comes to live with ginny.

I know this isn't much but I've been looking for it for a very long time. I found it on a list of fanfics(don't remember the list)

#+begin_quote
  How do you go on when the one thing you counted on is gone? What do you do, where do you go, when you find life has passed you by? Nine years has passed since Harry defeated Voldemort. Nine years he spent in a coma.
