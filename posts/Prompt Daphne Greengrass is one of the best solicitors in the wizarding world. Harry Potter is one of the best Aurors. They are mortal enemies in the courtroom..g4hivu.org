*** I think this is coming from the idea that Harry is there to testify for his cases, and so he sees the criminals he arrests getting off every time. Kinda similar to Detective McNulty with Stringer Bell in The Wire if you've seen that.

** "Mr. Potter, did you or did you not entered the Defendant's residence fifteen minutes before the subpoena arrived?"

"I-I did"

"Lord Judge, I call for any evidence of the contraband Mr. Potter found at defendants house to be removed as illegally acquired"

"Motion Deferred, evidences 7 through 10 are therefore not usable by the prosecution"

If glares could burn the ones sent by one Susan Bones to Harry would have left him smoking.

"Now Mr. Potter, why did you not wait for the subpoena to arrive?"

Harry looked into Daphne's eyes, who just raised an eyebrow "I was afraid of running late to a...previously arranged...appointment"

There was confusion in her eyes before they widened and her face became carefully blank.

"I see"

The rest of the testimony was taken, along with the defendant's, and despite the evidence removal of part of the evidence, the evidence found on the defendant's establishment (which was legally apprehended) was enough for condemnation and the application of a hefty fine and bail sentence. Much less however than if the evidence in the house was taken into account. Truly a harmless but illegal case of contraband of magical ingredients.

The Lord Judge ended the procedures, and thanked both parties, "I believe that's all, thank you Mrs. Bones, and Mrs. Potter"

Susan was still glaring at Harry while Daphne had a smug look on her face while her client, one Blaise Zabini was thanking her profusely.

At the back of the room, a couple was having a discussion.

"Ron, shouldn't that be considered a conflict of interest?"

"Eh, I don't think there's a law like that, some people tried to raise a fuss, but never managed to pin anything illegal, it always ends within the law, and both parties are normally satisfied enough to not complain much, though I think Susan will make Harry take on Alley Duty for few weeks for that one"

Another voice from their side spoke "It's not like there is any other barrister with balls to defend anyone arrested by 'Auror Potter' and not go for a plea bargain when he glares at them, and it's not like Daphne gets any of the really bad cases, it's more a hobby now"

Hermione looked over at Astoria Malfoy, who was sitting on the side of a very amused looking Draco Malfoy, before huffing, sometimes she forgot on how the Wizarding World seemed to lack any sense in some things.

Said barrister and Auror were coming up now, with an irritated looking Harry being arm in arm with an amused Daphne.

"You know Harry, had you sent a Patronus, I would not have gotten mad with you"

He sighed, "I know, it's just I had already canceled that dinner, and it wouldn't be fair with you to make you miss another"

She stopped to caress his face tenderly "Well come on to dinner then, I am famished"

She looked at the other two couples, who rose from their seats to follow them.

The second Friday's dinners were always at the Potter's.

*** Solicitor probably works better in this case. Criminal solicitors tend to do either defence work or prosecution work and stick with that side. Barristers on the other hand are engaged on a case-by-case basis and can be doing prosecution one day and defence the next.

So if Daphne is to be consistently doing defence work, it would make more sense for her to be a solicitor.

**** A Solicitor does not intervene in Criminal Court only on the very small case, the Solicitor interact with his client and forward the case to a Barrister who does his work in Court. A Solicitor conducts proceedings in Court only in Magistrates Courts and County Courts be it civil or criminal. A Barrister is needed by law even if recent reform has allowed more flexibility between the summa divisio of Sollicitor and Barrister, in the High Court, be it\\
Family Division or Queen Bench Division, in the Crown Court and in the Court of Appeals. The criminal case in the Wizengamot and Council of Magic Law would be at High Court Level Minimun. Even if the more similar would be the old procedure of indictment transferred by the Queen Bench Court to the House of Lords sitting in Supreme Court and presided by Lord High Steward. A Lord could only be tried by his peers. Of course those time are sadly gone.

***** Yes, barristers do the advocacy except in lower courts. Not sure what relevance that has, though. Harry is an Auror, so won't be doing any advocacy either. The premise is that Harry is trying to catch criminals and Daphne is trying to get them off. That doesn't require either of them to be performing advocacy, just that they are involved in the case. Which both Aurors and solicitors would be.

****** Ah You speak of the investigative stage before prosecution in Court. You speak of the leg work so to speak before formal indictment. I was thinking of the proceedings in Court stage with the examination of the case, the witness interrogation ... . It does not help that we don't know what are the Hit Wizards and Aurors prerogatives in terms of investigation regulation and suspects rights. Does the DMLE recognise the Bill of Rights ? Very difficult if the DMLE workers are allowed to use veritaserum on suspects.

******* Solicitors are involved in court proceedings as well, though they do not perform the advocacy. Barristers will often need to take instructions on strategy etc. and it is the solicitor they get their instructions from. Solicitors are also in control of the trial documents, the trial logistics, and corralling and preparing witnesses/experts.
