Are there any fics where Harry has Marie Antoinette Syndrome and has like a white streak of hair like Anna from Frozen? And it slowly turns completely white?


** And here was me thinking you were asking for stories where a Harry who had such a sheltered and privileged upbringing, that his naÃ¯ve worldview causes the masses to turn against him.

** There was one fic where Harry ended up in Azkaban after the Triwizard Tournament and his hair turned white in year he spent there. It is on ffnet and has a Banshee in its name (Call of a Banshee maybe?). I think it is abandoned, however.
