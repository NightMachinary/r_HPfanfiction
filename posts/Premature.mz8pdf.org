The prophecy was made in April of 1980, on hearing it, Dumbledore suspected the Potters of being the subjects, he then told them of the prophecy, Lily then went to a muggle hospital, and faked a condition that required the doctors to induce labor at the end of June instead of July. Harry is still the intended subject of the prophecy, but as he doesn't fit the phrasing anymore, no one realizes this.


** all i can think of is dumbledore being like “i'm so sorry this is so difficult” and lily being like “yes :( now someone hand me a fucking knife it's csection time, baby”

** Fun fact from a quick Google: The last day of the seventh month (Rajab) of the year 1400 by the Islamic calendar is the 13th of June 1980 by the Gregorian calendar. The prophecy never specified which seventh month.

*** I never would have thought of a loophole like that, but it could be a good avenue for an OC to enter, born at the beginning of June. I like that train of thought

*** Along the same lines, doesn't “September” basically mean “seventh month”, from back in Roman times?

*** Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure prophecies are set for the terms the people who hear them understand. So, unless you make the Potters ISLAMIC, I doubt that would work. The same for the Roman calendar. They're ENGLISH, not Roman, so that wouldn't apply. Otherwise, you might get a prophecy delivered in some Brazilian Tribal language that no one can understand -- essentially rendering the prophecy a non-issue. And it would happen all the time.

**** Or the frame of reference is set by the seer, and you just get creative with Trelawny's backstory.

** Well, this would probably only work, if the Longbottoms did the same. Voldemort decided that Harry was the child of the prophesy but he could have chosen Neville. With Harry out of the picture Neville probably would have been the BWL, by being the only child that fits the prophesy (or so everyone in the know would think). If Alice followed Lily's example though, there would seemingly be no child to fit the prophesy and that is something I'd really like to read.

*** My thought was that everyone would assume it was Neville incorrectly because he was the only one that fit, whether he actually survives or not. That said a situation where the prophecy just comes up blank could be very interesting too. When I considered this I was thinking wizards having magic are able to pinpoint time of birth and keep both the mother and child healthy and so don't really know about early labor, that and them being dismissive of muggle advancement, they wouldn't even be able to consider a situation like that
