...why do you like it? What elements of the story appeal to you?


** There's a lot that I dislike about Harry Crow, and yet I've read it several times. Why? I love the worldbuilding of goblin culture, and I appreciate the concept of taking the prophecy and threat of Voldemort's return seriously and preparing Harry from a young age to give him the best chance for survival. I appreciate that the good guys use every tool they know of, including Muggle and goblin technology and weaponry, to their advantage. I appreciate that Frank and Alice were healed. And the descriptions of dueling and battles are really well-done, unique, and exciting. SO many fanfics have tedious fight scenes, or eschew them entirely.

** Robst finishes his stories, and in a timely manner. He doesn't leave dozens of stories unfinished and/or abandoned while he chases the next plot idea for a few chapters. That puts him ahead of most fanfiction authors who never finish their stories. In addition to that, you know what you're getting when you read his stories - if you like Harmony with a powerful Harry and a lot of Dumbledore and Weasley bashing, especially Ron and Molly, you'll be satisfied. Harry Crow pretty much has all that in spades.

I can't stand the Weasley and Dumbledore bashing any more, nor the way Hermione will basically end up a support character for Harry the hero no matter how the story starts, and I don't like the slut shaming that appeared in Harry Crow. But that's my personal taste.

  A mediocre story, even finished, is far less interesting than a good story, even if it's only a chapter long.
#+end_quote

The point, I think, is that a finished story, even a mediocre one, is ahead of more than half the 800000+ stories on FFN, many of which are both mediocre (at best) and unfinished.

Also, it shows dedication on the author's part, which bodes well for their storytelling effort and earns readers' respect.

**** A story needs an ending to be considered good, imho. Starting a story is also far, far easier than finishing it - as proved by the tons of stories that hit the plot point the author had in mind and then fizzle out since the author never thought beyond that "cool scene" they had in mind. You can spin quite the yarn, pile up the mysteries and twists, but a story needs a satisfying resolution to be good.

Interesting ideas or chapters are not enough.

****** That's a very good definition. A story needs, among other things, a conclusion - an ending, a resolution. A piece of writing doesn't.

Another thing to consider is that a story can be ruined by a bad ending, no matter how good the start was.

** RobSt is a solid writer, and/or has a good beta reader

(Say what you will about his stories, but they don't read like they were written by a dyslexic, somali preteen)

I also enjoy that it's very AU, and not just a slight twist on a story that five dozen other writers has taken a stab at already..

** Like many ITT, Harry Crow was my first introduction to Robst fanfics. What I loved about it the first time I read it was how unique it seemed to me. Keep in mind it was one of the first handful of fics I read so I didn't know about the tropes and cliches that plague lots of fics in the HP universe.

One positive thing that can be said for Robst, in general, is that every one of his stories begins uniquely. The premise of Harry being raised by goblins is one that has been attempted very few times to my knowledge, and in this story the world building was very well done.

I've tried rereading it twice and couldn't get through it either time. The problem with Harry Crow is that it drags on too long, and the problem with Robst fics in general is that after starting with a wonderfully unique premise, after a few chapters the same old shit starts happening all over again. He also has a few writing techniques that he uses several times per chapter that I don't care for and each time he uses one it makes me cringe. A couple random examples would be: “Harry falling in love with Hermione meant that he would do anything to protect her from harm. He was always going to be the one to treat her right.”

I don't like how instant Harry and Hermione 'bond' but as you and others said, he has unique ideas and is great at writing detail.

*** Not the OP but... perhaps the OP is struggling with it, and wants to hear positive things about the story so they'll stick it out until the end?

I like the concept, but I can't get over the frankly fucked up relationship between Hermione and Harry, and the way Hermione's parents treat said relationship (and are treated by the author). The ickyness of that portion of the story became too much, and therefore I put it down. Other people can ignore it - I couldn't.

That being said, I really liked the one other story of his that I've read (A Different Halloween). Both stories are wish fulfillment with a ship I enjoy, the writing is generally fine and it's a long, completed story. In theory it's something I would like... but the glorification of an unhealthy relationship between twelve year olds? Yeah, nope.

The sub loves Ron (at least in recent times), so anything which paints him in a bad light is seen as evil. Just look at the "the movies were horrible for low-key shipping H/Hr" comments you see every time someone brings them up.

I'll admit that bashing is not the sign of good writing (unless it's crack), but the Robst hate here feels like a circlejerk. Just like the Noodlehammer bashing. It is well known, no need to bring it up again and again.

***** The relationships Robst writes are controversial to put it mildly. Or rather, the age is, especially in Harry Crow. Noodlehammer, well it's a powerwank, and not a good one. But this sub acts as if it's the worst fic you can find, which it definitely isn't. There is so much utterly depraved shit on the sites that IMO Noodlehammer isn't worth getting worked up over. Countless fics are so much worse.

*** Take about 10% off there, Sensitive Sally. I asked the question because I was reading Dunuelos' Lone Traveler stuff, and in an author's note he mentioned "Harry Crow" being one of his top five favorite fanfics. And despite your assertion of "the Robst hate on this sub," Harry Crow /specifically/ gets a lot of recs, especially from people looking for Harmony work.

Now, personally, Harry Crow is probably my least favourite RobSt fic; I found it clumsy, boring, and chock full of obnoxiously arrogant, braggart 'better than thou' Mary Sue characters. /But/ it has a number of fans, quite devoted ones, and I was curious as to why. And I've gotten some great answers (especially from [[/u/cellequisaittout]] - cheers, mate), and I'm considering giving it a shot (for the third or so time). RobSt is something of a guilty pleasure of mine; some of his fics are crap, some are gold, and most lie somewhere in a pleasant, popcorn read middle ground.
