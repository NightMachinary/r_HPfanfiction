I've been reading fanfiction for several years now, and I've come to the conclusion that writers don't know how to do detailed descriptions of non-model esque characters.

So many stories I read now are filled with a world full of unmistakably perfect people.

One recent story I read had a scene where the main girls in hogwarts had a slumber party, and then the writer went round all the girls describing how perfect but slightly different their bodies were?\\
Is it just me or is anyone else annoyed that very few stories have some sort of physical realism?

** The most egregious example of this is when the author makes Snape some otherworldly sex god. I don't care how much you like Alan Rickman. It is explicitly stated in the books that Snape is fuck-ugly.

Dude has a hook nose and an eternal film of grease coating his pale, skeletal body. You know those stereotypical cutouts of witches that people hang up on Halloween? Snape is that, but with a penis.

If you want to write romance with him, by all means. Everyone deserves some love in their life. But for god's sake, stop pretending that every student sighs longingly when he saunters into the dungeon.

** That's not just fanfiction. Any type of media, across the board, usually doesn't focus on unattractive people. It's rare for a book to specifically describe a main protagonist or supporting character as unattractive, and in movies/television it's unheard of. In particular, when Hollywood adapts a book to the big screen they pick attractive actors to portray the leads even in cases where the book described the main characters as flawed.

I'm not annoyed by it because it's just the status quo, but I am pleasantly surprised when a fic doesn't fall into that mold.

**** /The Hunchback of Notre Dame/ is an interesting exception. As [[/u/JibrilAngelos]] mentioned, authors often make characters' outer appearance match their supposed moral nature. This is especially common in literature from the Romantic period, during which people believed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomy][physiognomy]] was a real thing. Victor Hugo's novel was in some ways a critique of physiognomy. He intentionally wrote scenarios and characters that overturned the commonly held ideas at the time.

***** *Physiognomy*

Physiognomy (from the Greek φύσις physis meaning "nature" and gnomon meaning "judge" or "interpreter") is a practice of assessing a person's character or personality from their outer appearance---especially the face. It is often linked to racial and sexual stereotyping. The term can also refer to the general appearance of a person, object, or terrain without reference to its implied characteristics---as in the physiognomy of an individual plant (see plant life-form) or of a plant community (see vegetation).

Credence of such study has varied.

** You need to stop seeing fanfiction as a collection of literary pursuits. Yes, a lot of fanfiction is made by aspiring writers, and yes, some of them are terrible at it. But there's also a huge part of the community content with writing out their fantasies and treating other stories the same, which is where they get favourites from.

In other words, do I wish more stories were realistic in this? Yes. Am I annoyed there's a lot of stories that are not? No.

*** Average looking men are lumped into being unnattractive (See 80/20 rule).

Men's measure of attractiveness for women is generally the length of time it'd take to make the decision to smash. If he has to think about it, he's not really attracted to her, but if he finds a feature he likes while thinking it over he'll do it anyway, because why not?

As for fanfic, both genders (Male and Female) are guilty of overexaggerating the attractiveness of the main characters they are writing about. Because to them, that's the ideal romance and honestly, who doesn't want thier creations/pairings to be perfect and validated outside of the two of them? Not that there is anything wrong with that. And to be perfectly frank, if you love the person you're going to describe them as beautiful to you anyway. I don't think I've ever seen a couple describe themselves as average, internalize it, and then mean every word. That's generally not how emotions work.

Also, a lot of people grew up on the movies (Or at least seen them) and use those as the general descriptors for thier characters.

Although I find describing Daniel Radcliffe as tall honestly hilarious.

So I could be wrong about the slumber party detailing, but only because people are weird.

** Ugliness is something very shallow to comment on. Not all characters are shallow. If you want to point someone out as ugly, very well, do it. But I think the author, so he uses a Omniscient Narrator, should abstain from commenting on the appearance in a judging way. If a character notes in his thoughts or speech someone else to be beautiful or ugly, I don't see any issues.

Too many people feel the need to point out their character as blindingly attractive, easily forgetting that /this/ is a very subjective thing. What one considers attractive may be repulsive to the next. Such omniferous statements have very little meaning and therefore are useless.

Please do understand that there are as many definitions of the word "beauty" as there are people. Not all may differ, certainly, but all, nonetheless, share the very common fact that tastes vary even in their smallest nuances. I may prefer very muscular women, and find them to be absurdly attractive, while you might find it to be disgusting. You may like this, I may like that.

** It's certainly annoying when authors go over the top with this, it just reeks of trying-too-hard, but I honestly don't think it's that prevalent. I see plenty of fics where characters are just described as normal but those moments don't stand out too much. The ones where everyone suddenly turns into a perfect super model type are more memorable though, and if it's something you find particularly annoying then it's only natural you'd notice and remember when an author does it.

My main ship is Snape/Hermione and I've definitely read my share of stories where they are described as way too good looking (something I just ignore) but still wouldn't say this is the norm. Many fics in this ship go with the approach that while they're not beautiful/handsome, they do find each other attractive, which I think is a perfectly sensible approach to a relationship between them.

I've even seen the complete opposite case of what you're describing. For example, I recently read a story in which the author described Hermione as a UK size 12 and she got shit on in the reviews by people complaining that Hermione would never be that fat. It's just a common issue in literature/art/cinema that characters are expected to be good looking.
