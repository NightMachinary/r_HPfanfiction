*** Assuming you're not being sarcastic, it comes up in Cursed Child. Astoria Malfoy ne√© Greengrass dies from a bloodline curse passed down through her family.

***** No fear, CC really did a lot of unlikeable things to well loved characters and I don't think you're missing much by skipping it.

***** I'm pretty sure it was Fanon even before Cursed child. I've seen it in a lot of Haphne fics.

It even fits, since the, Cursed child is literally just bad fanfiction.

** In Keystone Council, I have Astoria getting ill from the blood curse at the end of her first year (Daphne and Harry's second), and Harry makes it his mission to find a cure. This being a multiverse fic, he has four healthy Astorias to compare the sick one to, and four alternate-universe counterparts of himself to help out.

Unfortunately, this just happened in the last two chapters, so I don't have much story to offer - but it's something I want to explore. Canon always felt as if she got sick just to give Draco and Scorpius the sads, and that bothers me on a fundamental level. It felt very much like she was stuffed into a refrigerator, or the wizarding equivalent.

** I'd love some stuff with an HP/AG pairing exploring her bloodline curse. There's not many HP/AG fics in general, and I've never read one with that in it at all.
