Hey guys, I know I just bothered you all like 5 minutes ago, but I figured this would be the best place to solve a mystery. I mean, didn't reddit find Shia Labeuof when he was out and about.

Anyway, I was following this great fanfiction author on AO3 a while back, almost 7 months ago or more now. She wrote at least 4 Snily stories and had 1 ongoing one that I was also following- and by the way she was great at writing these. The author's AO3 name is *Valardoheris* and the ongoing story was titled */Twist of Fate/*. However, at some point in time I stopped receiving updates from both the story and anything that the author did on the website. I even had her other completed ones bookmarked on my account and they were gone from my bookmark list. Her page itself now led me to a 404 error page. It was as if she deleted her account, which would make no sense to me. I mean she was in the middle of s good story and has had success on the website, so this was very surprising and unexpected.

Now I do realize that this could be something on my end, but I can't see how. My internet is fine, I tried on different computers, and even outside of my account. I am just looking for an explanation as to how and why her account and her stories are gone from the internet. Or even better, if she got a new account where all the stories are, please share. I don't know why but the suddenness and randomness of it all has me worried about a complete stranger, so any piece of info you might know would be cool. Thanks.
