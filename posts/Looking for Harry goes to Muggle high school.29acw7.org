** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2917903/1/All-at-Once][All at Once by Aurilia]] is pretty good, but it is a WIP that hasn't been updated since 2008, so I'm guessing it's abandoned. Still, I think it's worth checking out since it is over 200k words long.

"AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info."
