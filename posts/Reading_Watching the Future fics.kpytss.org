Are there any fics of the OOTP or the Marauders or really any of the characters either watching the movies or reading the books and finding out about the future? Most of the ones I seem to find never seem to get very far (especially ones involving the Marauders plus Lily) so I was wondering if there were any good books about the characters reacting to the future. I've especially wanted to see the kind of reaction the Marauders and Lily would have for how Snape really looked out for Harry even though it doesn't seem like it at first


** Here is one! Two actually! You can read the series in ao3!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977403][This series over here]] has realistic reactions and actions, as well as minimal quotations (as the summary states.). A Dramatic Reading (first book in the series) is complete, but A Sensational Story (second book) has had 7 chapters for as long as I can remember.

â€‹

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1779118][Over here]] is another one, a lot less realistic, but the reactions are still in character. First three books are complete, and goblet of fire is incomplete, but it's long and fun as well.
