I actually remember reading a Haphne story that had all of that (but it was meant as a joke). I can't remember the title, sadly.

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.

  or Veela allure

(Groan)...Allure. Not a thing. Pure fanon. Veelas are attractive through sheer prettiness and magical dancing, not 'allure'/'pheromones'/whatever. Bugger off.

**** What's this quoted from? Regardless, the point is that it's not a weird intangible "allure". The way they look and dance is seductive, it's not a pheromone or magical equivalent thereof as is usually understood in fanon-imbibed fanfics by the word "allure".

** What the fuck? So many logical holes and unrealistic bullshit going on here it's ridiculous. Why would Harry let some random ass older girl take his stuff from him and make it into a slideshow? The guy who stood up to Malfoy in an /instant/ when he tried to take his Nimbus and Neville's Remembral? Why would Harry sit and let that random girl "teach him sex ed" instead of telling her to fuck off and being uncomfortable and embarrassed over it? Not to mention pissed off at her arrogant presumptions and way crossing boundary lines. Why would Harry even /need/ lessons like that? Didn't he go to school before Hogwarts? Why would any older student actually decide to randomly teach some kid sex ed? Who would even actually do that? Seriously?

Jesus fucking hell, and a /practical lesson/? What, you want some random student to just up and decide, "Hey, I'm going to teach this teenage boy about sex, /by having sex with him/! Because clearly I have no reason to exist except to service a guy! I'm all about sex and nurturing by example." That's total bullshit, and you're a fucking idiot Hellstrike. Not to mention from all your posts you seem /real/ obsessed with "portraying" preteen and teen sex in all your stories...

*** I agree with your complaints but this is clearly meant to be a not-very-serious, borderline-crackfic kind of thing, so the implausibilities and OOC behavior are kind of excusable in this context. I'm not much for sex comedies myself, but in general, so long as it's deliberate, stretching disbelief so in the interest of a good laugh is fine by me.

Rowling wouldn't portray that in the books, but (especially in this looser, cracky context) it is /not/ hard to believe that a slightly older student might be up for making love to Harry, never mind if he's a few years younger than her. Harry's handsome and famous. And men don't have a monopoly on being lecherous, y'know. If you can believe that a teenage /boy/ might "take advantage" of a /girl/ in this situation, then you shouldn't find it so strange that this might happen with the genders of the participants switched out, also --- especially in a setting like the Wizarding World where sexism is mostly not a thing.

And considering that Hellstrike emphasizes that the 'practical lesson' is entirely optional and that if it there he doesn't want it to turn the story into just a piece of erotica at the expense of the humor... I don't think your accusations there at the end are warranted.

If Random Hufflepuff OC #547 does that, sure. But someone he knows like Katie Bell or Angelina Johnson?

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a6odeo/harrys_mail/ebwmac1/][This post is based on a comment in the "Harry's Mail" thread, which currently sits at +12]]. So obviously some people there liked the idea. Sorry that some of us like cracky comedy.

I said I preferred the absence of one, given that there is more than one story on Archive with them included and they are weird. But why not?

I draw the line at 14, which is the legal age of consent here in Germany. And anything younger is illegal here, even in fiction (as long as it is explicit and realistic).
