We all know the "Harry is Salazar" fics, but what if James Potter had been Salazar Slytherin reincarnated? It would explain his prejudice against the house of Slytherin, as James somehow knew, deep in his bones that every time people mention the "slimey, slippery, Dark-Arts-obssessed, muggle-hating House of Slytherin" that that's not how Slytherin is supposed to be. Something is Wrong with that house, and James was determined to fix every little thing about it.


** Woah

Would Lily know?

Wait if the marauders know would Voldemort also know?

*** Hmmm. I suppose if James knew the truth, then Lily and the marauders would know and keep it secret. If he didn't know, it would also be fun tho in a dramatic irony sort of way lol

**** I mean wouldn't peter blurt it out to Voldemort or would Salazar/James make them swear an unbreakable vow. (The kind of one we see in HBP)

We don't get much of James and this isn't something he would likely do but fanon Salazar still has some canon Salazar traits.

***** That's a good point. Salazar/James would prob do the unbreakable vow

Or, if we wanna flesh out the theory more: Sirius is Godric, Remus is Rowena, and Peter is Helga, so Peter never betrays them at all

****** This would also mean they would be in their respective houses. Going by your prompt Sal being in Gryffindor would make sense. Sirius/Godric will be In Gryffindor by default but I can't see the other 2 in Gryffindor. They would obviously still be friends but the “marauders” won't exist.

What would this mean for Snape tho. Would one of them take him under their wing or will Snape knowing more curses than an average seventh year put them of a bit.

What exactly happens to the Potter/Snape rivalry

The “James is arrogant, cocky and a bully and also has a crush on Lily but she want nothing to do with the arrogant toe rag” thing would also probably not happen

***** Yeah, you could just say that magic has a certain "frequency" in each person that is also passed on to their children(like DNA) and let Salazar's magic along with his memories be reincarnated in James. Harry can then be the legitimate heir of Slytherin.

****** It's called a family /tree/ for a reason. That same magical frequency will be shared among a lot of cousins. And once you're dead your direct heirs get their inheritance. You can't claim it back if you resurrect yourself.

Not to mention Hagrid got him the photo album the year before.

** Sounds like a pretty cool idea. Although I think the backstory should also be quite AU in order to fit the theme better.

As in, have the Marauders still be a thing, but have them be completely surrounded by mystery. They were never caught, not a single time. Because Salazar was cunning and all. And they probably wouldn't bully Snape as hard/at all. So Snape himself would have to be AU: either a true believer (in order to join the Death Eaters) or a "true" Slytherin being a spy from the very beginning.

But I really like the concept.

*** Or you could have James inherit the cunning and skil but not the memories till later in life.

so he completely hates slytherins and thinks everything they are doing is wrong but can never explain it

** Okay not to sound stupid, but can I get a link to the "Harry is Salazar" reincarnated fics?

I've honestly never read one. Then again I limit myself to only stories 60k words and above, and completed (not in-progress). That might stunt my knowledge a bit :(

*** Ofc! The best one I've ever read so far is actually one that meets those limits: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22144981]] (sorry I don't actually know how to use the bots lol). It's a Cedric/Harry Luna/Neville fic (but also Helga/Salazar Godric/Rowena). It's 90k+ and completed. From there you can prob follow the ao3 tag that SomewheresSword used (Harry Potter is Salazar Slytherin) to find others you might like :)
