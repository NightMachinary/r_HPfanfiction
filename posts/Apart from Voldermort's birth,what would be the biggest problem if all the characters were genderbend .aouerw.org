** Voldemort's conception would be more readily perceived as the crime it is if it had been Maeander Gaunt getting Tamsin Riddle pregnant by way of a 'love potion'. He'd still have ended up in an orphanage, of course: girls who got pregnant out of wedlock got put in 'psychiatric' institutions - some of them not getting out until the late 80s/early 90s - so the graveyard scene would've been the burial ground of a disused victorian asylum. For that added Hammer House of Horror vibe.

**** Good point. If /everything/ is genderbent, then so is the symbolism inherent in ritual and ceremonial magic. If it's just the genders of the characters, Riddle is shit out of luck because as an indigent he'd have got a Public Health funeral, which had been cremation-only affairs since before the first world war.

****** Well, his father dies in poverty doing his retarded inbred best to provide for his potioned 'bride'. His mother, going home when the potions stop coming, is committed to an asylum as an unwed mother and dies in childbirth there. When he returns to the house at Little Hangleton he only gets to murder his grandparents rather than a clean sweep of two generations of Riddles.

His father got an indigent's Public Health cremation, so no Bone of the Father, but if everything's genderbent, he gets Bone Of The Mother from the burial ground of the asylum she died in, if her family didn't claim her body when notified of her death.

******** A big piece of Voldemort's backstory is him being raised in an institution (and having a problem after 5th year because back then orphanages kicked their charges out at 14, that being the end of compulsory education and the beginning of the requirement to get a job and stop being a burden).

So, no, if we want the same story the elder Riddles are /not/ going to take in their daughter's bastard (as they see it). And Voldemort's mum is going to be a heartbroken new inmate who knows she's not going to be allowed to keep her baby - they made it quite clear to such women that they might be pregnant, but they weren't going to get to be mothers - giving birth with the benefit of 1920s midwifery in an institution that might or might not have the budget for a proper obstetrician in the event of complications. The NHS was 20 years away when Voldemort was born, after all.

Most guys would not turn away a pretty girl throwing herself at them, especially not with teenage hormones thrown into the mix. I mean, defending your friend sounds great, but I think most would forget about that if her rival stood naked in front of you and went for your pants. And "the naked man" sounds like something FemJames would pull since there would be little possible backlash (and no teenage boy would like to admit to turning away a shag, especially not when you grew up during the sexual revolution/liberation)

** I wonder if Harry would even get to the Hogwarts Express in year 1. Vernon (who runs the Dursley household) thinks it's funny to strand Harry there and therefore does it. However, if Petunia (Peter?) Evans were the Head of Household and had a huge personal anti-magic grudge, he might elect not to drive his daughter to King's Cross that day.

The Weasley family would have a vastly different dynamic--think of all of those women! I don't know if they would even be in the same circumstances. Would Arthur(a) even want to give birth that many times? Some key characters like Ron and Ginny wouldn't exist in that case. Would Molly (Manny?) prefer a low-wage job where he can pursue his passion? Or would he pick something else? (I am assuming that we retain the patriarchal ideas where mom = stay at home here)

*Not really "problems" but:*

I think Hermione would be perceived differently by the students--less "bossy buck-toothed know-it-all" and more "ugh, THAT guy" or maybe even "wow that guy sure is a whiz"

Draco's behavior would come across as a lot more "queen bee"/cliquey. I'm sure he'd select attractive students to be his goons rather than big, fat ones. So Crabbette and Goyley would be more dumb Slytherin outcasts than right-hand-women, and meanwhile Theo(dora) and Blaise(ley)(?) would be more important to the plot.

The reader might assume that witches can be more powerful in general (Voldemort, the DEs, the Marauders, Dumbledore, the Chosen One). (In canon the over-representation of powerful males isn't super noticeable since there are way more male characters in fiction in general).

Also, for some reason the phrase "the Fat Lord" really has me cracking up and picturing some 4chan denizen... Imagine the Fat Lord guarding Gryffindor's tower... with his neckbeard and cheeto dust. You may enter, m'lady.

Moaning Merton creeping on Harry taking a bath becomes 1000x creepier.

Yeah, you have Lily, Tonks (at least in OotP) and Hermione once she turns 17/18. Bellatrix makes a decent antagonist because she gets things done (unlike literally anyone else), but she isn't exactly a developed character either. Andromeda and Fleur have some potential but need a lot of work from the author to be more than just a trope.

Because it was not difficult. If the Ministry was an ironclad organization where corruption was answered with summary executions, or if he was the only one who pulled it off, it would be an outstanding and interesting feat.

His actions afterwards are simply stupid. Like, instead of leaving for Bali or Venice Beach, he continues to live as a fucking rat for some reason.

I enjoyed them in a normal way when I read them, thought they were alright but never got caught in the hype (I think because I caught onto the HP train too late and none of my friends were into it).

But given that my search was not very successful, I started to look for alternatives. And while most Harry/Hermione stories aren't stellar either, there were quite a few I enjoyed.

I find the universe Rowling created interesting. Her world building is vague enough to leave you a lot of creative freedom, unlike let's say GRRM.

And as anwesend above, I find a good chuck of the female background cast interesting. You have characters like Lavender Brown who fought and most likely died for the cause and yet are almost never on the side of the protagonist. I mean, if you look at my stories, it's basically always Harry centric, Hermione as best friend and then a bunch of background characters like the Tonks, Lavender, Fleur or Pansy (although that one was dictated by the plot I wanted to tell).

***** Male ones you have Harry (duh) and Ted Tonks due to the shit his marriage undoubtedly caused and the massive balls that stunt required. That's it.

Neville is the walking embodiment of "you just needed some confidence", Ron is utterly unrelatable to me since I am a single child (and has very dubious priorities in the last book; his "redemption" arc feels very forced), the Twins used children as test subjects without medical personnel nearby, Arthur has forgotten about the concept called "reading a book", Cedric did not reign his house in when they were ganging up on Harry (and he could have succeeded if he really tried).

The Death Eaters are magical Nazis who only succeed if their opposition is either utterly incompetent or sympathises with them. They are not interesting, the canon interpretation even makes rather poor antagonists. Malfoy is a spoiled brat who is all bark and no bite, Snape is boring because everything he does comes back to the woman he threw away and then not only destroyed the last bridge but nuked the whole area (figuratively) by joining the very ideology which caused the damage.

So who exactly is left? Fudge? Scrimgeour? Dean Thomas?

I mean, I don't mind flawed characters, but what the male characters offer aren't interesting flaws. Fan favourites like Snape, Lupin and the Malfoys are shite if you look under the surface and not exactly complex characters either. Snape would have had some potential if he really had a change of heart either after the worst memory or after Lily died - but he is simply obsessed with Lily and James, to a point where it stops being interesting and is plain boring instead.

******* It might be if Ron wasn't so whiney about it and the other brothers were actually decent. I mean, the twins seem to have caused more than one trauma, Percy showed absolutely no interest in his siblings due to different goals in life (until the 7th year at least) and the other two were significantly older and left the country, so I'm not sure how much interactions you would get out of that.

Don't get me wrong, I am a huge sucker for "protective older sibling". But I think a sister would be better suited for Harry because he has a serious lack of positive (older) female figures in his life while Sirius holds down the fort for men.

And lastly, due to the limitations of writing, the Weasleys are an absolutely horrible example for a family because you can at most focus on three or four characters unless you want to move the plot at a snail's pace. I mean, you have Harry (1), Molly and Arthur (2+3), the six/seven Weasley children (4-10/11) and their spouses, which brings us to a score of characters, and that's before you talk about their children. Even if you go with a CoS adoption, you have too many characters to do them all justice. The dialogue tags during dinner alone would be a nightmare.

The one way I see as interesting is Bill taking a bigger interest in Harry and breaking off contact with his family over their treatment of Fleur, but that would be far from "childhood with brothers" and more akin to "mentor couple".

******* Bear in mind, this is all my personal opinion:

You have characters which are interesting based on what is written in canon. Basically Harry and Hermione (at least based on the first five books and a few moments in DH).

Then you have those with interesting implications, like Lily, all three Tonks and (admittedly, I forgot about him earlier) Moody.

After that are the characters which have potential but need some work to be interesting, like Sirius, Fleur and Ginny, who sadly often are fairly one-dimensional.

Bellatrix is a decent antagonist, even if she is one-dimensional because she is dangerous. You can give her an interesting background and make her more tragic (eg maintained a good relationship with Andromeda, slow descent into madness, stuff like that). But in order to be truly interesting, you need her to turn traitor on Voldemort before the DoM battle (after that there is too much water under the bridge). And even then she would be an anti-hero at best.

Then there is a bunch of interesting "what if they got more screen time" characters. That bunch includes Parvati and Lavender, Justin FF (rich Muggleborn as a contrast to Malfoy) and Viktor Krum.

Luna is the odd one in the mix because she works well as a background character but doesn't really work as a protagonist because, in order for her to make sense and be relatable, you need to destroy some of her "Lunaness".

******** I just son't get how you can say Harry's one of the interesting characters. Harry is Generic YA Fantasy Protagonist #54, complete with special destiny. The only marginally interesting thing about him is that he has the reputation of being a lot more formidable than he really is. ^{_^{*}}

********* Because Harry is very relatable. Unlike, let's say generic soldier 23, he is no macho who kicks arse and chews bubblegum (which can be entertaining, even if not relatable). He is not Barney Stinson or Jon Snow, but he does not need to be.

Harry fucks up in believable ways, his flaws are authentic (even if canon downplays the effects of child abuse) and while generic, he feels like a real person who is completely overwhelmed at times.

It's the same reason why Ron from Kim Possible is such a great side character. He might be generic, but he is authentic.

********** Except Ron from Kim Possible isn't a generic kid hero. He's the loveably eccentric fuck-up who can't get anything right but who comes through in the end. He has a PERSONALITY.

Harry... ALMOST has a personality. But comparted to pretty much every other character in the series he's incredibly bland. I'm pretty sure JKR did this on purpose so it'd be easier for the readers to identify with him... but it doesn't make him INTERESTING.

** That the british magical society was basically a Matriarchy. If you genderbend everyone, no exceptions, but leave the world mostly as is, then Britain is primarily ruled and guided by women. Lucia Malfoy, Agatha Dumbledore, Cornelia Fudge,...

I wrote this trope out once and came to the conclusion that to keep the universe mostly aligned, you have to make wizarding culture a matriarchal society. Women take their names over into marriage, they are the "strong ones", they are the leaders and breadwinners. Otherwise, you start with making Lucia Malfoy into Lucia Black and stop at wondering how to explain that the Hogwarts Houses are still named the same.

I stopped because I realized what a massive box I opened there.

*** It wouldn't have to be though. It could be that the male-female lifespan difference gets multiplied up, so that things are actually pretty evenly distributed below top ranks.

** Well, I'd say last names, simply because Canon follows a more patriarchal system than not, but that doesn't add /too/ many problems that can't be fixed with an authorial hand wave. But other than that? Well, the Death Eaters would mostly be made up of women, sans Voldemort's "boy-toy", which might have some less-than-savoury implications. But then again, with most of the positions of power already filled with women, maybe it not be /too/ big of a deal...

But personally, the biggest problem for me when reading a fic like this would be memorising /all/ the names. Who's who, how are these people similar to their canon selves, how are they different, et cetera. It took literal years for me to get to the point where I know who Miriam Strout and Frank Bryce are off the top of my head; I'd go mad trying to figure out and remember their genderbent counterparts.

Not to mention that as an author coming up with the names would be hell in and of itself.

** I don't subscribe to the idea that people who are attracted to someone would be equally attracted to their genderbent equivalent, even if they themselves had been genderbent. Growing up as a boy instead of a girl introduces more than enough variables to have entirely different romantic parameters.

So basically none of the characters we know would exist in that world, because people would started to marry entirely different people, since whenever that genderbending thing started to happen.

** It wouldn't be Harry Potter anymore. It would be Harry Evans.

Unless there was a made up rule that since Leo Evans was a muggleborn, he would have to take up the Pureblood surname of Jamie Potter.

There wouldn't be any Dursleys either. I can't see Violet Dursley doing something untraditional as making her husband take up her surname, unless Peter Evans really hated his family and was willing to do something abnormal to cut ties with them.

As to the Black sisters becoming the Black brothers, maybe the surname issue could be fixed by having male!Bellatrix and male!Narcissa getting betrothed to fem!Lestrange and fem!Malfoy but the families agreed that since male!Andromeda was the eldest and he would get to keep the Black name, then the two younger brothers would take up the name of the families they were marrying into. Somehow the younger two got married first, and then male!Andromeda didn't show up at his wedding, instead eloping with Theodora Tonks and taking up her surname to spite his family.
