The Aurors...holy hell

This should be mandatory reading for this sub.

Linkffn(The Aurors)

P.s [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] you are ruining my life. How can I even go on after Chapter 10

Anyway, what's everyone else reading?


** Hah! You've made my day. Honestly the story is intended more as a suspense than a mystery :)

Edit: aww you guys are the best :)

*** I, too, just read The Aurors the other day. Great fic, couldn't stop, spent half the night squinting at my phone.

Gotta say though, also read that Dursley wedding fic... man, I laughed out loud. Had to share it with a friend and we kept quoting Ginny to each other. Too funny.

** To be fair, The Aurors is not a particularly good detective story - it's real strength is in the characters interactions. Same things with Strangers at Drakeshaugh.

I think, I had the killer pinged the second he first appeared in the story.

** I hate to say it but I gave up as soon as I knew who the villian was. It's just to much of a stretch for my head canon to see them as a villian.

Should I just suck it up and finish it or will it completely ruin my head canon?

*** That's completely fair and I knew it would be a gamble - if you would rather imagine him as he is in canon I say read something else :) I know how annoying it is when you have a vision for a character and someone writes them wrong!

*** I think it's explained rather well but can't say if it will run your head canon or not. I tend to not take away AU characters into my head canons but understand that's not for everyone. I'd err on the side of caution

*** I tried to read HPMoR but I don't think I quite grasped what's supposed to be so funny - or is it supposed to be funny, even? I read a few chapters but either it's SO not my humour or I am hopelessly stupid, because I found it very dull.

Can you give me the elevator pitch? üòÅ

Some of us are depressed enough, thanks. I come here looking for stories I enjoy, not ones to upset me.
