I was browsing through the GoT archive on AO3 and I found myself shocked at how many fics featured this um unique pairing. I know why a gay pairing involving Harry is popular but why Drogo? I would assume that the AO3 fandom pair him more with characters that fit the fangirlly-gay fetishy stereotype like Draco (i.e. white, pale, and tortured). Anyway I was just curious if there was some reason why so many of the most bookmarked fics for GoT on AO3 feature this ship.


** Because most of this stuff is written by preadolescence girls who do not understand that homosexaul rape is not romantic.

** Because just like Snape and Malfoy, the series did a good job of making him way more likable than he should be. And even in the books Dany develops something akin to Stockholm syndrome. Most people see that Dany grows to like him, so he must be a good guy. Also, he is rather good looking, so queue the shipping.

Kinda like Malfoy to be honest. If Harry called Malfoy traitorous scum, terrorists, war criminal or claimed that it was karma for Katie and left him to die in the Fiendfyre, he would be a lot less popular than after being rescued by the protagonist and therefore getting approved by him

Also, most readers don't seem to care about misdeeds as long as they don't impact the protagonists.

** I haven't seen one, actually. Might be more to do with how and where you search, frankly.

Browsing in FF.net with "+40k words, english, sorting by number of favorites" and I haven't seen one in the first few pages.
