** I'm a new writer who really wants to get better at procrasination so I hope you don't mind if I just go for it. I know I'm not very good lol

"James was like a brother to me, Harry. Quadditch nuts, the both of us."

Harry looked over in confusion. Sirius' eyes glazed over his parents' gravestone to the memorial left nearby.

"Prongs used to say that the greatest gift he could have was for me to piss on his grave." Sirius wiped the tear on the edge of his eye. "Can you imagine that, Harry. The ministry letting out a dangerous criminal in order to let them piss on a man's grave."

Harry drank up the information about his dad. He kept learning more about how barmy his father was. He wanted someone to piss at his grave, but he also wanted to become an auror? What type of person was this?

"Piss on me."

"What? Who's there!"

"Harry, you alright?"

Lined up with Harry's torso was the ghost of a thin man in wire glasses. The ghost's hair stuck up in the back, seemingly movin with the wind and /oh/ that was his father.

"You're," Harry gulped.

"Your daddy, very good, Harry."

"Why do you want me to pee on you, dad?"

"Dad?" Sirius confused tone became high-pitched. "Prongs?" His hands right through James' body, eyes unseeing. He looked at Harry. "You can see him?"

"Of course, Padfoot. I'm right here." Harry's dad proceed to stick his fingers up Sirius' nose. Sirius sneezed.

"Harry, I've been here the whole time, nobody able to see me, because the killer never left their /interfectorem signum est scriptor/ - killer's mark. So I need you to pee on me because you have part of Voldemort's magic in you."

Sirius transformed into Padfoot and proceeded to climb up Harry's shoulders. Padfoot's eyes begged for an explanation.

"He wants me to pee on him." Padfoot's twisted right, eyes boring into Harry's. "He's stuck here until the killer leaves his mark on him."

Padfoot started pawing at Harry's shoulder. And, wow, those claws were sharp.

"This is barmy." James looked up from his spot on the ground, begging. So Harry pulled his trousers down, anticipating to simply pee on the ground. But James had opened his mouth like he was impersonating the toliet bowl. And wasn't that distrubing, he didn't really want Harry to really pee in his mouth, did he?

As Harry peed, James' smile grew and his ghost faded more and more. "Oh, thank you Harry. I can't wait to see your mother and tell her all about how proud I am of you. We'll meet again, Harry."

A moment later, James Potter disappeared. Then, a female voice, "JAMES FLEAMONT POTTER!"
