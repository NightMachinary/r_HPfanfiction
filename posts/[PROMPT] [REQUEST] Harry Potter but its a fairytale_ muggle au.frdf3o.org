Preferably slash (:

I've read some really good muggle au's (like (I think it was called) blurring realities which was super good and I would appreciate if anyone could find a fic with a similar tone) and some recs would be great.

I think the type of thing I'm looking for is not magic with a sense of magic?? Idk

*** Sorry, that was a bit vague wasn't it.ðŸ˜…

So basically in the fic I'm refrencing, Hogwarts is a dance school. The school preforms a show which is based upon Harry's adventures and the actors all find themselves falling into the roles of who they're acting (eg// Harry plays himself (in the actual show he's only called The Hero) and finds himself resonating with the character he's playing and feeling the emotions, grief etc and feeling like he's rembering something about his Canon life but he doesn't get it.)

So like not like Hogwarts is a wizarding school and there is no wizarding world, but the fic still carries a sense of magic and power and odd things happening.

I'm sorry, this still doesn't make sense, does it... I'm not even sure what I'm talking about, it's more of a feeling that the fic carries rather than a plot technicality

***** Perhaps an example of OP's idea might be movies like /Secondhand Lions/ or /Brother Where Art Thou/ in which real-world events are portrayed in a fantastical, almost mythical way.

It's even a genre of litterature: [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism][magical realism]]

****** ZxcvJSKAK there's a name for it! I love the idea of this concept and I didn't know that it existed as a subgenre. Thanks!
