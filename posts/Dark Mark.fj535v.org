:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm actually looking for recs and a certain story.

For the Recommendations, any story were Harry gets the dark mark (or something like it), preferably him joining the Dark Lord. He can join willingly or be blackmail. Open to slash stories.

As for a certain fic, I believe the Dark Lord is holding Harry against his will, and the death eater that is watching him grabs him or something and Harry touches the Mark and finds out he can effect it. I think he almost gets away but Voldemort shows up and stops him. I really like the idea of him being able to effect the mark, so if you don't know this story but know one similar please post it. Thanks.


** The scene you described sounds similar to scenes in the following two fics:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/832559/][Keep Your Enemies Closer]] - Harry discovers that he can affect the Dark Marks in chapter 5, and it becomes plot relevant on multiple occasions later on. linkao3(832559)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/][Blood Crest]] - Harry discovers that he can activate Dark Marks in the latest chapter. linkao3(22022296)

As for fics in which Harry himself is branded, here are two in which he eventually gets Marked after accidentally traveling back in time to the 1970s:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10413771/][Turning of the Times]] linkao3(10413771)

  Voldemort conquers wizarding Britain and discovers his human horcrux. Harry is allowed to live under the new regime. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with vengeful classmates, a strange connection to Dark Marks, and worst of all, Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia. Story is mostly gen, though praised for its gradual platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.One reviewer says of KYEC: I just found this story a couple of days ago, and I'm thoroughly gripped by it. I could barely stop reading in between chapters, but had to, of course, since your tale is already so deliciously long. The plot is thrilling and well thought-out, and your characterisations are spot-on.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

  Then Harry's mouth went completely dry.  His captor struck a tall, imposing figure, black locks neatly framing his aristocratic cheekbones. The relaxed line of his mouth did nothing to soften the furious, slightly maniacal glint in his cool gray eyes, fixed unwaveringly upon him. “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.” *Harry and Teddy accidentally time travel to 1979, where they are immediately captured by Voldemort at his prime. After months of posing as a loyal Death Eater to protect Teddy, Harry is then captured by the Order. Misunderstandings ensue.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.

** linkffn(time to spare by emysabath). Harry travels back in time and decides to become a spy because Snape won't turn sides for a couple of years yet but a spy was clearly needed much earlier. Gen, very interesting, complete.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7040089/chapters/16011331][Consuming Shadows]] has Harry getting marked by the dark lord, but it's not the dark mark. Lily Potter is also alive and Harry goes to Beauxbatons. It was recommend recently as a Harry-goes-to-other-schools fic, is why I'm reading it. It's currently up to chapter 45, I believe, and is getting updated roughly monthly. Edit: Harry is blackmailed into getting the mark around the 41st chapter. The end pairing is Harry/Voldemort but so far they hate each other.
