If I write a story where Harry becomes immortal, would it bother people due to his actual physical age, meaning he will look about eleven?


** Nope. I am a man who enjoys Anime. Immortal children is all the rage there.

**** Ah, okay. Cool, then yeah, I'm with Alouda and Wassa on this one. People'll probably be at least irritated if you give him any romance stuff (though some may read it anyway, if Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is any indication), but they'll probably be okay with an immortal always-child otherwise.

***** One of the main reasons I'm keeping him that young is so that I can avoid romance all together.

****** Good, then I honestly don't know why anyone would mind. Quick question though, is it just romance that will be out for him or will he actually stay at the maturity level of a 11 years-old?

******* It's only physically he'll stay eleven, his mind will age.

** Yes, if you give him any form or romantic relationship. Also aging potion exist so you have to either establish that it doesn't or ehy it wouldn't work.

*** They're temporary and probably too expensive/inconvenient to take them 24/7

** As long as he doesn't get into a relationship with any children when he's not one himself. If he's still the same age as them just unkillable that's fine.
