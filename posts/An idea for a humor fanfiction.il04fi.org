#+begin_quote
  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

** Right. At first he was having problems with depression and remembering this horrible event from his past, but once Tommy was good enough to take care of that little bit of soul stuck in his head, the others were all quite taken with him. They'd never met someone with two souls before. As a result, after eating the one, they had no interest in the second. They had eaten a soul, no one had two, so he couldn't have another --- they must be mistaken! Because he was still around after having his soul eaten, they started talking to him, and it just sort of snowballed from there until they were playing volleyball by the lake in bikinis while he refereed!

No one had every checked to see if they were male or female, so Harry was just as surprised as the Professors.
