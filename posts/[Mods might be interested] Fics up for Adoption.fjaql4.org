So, I had a thought that the mods might be interested in and wanted to get some other perspectives too - what if we had a monthly thing where we posted any fics for adoption (and attempted to follow up on abandoned fics) to look into the possibility of others picking them up, but with the original author's interest/permission/input? Sort of like the Beta-bartering thread on the Fanfiction reddit, only for abandoned or up-for-adoption Harry Potter fics instead.

EDIT - since I'd basically just be saying identical answers to every comment, I thought I'd add some further thoughts here to clarify what kind of thing I'm pondering.

While there's no legal ownership of fanfiction or actual viable restrictions on or punishment for adopting a fic without permission or taking others ideas, it's kind of a dick move. So, I'd suggest making authorial-input (either directly by posting/commenting or indirectly by mention on profile pages/fic summaries) a requirement.

I'd also try avoid sort of... flooding of comments asking abandoned or hiatusing fics to put them up for adoption. This fandom can be quite... passionate at times and I'd imagine two hundred comments on your fic that you've been trying to update for three months demanding you put it up for adoption would be rather intimidating to even the most self-possessed extrovert of writers. It's why I'd say keep it to a month or so only rather than weekly. Any more than that might lead to some shenanigans to keep up the numbers.

Other'n that, I'd leave it to the mods and others to develop ideas. I don't really wanna make more work for the mods, since they have 'lives' and 'jobs' and 'families' to spend their time on, but I'm sure there's some negotiation or adjustment we can make to the idea to make it easier for the mods.


** Oh that's actually really cool! I know a ton of harry potter fics end up abandoned. So it'd be especially good for this fandom.

** linkffn(13355457) has the interesting premise of Voldemort securing Harry's loyalty by bringing James and Lily Potter back to life and I was disheartened when the fic was abandoned.

  A boy who grew up in a cupboard used to dream that his parents would save him from his miserable life at Privet Drive. But when a man with two faces offered him the chance of a lifetime, he realized that maybe, just maybe, he could actually save his parents, instead. All he had to do was give Quirrell the stone... (Sorcerer's Stone AU. Begins during Prisoner of Azkaban)

*** Atlasnerd here. I am a terrible person who hasn't given up on the story, but I'm definitely riding the writer's block train.

Honestly, I would be 100% fine with someone taking the story and running with it, as long as they credit my portion of it. I'll even share the insane amount of outlining I did. I just maintain the right to continue it on my own profile, if I can ever actually force myself to finish it.

Also, thank you for mentioning me!

***** Hey, no worries! I went from updating it biweekly to suddenly falling off the face of the earth for eight months, that wasn't an unreasonable assumption.
