*** There as a fairly good fic I was reading a few months ago that was entirely ruined by this. At least every other chapter was "I don't know why he looked at me that way so I'm going to cry instead of talk about it" or "she looked at me when I did this thing I'm insecure about, better not talk to her for a week. That will show her!" Amazingly enough I forced myself to finish it, but by the end I had unbookmarked everything I'd saved for future reading from that author to avoid another nightmare.

** I hate hate hate potioned Harry and Hermione. It's like, a girl - in this case Hermione - isn't good enough for Harry unless she's loved him for ever and never loved anyone else. She must always worship the ground he walks on and kowtow to him. And she is /of course/ a virgin, even if he's banged all the chicks.

I don't hate Harry/Hermione like a lot of people in this subreddit seem to. I can deal with ooc characters and Mary Sue (to an extent) Hermione. But give them some personality outside the relationship and let them be stupid teenagers. Let them make mistakes with love and be cruel to each other. Just give them some bloody agency.

*** What you have to understand is that, from a psychological standpoint, that is a typical male fantasy scenario. Fanfiction is written primarily as fantasy/wish fulfillment. When you see fics like that, I will place money that 99% of the time it is a male, and most of the people who Favorited it are males as well.

Fanfiction does not necessarily have to reflect reality. I personally read fanfiction as a bit of an escape, and prefer works that cater to my tastes (not saying that these do, but just in general).

Also, the vast majority of males will tell you that, while they recognize it as a reality, they try never to think of the fact that the girl they love has physically been with another. Reactions differ from male to male, but it is rarely a comfortable subject for us males to dwell on, for a variety of reasons. So why would I want to read about that with characters I have developed an emotional attachment to (if the author is good), when I am trying to read for pleasure.

Note: I do not speak for every male out there. My views are my own. Just thought I would try and give a different viewpoint.

** Oh man, this takes me back; undoing romance tropes was the goal of my first ever fic. I love old romcom movies, I love the predictability of the genre, but when it comes to /reading/ romance, I can't stand it.

This isn't even necessarily a relationship trope: I hate those conflicts where someone does something obviously wrong and has to make it up to the other person -- you know, that big glaring sign that says this character is being a bad friend/partner/whatever and poor main character who has to deal with them. More often than not, interpersonal problems come from both sides, and I wish that grey area was explored more.

Also I wish it was more accepted that one can write a relationship without necessarily condoning it. Relationships are complicated and they don't have to be perfectly happy or healthy to be meaningful.

ALSO -- I could go on and on -- the worst offense that I nearly forgot: melting ice queens and fixing bad boys. Love isn't a swiss army knife that fixes everything.

******* Right. I guess because I read several other fandoms and it's a trope that's used way too much and it has actually leeched into real life (atleast if my social media accounts are atleast half honest).

To say it a different way, in fiction, suspension of reality is a thing and it needs to be, but at the same time it can get excessive. I know that as a result, my primary fan fictions that I'm reading from have changed.

So much this. What little conflict romance fanfic does include tends to be trivial and easily resolved (generally miscommunication errors that can be settled just by talking it through).

There's a lot more to relationship conflict than big Drama like jealousy plots. I want to see a romance fic where both partners have characteristics/habits that their partner genuinely dislikes/finds annoying, and the couple works through this, either breaking up over it or learning to tolerate it because the good outweighs the bad.

And since I mentioned breaking up: this needs to happen a lot more. Fanfic romances are far too successful in general. Harry should be going through a succession of unsuccessful romances before his "OTP" (and even the OTP should end up in break up if they're still at Hogwarts).

****** Adding break-up after break-up won't do a thing but turn your romance into a soap opera where readers don't take any relationship seriously because it might be gone overnight. That may be realistic for teenage romances, but it doesn't lead to a good Romance.

Focusing on how people adjust to tolerating their partner's habit to use the toothpaste tube in the wrong way also doesn't really make for good romances.

What you are describing is like the shopping trip of Harry Potter stories or a training chapter or three - realistic, for a certain meaning of realism, but killing the pace and plot if overdone. It's the kind of stuff that gets mentioned, maybe, once, and then is solved.

If you want to write a romance, you need to write a Romance, not a documentary of relationships. You want emotions, struggling, drama, not petty stuff. Jealous rivals, meddling parents, family honor, duty, social pressure, even fate itself are difficulties to be overcome in Romances, not slightly annoying personal habits, apart from those kind of "habits" that actually are a major thing, like infidelity, or fear of commitment.

******* Drama is a perfectly legitimate genre, and a hell of a lot better than capital-R "Romance". I'd take Hogwarts: The OC over Hogwarts: Mills&Boon any day. Though The OC still commits the cardinal sin of "all relationship problems are miscommunication errors".

Coming of age is a major theme in HP. Having failed relationships is a common, maybe even essential, part of that.

And of course it doesn't need to be as trivial as your ridiculous toothpaste example. There are plenty of substantial issues of incompatibility that can either break relationships or be worked through by a couple determined to make it. Examples include sexual incompatibility, differences in political views, competitiveness, being a sore loser, attachment to traditional gender roles, etc.

Having the only threat to a romance be external threat is bad writing. Interesting romance is about the dynamic between the two partners, and a three dimensional dynamic is better than a 2D one. Three dimensional characters feel real, which means having likes and dislikes... no two people are perfectly compatible, and to write a romance in that way reduces the depth of the dynamic between the partners.

If there have to be breakups a gogo, there should at least be some overarching romantic plot. Harry going through a couple teenage relationships until he settles down in his 20s with another girl is not a romance. It's like if there was no Voldemort, and Harry simply went through different enemies of the years, without anything to tie them together into an overarching plot.

Harry and (insert girl) going through relationships with others until they finally realize they have found what they have been looking for with each other is a romance. You at least need to have both characters around for the majority of the story, and have the focus on them.

** Fics where the only way you can justify your pairing is by demonising literally every other person who could be with them. I'm never going to by Dramione canoninically but if you're changing Draco's character to make it possible then there's no reason for Harry/Ron/The Order to have an issue with it after the initial distrust. Alternatively if he hasn't changed that much then Hermione shouldn't be with him because he's racist. Equally applicable to Harmony fics. No they don't need to be potioned to be together, it's okay that Ron exists and isn't a rapist.

Any fic where statutory rape occurs and it's played off as cute. Bonus points if it's between Hermione and a Death Eater. Double bonus points if the only reason they're together is that this Death Eater (either Snape or Malfoy usually) is that they've saved her from the rape camps after Voldemort wins.

MPreg. I wish I could link the conversation I had on an old account about this. No it isn't possible. No I don't care that magic exists. It's just fucking stupid. Particularly when *you shit the baby out*. No hermaphrodite magic, no c-section, no of course Harry is going to shit out his and Draco's biologically impossible, twisted, evil little spawn. This is also apparently romantic.

Slash where you either do one of two things; have everyone be gay or have noone be gay. I don't have any issue with gay people but slash fiction is never going to be my thing because...well i'm straight for one and don't enjoy reading gay sex scenes...but mainly because I just don't buy that many gay people in the world and I /hate/ the idea that you'll end up with the one other person in your demographic by default.

Really any fic where rape is used as a plot device, mainly because i'm convinced no one who has been raped would write about it romantically and therefore the rape is just painful to read about.

In Harmony fics where Harry just spends 90% of his day in the library and this somehow solves all his problems. Also (and I just know i'm going to get shit for this) fics where Harry quits Quidditch for his girl because 'he just likes to fly'. No. No. No. Harry likes Quidditch. I don't care that you don't like sport. I don't care that you think people who play sport are horrible and bully people. That's not true, and Harry likes Quidditch. It's so annoying.

Pregnancy outside of that fic I recommended here a few days ago. Never done well. Not romantic unless you're married. No being married at 15 doesn't count.

Fics where anyone is banging in first year. I remember a fic where Ginny and Harry are soul bounded and she has to blow him every night to 'strengthen the bond'. It's disgusting and it's not romantic, it's paedophilic.

Snape is a bitter, old man in love with a dead woman. He will never be in a functional relationship. Also I don't think his feelings for Lily are cute. They're a little sad.

I'd love people to use original side characters. Like I get wanting to use Daphne because you want a generic Slytherin to write about and want something different. But I wish /someone/ would use Pansy or Millicent or Many Brocklehurst. Oh also 'Ice Queen'.

Any mention of a child being incredibly talented at sex. Particularly when the author is actually clueless about sex. My favourite one is in The Harem War where Harry is a metamorphmagus and grows his tongue to lick his many, many, many wives /cervix/. I...just...no...no. no.

Harem fics. I just don't get it. They're pointless outside wanting to write about threesomes/moresomes. Those relationships would never work IRL and every charcter is basically the same.

**** I'm not ascribing a positive or negative to it, but stubbornness is a Hermione characteristic. See the firebolt thing in POA even when the boys turned against her.

And that's in the case of even if. So many romance fics also depower everyone else to make designated male love interest look better. That's more okay if its someone like Ginny or a girl we don't see in canon who we don't know how powerful she is. Someone like Hermione though, or the well-trained, adult Tonks or Bellatrix, and it doesn't ring true for Harry to become super-powerful and great just because.

I guess in general I don't like too OOC behaviour because then it becomes a fic about the author's characters, set in JK's world. Its much less immersive and to me, more like I'm reading a story that's pretending to be Harry Potter in order to draw you in than an actual fanfic.

2: Any Romione fanfic where they aren't in character. As a big Romione shipper, I'm extremely picky about that.

3:What's the point of soul bond fics? If 2 or more characters are automatically guaranteed to be together till the end of days because of some ritual, then that wipes away any suspense or curiosity in how the romance will go. Same with marriage law fics.

4: When the characters involved in the pairing are utterly perfect. Not really any secret on what type of fics those generally happen in.

5: Anything involving pairing minor characters with main characters. If you don't know the character well enough to pair them off, that's basically the equivalent of a self insert. In fact, it's the exact definition.

6: Time travel fics that undo all the bad stuff. Evar have those times when someone tells a genius joke then proceeds to dedicate the rest of their existence to turning the joke into a dry piece of mouldy bread on the floor by repeating it every 15 seconds? That's time travel fics to me. An idea that was good once or twice, but should really just stop by now.

7: Nice Draco. I think everyone universally hates this.

8: When someone doesn't know a female's personality very well, so to compensate for that, said female turns into a generic sassy, laid-back and upbeat character that we already have too much of. Anyone who's evar read a Harmony fic in their life time knows what I'm talking about.

** Particular annoyances / insta-quit:

1.  Neville Longbottom / Hermione Granger / Ron Weasley / Severus Snape are suddenly gay. They aren't, not even by a long shot. You might make a weak case for Harry and Draco, but those four? Seriously? Just put your own characters there.
2.  Harems. Stop. Just... stop.
3.  Romance solves everything. This is especially painful for HHr. If the solution is that simple, then the problem is idiotic, and your story is garbage.
4.  Lucius Malfoy cheats on his wife and that is somehow romantic. You take the one redeeming feature of an otherwise one dimensional loathsome caricature of why rich people are evil, and remove it. You made a character that had a dimension and a half and removed the half; he is just some rich douchebag now.
5.  Snape is immediately softened up and becomes a nice guy because he just needed to get laid. If this happens in a story, then the author missed the point of Snape. He'll never be the traditional nice and romantic guy, so stop trying to make it happen.
6.  Harry is a sex god at fourteen. Actually, fourteen year olds. They have nothing to do with romance; at fourteen teens have the emotional range of a brick.
7.  Soul mates / soul bonds / soul sucking lack of creativity. If I'd want Disney crap, I'd probably be reading Once Upon a Time fan fiction.
8.  Dom/sub relationships. They aren't all bad, but I've read about two that didn't make me cringe. The basis of that kind of relationship is a deep trust that in many ways can be stronger than traditional love. It requires a lot of care in crafting, and most romance stories (/cough/50 Shades of Crap/cough/) mess that up.
9.  Rape is now somehow OK. It isn't, and if you think it is, fuck you.
10. Half the tension is misunderstandings causing ridiculous conflicts. No, there are serious issues that need to be addressed for a relationship to work, pretending like misunderstandings are a legitimate plot device just shows how stupid the characters are.
11. Everyone is stupid. This happens far too much in the romance genre. While in adventure stuff it is usually evil is stupid, in romance it somehow transcends that and becomes universal.

Other things I've learned to somehow live with:

1. Character bashing. I understand you want to get Ginny out of the picture so Harry can hook up with Hermione/Cho/Daphne/etc. There are other ways to explain this that don't require this lazy form of rubbish. Sometimes relationships just don't work out; most don't. It shouldn't be hard to write.
2. Everyone has the exact same sexual orientation. Either everyone is straight, or everyone is gay. Maybe a token relationship that isn't? Like... add /some/ depth to the world. It's not like there is a lack of candidates.
3. Teacher/Student relationships. Oh, how it hurts me to admit that I can actually sometimes read this now. I mean, Snape is one of my favorite characters because he is deeply flawed in many ways, /but he would never/. Don't even get me started on Remus. Or (/shudder/) Minerva.
4. Big deals out of virginity/homosexuality/whatever. I'd think wizards would be well more open on a sexual level than muggles; contraception is what led to humanity changing there, and that seems like something wizards must have figured out centuries prior.
5. Voldemort pairings. This used to be insta-quit territory, because seriously, Voldemort? But it actually works surprisingly well in some (ok, few) funny stories.
6. Melodramatic over-the-top bullshit. Falling in love might be over the top, but loving is painfully mundane 99% of the time. Still, I suppose it isn't insta-quit.

I could probably keep going for more, but really, those just needed to be said.

** The One Night of Passion They Must Never Speak About.

I actually like all the chaste romance tropes that are mostly unpopular here---that's kind of why I'm reading about kids from a series of children's novels set in a pseudo-Victorian United Kingdom, to be honest---but a weird hanger-on to those tropes is that at one point (if it's Harry and Hermione it's in the tent, but I'm sure there are dead-horse moments like this for every ship) they ~lost themselves~ and had sex and they've never spoken about it or kissed anybody since.

If you want to write a romance story where they have a lot of sex, go for it, and if you want to write a romance story where there is no sex at all, go for that. But every time I get two chapters into a story and the narrator suddenly thinks "They hadn't been so close since... that night...", I throw my hands up and start over.

I'm also not a fan of the idea that characters should necessarily "behave like teenagers", as though for all teenagers in all cultures in human history this has meant "have sex with multiple people." (i.e., it is certainly true that our great-grandparents frequently had sex before they were married, but it is /not/ true that this means they were basically Just Like Us. If you read more about life prior to the sexual revolution, and before that prior to the idea of age-segregated and private spaces, it's clear that some people did, some people didn't, most who did were with their eventual spouses, and for the children of 'respectable' people it was frequently an enormously weighty and frightening decision to make.)

I think it's not at all a stretch that people would behave differently than we do in an inherently provincial society---driven much more by tradition than shifting consumer tastes---that seems to value early marriage. (Of course this is complicated by the steady influx of Muggle culture, but in spite of that Muggle culture appears to have relatively little influence in the visible parts of wizarding culture.)

** Soulmates, Soulbonds (and anything like that, including stuff like the "imprinting" from Twilight) as it sounds like damned slavery to me (you don't have a choice but to accept who your soulmate ist...sorry, I rather have a rocky relationship which involves working for it (but not rolling over for your partner/becoming wiped just to keep it together) than that...it's disgusting that people like this (like "love at first sight" -.-))...I love stories which develop friendships further (like Harry and Hermione figuring out they'd be good for each other, while maturing a little (her being a little less bossy, less accepting of authority just because it's authority, less accepting of stuff in books as absolute truth and agreeing that she's not always right and him standing up for himself more, applying himself more (at school for example) etc. etc.))...it's something I really like (incidentally: I don't believe in the "friend zone" -.-)

** Teenagers being into S&M. If a fic is a very AU, purely lemon oneshot, fine, crank the suspension of disbelief up to 100, but otherwise no.

*** Sexual fetishes don't wait until you are an adult to develop. If you honestly think that no teenagers like bondage, then you're utterly wrong.

**** Yeah maybe but for both having their first sexual experience I'd expect things to be quite vanilla. Unless someone is leading the experience down that path, I'd expect it'd take a while for their trust to reach the 'share my kink' stage.

Of course with soul bonds and mind reading this sort of thing can be short-circuited, but I get really annoyed when Harry's first time includes flipping [girl of the author's yen] over and aiming for the back door, and kink-wise that's not very far out at all.

***** Oh, definitely. I don't expect any teenager to start their first time with S&M and similar stuff.
