***** It's essentially a crack fic, but it's not fun enough to be good crack.

It has entertaining moments and some fun ideas, but the parts in between are repetitive and looooong-winded.

***** Yes lots and lots of extraneous exposition which, while interesting, really didn't do much for the story. I just read it, and wanted my four days of life back.

**** I know I didn't finish, and I think I only made it to about a quarter of the way through before I noped out. No fond memories.
