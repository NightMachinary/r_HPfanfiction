In which Harry created a Horcrux. Did his fear of Dementors drive him to hide part of his soul elsewhere? Did he want insurance against the Death Eaters killing him? Was he hell-bent on killing Voldemort or Bellatrix at any cost?\\
Whatever the cause, he made the Sword of Gryffindor into a Horcrux (where'd he even learn how?), but at some point before the final battle, his grief and remorse at taking a life ended up undoing it again. How does this affect his final encounter with Voldemort?


** I was honestly thinking you where hinting at that Gryffindor had created a horcrux and had taken over Harrys body.

**** During the duel against malfoy in chamber of secrets

harry gets sent to detention for drawing a sword.

when asked why he tried to attack malfoy with a sword he responded, that snape fellow said I could disarm malfoy, so I figure why not give it the old gryfindor try.

*** Alright, that's also a cool idea. When Harry starts performing awesome feats of skill and daring whilst on the Horcrux Hunt, but can't remember them, he wonders if he's somehow being possessed like Ginny was in his 2nd year...but Voldemort has no reason to help him, so if it's not him, who...?

** Alright but if you think about it the Sword of Gryffindor is THE perfect Horcux because it literally eats things that would harm it and makes itself stronger with then, like it absorbed the basilisk venom. If you play your cards right you can literally have an indestructible Horcux.

*** Mm-hmm, which is why Harry would have used it, of course. Indestructible unless he happens to feel remorse.
