I love the Weasley's, they are my favorite Wizarding family. I'm looking for some good characterizations of Charlie and Bill since they weren't used that much in the series.

I'm also of course looking for good characterizations in general for the Weasley family.

Any rating is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is okay


** They are not the main focus in any of these but they all have good characterizations of the Weasley family.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
