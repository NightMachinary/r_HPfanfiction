The Umbridge thread made me see that I haven't quite read about her in that way. She has the potential to be the greatest villain if she wasn't an adult in a children's book series.

Any fics where she's truly the evil mastermind she could be? (As long as it's finished or updating regularly, please?)


** Fun fact: HP wasn't intended to be a children's book. It just ended up being one.
