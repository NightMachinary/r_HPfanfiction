** I have gotten a lot more picky today, as I hate:

- Canon rehash, especially in time travels
- Ice Queen of Slytherin
- WBWL
- Potter and Weasley bashing
- Voldemort and Death Eater apologies
- Damsel in Distress Hermione
- Hermione agreeing to marriage law
- Leather pants Draco
- Manufactured drama and angst
- “Good guys don't kill” trope

However I don't mind WBWL as much as there are some decent ones out there, and I do think if well done it has potential.

***** Agreed, most of them are quite bad. However there are a few good ones, most notably DPSW like you said but also Antithesis.

I really like how Antithesis has came along. The last 15 chapters or so have been on point, I'd say that fic has done a rather excellent job of using the trope.

*** What exactly is canon rehash? Just the exact same events happening but Harry does things differently or better? Or are you tired of the 1st-7th year structure as a whole?

**** Canon rehash occurs when an author changes various characters actions, but keeps the plot points the same.

Now to be fair, some events aren't impacted by, for example, Harry.

Assuming Harry didn't go to Hogwarts/is in a different house/is blind/is paralyzed/has been transfigured permanently into a rather large cockatiel:

Year 1 - Stone still in Hogwarts, Voldemort still tries to jack it. Maybe he succeeds - this is a point the plot /could/ diverge, but often doesn't.

Year 2 - Tom's diary goes to Hogwarts, because Lucy Malfoy wants to discredit Arty Weasley's "Muggleborn Protection Act". Unless either of these characters are fucked with this event happens.

Year 3 - Sirius gets his paws on Fudge's paper and sees Peter Pettigrew on vacation. Unless you've messed with the Weasley family dynamics, Harry doesn't actually figure into Sirius breaking out of Azkaban.

Year 4 - Often a point of divergence, as if Harry isn't around/important etc he might not factor into the Triwizard tournament. Although if he is around old Voldy probably wants his blood for that ritual.

That is the problem with canon rehash - a lot of events are predicated on secondary/tertiary characters, none of which are actually influenced by the main characters. So we inevitably wind up rereading bits of plot over and over again.

***** And it's incredibly hard to streamline the first few years in a natural way, in my opinion.

I'm trying to hash out my own fic right now but it's hard because I need to start at year one to set up the differences in Harry's character, but I don't want to retread Quirrel and the Chamber and Sirus escaping.

**** Basically canon rehash is the same events happening over again regardless of changes.

If a fic includes the Chamber of Secrets and Triwizard Tournament it is very likely a rehash of sorts.

This gets incredibly annoying very fast.

For example: If Harry travels back in time to first year, the Chamber of Secrets should not happen under any circumstances. Harry knows exactly how to prevent it. The author will then say some bullshit regarding "preserving the timeline", which is a codeword for being lazy and unimaginative.

This then prompts the question why did the protagonist travel back in time if he isn't going to change the past? That's the whole damn point of traveling back in time in the first place.

***** And this ends up being the thing I'm struggling with while trying to write my own fiction.

I'm not writng a time travel fic, but it still makes sense to start at year one because I want to write a different version of Harry. But then I'll have to redo all the plot points of at least the first three books, because none of those things are in a child's control.

And that's even more boring to write than it is to read. Even trying to think of new, inventive ways for Harry to make his way through the various plot points is tedious.

** I started in 2007 with a dial in connection and a Buffy fanfic addiction. Took my mum with me who despised reading from screen and printed all novel lenght fics double sided on A4. I still can see her reading on the couch with a 5 inch stack...

After Buffy came Lord of the Rings, a small side step to LOTRRPF, Harry Potter and Sherlock.

Tl;dr : I'm 11 years older. Yes, I'm different now :)

** I started reading fic when I was like 12 so my tastes have changed a lot. Off the top of my head:

-I used to almost exclusively read 100K+, these days I keep scrolling once it's pushing 40K, and over 75k I just won't do unless someone specifically recc'd it.

-I very rarely go for anything terribly intricate plot-wise anymore (HPMoR, time travel fic, etc.), ditto anything with heavy angst/serious topic. I'm more in the "came here to have a good time, not to have my feelings hurt" camp now.

-I tend to prefer more character-driven fic; that hasn't changed, but I'm much more of a stickler for accurate characterization than I used to be.

-I wouldn't read ship fic at all for several years, now I'll read it but usually more as a function of other elements present in the story than the specific ship. There are still ships I won't read, but not any that I really look for.

** I started out in Fanfiction reading HP fics. I unfortunately like many people here started reading the shitty cliche stuff that nowadays makes my eyes hurt 2 sentences in.

I have actually expanded a lot of my different fandoms especially in regards to Naruto, where I know everything in canon but have never actually read the manga or seen the anime.

I am exceptionally happy I am not the same person I was when I started reading fanfic, for one I like being an adult, and also I have a much better reading speed/comprehension/ability than a lot of my friends.

** I used to tolerate slash, but now I just skip any fic tagged with it, as it will perhaps inevitably be fifty percent badly written bad porn, and thirty percent teenage relationship angst.

I used to try to read Snape/Harry redemption stories, but I don't care for Snape wank, which is what they tend to be.

On that note, Snape wank. Rowling gave us a single dimension, horrific example of a human being. I don't understand the fascination with trying to redeem him, or worse, giving him a pedophile twist by pairing him with a student.

Romance in general. Over the past decade I've become quite the unrepentant misogynist, and I nope right the fuck out of any romance centric fic.

I can still stomach a lot of tropes and clichés, if they are well written.

I'm not sure misogynist and sexism have anything to do with not liking romance.

I don't like romance centric fics either, but I also enjoy BAFM female characters.
