Story: Regrowing the Blossoms [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12960346/1/Regrowing-the-Blossoms]]

/The war is finally over. Neville Longbottom visits Molly Weasley at the ruins of the Burrow. A son without his mother and a mother without her son slowly begin to heal and flourish again. Love and hope prevail over grief and loss./

Let me know what you think! It's not perfect and I know the tone changes a lot, but I was sitting on it for ages and needed to get it out of my head.


** I have this open in another window right now. Give me a moment and I'll do you a proper review?
