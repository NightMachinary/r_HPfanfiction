Never watched the Movies nor the Series, but when i look at Elvira, i somehow easily see Bellatrix. So, i wonder, if there are Fics with Bellatrix or some other Character (OC) who becomes a "dark" person and/or a Baroness. I would expect totally AU (i dont mind if its mixed with Canon), (lots of) erotic, sexual innuendos, comedy and even possibly Sex.

Maybe Bellatrix (or the other Person) likes to attract and tease the males (or females too), but drop them and rejoice in their expression of being cock blocked, unless a few exceptions who she finds really attractive or "worth that they share her Bed"
