** Linkffn(New Blood)

Hermione in Slytherin appears to believe in a variant of blood purity where there's a difference between the common mudblood and the "New blood" which is like ultra pure.

In reality she's just a really good con artist. She even makes a small fortune with a MLM.

I don't think so, cause in chapter one, the sorting hat says

#+begin_quote
  /New Blood?/ the hat queried. /...why, look at that. You/ */are/* /New Blood. But your journey will not be an easy one./
#+end_quote

So "new blood" is apparently a real thing, which makes her an actual racist.

That said, the fic fits the request either way.

**** It's caused by a self fulfilling prophecy. The prophecy said that she'd be new blood but not much more, so she pretty much made all of it up, convincing everyone that it's true, thus fulfilling her prophecy.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
