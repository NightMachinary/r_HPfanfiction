There seems to be a lack of those. Other than Quidditch, mean.


** Years and years ago there was a story that made fun of the Football/Soccer divide by having American Quidditch, and European Quidditch. They way I remember American Quidditch had more protective gear and was more contact driven and as a reverse a scoring system that made sense. There were different balls and stuff that I don't remember the details of.

*** But wouldn't it be quite boring though? I mean for either a human running race or an automobile race, you'd either need insane fitness/endurance levels or incredible driving skills under the fear of death. In broom racing, only the best broom (a.k.a Malfoy) wins

While executing a Quidditch manoeuvre like the Wronski feint, you have two people starting from different distances and altitudes, diving at extreme speeds towards the exact same point, and one person then suddenly switching direction at the last moment. Compare this to an ordinary broom race, where racers just move from A to B.

Edit - IIRC The Lie I've Lived had this event in a kind of death race format. But in such a format, racing always becomes secondary and the participants and the spectators are more interested in who gets eliminated from the race and in what fashion.

***** But NASCAR, like F1, is dependent on the driver's skills. And in broom racing, that aspect is really redundant.

Unless, we start allowing broom modifications - okay, then, maybe I can envision an interesting race

******* Individual skill comes into play when you have a specific track that you need to follow. Creating a tracked path for racing is difficult in air, where you have no boundaries as such, unless you add stuff like rings through which the racers have to move.

On hindsight though, I have realized that there are Olympic events like sailing where you have similar conditions, but the sport still requires skill and still remains entertaining

******** It would probably be very similar to the courses for drone racing, but with some added magical modifications. Maybe the racers have to fly through hoops that move a bit, or shrink and expand, or catch on fire every 7 seconds.

**** Well, when I used broom racing for a task in the TWT, I had an obstacle course - and rings the racers had to fly through on the course. So, flying skill played a crucial role. And everyone was using the same brooms.

**** Amateur broom racing would probably use commercial brooms, and probably standardized ones at that, and it would be focused on endurance races -- Orkney to Cornwall at 10m off the ground, sort of thing. Your skill might only shave off a few seconds here and there, but across a 12 hour race, that counts for a lot.

Time trial open course type things would use custom brooms, much like Formula 1.

**** This would work better outside of Hogwarts. In 'professional' broom racing, I imagine it would work like Formula 1 racing. They wouldn't have over the counter available brooms, but highly specialized brooms made especially for racing. Probably sponsered by the main broom manufactors. Like, team Nimbus used to be always in the lead, but then the producers of the firebolt came with a revolutionary new design etc.

** Oh, this thread just gave me an idea. What about a sort of BattleBot (combat robots destroying each other) but with enchanted contraptions... I'm thinking about writing a nerdy/smart/tinkering Harry and that could be the perfect niche "sport" that has all the magic nerds breathing heavily.

Like there would be a competition held once a year at EnchantCon (name subject to change upon getting an actual passable idea) in America (because of course such a thing would take place in America) and it would be reported only in specialized Geeky magic magazines.

Of course, one would need to create and expose carefully to the reader a solid magical system for enchanting but that was already part of my plan...

-"Harry, my boy, what on earth are you woking on at such a late hour!", said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling with mischief.\\
-"Oh, I'm just trying to get this fire spell to stick on my flame throwing module."\\
-"YOUR WHAT?", asked Dumbledore in shock. Designing weapons at 14, he thougth, how terrible, a clear sign that Harry is turning dark... I did well to steal everything from his vault and ready my plan to emprison him in Azkaban all these years ago.\\
-"Oh yeah, see, I'm making this BattleBot like for EnchantCon, I read all about it in Wizarding Weirdo Weekly"\\
-"I...see", the wizened man said, not seeing, "well... as you were"\\
Walking through the corridors of his beloved castle, the old man adorned in his confortable and rich gem-embroidered robes had only one thougth: I must procure such publication promptly and asses it. Such an obviously dark text should not have passed through the wards.

** Ideas not from fanfics:

Given what soccer is in the UK, and sports being what they are, my headcannon is that there is organized play of nonmagical soccer at Hogwarts. There's no reason to imagine magical children don't have legraces just because they could be racing on toy brooms instead.

There's some sorta niche sports/sport-like activities that can have interesting magical versions: Vaulting, which is like gymnastics on horseback, easily translates to gymnastics on a broom. If Hogwarts has a marching band (is that just an American thing?), the colorguard could use their wands for their ribbons, flags, etc.

** Moonball - played in singles, doubles or teams of five; using magic to move a glowing ball (moonball) through an obstacle course. The simplest course is just a ball sized channel (like a rollercoaster path) but other elements can be added to make it more difficult (loops, rolls, leaps, leapfrog, hurdles etc).

In singles, the course can be side by side or single run. In side by side, they start at the same place. In single run, they start at opposite ends and must strategize so they meet in a place where they can pass by each other.

In doubles, team members work together to move their ball and interfere with the other pair's run on either style of course.

In team play, it's all five working together as either a tag team with the ball or in disenchanting the course ahead of another team member with the ball but they also have to re-enchant it.

(moonball's popularity took a hit when it was discovered that blood purists used to play this game with muggle babies)
