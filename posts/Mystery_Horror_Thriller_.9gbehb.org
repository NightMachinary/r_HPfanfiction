Fics having the above three genres but with Harry and Ginny as the main pair.. Anyone? Can be one shot, long fics or medium length.


** Several of Northumbrian's would work for you.

*** Read them.. :( feel like erasing my head and reading them again. However by the pace North is going, 10 years from now when his top two fics are completed maybe I would have forgotten them. They are the best though and I would recommend them the first thing for anyone going through this post looking for similar fics.

It's a Auror investigation/mystery of sorts and complete.

** I write this sort of stuff. Aurors and Hollow Ash. There is an OC but Harry and Ginny are the main pairing. Aurors is a police procedural thriller, Hollow Ash is a myster/Horror.

*** Oh I have read both already and loved them! That's why was wondering if there are more like them! I love reading about Harry investigating crimes as an Auror and yours was the first fic which I read in this genre.

Wonderful story btw. Hope to keep reading your works!

** Anything by Zeitgeist84. All amazingly well written, trio is a bit ooc but it is written to great effect. He hasn't updated in a long while but I'm still hoping for a midnight blues update.
