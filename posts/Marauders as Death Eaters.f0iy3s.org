I recently started reading this fic where it turns out that the marauders were death eaters. I thought that sounded interesting, however the fic turned out to be a little too trope-y for my liking. I was wondering if anybody knew of any stories where the marauders were death eaters? Thanks!

*** I think it was called Serpentine? Lily was a pure blood, Petunia was a squib, and Harry was Voldemort's grandson. I stopped reading where Harry was the heir of like 5 houses and I swear had 7 names

**** Ah, I was all 'DE!marauders? That sounds cool!'. But now I recall reading that. Not to say I didn't power through what was there because sometimes trope-y is what the doctor ordered.

** So it's not really death eaters I guess, but HoshiHikari has this interesting series that isn't finished called The VPMWPV which is a sequel to The Reign of Darkness which has what you're looking for I believe. Read Reign of Darkness first though!
