As above, but also i would prefer if the story gets at least past TWT if not further. Crossovers are welcome as long as it is not heavy like no marvel or dc since that always makes the storys more complicated and difficult to follow along. Anything with single or multiple universe as long as there are not too many new characters to remember, makes it more fun too.


** A Black Comedy has Harry with a form of windless magic. He can use a combination of summoning and banishing to create invisible but corporal 'hands' to manipulate stuff and even spells if I remember correctly.

  When Harris was bitten by the basilisk, the venom destroyed the Horcrux in his head, but Fawkes saves Harry's life. Accidental magic begins to happen around him and not all of its consequences are good. Only with the help Hermione and some new friends and allies can he learn to master his newfound power. He only hopes it's enough to save him from the Dementors and Sirius Black. HHr

****** I'm reading it at the moment hehe, just popped over to reddit to check the forums. It is quite fun. I'm only at chapter 6ish, but its a fun read. Not a very serious read, but it isn't childish nor is it stupid. No bad grammar or stupid characters yet.

****** Yeah, it's tropey AF.

I've enjoyed it though.The main reason these tropes are usually bad is that they aren't used well/ at all by the author. Helpful Goblins give Harry all the gold. Harry never uses the gold beyond boasting about it, and Goblins quietly recede into their caves and never contribute to the story again.

In this fic all the tropes are use, but are actually used. They build out a plausible world that contains lordships and anti muggle prejudice and heir rings and wandless magic and what not.

So if the very idea of these tropes is offensive to you, then yeah avoid this fic. But if your opinion is mostly based off of fics that have used them poorly, then I'd give this a shot.

****** Its worth a read, if you kind of "mentally prepare" yourself for it. You have to go into it with a mindset of humor that can be a bit meta at times. Its average for the most parts, to be completely honest, but has some very well written parts where the author ended up surprising me with very tense scenes and a good use of those tropes.

I also gotta say: I was a big opponent of this fic. The way Harry molds 8 year olds into his private female agents is... iffy. There's nothing sexual about it, and am I thankful for that, but there is definitely a undertone of "dominant male - submissive females" there that is balancing the lines between "barely okay" and "not okay", especially because he fully plans on making them his harem later on. I won't spoil anything, but I'm sure that should you read it, you'll know which scenes I mean.

However, I still don't understand the hype around it. There are way better fics out there.

** My darkness ascendant story will likely have harry get home after first year(to sirius's house) and immediately get locked in his room with his wand locked away in a tunnel so he has to learn how to wandlessly summon it back, a tradition in the potter family. If he succeeds before the two weeks is up (depends on a coin flip), he'll get something. But it's a top cow(comics) crossover so prolly not to your interest.

** On an unrelated note, why do people assume that you can use 'Beams/Jets/Lights' magic while wandless? The only times we've seen wandless magic has been through elemental and telekinetic use, yet I don't recall anyone shooting stunners out of their fingers with wandless magic. I'm assuming that wandless magic is only capable of kinetic displays (Pyrokinesis, Hydrokinesis, Telekinesis etc...), and 'invisible force spells' kind of like Protego, which is supposed to be invisible.

*** dumbledore used wandless transfiguration to change the slytherin banners into gryffindor banners and grindewald used wandless magic to heal credence, and quirrel used it to conjure ropes. I think its not quite as limited as you think and thats without the stuff found on pottermore. but I personally think those spell light are just more focused and better directed spells than those without a wand

**** True Transfiguration has no visible lights/flashes, Dumbledore transfigured it in an instant, I'm not saying that these are all there is to Wandless Magic, I'm just saying that you can only really use the magic through certain fields/spells that were designed to be done wandlessly and with a wand, and some that can only be done with a wand.

** That's like every single indy harry/dumbledore bashing story out there. I can tell you the plot right away: Harry finds out Dumbledore is evil and using/manipulating him, runs away to goblins, finds out he has 100 family vaults and thousand manors, buys huge bottomless trunk and other shit, learns that dumbledore is keeping wandless magic from him, starts shooting AKs and Crucios left and right without a wand ...

*** TBH it would be pretty interesting for him to snap and decide that wizards have to be exterminated and makes a spell so he can "shoot" people with aids.

The incantation could be aidsus demonstrateus or some such.

Fuck that sounds depressing.
