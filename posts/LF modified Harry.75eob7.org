Hi! I'm searching for a fic in which Harry modifies himself using magic or replaces pieces of himself with machines or artifacts. He could also be changing races using magic.

Thanks a bunch!


** Linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) Harry is rather adept at self-transfiguration, including turning his skin into metal at at least one point.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror

*** Is this the one where he installs a Dr. Stein-esque head screw? I remember liking that one. I gave up after reading the first chapter, but read the rest of it eventually.

  His fight finished, his enemies dead, Harry Potter expects to move on from a life of conflict and pain. Either to the peace of oblivion, or to the embrace of those already fallen to Riddle's army. But fate does not have such a happy ending in store for our protagonist, and he arrives in another world to be found, covered in blood, by a familiar face.

  The Kyuubi Chakra was split into two halves and sealed into Naruto's sisters, the Yang into Erza, and the Yin into Mito. But there was another being there that night, and three possible hosts. Minato was able to survive the sealing by changing the seal at the last minute, not realizing his mistake until years later. Adopted from Jinx777.
