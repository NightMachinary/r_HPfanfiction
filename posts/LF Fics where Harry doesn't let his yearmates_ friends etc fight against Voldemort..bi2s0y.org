I'm looking for fics where Harry proactively refuses to let his friends (i.e. DA) fight with him against Voldemort. It could be that he believes they are too naive, or that he only taught them how to survive in an emergency, or that he believes it's his duty to fight Voldemorts army.

Length: >70k words.

No Harry/ Hermione.No Slash.

Edit: Added a little extra clarification.


** You mean Canon? Harry always train his classmates for their own safety, and never wanted them to follow him into battle. It's the member of the DA who each chose, or not (looking at you Smith), to fight with him. Harry refused to let his friend follow him to the Department of Mysteries, and later blamed himself for each death during the Battle of Hogwarts. Each time, it's the people around who reminded him they were here by their own choice.

Unless you mean physically stopping people from following him?

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** So why would anybody want such a Harry (I mean canon is close to this and frankly it sucks! It's their decision if they want to stand and risk death or kneel and hope that others do it for them!)?

Seriously, hypocrites aren't fun and neither are overprotective anythings (brothers, fathers, mothers, boy- or girlfriends etc.) and Harry would be both if he argues for being taken seriously and being included in order meetings and being given (classified/secret) information etc. while also keeping his friends and classmates out of the fight! It is their fight, too because if they don't fight then they've lost and will probably forever grovel on their knees!

Seriously, I myself would never make a great soldier (or even a great policeman - especially since I would probably ignore all minor lawbreaking (that doesn't endanger or hurt anybody!) around me!) because frankly I think all nation states are dumb and fighting for one is even dumber (united humanity FTW!)...but if the freedom of everybody (I doubt Voldemort would have stuck to Britain in the long run!) is in danger, then you bet I would pick up a weapon to fight and people trying to stop me would join my list of enemies, be they best friends, parents, girlfriend etc.!
