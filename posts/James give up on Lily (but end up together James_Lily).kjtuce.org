Any fic where James give up trying to date Lily who clearly doesn't like him (or so he believe) which cause him to act normal toward her which make Lily fall for him and because James is ignoring his feelings toward her, she has to be the one to ask him out? For clarification, James never stopped loving Lily, just gave up on trying to date her, thinking he had no chances.

Basically, a fic where, for example, after the end of their fifth year, James take Lily's words (when she defended Snape) to heart and decide not to bother her anymore and grow up. Lily see the new James and she like the new James but since isn't asking her out anymore she has to be the one to do so.

I would also prefer if it's slow burn. I read too many fics where James and Lily aren't friendly to each other but somehow end up engaged less than a year later. Especially when James' attitude/personality never changed in the story.

** In â€˜the lost generation' by Jennbob linkao3(1110486) something of the sort happens. I mean to say James doesn't want to press on her anymore after the Snape's Worst Memory and it's Lily that makes the first move after that (but it's not like she completely dislikes him after 5th year). It's a fantastically written fic and I honestly can't recommend it enough (it's one of my all time favourites). It starts with Sirius being born and follows the Marauders years at Hogwarts (the last chapter that was updated few days ago happens in Jan in their 7th year, it's a work in progress). It's also a wolfstar fic. Both wolfstar and Jily are slow burn and take years (wolfstar get together in 98th chapter and Jily in 131st chapter). There is a slight canon divergence at times (the first train ride is different to what was shown in DH and it's the biggest one I can think of) but it works very well and otherwise it's completely canon compliant. Jily is extremely well done and the whole process of them getting together is very realistically presented.
