I'm just wondering if there are any fics in which she is killed in that childhood encounter, thus leading to a very different Albus Dumbledore. Would he be more susceptible to and enthusiastic about Grindelwald's plans? Would he become a Dark Lord himself? How might Aberforth react? I've never seen a fic that addressed this possibility, and I am curious if anyone has tried to do so.

Thanks for any suggestions.


** He'd probably never meet Grindelwald at all, he was only in Godrics hollow because of Ariana.

*** And probably would then have dueled grindelwald earlier too. From the books it seemed implied that he was just avoiding him because of guilt and shame but from the new movies it seems to have been ret conned to a blood pact that prevented them from taking action against one another.
