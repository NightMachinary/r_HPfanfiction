For me, it's Justbored21. I found I'm not a hero on accident and it hook me. I have reread Lightning curse and Chaos multiple times. I want to hear about you guys (and ladies), if you want to give me a link be free to do so


** Hey same...I was looking for a wbwl fic and I found I'm not a hero and that got me into haphne as well. I then read his other ones and I've read most of them several times...though I do wish he'd have only 1 or 2 fics at one time and stick to them...he has about 6 different ones currently active and that does make it quite annoying dealing with updates

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

***** “Petrification Proliferation” is great. I really liked those stupid “I am not JK Rowling” notices ... White_Squirrel got them to the level of a special art.
