Sorry to bring up dark harry again, I know there's an insane amount of posts, but most of the stories I find are just harry being an over powered, single minded psychopath with no social skills at all.

Does anyone know fics with a riddle like manipulative, charming, dark main character that actually cares about power and influence? (doesn't have to be harry)


** I don't know about her being charming, but Hermione is showing signs of taking a similar path in linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or by jacobk).

Without giving away massive spoilers, this fic doesn't have the same problems that a lot of "X in Slytherin" stories do: there's no fast friends with her fellow Slytherin, no political careers at age eleven, no "she's a true Gryffindor in green" punch-pulling, no OOC, no instant psychopath mode, and no vehement shipping.

It's actually ruined me for other Hermione in Slytherin fics.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Hermione and Draco team up after the war to overthrow the Order and take over wizarding Britain. "I don't even especially mind belonging to you most of the time," he closes his eyes and just breathes for a bit, savoring not being in pain. Finally he adds, "Just... try to take better care of your toys." Dark Dramione. COMPLETE
