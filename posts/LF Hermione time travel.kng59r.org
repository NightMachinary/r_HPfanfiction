hey! recently, i've been obsessed with time travel fics, especially with Hermione. my favorite pairings are regulus/hermione or sirius/hermione but i'm ok with any of the marauders except for James because he reminds me too much of Harry lol. any recs u guys have are much appreciated!! also, i've already read the popular ones like debt of time, roundabout destiny, etc


** If you like Sirius/Hermione, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]] is very good

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
