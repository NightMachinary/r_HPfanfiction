Is there any fics where Harry or Hermione learn to create new spells of their own and use them?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] and its sequels are the only ones I know. You many not like it though, since it's a canon rehash but with Hermione inventing spells (or rituals) for everything, which eventually gets a bit boring. The magical theory is really good though.
