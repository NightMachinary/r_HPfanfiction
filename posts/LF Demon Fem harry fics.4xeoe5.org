*** Your brief summary of the first one sounds good, but then the actual summary sounds terrible.

Gives me an idea for a story though, would be kind of interesting if Harry randomly contained Kurama, or maybe Isobu or one of the other ones, but they had no idea what was going on, or how they got in there, or knew anything about the potterverse. Could lead to some funny interactions.

  What happens when you anger a God? What happens when something once pure, turns wicked and angry? What is left of someone who has been alone so long? How do you ask forgiveness for being so wrong? How do you apologize, for breaking someone's heart? This is the story of Slytherin House's Angel of Carnage. FemHarry/Naruto Yuri, wrong GWL, God-like, lots of bashing, lot's of gore.
