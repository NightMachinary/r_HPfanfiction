** Here are a few quick tips I've picked up (And still struggle with). Anyone, feel free to offer input or disagreement.

- Show don't tell. This one can be hard, but in general it's better to describe somebody behaving or appearing a certain way that inspires thought or emotion. As opposed to just telling the reader what emotion they are feeling.

- GENERALLY, chapters should be at least 2000 words. There isn't really an upper bound, but some consider it a bit unwieldy to read 30K word chapters. Also, don't concentrate too much on word count. Use as many words as it takes to tell the story, and no more. Longer does not mean better.

- Be careful with using too many adverbs. This sort of falls under the "show don't tell" rules. Also, if you use them too often it seems lazy.

- Understand verb tenses: Simple, Perfect, Participle etc.

- Mix sentence length. Some long sentences, some short and some medium size. Often a short 3-4 word sentence can be way more impact than an 8-9 word sentence.

- Don't use a semicolon unless you are absolutely certain how to use it correctly.

- Go research commas. Don't just guess. Look up "comma splicing"

- Use a thesaurus to learn more colorful language, but don't use a word if you don't understand the nuances of how it's used. Most words you can look up a more specific definition online.

- Outline. Sometimes it's easier to just think of an idea and start typing, but eventually you need to take a step back and plan everything out, otherwise your story will meander.

- Character voice. Even in third person you need to give each character a voice, you should have a unique way you describe them, their dialogue, their thought process etc. compared to every other character. Minor characters don't need as much, if any, voice, but your main characters should be distinct.

- Imagery: You have more senses than just site. Use them all when you write.

- Go read quality literature to learn better vocabulary and look up words you don't know. Use this literature to study story structure, tone, character voice, imagery etc.

- Dialogue tags: Don't use too man, it's okay to leave some out as long as it's clear who is talking. Don't go out of your way to avoid saying "said." Let the flow and sound natural.

- Let characters write themselves for the most part. Don't force them to do something that doesn't represent their personality just to fit the narrative.

- Don't hesitate to re-write something that doesn't sound right, or doesn't fit the narrative or somebody's personality. I often get into this mindset that I've already written this part, so I'll do the best I can to clean it up, but that's being lazy. Go back to the drawing board if you must.

- Learn the Oxford comma

- Learn what the difference between lay and lie and how to conjugate them.

- Learn how to use prepositional phrases, adverb phrases etc.

- Learn how to use and punctuate conjunctive adverbs

- Learn the many uses of "as"

- Practice! And get feedback, both at the low level of grammar and spells, and the high level of story structure, tone etc.

- Lastly, have a thick skin. People will tell you your writing is shit initially, and it's probably true. Accept any criticism graciously and improve.

You can definitely find something online that expands upon these.

I have noticed that many fanfic writers will post author's notes that explain/ elaborate on their chapter. would you consider that "telling" even though it is not in the work itself?

**** If you say something in your story that needs clarification in order for the reader to understand, then you should consider rewriting it, so that it makes more sense.

There are appropriate times to offer explanation such as clarifying intentional deviations from canon, offering supporting lore or information or even translations.

You SHOULD NOT use authors notes to respond to specific reviews. If you do, then that review and its answer need to be relevant to everybody reading the fic. Restate the idea behind the review, respond to the review, and explain why it's relevant to all of the readers.

If you want to see a good example of how to use authors notes I would refer you to linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) chapter 10 specifically.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

Write what you want to read - fanfic should be something you enjoy for the sake of writing it, not to chase reviews or favourites.

** Proper grammar for dialogue is:

"Blah blah blah," he said.

Also, stick to said. If you're gonna flourish the "he said" part, show, don't tell. If you need to use adverbs, you're doing it wrong.

This is my biggest pet peeve with fan fiction.

** Most of the suggestions that have already posted are very good, and should be heeded by any aspiring writer. So, instead, I shall talk about the intangibles.

*What Do You Want?*

You need to decide what it is you want to get out of fanfiction. Everyone is a little different in this regard:

- Doing it for practice. No-one is born with an innate ability to write well, though we all have the ability to create our own stories. One of the greatest strengths of fanfiction is that it allows for a 'safe space' for growth. You don't need to worry about world building, or character creation, or any of those things if you don't want to. You can, instead, focus on getting better at the nuts and bolts of storytelling. Later, once you have a grasp of those things, you can move on to the bigger game. Do you want to improve? Even if that means you may be hurt by the criticism?

- Doing it for recognition. Everyone loves being recognised. Reviews are one of the biggest drivers for many writers, it surely is a nice feeling to be told how good your little baby is doing. But you must be careful here, sometimes the story that gets the most recognition isn't the story you want to write. Can you handle that?

- Doing it for fun. The joy of creation can be a heady thing. Fanfiction is, in many ways, like rediscovering the pure joy we all experienced as children, as we concocted stories for our teddies, or dolls, or other toys. It doesn't have to be about agendas. Some write simply because that joy is enough for them. But when that joy starts to lose its shine, will you continue your story to the end?

- Doing it because a story needs to be told. Sometimes it's not about what you want, sometimes it's about something bigger. Sometimes it's about telling a story that needs to be told. Maybe, in some ways, fanfiction isn't the best place for this kind of story, but maybe it is exactly the right place.

There are other reasons, I imagine, that I haven't touched upon here. And no-one is motivated by only one or two of these reasons; we all are influenced by them all to some degree. What is important is that you work out why it is that you write, and what it is you hope to get out of it.

I say this because if you write for enjoyment, and you find yourself not having fun, then that is a good time to consider if the story is still worth writing.

Finally, the single piece of advice I'd give to an aspiring fanfiction writer, quite beyond all the technical questions of grammar, spelling, or word choice, is to love your fandom.

It seems insipid, I know, but it's something that many people seem to forget over the years. You are not in competition with the Harry Potter books, it is more a symbiosis. Without Harry Potter you would not be here writing a story (or thinking about it), remember that. And remember why it is you read the books from cover to cover, and why you have found yourself thinking about fanfiction five years after the last movie was released. It is the love of the fandom that is the heart-beat of fanfiction, don't forget that.

Do you dislike Ron? That's fine. But do not declare war on him when it comes time to write your story. It isn't a fight you can win. Your story lives within the fandom, and trying to attack the fandom is like bringing down your own ceiling to get back at the noisy neighbour upstairs. There are no winners, only losers, and your story will suffer for it.

My favourite stories are those that demonstrate an affection for the source material, and communicate that joy to me through their writing. I am willing to overlook a few issues in grammar, pacing and storytelling if that love for the fandom is present.

Anyway, go get 'em, tiger.

** - Refresh yourself on [[http://englishgrammar101.com/][grammar]], especially if you don't have a word processor that will check for mistakes.

- Keep multi-chapter stories separated into chapters, with each chapter starting on its own page; that will make it easier to keep track of. [[https://www.scribd.com/doc/311002858/Fanfiction-Story-Doc][Here's]] a quick example of that.

- Likewise, an outline that lists chapters will make your life easier. Make sure to note which ones you've already uploaded. [[https://www.scribd.com/doc/311002082/Fanfiction-Outline][Here's]] another quick one I slapped together.

- Place notes either at beginning of chapters or the ends of them. Never anywhere else.

- Edit your work. Even if you have betas.

** There's some good tips already, so I'll try to avoid repeats from the other commenters.

One thing that gets me to drop a work faster than anything else is paragraph errors.

The biggest most annoying thing I ever have the displeasure of reading is when multiple characters speak in the same paragraph. If someone new is talking, new paragraph is needed.

Similarly, actions between characters should be paragraphed out in the same manner. First character actions. New paragraph. Second character actions. I won't say this is an absolute golden rule, as there are some cases where you would muddle action, but if you're a beginning writer then you should probably keep things separated.

Keep in mind those rules when mixing dialog and actions. Dialog and actions can be in the same paragraph, but only when the same character is both speaking and acting.

One time I read (part of) a story where the author /continually/ formatted their paragraphs like so:

#+begin_quote
  "Character A dialog." Character B actions.

  "Character B dialog." Character C actions.

  "Character C dialog." Character A actions.

  etc.
#+end_quote

And it was some of the most horrible to read stuff I've ever read.

Those are the big things. Beyond that, I find paragraphs exceeding four or five sentences to be tedious to read. Maybe this is just me, but paragraphs that take up the entire screen of my tablet tend to make my eyes jump between lines.

I've you've gone ten sentences in a single paragraph, you've probably covered multiple topics and should splice in your paragraphs somewhere.

Again, these aren't necessarily Iron Clad Rules, but should be kept in consideration when starting out writing.

A few other notes:

Pace yourself and make writing a habit. Set yourself an achievable goal based around your personal life. For example: two, 4k chapters a week. That's less than 1.5k words a day. So sit down every day and write 1.5k words. You'll be ahead of schedule.

Slipping on a day is bad. Saying "Ah, I'll do 3k tomorrow" is the start of the end. Procrastination leads to dead fics.

Be wary of plot-bunny burnout. You have this genius idea. Man, no one's thought of it before, its great. You get to writing. One week and you've already got 15 chapters under your belt. Things are going great.

But uh oh! You only thought of that one cool idea that kickstarted your writing. Now you're stuck thinking up an actual plot to go with your idea.

So many fanfics die out early and hard with the author promising that the next chapter is coming out. That's rarely the case. This all ties into the pace yourself thing I mentioned earlier, but just keep it in mind.

Lastly, stations of canon. Be very careful about the stations of canon. We've /all/ read the Halloween troll fight a *million* times. We've all read the Goblet of Fire tasks a million times. So on and so forth. Sure, they usually have variations. But it does get old after a while.

If you're going to follow the stations of canon, be mindful of exactly how samey you're being.
