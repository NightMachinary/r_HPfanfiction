** There's a suuuuuuuuper smutty one I can't remember the name of somewhere. Malfoy's older sister, kind of treats Harry like a kind of pet due to her being essentially a well respected older student. I just remember some scene in the RoR as the smut.

*** I remember that one, it was Twins by angles of death, looks like it's been deleted on ffn but I found a separate link.

Edit: direct link removed, if you want to read it Google found it for me pretty quick.

  The saying "opposites attract" is proven true when two very different people come together, despite their own (token) protests. Long-ish one-shot, heavy AU. Super!Harry, kinda (it's not really relevant, it's just kinda there). Basically my answer to Harry/Draco shipping: Harry/Draco's more worthwhile twin sister. Footnotes! Terrible summary, but such is life, yes?
