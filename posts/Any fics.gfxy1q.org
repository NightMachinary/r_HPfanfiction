Are there any fics where Harry is raised by McGonagall? I recently read a headcanon about it and would like to know more, if there are any.

  What if McGonagall had delivered the letter from the start like she had done for every other muggle-raised child? Why wouldn't she have wanted to check up on Harry when she loathed the Dursley's from day one? Well, maybe Harry would have been encouraged to think and try his hardest not to make friends but to earn the respect of his new guardian. Begins after the trip to the zoo.
