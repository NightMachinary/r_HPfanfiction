:END:
The 4 fields had soil from different famous grape areas, and had wards to simulate their growing areas. So like, South France, North France, Australia, Cali or something. No idea what the fic was about aside from that.


** Novocaine, I think.

*** I love that OP had such a small, weirdly specific detail that they remembered about this fic and that you knew what it was. Humans are amazing.

**** I remembered it because I'm writing a fic where Harry and Neville are buddies, and grow plants and whatnot, so it was relevant to my fic, but when I wanted to go check out the fic for ideas on how they did it, I'd forgotten where I'd read it. I'm trying to make sure I have a list of where I got some of the ideas, give credit where it's due.

***** Honestly? Even better. You're the best for going the extra mile to give credit to the original author

****** Yeah, there's some really neat ideas out there that are basically just throwaway lines, but that seem really cool? Like this one person had Harry make a bumbleberry pie, and IRL that's a mixed berry pie, usually with 3 berries, but in the fic Bumbleberries were small striped berries that buzzed when you bit into them. Then this fic that had elves use wards, and soil to replicate different environmental conditions for growing grapes, it's just neat and has so much room for expanding upon, but I also don't want to pretend I thought of them first.
