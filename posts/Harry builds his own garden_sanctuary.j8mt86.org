:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a fic where young Harry decides he'd rather not be at the Dursley as much as possible. He finds this hidden area nearby that has a stream and whatnot. He uses the library to learn how to survive off the land (farming/building/etc). I don't think the fic is complete but I remember it being pretty good. I would love some help finding it please! Thank you!


** I think that's Harry Potter and the Hidden Kingdom. A good story, but sadly it hasn't been updated for a few years.

  What if instead of locking Harry in his cupboard whenever they didn't want to look at him, the Dursley's had locked him out of the house instead? Maybe this. Self-Sufficient, Independent!Harry.
