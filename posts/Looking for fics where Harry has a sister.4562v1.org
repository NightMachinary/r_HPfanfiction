  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.

  What would have happened if Ginny had been the third person in the Aperio? How would it have changed things? Diversion from chapter 22, must read The World as We Knew It first. HG, AU. Abandoned.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

*** Yeah, 3+ years with no update is probably abandoned. Good story, but not a lot of sister interaction. And feels rushed that last 5 chapters or so, like the author was trying very hard to finish quickly, but couldnt quite pull it out.

Whats there is fun though! Worth a read.

  Harry Potter was not the only one marked that fateful Halloween, Severus Snape is given a chance at redemption in the form of a daughter, and fate may just be a bigger problem than the three of them thought. It doesn't pay to say it hurts sometimes, when it only gets much worse.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  What if Harry had a twin sister, someone who grew up with him as they ventured through life together, instead of him facing the world by himself. And Malfoy has a sister as well, which makes life even more chaotic. Sequel to Battle of Wills, with AU elements. Story begins with Harry's 4th year. Harry/OC/OC/Fleur. Warning: wincest, BDSM, harem.
