Do you know any interesting were Harry is Voldemort real son, and it's not a potter. It would be better if Harry is really dark, but I don't really care.


** The closest I know of personally is cleotheo's Children of the Dark series. Voldemort as Harry's grandfather, with Snape as his dad. Snape grew up not knowing his mother had had an affair with Voldemort and finds out after he graduated Hogwarts. Voldemort then goes on to marry an American (?) witch and has Hermione. Harry and Hermione grow up alongside Draco Malfoy and the three work together to bring down the Order from the inside. It is a Dramione fic, but has interesting characterizations of Dark!Harry and Dark!Hermione who have to pretend to be the 'saviour' and a muggleborn respectively. It's also a seven book series that's fully completed, with an eighth book that is a drabble collection as well.
