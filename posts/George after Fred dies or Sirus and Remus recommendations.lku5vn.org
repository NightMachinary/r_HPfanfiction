  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

** *For George being sad*

linkffn(The Latecomer by HalfASlug) - George speaks at Freds funeral - This really just made me bawl crying.

linkao3(The Exceptional Mr Weasley and his Approximation of Obedience by Realmero06) - Sirius leads Fred to the afterlife. Also sad (this also might be on ffn i dont remember the website)

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9636572]]) George meets Andromeda over 3 funerals. Also good and sweet I liked it. Marginally less sad and a good insight into the world.

*For Wolfstar*

I've also so much wolfstar ones that have been recced on this site too many times to count but linkao3(Text Talk by weirdo) and linkao3(Dress Up in You by MsKingBean89) are the two best ones and are muggleAUs so maybe are a bit different to the other recs you'll get. I know reading muggle versions is odd but these two are worth it =)

â€‹

All the authors of what ive recced are also brilliant and their other stories are well worth looking at!

  Sirius is in boarding school, Remus is in hospital, and they don't know each other until Sirius texts the wrong number.

  Non-magical modern AU - Marauders/WolfstarSirius attends a charity rock gig organised by his best friend's girlfriend, and the tall, quiet bassist catches his eye...Basically just a thing I wrote after listening to Belle & Sebastian's 'Dress up in you' a million times.Quite sexy.

  Ever wonder how Harry's life would have been if his parents had survived and he was still the Boy Who Lived? Well, this is my take on what would have happened. Rated K for safety

** Not just focused on George after Fred's death, but does have a large portion of the story dealing with this: The First Day by little0bird. Although George constantly calling Fred "bro" when he thinks about him greatly annoyed me, also don't love the characterization of Charlie from this story, doesn't really fit the "canon" view of Charlie in my mind.
