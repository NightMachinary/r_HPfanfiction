** Questions--this is an Adult Harry that has already been through this situation and had the bit of Voldemort in him killed? So he wants to restore the piece of soul? Is the intention to remove entirely the soul sliver from Baby Harry?

I think blood would need to be involved and one of Voldemort's already-existing Horcruxes. The shared blood between the Harrys and the soul fragment in the existing Horcrux would create sympathetic links. The Horcrux would draw the soul sliver to it, but the Adult Harry's blood would absorb it. Sorta.

That's an interesting question.

** Jokes thread: Joke answers that might be useful for inspiration go here.

Imperius the baby into committing murder.

Feed the main part of the baby to a dementor.

Go back in time with the baby. Use the attraction between soul shards to dislodge them from the main soul. This would not result in a paradox if you use the new method of time travel which can create duplicate bodies and can avoid paradoxes. Alternatively, blah blah blah, souls are timeless, so combining soul magic and time turners grants infinite power.

*** If the connection is new and fresh, there is only one solution.

Bitchslap the baby so hard the soul shard is dislodged from the wound. Baby Harry will thank you later, assuming he survives the whiplash.

** You don't need to transfer the soul. Old Harry just legilimizes young Harry and can see into Voldemorts mind.

Or you can do it the way everyone else does it in time travel fics and have old Harry imperius young Harry and make him kill some innocent person (such as Dudley) and create a horcrux (Out of old Harry, for instance).

Or you could ignore the horcrux altogether and avoid rehashing that annoying concept.

**** Can't tell if you're being intentionally confrontational or just obstinate, so I'll be generous and assume you misunderstood me. "do what everyone else does" was a subtle jab at the entire concept you're perusing, implying that the idea of using "riddle!soulsliver" as a weapon is uninspired and... bland.

** Just cut that chunk out of his forehead with a repurposed magical ice-cream scoop. Then, since the soul-sliver wants/needs a better thing than 'cast-off chunk of forehead' it'll fight back, try to control whatever nearest it can. So you feed that lump to a toad, it becomes a Volde!Toad, and you can just carry that around in a fishbowl or something. Maybe it'll have extra-evil toad poisons, or a double-extra-long tongue.
