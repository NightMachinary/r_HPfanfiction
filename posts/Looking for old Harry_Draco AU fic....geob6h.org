:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic somewhere between 2007-2010...... It was long, many chapters. Harry was a twin, and I believe got sorted into slytherin. Harry's twin was a golden boy and got sorted into gryffindor. Eventually it became harry/draco slash (after many chapters) but to start they were just friends and harry was resistant to any kind of relationship or intimacy. Harry wasn't treated well by his family, especially had issues with his dad. Throughout the story harry was powerful, and eventually became something of a defender of social justice and equal rights for all magical creatures sort of savior figure.

There are other details I can add if this doesn't help, but the rest I can't be sure I'm not confusing with other stories...

I LOVED this story for a while, but I don't remember my logins for any of my old accounts where I might have saved it, and I can't remember what it was called, and google searches turned up nothing. :/


** I think you're talking about the Sacrifices Arc, the first in the series is Saving Connor

*** That is my first thought as well, especially given the " defender of social justice and equal rights for all magical creatures" bit

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

** Was it a single book or a series? Unfortunately, the above applies to a lot of Slytherin!WBWL!Harry stories I've read.
