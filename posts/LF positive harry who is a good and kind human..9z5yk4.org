So I just finished the downward spiral saga by BolshevikMuppet99.

Geschichte: Harry Potter and the Homecoming [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12867536/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Homecoming]]

After that experience I need a fluffy good Harry story.

I read Seasons of change already. That was exactly what I am looking for.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

I am not sure if this is what you're looking for, but Harry is overall nice and friendly.
