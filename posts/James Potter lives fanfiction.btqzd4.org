** There was this fic where James Potter survives the attack on Godric's Hollow but spends 14 years in a coma in a muggle hospital. He wakes up before Harry's fifth year and becomes a Defence professor in disguise instead of Umbridge, though she is still at Hogwarts as a High Inquisitor. Harry learns about his identity through the Marauder's Map and is understandably pissed (though the narrative painted his reaction as unreasonable for some reason iirc). They slowly reconcile and get to know each other and James tries to protect Harry from Umbridge.

Seemed as it would be easy to find, but Google refuses to help me.

*** Probably because Harry having normal human reactions to things is treated as unreasonable by both the books and large portions of the fanbase. Though latter has cooled on that over time.

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

** I know something similar to this was posted in the last few days, but for some reason, I can't find it in the search. However, I did bookmark a couple that seemed interesting.

Without thorn the Rose linkffn(9097983) has James raising Harry without Lily. Seems interesting so far but haven't finished it.

Haven't even started this one linkffn(12910629) but this has the same James and Harry without Lily theme.

Of all the stories where James is alive, this one is my favorite, granted he isn't a central character:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/1/The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]])

This one used to be recommended a lot, and is also really good but not so much lately:

  A bittersweet coming-of-age story for fans of good writing. Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Linkao3(This Gonna Be Good by GStarshine)

This has James alive, but it does have Evil!Dumbledore with Fem!harry and is an avengers crossover.

I enjoyed it and It is 422,000 words so even if it is probably dead it still lasts quite a while.

** linkffn(The Reluctant Champion by TheUnrealInsomniac) is the first story in what's supposed to be a series along these lines. The next book, linkffn(A Scattered War) is out but updates very sporadically - only six chapters since June 2016.

These are very much AU stories with what I'd say are much more realistic teenage characters. The realism does mean the story loses some of the innocence of canon. I flicked through the first story again not long ago and still consider it well-worth reading.
