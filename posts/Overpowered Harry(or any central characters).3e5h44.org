Hi. Was just wondering if there were any fanfics with Harry or any main character who is overpowered or even godlike? An example of what I am looking for is The Darkness Within trilogy by Kurinoone. Thanks in advance! P.S. I would prefer a novel like fanfic if possible:) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5957714/1/The-Darkness-Within-The-Rewrite]] ffnbot!directlinks


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] is a must read. Harry gains power from a Fallen Angel, an Archangel at that, so he is very powerful.

This is a trilogy that is more than novel length so I hope you're OK with that.

*** Also I find it necessary to add that if you don't like duelling scenes, prepare to dislike this.

Some fights take over entire chapters.

**** Oh no. I love dueling scenes. That was something I loved about Denarian Renegade. The duels were incredibly well written and engaging unlike many duels I have read.

******* Used it here as more of a figure of speech, really.

But anyway, lets compile one. Here goes:

1: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird Trilogy]]

This one had me hooked and never let go until the end. Great worldbuilding, great OC's, well doen OOC and I loved the protagonists. Its just overall my favourite fic and the only one I ever re-read.

2: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Black]] & its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9937462/1/Black-Princess-Ascendant][Black Princess Ascendant]]

A little too edgy at the beginning, but the story develops in a great way. Believe me, I had to fight over the first 5 chapters, but its well worth it. Jen Black is the best!

3: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Those Gilded Chains We Wear]]

My favourite romance. Bellatrix/Hermione

But for god sake, ignore the A/N!

4: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]]

Blind!Harry and quite possibly my favourite Harry/Hermione

5: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]]

The only fanfiction that was so heartwrenching that it provoked tears. Its probably the saddest fanfic out there and I love it for that.

6: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3973687/1/Crazy-Little-Things][Crazy Little Things]]

A very fluffy, very enjoyable Hermione/Luna romance. Good for a day of reading in the sun.

7: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls][Elizium for the Sleepless Souls]]

Well done, very lovecraftian horror.

8: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6740130/1/The-Rebel-and-The-Chosen][The Rebel and The Chosen]]

The best Harry / Tonks there is.

9: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2737363/1/Twists-of-Fate][Twists of Fate]]

My favourite Vampire!Harry story out there. Steers clear of a lot of the typical vampire fic cliches. Unfortunatly, its abandoned with no hope of ever being revived, it seems. One can only hope that some author picks up where this one left. I recommend reading it, anyway. Its just 70k words and therefore a nice afternoon read.

10: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8966727/1/Vengeance-from-the-grave][Vengeance from the Grave]]

Harry gets resurrected by the Department of Mystery and becomes a Wraith (of sorts). More a Lich, I think. Its a very nice read if you find the "true end" of the story yourself. Harry is quite overpowered in this, but it doesn't feel bad to read.

Also, for some reason the bot doesn't work when I link stuff with it. So, I'll use the old ways.

** linkffn(HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH) might qualify. A mad eldritch horror as much as a god. But six of one, half dozen of the other.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Source) has an overpowered Harry, at least when you're viewing it from a perspective of trying to get stuff done. Stylistically, he's /almost/ acceptable.

**** Yes it is a crossover, but I never read the other half and never had any trouble with it. I recommend reading at least two chapters to see if you like it because chapter one is mostly set up. I enjoyed it, but it's still set up.

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with
