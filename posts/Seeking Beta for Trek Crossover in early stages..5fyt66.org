I'm working on a Harry Potter/Star Trek crossover and looking for a Beta reader/someone to keep me on the right track.

The story is an OC-centric crossover, following a group of Ravenclaws as they go from their first glimpse of Hogwarts to space and beyond, entering the greater galaxy featured in the Star Trek world in the latter parts.

While the first parts would focus on the group as they pass through Hogwarts, the latter parts would take the characters into the galaxy of Star trek, so i'm hoping to find a beta who is familiar with both settings. Although i would settle for someone less familiar if they're good at calling me out on my */BS/* and fixing typos.


** I would like to. But the problem is that I know practically nothing about Star Trek. (Except for the three movies that came out)

** I am probably not the person you want as a beta, as my ability to do anything on a schedule is diminished by having a lot of little kids under foot, but I am crazy excited about the prospect of this story. Please be sure to post here when you start uploading this somewhere.
