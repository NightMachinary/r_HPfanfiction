Honestly, no clue how this works, but if the site's nominated wouldn't everything on the site be nominated?

** That's a great way to think, very optimistic. I think that if the site is nominated, then the people who build/run the site are nominated. So that's the Organization for Transformative Works I think.

*** Eh, congrats to everyone anyways. If no one wrote on the thing, it would be a moot point.

**** That's an excellent point! These sites wouldn't be anything without the writers. But I have a sneaking suspicion that this award is more about how ao3 serves as the final archive for a lot of older fansites. An increasing proportion of works on the site were imported from older sites that have now gone dark. They're doing great work preserving fandom history, tag soup complaints notwithstanding.

*** I'm so glad the people who worked to make AO3 a reality - and keep it one - are being recognized, especially with all the "how dare AO3 host fic I think is gross!" wank going around.
