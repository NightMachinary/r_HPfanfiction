Opposite of redo fic to prevent voldemort from winning.

​

Maybe Draco travels back to 1991, and works against the Golden Trio to keep them from thwarting voldemort.

​

Maybe Draco travels back to the 1940s to help Tom Riddle from the beginning to make his army strong. Helps make more subtle horcruxes and hide them better

​

Maybe Draco travels to marauder's era right before the critical point of the war. He tries to prevent the Order from gaining some game-changing recruits, and to help recruit Death Eaters.

​

Maybe along the way, Draco comes to the realization that it's better if Voldemort loses. And he hurries to undo his changes.

** Time travel back to Year 1 is usually something I can't stand to read because of all the do-over tropes that abound. However, I think a fic that has this sort of Draco do it could be fascinating if done well.

- Draco doesn't know all the events that were happening in the books (does he even really know about what happened with the Philosopher's Stone, for example), so he'd be working from very incomplete knowledge. This could be really interesting.

- An author could do a lot of interesting things with Dumbledore vs. Draco. The cliche of having Dumbledore plotting against a child (Harry) could really be turned on its head by having a good Dumbledore suspecting and eventually plotting against an ostensible child (Draco) as he comes to believe that there's much more to Malfoy than there seems to be. Get overprotective, political, evil, racist Daddy Malfoy in the mix, and things could become even more complex (in a good way, if well done). It would honestly be refreshing to see a do-over wherein poor Harry is still just a clueless kid and ancillary to the real action.

- Of course, one could eventually go the reformed!Draco path and have him gradually begin to care for Harry et al (especially if he discovers the Dursleys and all that), but I think this would be extraordinarily boring and predictable.

** The only problem I have with this idea is that, unless you want to completely break the scenario (not really the point in a do-over fic), you would need to have a MC a little incompetent.

In the books, Harry either barely win by chance or depending of the opinion, loose or just manage a draw :

- PS, CoS, OoP and DH : he "wins" but often barely survive and only thanks to external intervention (mother's love, Fawkes, Dumbledore) . . .\\
- PoA, GoF and HBP : he "looses" (Pettigrew escaped, Voldemort came back and Dumbledore died).\\
The problem is, in the books where Voldemort loose, a Victory would mean game over for Harry. And since the victory was already so close every time, you would either need to have an incredibly incompetent Draco (maybe in a crack fic) or completely change the scenario (maybe a double time travel fic where another good guy like Ron also came back in time and is plotting to stop Draco).
