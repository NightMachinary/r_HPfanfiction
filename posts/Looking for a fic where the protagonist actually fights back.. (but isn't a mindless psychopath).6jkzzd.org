Malfoy, Umbridge, Snape, Dursley, Smith, Mclagen...

There are so many annoying ppl who cross pretty much every line of decency and i would like to see a fic where harry or whoever doesn't accept this and actually responds with appropriate violent action.

I'm not really looking for a super dark/psychotic lead character, just a bit of ruthless pragmatism: you have a wand, a cloak of invisibility, a map that monitors the school, and the ability to communicate with and control serpents there should be some opportunities for creative problem solving..


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): I think Harrymort fought back with very appropriate measures:

It started small as I relearned the art of wandless magic. Forget to feed little Harry and Dudley's bottle explodes. Insult him and your tongue starts to swell up. Go ahead, lock him in a cupboard. He will always find his way out, and you will somehow find your way in.

Even misfortunes that could not possibly be my fault, such as Vernon's demotion at work, were attributed to my malice. I, of course, never argued against anything that made me seem more powerful.

The Dursleys eventually decided that they feared my dark presence more than Dumbledore's threats. They dropped me off at the orphanage, the firehouse, and deep in the wilderness. They even called Child Protective Services on themselves. Repeatedly. Yet I was always back by morning.

--------------

“Well, I'm Draco Malfoy and I was hoping to speak to you" -- he glanced disdainfully at the Weasley -- "Privately."

The Weasley bristled. I held out an arm. "Quiet, I know exactly how to handle this."

I smirked. "So, you wish to join me. Your foresight is commendable, and I assure you that -- should you choose to be my minion -- I shall allow you a sliver of my eventual glory."

Malfoy sputtered in indignation. "I'm a Malfoy. Malfoys are not minions."

--------------

“The class exploded into discussion, and I made sure to drag Hermione into the hallway before she finally exclaimed, "You don't seriously believe that Professor Snape is a werewolf?!"

"No, Hermione, that would be ridiculous," I said.

"Then why would you say something like that? People are absolutely awful about werewolves. Do you know what that kind of rumor could do to his reputation?"

"Yes, which is why I don't appreciate him trying to out Lupin.”

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

**** Seventh Horcrux, while being a humor fic, nevertheless fulfills his request quite well. Harry doesn't take anything in this story, and he fights back, if in a humorous way.

***** He was looking for "ruthless pragmatism", clearly he was not looking for a humor fic.... The Harrymort in this story is hardly ruthlessly pragmatic. Everything he does and thinks is a setup or punchline to a joke.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

** In the Dangerverse series, Harry refused to finish detention with Umbridge once he learned about the blood quill.

In that, Umbridge dragged him up to Dumbledore's office and demanded that Harry be expelled, but Harry used a secret passage out of the office to make his escape and wreak havoc throughout Hogwarts for the rest of that year.

Dumbledore, who didn't want to see his best hope against Voldemort becoming a wanted fugitive, then obliviated Umbridge and rearranged her mind so she left Harry alone.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
