After playing some Wolfenstein: The New Order, I'm in the mood for some wizard-Nazi takeovers! Drop your best recommendations for stories - preferably with Harry as the main character - where Grindelwald won the first war, or where he's alive and an important character or antagonist.

Preferably longer and complete stories please, bonus points for lots of awesome AU world-building! Of course, if you've got a shorter fic that really stands out to you, drop it in anyway and I'll give it a look. No other real objections for content except excessive smut, as I'm not really in the mood for that right now.

Thanks in advance!


** Darkness Visible by Plutoplex is not a Grindelwald-take-over fic, but it does feature Gellert and Snape as the two main protagonists working to take down both Voldy and Dumbledore. It also features lots of angst and a pretty well-developed theory of magic and magical lordships. linkffn(11625127)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12001201/1/Let-Perpetual-Light][Let Perpetual Light]]

Grindelwald's an important character in Let Perpetual Light, but Harry's not the main character and it's pre-Wizarding War (not an AU).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] Grindelwald's mentioned repeatedly in Reign of the Serpent and is still in power. Harry is one of the main characters and it does have a lot of fantastic AU world building. (incomplete)

** Seems highly unlikely you haven't read this story, since it's one of the best stories in the entire fandom, but linkffn(5150093)
