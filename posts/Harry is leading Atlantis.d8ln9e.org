:END:
So, searching for a fic where Harry is an emperor or something in Atlantis and multiple people want him back or dead so they go there to get him back (Death Eaters and the Order) so the break the wards of Atlantis (not Star Gate, I mean the lost continent) and portkey there. What I remember is Harry fighting with Dumbledore and one of his friends (Doge?)..I think Harry kills the friend and Dumbledore is enraged...at the same time Death Eaters try to infiltrate? The island....when I read it, the fiction ended with Harry being kidnapped. Please provide me with a link or name to the story....if nobody remembers, then just recommend good/great fics where Harry is an emperor/king....would like fewer grammatical errors in the story...


** Anyone?
