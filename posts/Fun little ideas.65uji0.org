We talk a lot about plot bunnies. This thread is for discussion of those ideas that are /less/ than plot bunnies: small ideas which could feasibly be inserted into many different fics. Ideas which are not dependent on the specific plot of a fic.

These ideas could be elements of world-building, character moments or interactions, jokes, etc.

So what are your small ideas, or for lack of a better phrase, "plot mice"?


** Here's one:

I was thinking recently about Mr Weasley's comment in PoA:

#+begin_quote
  "I don't care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we're no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands."
#+end_quote

It's a throw-away comment, but in fact it summarises neatly an important aspect of the wizarding economy: a lack of ability to automate magic means there's little room for mass production.

This ties in nicely with the likely small population of the wizarding world, and the relative simplicity of the wizarding economy as seen in Diagon Alley. Contrary to a lot of "rich Harry" fanfic, there isn't really any evidence of complex financial markets and nowhere near enough economic activity to allow there to be wizarding billionaires.

And so onto the "plot mouse": what about Nimbus? The brooms appear to be mass produced like Muggle goods, yet we know there aren't self-spelling wands. Essentially, each of those brooms has to be made by an individual wizard who has presumably been taught the Nimbus spells by the company.

And here's the thing: we know that there is a huge variation in magical ability between wizards, and that there can be huge variation even within a single spell. In GoF, when Harry first learnt the shield charm, it was flimsy and could barely stop a jinx. By DH it was deflecting powerful curses and covering large areas.

The logical conclusion to this is that different brooms within the same brand and model will have variations, given that they have been created by wizards of different skill, even though they are using the spells.

Now, Nimbus has a strong brand and reputation for quality, so they presumably make sure all their brooms meet a certain minimum standard/specification before putting them out for sale. But this does not exclude the possibility that some are still much better than others, depending on which employee enchanted them.

The "plot mouse" is therefore as follows: despite Nimbus' marketing stating all their brooms are equally good, it is generally known and understood that some are better than others. Within broom enthusiast circles, it is possible to identify via serial number or maker's mark the person who enchanted the broom in question, and certain makers have a reputation for producing brooms of higher quality. There is a small but enthusiastic market for acquiring top-level brooms, as well as collectors.

** Another one: the Malfoys are farmers.

We know from Pottermore that the Malfoy family came to England with William the Conqueror's invasion in 1066, and that they were rewarded with land for this.

Amusingly, this means that the Malfoy family very likely do have the right to the title "Lord", as in those times a gift of land and the granting of a noble title were essentially tied together. Ironically, however, the Malfoys are Muggle nobility - the title would not be magical in any sense, as it was granted by a Muggle monarch. Which might explain why by the time of canon they don't use it - it would be a rather nasty reminder of their past Muggle connections.

In any case, the Malfoys have a large amount of land, gifted to them by William the Conqueror. The Malfoys are also very rich.

Now, the magical economy seems to be pretty basic. Most shops seem to be independent sole traders. There are a few well-known brands and products, but not too many of them. The potential for wealth creation is limited by the small size of the market, given the low wizarding population. So where do the Malfoys get such fabulous wealth from, given that enterprise and trade have limited potential?

The answer to me seems obvious: the land that they have. Traditionally, the landed classes generated wealth from that very land in the form of agricultural activity. Which is to say: the Malfoys are farmers.

Indeed, depending on the size of the land, it might be that they are THE farmers. That is, their land might be large enough to constitute the food supply for all of wizarding Britain. Alternatively, they might use the land to breed magical creatures or grow magical plants.

*** More traditionally, the land owner has tenant farmers that do the actual farming for them. Maybe that's the source of the disagreement between the Malfoys and Weasleys? The Weasley used to be their tenant farmers, but we're kicked off and had to spend all their accrued money on buying the plot for the burrow.

*** Thats possible, but I would wager that most wizards simply keep small gardens, and then duplicate what they have.

** Last one for now:

I have always been curious about the date of the passing of the International Statute of Secrecy (the 'Statute') and the creation of the Ministry for Magic. It is well established by now that the two are linked - the obligations imposed by the Statute necessitated the creation of a larger and more organised bureaucracy - but the dates remain curious.

The Statute was signed in 1689 and came into force in 1692. The Ministry was founded in 1707.

For those of you who are not familiar with British history, these dates are significant for Muggle Britain also.

1688 was the year of the "Glorious Revolution" in which Parliament overthrew the monarch King James II for being too Catholic and too French. They instead installed the Protestants William of Orange and his wife, Mary II (also the daughter of James II) as joint monarchs. It was a moment which essentially established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown, the culmination of a process which had begun with the English Civil War (1642--1651) between Parliament and King Charles I, which Parliament won (chopping off Charles' head for good measure).

Similarly, 1707 was the year that the Kingdom of Great Britain was established following the Acts of Union in 1706 (English Parliament) and 1707 (Scottish Parliament), which unified England and Scotland.

It is curious to me that a period of great constitutional upheaval in the Muggle world is mirrored in the magical world, and I wonder if they were at all connected. We know of at least one connection from the following WOMBAT question:

#+begin_quote
  In your opinion, which of the following contributed MOST to the introduction of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692? Choose ONE.

  a. widespread persecution of wizarding children by Muggles

  b. escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to perform magic for Muggle ends

  c. escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to teach them magic

  d. increasing numbers of witch-burnings

  e. increasing numbers of Muggles being burned in mistake for witches

  f. failure of Ministry of Magic Delegation to Muggle King and Queen (William and Mary) begging for protection under Muggle law
#+end_quote

The phrasing of the question is convenient (since we were never provided with the answers to the test) because it means that all of the answers are true events, it's just that the question is asking you to identify the one which was most important.

So we know that prior to signing the Statute, British wizards attempted to have magic legally recognised in the Muggle world so that they could live in the open without hassle.

(But note also that the dates have since been revised, as the Ministry did not exist yet in 1692).

On to the "plot mouse", then:

The idea is that the English civil war spilled over into the magical world. That the conflict between Royalists and Parliamentarians, which might anachronistically and simplistically be described as a conflict between tradition and revolution, was mirrored by a conflct between the traditionalist Wizards Council which had ruled magical Britain for hundreds of years and a "progressive" faction which would eventually evolve into the Ministry of Magic. The Wizards Council would be essentially for the status quo of de facto separation but no formal divide between the two worlds, and may have in fact had ties to the Crown which gave them a vested interest in both no Statute and Royalist victory in the civil war. In comparison, the pro-Statute forces who wished to overpower the Wizards Council would thereby be natural allies with the Parliamentarians.

So the plot mouse is that the English civil war was the last combined Muggle and wizarding conflict in Britain. Both Royalists and Parliamentarians had direct and official magical aid, and the Parliamentarian victory was fundamental to the transition from the traditionalist Wizards Council to the modern and bureaucratic Ministry for Magic.

After that time the Statute prevented magical interference in Muggle conflicts, though breaches would of course occur.

Imagine if you could use some sort of Disullusionment charm on an arrow (or even a bullet) spelled to be very strong. You could use /wingardium leviosa/ to control its flight. You've basically got Yondu's weapon but even better as it's invisible (it needs to be invisible to prevent enemies from just vanishing it).

If you want to cast other spells while still using it, you could take a spider, put the Imperius curse on it, transfigure it into a bullet, disillusion it, spell it to be super strong, and voila! You've got an invisible super strong bullet that you can control with your mind while still casting ordinary battle spells. Would be very lethal if used properly, I think.

I don't know if this is super original (I think I saw something similar in HPMOR) but basically you could transfigure a wand into a tooth (or a strand of hair) and replace one of your actual teeth (or strands of hair) with it.

**** I have always liked the fanon notion that wandless magic isn't actually wandless, it is simply less precise than a wand. If we look at guns, the purpose of the barrel is to give it more room to accelerate, and add rifling for stabilization. And if we think about it, a wizards arm would work well as a magical focus. Made of wizard bone, with a core of marrow and blood, surrounded by yet more blood and muscle. The wand basically adds the rifling, because it extends the amount of focus used and allows nifty tricks like wand motions to help influence and direct the magic. Without a wand, you can't do wand motions, and your magic comes out sooner than you expected, but if you are quick enough, you can shape it with will before it escapes. This explains a lot about the Wizarding world. Canonically, we know that Quirrel, Harry, Dumbledore(probably), and Lupin(debatable) all can use wandless magic. It also explains how other creatures use magic. Dragons for instance have dragon heart strings as a way to channel magic through their body so they are durable and can fly, and the vocal cords could be how they create fire. Wandless magic, which is very crude, but extremely powerful. House Elves do a similar thing, but they snap their fingers, while moving their arm in a way to indicate what they want done. Thats why wands are so important, because they allow the magical being to make their magic much more complex.

Specifically the part where he discusses how the Dark Arts are like a many headed hydra, forever changing. The hydra comparison is obvious, cut off one head, and two more appear. This, to me, implies one great truth: all dark magic (jinxes, hexes and curses) that don't count as Dark Arts are merely former Dark Arts that have been countered, and then replaced by new Dark Arts.

For example: The Body-Bind Curse (incantation: /Petrificus Totalus/) was the preferred Dark Art of a serial killing dark wizard back in /whatever date/ who would use it to bury people alive and could only be countered by Mandrake Restorative Draught (incredibly rare due to the then difficulty in procuring wild mandrakes), however it's status as Dark Arts was ended due to the simultaneous advances in Herbology (figuring out how to farm mandrakes) and the development of a counter-curse.

** That small crime among wizards is virtually ignored.

From what I know, and I'm probably wrong, the Ministry of Magic was first set up specifically to enforce and regulate the Statute of Secrecy. This later evolved into the different departments, such as Law Enforcement. However, according to the wiki, Aurors are essentially muggle military used as a peace keeping force, while Hit Wizards are essentially SWAT teams used for capturing fugitive criminals. This means that anything smaller than that - such as fraud, theft, vandalism, illegal potion use, black market trading - is of lesser importance, and thus not attended to by either. Normally such things would be the responsibility of the police, but Wizarding Britain doesn't have police; they just have a peacetime military.

One would assume that another department would take up the slack in that regard, but according to the wiki, the only department that would deal with anything smaller than what could be considered a felony would be the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts office. And of course, that's the smallest and least staffed office in the entire ministry, not to mention it deals with muggles and not wizards. The Improper Use of Magic office only, or at least usually, deals with wizards in muggle areas, as presumably that's the only thing they can reliably detect.

The only crime that might intrude upon another department is the smuggling of magical animals, and presumably the Department of Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures would only bother chasing things of a potentially volatile nature, such as dragon eggs. (Way to almost bring down the long arm of the law, Hagrid.)

All of this, combined with how easily magic can be used for concealment and evasion, means that the effort:reward ratio of prosecuting small crime that doesn't break the Statute is simply nonexistent.

This might also explain the level of corruptibility in the Ministry of Magic. Should a criminal somehow be caught by a ministry employee, and if the crime was not of an urgent nature, a simple bribe would be far more attractive if the employee knew how much time and effort it would be for an ultimately thankless task. Aurors and Hitwizards would be especially susceptible to this, due to a feeling of superiority because of their specialized training, as well as other, more pressing matters.

This also offers an explanation for Nocturn Alley. All the shops are a front for the criminal arm of Wizarding Britain - the Rogue's Court, if you will.

** What if Colin had the courage to back Harry to the hilt in the immediate aftermath of that goF Halloween scene (ie: telling Ron that if Harry didn't enter, how could he have given Ron the chance to do it?)

Probably a few throwaway scenes, but it could involve a little bit of trust forming between Harry and Colin, if nothing else). Had a fic planned, but it's just been sitting in my brain for a while because I don't know Cormac McLaggen's characterization /that/ well.

Edit to clarify who I mean in the last sentence.

**** I can see the problem here.

What I mean to say is that I don't know how to handle Cormac McLaggen reacting to what Colin Creevey is doing (given how McLaggen reacts to the DA at first, and how he reacts to losing to Ron in Quidditch tryouts in HBP). This situation is somewhat different, as I see McLaggen siding with Ron here, which could lead to fighting in the dorm between Colin and Cormac.

I'll go ahead and edit my OP to clarify.

** My big thing right now is getting better at writing imperfect characters that don't automatically make you hate them. It's hard to write characters with flaws because they immediately either get dumped in the villain box or they seem overly unsympathetic and turn people off of the story itself.

Also, I'm interested in other sapient magical creatures and how they are forced to survive not only on the fringes of magical society where they are ostensibly acknowledged as existing, but the fact that muggles are EVERYWHERE and tech is practically better than magic nowadays and so how the hell are centaurs not part of society? How the hell have dragons not been discovered on satellites?

And, if magical sapient creatures were discovered, how would muggle society react and behave? Would this create a crisis in the magical world as well, especially if goblins and centaurs were given more rights and options in muggle society?

*** The whole "sapient creatures break out into the Muggle world, wizards freak out" idea is gold. It's actually a full plot-bunny, I think, not a mere plot mouse. Maybe the Goblins could peruse wizarding law and find that the wording of, say, the German law against breaking the Statute of Secrecy is worded in such a way that it covers wizards and squibs, but not Creatures. They proceed to officially shift all Goblins' nationalities to the German Goblin Nation, and then start flowing into the Muggle world /en masse/, taking Centaurs and Co. with them.

** It's pretty clear that the Wizarding World is very into read and consumes a lot of reading material of different types (books, periodicals, etc).

I've been thinking about how The Quibbler (which by the way I like to think that Luna calmed her "looneyness" down after the war) becomes a more arts and literature focused periodical.

Along these lines, we could see how Rolf + Luna and Neville contribute to their respective research journals (remember Transfiguration Today?). I read a fic or two mentioning this concept and I think it would be a nice touch somewhere.

I also think about how in the USA we have a man called Bill Simmons, who is a famous sports columnist who went on to found a few famous sports and culture journalism websites as well as write a few famous sports books about basketball and other things. I want to see Ginny have this type of authority, with her writing doing very well, and having a developing fanbase and power in the journalism world.

I especially want to see her switch newspapers because of how the Daily Prophet continually pushes trash journo over her sports reporting team, and how she bolsters the rival paper because of her very public switch.

** One thing I don't think I've ever seen is something I'd like to call "character-insert". Basically a self-insert, except you insert a character from a different franchise instead of yourself.

Most crossovers I see have the two franchises exist in the same world, for example a Bleach/HP crossover where Ichigo is sent to bodyguard Harry and kill Voldie because Soul Society owes a favor to their British equivalent. My point being that for the purpose of that story, Hogwarts and Soul Society exist in the same universe, but what I'm thinking of is something more like a "Ichigo wakes up in magical Britain and Soul Society doesn't exist here" type of setting.
