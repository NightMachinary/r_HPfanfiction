Comparing to HBP moody and Grown up Snape or even flitwick and McGonagall, how strong do you think he was, when he graduated? In a fair fight, could Tom defeat one of them? Two of them? All four of them?


** Dumbledore described a young Tom Riddle as "probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen." If Riddle was that good as a student, even better than a young Dumbledore, who reportedly "did things with a wand I've never seen before" during his NEWTs according to Griselda Marshbanks, I think a young Tom Riddle could beat any of them 1 on 1, but maybe not 4 on 1.

*** Same. I think he could maybe take on two, but more than that and he'd struggle.

** I remember reading that he fought against McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn at the same time. They were described as

  they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him --
#+end_quote

And when Bellatrix died, Voldemort got furious, blasted the three of them away, and turned to Molly.

#+begin_quote
  he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn blasted backwards, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.
#+end_quote

Granted, he had the Elder Wand with him but there's also the argument that the Elder Wand wasn't at its strongest since Voldemort wasn't its true master.

*** I meant a 7th year Tom riddle, as I said in the post "when he graduated"

**** Oh, that's my bad. I missed that. I'll reread it. So, HBP Moody, adult Snape, Flitwick, or McGonagall vs just-graduated Riddle. I think he could handle one on one but he'd have some trouble with two or more because I don't think he'd have the immense power he had at the height of the wars.
