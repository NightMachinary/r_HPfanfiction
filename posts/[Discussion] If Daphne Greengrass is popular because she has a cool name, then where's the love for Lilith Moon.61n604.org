** I think the main reason why Daphne Greengrass is popular is because shes the future sister in law of Malfoy and shes the only named Sytherin pure-blood girl besides Pansy Parkinson and Astoria Greengrass. Writers also seem to avoid using characters whose house we dont know as their main character.

Pottermore says that she was supposed to be a dreamy girl and the first intimation of Luna Lovegood. Rowling said that she named her before she named Harrys Mother

****** In fanon, she's frequently an ice queen, yes. If you wanted to write a different sort of character, you might as well use somebody else. It's not all that different from wanting to write a bookworm and using Hermoine.

Besides, it also gives a certain expectation to readers. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It lets people know what to look for, /and/ it gives skilled writers expectations to subvert.

As for why, I imagine it's a combination of the ice queen archetype being fairly popular, both for the obvious character appeal and the ease by which it adds layers of complexity to the character (it's almost in the name itself). There's also the aspect of taking the house system too seriously (also a problem in canon), so the writer may want one of the few intersections between hardcore Slytherin personalities and likeable characters.

The way I see it, it's like getting upset at the self-sacrificing and short-sighted hero. You get to that personality in a main character through a similar process.

Of course, if people want to write Daphne as an ice queen, I don't really see a problem with that. If a lot of people want to, it's still not a problem. It's not as if there's a council of fanfiction that determines what gets written. If it bothers you /that/ much, there's nothing really stopping you from writing Daphne some other way.

** There were some good reasons named here, but I think the main is that she is a Slytherin, female, not ugly and not bad.

About all the other female Slytherins we know either nothing or something 'bad':

- Pansy is an asshole
- Milicent is ugly
- Tracy is never mentioned in the books, and isn't a pureblood

Since you can't redeem Pansy (that only works with male characters, right?), can't have Harry date an /ugly/ person, and Tracy isn't pureblood and not mentioned in the books by elemination the only hot, eligible Slytherin is... Daphne Greengrass!

We don't know Lily's house, so she isn't really a factor.
