The first, the major concepts I can remember is that Dumbledore thinks Harry has been taken over by the Horcrux in his scar, and after he dies Hermione and Ron flee to America to form a resistance against Harry, guided by Dumbledore's headmaster portrait. Harry imperiuses the queen of England into believing he is part of the royal family, and becomes the first magical king of England, and a war with the muggles results.

The second, Harry is working for Voldemort and is a puppet politician, who is told to overthrow the government and becomes a monarch, but then Voldemort doesn't like how popular Harry is and forces him to abdicate, and a resistance forms to put Harry back on the throne.


** The first one is Rise of the Wizards.

I think that the second one is Harry Potter and the Dark's rise but I don't think that Harry was king of England.

*** Thank you, both are correct. <3

Skimming the second one, it looks like Harry becomes Emperor in the second one, so it was close but I got the monarch term wrong.
