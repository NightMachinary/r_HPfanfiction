Rating of T if you can, I can a deal with a little romance but preferably no excessive smut, and preferably no SS/HG or any similar pairing

Snape-centric; preferably written after the release of the 7th book and fairly canon compliant, but minor discrepancies are fine and I'll even take AU if it's got enough of my beloved "hurt!Snape". Post-war Alive!Snape is also welcome. Anything where Snape is dealing with pain, mainly physical but also mental/emotional: tortured at a death eater meeting, injured spying for the order, nightmares, self-harming, suicidal etc. Fics where he's healed/helped by another character, especially Pomfrey, McGonagall, Dumbledore, or Lupin among others are also welcome. Fics where he's struggling through an order meeting taking place just after a death eater meeting. Fics where he's suffering after the war.

-TL;DR: just give me any "Snape is tortured by Voldemort, nightmares and Cruciatus after-effects, and maybe he needs some help; beware of angst" really, I've been reading every one I can find

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

**** Here you go, then. Most of these are quite short compared to some of the epic fic out there.

[[https://florahart.livejournal.com/547553.html][A Matter of Intent]] by florahart Snape destroys a horcrux; Harry helps him through the last hours of it

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/93342][Blood and Fire]] by cluegirl People keep trying to kill Snape, but Harry's ownership mark keeps saving him against his will

[[https://snarry-games.livejournal.com/22043.html][Always Hungry]] by melora98 Snape saves Harry at terrible cost to himself

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/483526][Black Story]] by Jay Tryfanstone Snape crawls to postwar Hogwarts after escaping torture and imprisonment (ignore the weird summary; it belongs to different fic)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/997569a][Standing on the Shoreline]] by tofsla Depressed cross-dressing Snape

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/998343/chapters/1976252][Disinherited]] by emilywaters1976 Snape traumatized into depression after being kept in Azkaban and tortured

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1058100/chapters/2119774][Walking the Monochrome]] by emilywaters1976 Snape raped and tortured until he becomes an unresponsive shell of himself. This is the Snape/Black fic.

One more Snarry, a long series that's not and may never be finished. It contains a lot of self-loathing and suffering and mental deterioration, but it's also got tons of plot and humor, scattered throughout with sexual interludes. I love it, but it's not for everyone. The tone starts out pretty light - Harry accidentally turns himself into a cat and is adopted by an oblivious Snape - and it just keeps getting darker from there. Alternating first-person POV.

Snape getting hurt and healing in more than 800 000 words. It is a good story with an active sequel. It meets almost all of your criteria. However it was written before all of canon was released and therefore Snape's background is somewhat different. Massive warning for sexual child abuse and many other horrible things.
