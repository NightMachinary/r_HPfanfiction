I'd have Sirius live and help the kids out during the Horcrux mission. That was a really missed opportunity. Especially given the fact that Sirius would be able to help the kids hide better, seeing that he was on the run.


** Tonks would have been brilliant in the Gringotts break in. No need for Polyjuice Potion. And it helps that she's actually Bellatrix's niece.

*** But you'd have to remove Teddy because I doubt that Harry would ever accept to allow her to abandon her newborn baby and risk her life for him.

**** I mean letting a male kid tell adult women what to do is shitty. Mothers are some of the most resourceful people on the planet. She's been an auror for long enough not to be stupid about it, and as a mother who wants to get home to her kid would probably be less likely to take risks than anyone else, so I think she's a great candidate.

Harry would hate it because of his mother giving up his life for him but it's war, man. Tonks would be pretty bloody upset about the kids going in there themselves, I bet.

****** ha ha you have a point. I hate the way she wrote that whole arc though

I don't really compare Tonks and Lily but trauma makes people very irrational so that's why I think Harry would be sensitive to that more than cognitively say ‘this is why you shouldn't do things'

***** That's true, but it's still a mission that only Harry (and the trio and Griphook) had information on and I think that, going by his judgment, he'd be wiser than to inform her.

On the other hand, Tonks might have been fighting for the right thing but, unlike Harry, Teddy was not in immediate danger (even assuming that the Order failed and Voldemort ruled forever, as half-bloods they were not yet targeted) so you cannot compare her to Lily. So I can't help but wonder if it would have been better if she stayed at home and not deprive her child of a mother's love instead of going in a battle that had no chance of winning outcome for the good guys until Harry went for his sacrifice. I mean Voldemort pretty much destroys the Hogwarts resistance which consisted of the Weasleys and the few remaining members of the Order (the Lupins, Kingsley, Aberforth), the teachers and the seventh years from three houses and some of the sixth years and then some ex-DA members. At the very most they could have been a hundred and Harry counts 50 bodies in the Tale of the Prince chapter. The tides are only turned when Charlie and Slughorn return with reinforcements and Voldemort is incapacitated to hurt people because of Harry's sacrifice.

****** Oh yeah I think that doing the whole guilt Remus thing and then going and sending both parents to the end fight was ridiculous Lez to be honest I'm pretty much not happy with the way Tonks and Remus were written at all so I tend to wilfully change things where they're concerned. She created so many awesome characters and then pissed them away in very strange ways to me

******** yeah such a flagrant waste of awesomeness. And just...I feel like as the daughter of a woman who was as much or more of a rebel than Sirius Black like...so much potential, but instead like ‘she can do a pig's nose and she's a cop. Boo hoo she's sad about a boy now she's dead'

********* I would..agree with her not going to not endanger teddy. But. This is also the mother who went to war rather then not. The last book had a lot of scenes like that. People dying without fanfare. Mad eye.remus tonks ect...realistic I guess but..bad writing for resolutions. I feel. Maybe if she had gone to that mission she would have been less willing to go to the final battle. Who knows.

***** If you want to keep everything canon before that point, Ted would be dead. And I am not talking about Tonks's decision per se. I mean she and her husband abandoned their child in the care of the grandmother to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. But unlike that, the Gringotts heist was something that Harry called the shots on and judging from his earlier talk with Lupin in the book, he would have never accepted Tonks as a new mother to join him in his mission.

****** Ah, thank you. I couldn't remember when exactly Ted had died.

Mhm... Maybe use Andromeda then? Andromeda is Bellatrix' sister after all. That could work, they wouldn't need to break into the vault.

** ---I want to write a fic where Remus actually does go on the horcrux hunt because I feel like an adult along would be super helpful and the werewolf method of them being magic-proof could theoretically, at least in this story help stave off the horcrux effects enough to make the complications of a werewolf on a long term mission worth it.

I think having an adult along especially one who is used to living with very little on the outskirts of society would be very different than three kids with less experience in such things off by themselves.

---I also think that more mission-focussed order stories would be great. Because of Harry's limited POV in the stories we only see them at their decrepit clubhouse but I feel like the characters themselves are pretty awesome so seeing more of that would've been cool

I feel like a horcrux hunt with Sirius, Remus, Bill and Fleur would be fucking great. They're all smart, quick thinking and good at magic. One of them grew up in a dark family and has resources, another is a dark creature and the other two are gulping, fit cursebreakers. What was Dumbledore thinking letting horcruxes sit around when he had access to people like that?

---Also a Tonks and Kingsley buddy cop story would be so much fun!

*** Kingsley and Tonks buddy cop story, yes! I want more stories in general with Kingsley, Tonks and/or Moody as Aurors.

With Remus, it's tricky, because he has a wife and newborn baby. Harry yelled at him because Remus left his family, Harry wouldn't want Remus to come with them, because he'd want Remus to be with his family.

**** Yeah, I mean first off I don't ship Tonks and Remus, but if I had them as a pairing I would also have them leading from James and Lily's mistake and pregnant Tonks takes her mum and dad and gets the fuck out of the country while Remus stays to try and help end the situation ASAP . I'm pretty sure Tonks and Remus are both action oriented people and point of find being out of the fight incredibly hard, so I figure Tonks to texting her parents and the baby, and Remus protecting the kids is a good action plan for them

***** Sirius would totally work, if he had lived. So irritated at Rowling for killing him off. He would have been perfect to help Harry, Ron and Hermione out. Especially if he had gotten a trial after the DOM battle.

Harry didn't want Remus and Tonks to fight because they had a kid, so I can see Harry not wanting either one to join.

Using Andromeda would be interesting.

****** I mean as I said Remus and Tonks are not a plausible ship to me. They're both flagrantly gay in my book, so they aren't procreating together and are a lot freer in any story I'm going to write. I just don't see Teddy happening, except though maybe a one night stand, because seeking out sex in times like that makes a lot of sense.

But honestly their arc reads like Rowling heard queer people going on about these gay characters and said ‘we can't have that. Better kill Sirius off and make the other two have a baby together!'
