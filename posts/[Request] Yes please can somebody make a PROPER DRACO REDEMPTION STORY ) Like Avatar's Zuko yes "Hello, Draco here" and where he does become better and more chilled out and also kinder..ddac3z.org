Yes please see the title, I do want to see an actual Draco redemption that is not just instant and stupid and also yes where he actually changes to be better and nicer! :) :) :) :)


** I think a great idea for a Draco redemption story would start maybe beginning of 5th year and tell the story from his point of view. You could grow him as a character while remaining mostly canon compliant. Jkr tried to redeem him a bit in books 6/7 but it feels really flat because we have no idea what he's thinking so he comes across as a bit slimy imo.

Kinda similar to what was done in linkao3(a life of smoke and silvered glass) for snape

*** Draco meets umbridge, realizes that's what he may have to side with it and decides nothing is worth that cost. Bides his time pretending to work with her until he sees his window of opportunity, and throws her out that window, goes out with a bang in slytherin, hides out between the forest and hidden places in the castle, befriends Hagrid cause Harris's a sweetheart and realizes exactly what Draco did and helps him when he can. And eventually Draco debases himself to get into Harry's good books.

*** I am just in the process of writing the Petunia's redemption (or even a bit religious conversion) story, and it could very well start after the war, with Draco finding he screwed up everything and he looks his way back. It could be interesting, but I have never seen any (yes, I am aggressively not into Dramione and Drarry, so I could miss the good ones, even if they are there).

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

Summary:

Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.

Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
