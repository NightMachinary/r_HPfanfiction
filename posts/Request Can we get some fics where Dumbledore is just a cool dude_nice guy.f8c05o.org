***** I've criticised it before, but I think it's not the best read because it's really a tease. It's slice of life, except in the background there's very real stakes that should be resolved in a cool way, which would have to get Harry&Co involved, except the professors are always the ones resolving them. It takes something that should be exciting, and ruins it. The non-mundane excitement is too much for a story to merely slice of life; the scope of the story is too big. I like their Pokémon fics, the ones about Ash being a Pokémon do this slice of life with fantasy and saving the world much better.

***** True, bit it's a very well written 'nothing happening'. I think of it as the fanfic equivalent of 'slow TV', if you have ever seen this. (It's like where they film people on a boat or a bus meandering through the countryside for two hours and then screen it in real time. I think it's meant to be restful).

** In Gryffindors Never Die Dumbledore has his serious moments, but is over all a pretty chill down to earth dude.

In the dangerverseseries by whydoyouneedtoknow Dumbledore plays an important role and has a grandfatherish role at points. Be warned though, the series is an epic over a million words, not even counting its au spin offs (yes, the au has aus) but it's a great one for a road trip or a vacation. The write was just starting out in the first one, so quality is a bit touch and go, but it steadily increases over the course of the series.

** I don't like bashing of any kind, it always shows incompetency of the author, but even I have to admit that some of his actions just don't add up. Having said that linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) tries hard to explain his actions, and I really like his version in linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence) (chapter 8; I have serious reservations about other parts of the story).

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** This fic, time traveling James II pretending to be a staff member in the marauders era, genuinely has one of my favourite Dumbledores (The Once and Future Headmaster's young Dumbledore is my second favourite). It also handles his sexuality really well without giving him a love interest.

  Twenty one year old James Sirius Potter never expected to go back in time to the seventh year of the Marauders. And he certainly never expected to fall in love there. But James doesn't belong, and the fate of Sirius Black has already been written.
