It's the kind that has all the characters read the books. This one takes place in the Great Hall in Hogwarts, Umbridge is there, an so is Remus and a disguised Sirius. Each person takes turns reading, at some point Sirius gets discovered but has his innocence proved via Veritaserum. I think it's incomplete but it ended when Harry was somehow starting to feel what his book version was feeling as they kept reading. Please help! I wasn't on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] or AO3


** Dunno if it has the Sirius elements you mention, but one possibility is A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel. linkffn(12324284)
