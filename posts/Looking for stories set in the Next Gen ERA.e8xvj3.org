I'd love to read about the next gen era in some way, note I don't count Curse Child as canon, myself. Though if there are some things like houses, in there, that's fine.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash

If it's an AU: No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione please

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.


** [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987&showRestricted]] It's a Rose/Scorpius fic. I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for but I loved it.

It also has a sequel called Still Delicate, which I also recommend
