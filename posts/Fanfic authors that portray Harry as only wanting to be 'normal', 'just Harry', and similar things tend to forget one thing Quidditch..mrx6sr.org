Now, while it's true that Harry very clearly hates the attention he gets for being 'The Boy Who Lived', I'd argue that that's entirely justified. Every time he gets called that, it's just another reminder that his parents were murdered when he was an infant, and he was left to grow up with shitty relatives. But consider his behaviour whenever he cements a victory for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team by catching the Snitch. He practically revels in the attention there, and I would argue that it's because he worked for that victory. It was something that he consciously, and willingly, took part in; and he sees it as a culmination of all the effort he put into training for it.


** Agreed. A lot of people wonder about Harry's Slytherin qualities and how the Hat could've considered putting him there---- I always thought it was fairly clear that he has a very deep desire to prove himself. He might not like the consequences of fame, and is uncomfortable with being the Boy-Who-Lived, but he's definitely ambitious when it comes to things he's passionate about, like Quidditch.

Really? I admit it's been a long time since I've read the books, but I don't remember seeing this at all. Wasn't he just about average at literally everything, with the sole exception of flying and defence? And wasn't his success with both of those things largely attributed to his natural aptitude? I don't know how much fanon has crept in, so feel free to correct me.

I don't know if you can really say he's ambitious or passionate there, not when he was almost press-ganged onto the house team after that first lesson.

Obviously he grew to enjoy it and of course everyone wants to win at the games they play, but I doubt whether a natural desire to win at games is equivalent to the definition of ambition most people have. Certainly, if I enjoy playing CS:GO or Chess I would like to win my matches, but that's not really the same thing. If I wanted to be pro, if I practiced extra, if a significant portion of my life was devoted to becoming a Chess grandmaster, then yes that would be ambitious, but I don't remember reading anything even approaching that dedication in canon.

**** Harry was solidly above average at everything when he wasn't distracted by Voldemort or other such things. He maintained a solid EE average on his owls despite his distractions, and was a damn fine wizard in his own right.

He is good at defence, but that is a combination of different magic schools. The reason he excelled there rather than the other classes is because he focused on the direct combat applications of most things rather than academic or other practical uses.

Hell, the Patronus is a charm, and Harry's ridiculously prodigious mastery of that spell is one of his defining traits for many.

THANK YOU!

I never got that mind set that Harry was an 'average' student.\\
His grades are all quite good and that is DESPITE the constant distractions to his academics that takes place during the story, like Voldemort, dementors, Triwizard tournament, and useless teachers (most Defense-teachers, Snape, Trelawney, and so forth)

Literally, the only exams he failed at was Divination and History.\\
Divination is a given, considering the teacher is actively sabotaging his class by singling him out and predicting his deaths constantly. Anyone would hate such a class.\\
In History, he literally passed out due to a fake vision from Voldemort. That is a valid excuse for a bad grade, and that is not even mentioning the fact the teacher in history is the worst.

In Astronomy, he received acceptable, despite being distracted with Hagrid getting attacked by Umbridge and McGonagall getting send to the hospital by several stunners.

Everything else? EE or above. Even potions, which has a teacher that actively hates Harry and sabotages his education.

That reminds me, I have another pet peeve: fics where Harry deliberately and consciously downplays his intelligence because of his upbringing at the Dursleys. That's not quite how it would go realistically. If anything, it would be on a subconscious level, and more in the vein of basically becoming something of a slacker, coasting through school doing the bare minimum to get a passing grade because "why bother?".

Between the distractions and the fact that we really don't see him trying too hard, I honestly think he could have been competition for Hermione in academics if he'd had normal time and more gumption.

Hermione is bright, but she's bright due to work, she works hard. She's not some sort of super-genius, regardless of how fanon treats her.

Harry had to deal with constant distractions and issues from his growing up - kids in abusive and neglectful homes often do badly in academics due to various psychological factors. Ron, even if he wasn't NEARLY as bad as fanon makes him, didn't help as he was pretty lazy and sometimes got Harry to slack even more. See "Divination is an easy class, just take that." Though Percy didn't help, am I getting fanon confused or did he suggest Harry take Divination and Muggle Studies?

We never see them do any advisement on which classes students should take, and every adult should know one can't trust a 13-year-old to keep long-term goals in mind.\\

***** Eh, IDK. The thing with 'average' in Harry Potter/Hogwarts seems to mostly be 'bad teachers with non-driven students', which doesn't seem to have particularly stellar results. Harry doesn't really stand out - I think when people say that he's average, that's what they mean (whereas he's certainly above average if we're counting those like Crabbe and Goyle in there).

I don't think any of Harry's magic is particularly extraordinary - like you mention, his success in defense mostly comes down to him having practiced that much more extensively than the other ones, and being fairly driven in the subject - but from the DA, I think we can see that (if they are also focused) other students were also all 'above average' in the same way.

I guess in the end I'd say Harry was above average, but not extraordinary - with his more unusual feats being less due to him being special, and more that most students in Hogwarts (from what I can see) would have been able to do something similar if in his situation and driven. Rather than, as some take it, a sign of Harry being incredibly powerful and the next super genius magic user like Voldemort or Dumbledore.

One thing I will say though, is that I always hear how difficult the patronus is, yet why exactly is that? By the description, it should be fairly straightforward, and I've actually seen some fanon that challenges that canon lore or subverts it by having him teach it to a bunch of other people... In which case, him casting it at such a comparatively young age is less attributed to any innate difficulty or talent, and more to do with the fact that nobody bothers to teach it to anyone else.

Like so many other elements in the book, the supposed "difficulty" of the patronus honestly seems to be one of those things Rowling shoved in for the sole purpose of giving him some easy street cred.

******* I don't think you're grasping my the criticism I made; to clarify, my issue with it is not whether it is /said/ to be difficult or not, it's that there is nothing to back this up. It is just constantly repeated that this is something difficult, yet it's not explained why it's difficult, or why he's better. He just is.

Which really tied back into my parent comment, where my main point is that all of these things rely on Harry having some innate talent.

Take for example karate, or coding. I understand why both of these are difficult, I can understand why someone may fail at either one of them. Certainly, both require a certain innate aptitude to achieve notable success; e.g, good physique and reflexes for karate, good critical and lateral thinking for coding. Both require large amounts of time and practice.

With either one of those, if someone is "really good at karate", or "really good at C++", this is something I can understand and respect. If someone is a prodigious master of martial arts, that's fucking impressive, and I can imagine the rigors they must have went through to achieve such a level of mastery.

Yet what the fuck does it even mean to have a "prodigious mastery" of the patronus? Obviously this is a fictional world, but within that fictional framework, why the hell is he better than Hermione? He practiced a couple times with Lupin, and then at the lake he had a dues ex machina moment where it "clicked" for him and he was able to cast it in the most dire of situations... And wala, henceforth, he is the youngest guy to do it, a prodigious master, yada yada. It's ridiculous.

******** From what we see, the Patronus is complicated magic because it requires more from the user.

Most magic comes down to intent, mastery of the technique of the spell and perhaps stamina, though that is rather murky.

The Patronus requires immense strength of Will, enough to summon and maintain your most positive memory while being surrouded by soul sucking demons that actively induce depression and bring forth your worst memories, requires just as much mastery of the technique as any other spell, and also seems to have a similar component of stamina.

Hermione was bad at it, because she's terrible under pressure and never came close to the willpower Harry learned from his time with the Dursley's and early Hogwarts. She also never practiced nearly as much as Harry did, didn't have the same motivating factor to learn that he did etc etc.

It's not so difficult to learn. Harry teaches it to the DA in a few sessions. Albeit after they've been learning advanced DADA magic for a while.

But it's a monster to put into practice because most people just don't have the kind of live fire mentality required to do every step of the Patronus at once against a Dementor.

Hell, even Harry at 13 learns it relatively quickly, and summoned a Corporeal when he thought Malfoy was a Dementor, but Lupin outright tells him casting the Patronus in the presence of a Dementor and out is as different as night and day, which the end of Azkaban proves.

That's a LOT of conjecture, which you kind of did elsewhere as well. I don't know if I agree that this vaguely defined "willpower" is the big difference, or that it's the primary reason for difficulty. I also don't know if I completely agree with all the rest, either... I could and would argue that being a top student and building successful habits requires and builds much more discipline and willpower than being vaguely disliked and put down by your family, if anything that would decrease this nebulous idea of "willpower"

We can agree that it's more difficult in a real world scenario, but I'll get into why the 3rd year thing wasn't nearly as impressive or relevant.

Yeah, you could say that all spells follow a similar framework and aren't explained, but what in particular makes this one different from a first year one? Why does Hermione struggle with it? This should be explained, regardless of the system of magic.

**** I think it's really that he just wasn't motivated. The Patronus is one of the hardest things to do for both DADA and Charms, and he did it perfectly at 13. And Harry's definitely not the only one who's had his parents die for him and went through a neglectful home environment as a result, and he's also not the only one with willpower, so I think it's safe to say that is an adequate proof that he has a good amount of underlying power and capability. Most adult wizards can't do shield charms, but he did that too, and even taught others (including those older than him, literal seventh years) to do it too. He might favor Expelliarmus, but it's shown repeatedly that his are strong enough to knock people out even when he's literally barely a teenager. He managed Sectumsempra and Levicorpus/Liberacorpus (no verbally at that) the first try.

Even in potions, Harry, while not being a prodigy like Snape who can /invent/ spells and potions before he even hits the 20s, is proven to be more than competent when it suits him, like when he feels sympathy for Snape after finding out his dad bullied him and then successfully makes the Invigoration draught, and even manages an EE on the OWL.

Keep in mind that the books are from Harry's perspective, so what sounds easy in his mind may very well not be.

As for Quidditch--- I mean, first of all, ambition doesn't necessarily mean hard work. You can aspire to great things without having the will to work for it. Second, Harry's life is the most hectic thing possible for a wizard, so I doubt he ever had the time or energy to train for professional Quidditch (though he certainly has enough to study more). There's a scene in GOF where Harry fantasizes about a crowd roaring his name like they do for Krum at the World Cup. I thought that showed there was a part of Harry that wanted to be the best at something, and to have people admire him for it even, as long as it didn't have to do with what his mother did to get rid of Voldemort. Doesn't mean he actively pursued it like Oliver Wood, but he /wanted/ to, and I think that's the point of it.

***** Don't get me started on the Patronus.

It's a prime example of Rowling changing courses midstream.

It's introduced in book three as this uber-hard charm, and Harry is amazing in that he can even produce mist.

Later on, he teaches it to fifth years when allegedly even most adults can't cast it.

You can tell Rowling was shifting from a "Harry is a powerful, talented wizard with self-esteem and laziness issues." to "Harry is an everyman who is lucky." which is what we got especially in book seven. Half the plot is done by Harry being lucky.

The reason he enjoys the attention when he wins at Quidditch might just be that the people cheering for him at that point are his own House - his family-of-choice, as it were. Every time he wins a Quidditch match and stays conscious to enjoy it, the people whose cheering he focuses on to the point where he tunes everyone else out? His besties, Ron and Hermione.

If he were playing Professional Quidditch, sure he'd enjoy the simple thrills of flying fast and winning - but he might basically just tune out the cheering fans if he had any.

Harry reacted strongly /against/ the DA. He only came to see its usefulness as preparation against Voldemort. His enjoyment in it came from seeing the DA's accomplishments, not their adulation for him.

His choice of career as an Auror is unquestionably shaped by who he has been all through the books rather than fame or money, neither of which he wants. To which I will add that all his adventures starting from dealing with the troll and the Stone, starts with "something has to be done and I'll do it".

Half the subplots of GOF was Harry dealing with /not/ wanting to be in the Triwizard Tournament. To the point of arguing with Ron, remember?

Lastly, Harry's reaction whenever he's unable to play Quidditch is always "damn they have no Seeker". He thinks in terms of what the team needs, not "what about me", going all the way back to him flying for the first time because he took back Nev's Remembrall from Malfoy... and that's also the core difference between Draco and Harry.

He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen...he had become Hogwarts champion...he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming...he had just won the Triwizard Tournament... Cho's face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration...Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad Ron couldn't see what he could."

"'Speak for yourself,' said George, 'You'll try and get in, won't you, Harry?'

Harry absolutely does want to just live a normal life. The one forgetting something is you, which is that there's a difference between the kind of fame you get from doing something in a school club and the kind of fame you get when people won't stop staring at a scar on your head and bringing up how your parents died.

Besides, if I wanted to, I could argue that he's not even seeking fame by playing Quidditch: he's playing it because it is something he genuinely loves to do. Harry would play Quidditch even if nobody watched the games and the sport was largely ignored by society. He's not playing it to be famous or to be seen, and if you think he is then you've grossly misunderstood Harry's love of flying and speed.

"Just Harry" is often used in "Friend of Goblins" fics, often with fix-everything-Gringotts.

There are fics where I want to scream "Shut up!" when he starts to "just Harry". It's freaking /everyone/. And when he starts with Dobby or Winky I feel like it's outright harassment. They're not human, stop making them uncomfortable. Call me Harry and eat at my table. No, Harry, no.

Another thing: This makes Harry single-minded and inflexible. /2-dimensional/. Maybe there are advantages to treating people differently, judging every situation separately. No, not maybe.
