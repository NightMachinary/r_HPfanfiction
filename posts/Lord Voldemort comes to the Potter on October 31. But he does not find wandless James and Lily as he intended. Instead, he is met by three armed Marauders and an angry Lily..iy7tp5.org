** Voldemort broke past the wards and cackled in delight.

"And now power will be mine! Mine, do you hear! Nothing will stand in my way!"

James stood at the doorway, his fresh cup of tea forgotten. His eyes narrowed and the Potter family magic surged up within him. The hazel-brown eyes sparked as his eyebrow furrowed and he shouted.

"Lily! /It's him!/ Take Harry and run the plan!"

Voldemort /tsked./

"Really? Just you? Honestly?"

James didn't lower his wand.

"No. Not just me."

On either side of the Potter patriarch, wands slammed forward. A cypress wand with a unicorn hair and an African blackwood with a veela hair. Voldemort's eyebrow slowly rose. What was this?

Remus Lupin stood to the left of James Potter, Sirius Black to the right. James didn't look to either side, but he knew that if he had he would have seen either amber eyes or bared teeth.

"How theatrical, indeed," Voldemort sneered. "And I suppose next you'll surround me and blast me. Seriously?"

Sirius smirked.

"Well, that would be me."

James huffed at the other man.

"Padfoot. Now's not the time."

"Sorry."

Remus shook his head and addressed the villain. Even now, his voice carried a professorial air.

"There's something else that you've forgotten, something vital and frankly quite important to this discussion."

"Oh? And what might that be, wolf?"

The amber eyes flashed. The other three could tell that Remus Lupin was amused, even through the werewolf trying to break free. The voice still carried the instruction clearly.

"Never piss off a redhead."

The three crouched as a primal scream erupted behind them and a blast of pure white sizzled over them. The beam - that of A Mother's Love and Fury - blew Voldemort into an old oak tree and he fell. He sat there, shaking his head.

James looked at his wife.

"Hello, sweetheart. Harry situated?"

"He's safe, dear. Are we ready?"

As she spoke, she squeezed to nestle up to her beloved husband's chest. Her wand came up.

Sirius laughed. The laugh was full of a vicious barking growl.

"I'm ready."

Remus nodded. The cypress wand was steady.

"As am I."

James held Lily to him, pressing a kiss to her hair as Voldemort struggled to his feet.

"Let's go!"

The Potter family magic rose up again and engulfed the four of them as the air around them ionized and sparks flew, a different color for each of them. James chanted, his voice strong.

/"Activate interlocks! Dynotherms connected! Intercells connected! Megathruster are... GO!"/

Together, they joined in with the next part as Voldemort stared at them in growing unease.

/"Let's go, Gryffindor force!"/

James' voice continued as their bodies and magic shifted forms. Not their Animagus forms but a combination.

/"Form feet and legs!"/

Remus and Sirius both grew bigger and their bodies shifted into strong legs

/"Form arms and body!"/

Lily's body and the lower part of James began the transformation. The rage in Lily at the threat to her baby manifested in powerful arms and a mighty torso, which immediately began merging with the forms that Remus and Sirius had taken.

/"And I'll form the head!"/

The last part of the ritual saw James morphing into an armored head reminiscent of a raging lion. This was followed by a flash of light and Magic as the combined being roared its leonine defiance at the Dark Lord. Their wands sung a mighty and terrible song as they United into a sword that heated the air around it into plasma.

By this time, Voldemort had gotten to his feet. He eyed the construct moving toward him and mumbled the only thing on his mind.

"Oh, shit."

** Lily really should have left Lord Voldemort a thank-you card. Why he hadn't attacked immediately after Harry and Neville were born, she didn't know. But he had waited for fifteen months. Fifteen months for her and the marauders to prepare. The fidelious had been quite an ancient and advanced spell, but it did have its loopholes. Loopholes the size of . . . a house. After months of intense study and work by her and Moony, followed by equally difficult charms and transfigurations work by herself, Sirius and her husband, they were finally prepared should worse come to worst. Everything was prepared as much as possible.

That Halloween, they realized the worst had come the moment Voldemort crossed the spell-alert boundary around their property.

"Lily! It's him! Get Harry and wake the other two!" The other two marauders were in the guest room sleeping. Their shift was going to be from midnight until noon.

The house was silenced to prevent anyone outside from hearing anything inside.

The front door blew in not thirty seconds later. The evil wizard took another moment to look around. Voldemort tsked on seeing James. "You should have joined me when you could," he said , and sneered. "How pathetic. What kind of wizard are you not to have your wand always at hand? I suppose it is too much to expect a blood-traitor to be competent."

James slowly held his arms out to his sides, away from his torso. "Oh, no, not at all. I have no need of a wand." James' heart was pounding so hard he thought it might leap through his chest.

Voldemort cocked an eyebrow. "Oh, really? You expect me to believe you can take me on with wandless magic?"

"Oh, no, not at all, James said slowly and earnestly. "I'm just going to stand here and watch you go up those stairs to our son's room." He was trying to be as convincing as possible.

Voldemort studied him a moment, frowning. "And your blood-traitor friend and your pet wolf will attack me while I'm suspiciously watching you, right?"

"Oh, no, not at all. They will do nothing." James lowered his arms a bit and motioned back and forth in front of himself.

"You will all just watch me kill your son?" the other wizard said, mild disbelief colouring his tone. "What will your wife say?"

"She will say nothing. In fact, she ordered me to leave you alone." He nodded emphatically. "I'll even give you a wizard's oath that I will not try in any way to prevent you from going to our son's room, and that neither will I attack you under any circumstances while you are here in the house or even in Godric's Hollow, if you want. Besides, my wand is upstairs in the bedroom on my dresser." He glanced upstairs.

A wave of magic flowed through the room. Voldemort took a step back and looked around suspiciously.

"That's nothing to worry about," James said, desperately calm. "Just Lily resetting the fidelious."

"Ah," the Dark Wizard said in understanding. "It will do no good. I am already inside the house. Do you hope to ambush me?"

James shook his head. "Nope. No ambush, I swear."

The Dark Lord stared at him through narrowed eyes. "You are stalling," Voldemort said flatly. He flicked his wand. "Avada Kedavra," he hissed.

The golem shook under the explosion and collapsed to the carpet, pieces flying and rolling across the room.

Surprised and shaken by the reaction. Viciously upset at being fooled, Voldemort growled angrily. He headed up the stairs, confident in his ability to defend against any attack by these foolish wizards. No one could stand up to him!

The first room was empty, just two beds in disarray. The second was the master bedroom. There wasn't a wand on the dresser.

The third room was the nursery, and it, too was empty. He growled angrily. He cast a quick, Homenum Revelio, which showed that no people were in the house. But where were they?

He slowly turned in place. There was only the house. They had to be here somewhere!

Outside, several hundred feet in the air, Padfoot held James in a levitation charm as he grabbed his broom and mounted it. "I've got such a headache from that, I'll have you know, Lilly," he said testily. Lily just glared at him. Harry was in front-chest-style muggle baby carrier.

"At least you're alive, which wouldn't be the case it I hadn't integrated that golem with legimency."

Mooney was behind and below Lily, acting as a spotter if she had any troubles. She wasn't as accomplished at broom-riding as the others. The four brooms turned and headed for the Potter Manor.

"I can't believe that worked!" said Padfoot, shaking his head.

"The fidelius only had to work on ONE person's memory, this time," Lily said mildly. "How powerful you are won't prevent it from working, or it wouldn't have worked for us in the first place."

"How long do you think it will take him to figure out that the new fidelius is set so that anyone IN the house doesn't know that there's the rest of the world OUTSIDE the house?" asked Sirius.

"I'm not sure he can," said Remus. "He can't see any of the doors or windows."

"And now he can't remember how to contact his Death Eaters to call for help," Lily added smugly, "Because they are all on the outside and he no longer knows they exist!"

"We should probably get Dumbledore to erect another fidelius on the property itself, just to be safe," James added.

"We'll do it AFTER we get to the manor and put Harry to bed," Lily said firmly.

"And with the both a muggle and wizard aversion charms on the property, no one will ever go there looking for him, anyway."

"What about the prophecy?"

"When Harry is an adult, he can just snipe the Dark Tosser through a window."

***** Voldemort's fingers lightly touched his own pale cheek and pulled away. He stared at the reddish-brown substance on them with a look that could only be called amusement. “All that for a drop of blood?”

James gaped as he sank to his knees. It had taken everything he had to chain those spells together: the lion, the cutters, triggering the series of explosions and fireworks that resulted in dropping the entire second floor study onto the Dark Lord's head. And yet the Gryffindor mascot that had once been his favorite couch lay broken at Voldemort's feet as the remains of his shield flickered out of existence. He stop tall amongst the rubble, a black monolith against the destruction around him.

Sirius gave a yell and charged forward, spells flying from his wand. Remus was circling from Voldemort's other flank, the tip of his wand activating the various runes carved into the walls. As Sirius' spells missed their target, they rebounded off the walls and around their makeshift kill box, inching closer and closer to Voldemort each time they passed---

But he merely sighed and flicked his wrist, yanking Lupin in front of the red jets. They pierced his chest, shoulders and stomach before Voldemort slammed him into the rubble and through the living room floor into the cellar. Sirius couldn't even call out his friend's name before Voldemort gestured and sent those shards of wood lying around him towards Black. The projectiles struck home, and James oddly was reminded of Minerva‘a pincushions before one particular plank lodged itself in Sirius' throat, cutting off his screams with a wet gurgle.

James stared as Voldemort resumed walking towards him. He heard shuffling on the stairs. “L-Lily,” he choked, “go. Run. Take Harry and run!” He found his way to his feet, and forced his arm to snap forward and send a cutter at his enemy. “I'll hold him off!”

That damned man smiled, but those red eyes promised hell. James Banished what was left of the living room at Voldemort before jabbing his wand at one last rune in the floor. It burned red, and the house seemed to roar and shake and flames slowly began to spread from the Norse glyphs in what remained in the wood.

Voldemort eyed the flames, like a teacher examining a student's project, until they suddenly roared and /reached/, arcing towards the dark wizard in a fiery embrace. It wasn't Fiendfyre, James thought, but close enough.

He couldn't see what was happening through the smoke; it was like the sun had been transported into his living room. He shielded his eyes, right arm shielding the top half of his face, gripping his wand even tighter lest the sweat made it fall---

But then it all stopped. The heat, the roaring, everything. James looked and even his heart stopped. /How?/

Voldemort still stood, continuing to walk towards him, a small ball of fire---the same ball of fire trapping him earlier---clutched in his right hand. His fingers clenched and the light dispersed, a trail of smoke the only proof of existence. James moved, wanting to strike, and Voldemort was just faster. He felt rather than saw the trio of curses hit him on the chest as he was flung into the wall. James felt his ribs forcibly crushing his lungs, his veins screaming along with his voice as knives dug deeper into each and every nerve ending.

He couldn't move. He couldn't breathe. He could only watch as Voldemort's eyes glittered into focus.

“You should've realized by now,” The Dark Lord hissed, “that I am /inevitable/, Mr. Potter.”

James' mouth moved, fingers trying to reach once more to his wand---

“/AVADA KEDAVRA./” And the world turned white.

You can't possibly think that Harry beat Voldemort by his own merits, can you? You do understand that Harry's victory says literally nothing about the strength of either in a fight, right?

They did not personally duel Voldemort alone while he was trying to kill them. They had almost certainly never spoken to him and had certainly never "defied" him in any situation where he could do anything about it. If they had ever been in the same area as him it would have had to have been at the end of the fight as everyone was fleeing or with Dumbledore there to scare Voldemort away. The series isn't coy with letting us know that Voldemort can't be beaten in a fight by anyone but Dumbledore.

"Defying" is literally anything that goes against what Voldemort wanted. Here is a quote from Rowling.

#+begin_quote
  It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting. . Also, James and Lily turned him down, that was established in "Philosopher's Stone". He wanted them, and they wouldn't come over, so that's one strike against them before they were even out of their teens.

#+end_quote

A lot of people were good in fights and Voldemort tore through them. That's basically the point of his character as a villain. He's so strong that no one but Dumbledore is capable of even trying to hurt him. Canon is really not at all subtle about this, Voldemort is very clearly in an entirely other plain of magical strength than everyone else but Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  around him
#+end_quote

Around him is an entirely different thing to fighting him. Fighting around him would have meant Dumbledore was there because otherwise the battle would have immediately turned to a retreat. There's no fighting "around" people like Dumbledore and Voldemort unless the other one is there to occupy their attention.

*** This is what Rowling has to say about the three defiances.

#+begin_quote
  It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting. . Also, James and Lily turned him down, that was established in "Philosopher's Stone". He wanted them, and they wouldn't come over, so that's one strike against them before they were even out of their teens.
#+end_quote

Note that "he wanted them" doesn't mean he personally sought them out to recruit them or that he had ever spoken to them. Anyone even remotely notable would have been someone he "wanted" and would more likely than not have been recruited more directly by other Death Eaters. Voldemort would have killed them if he had been close enough to personally ask them and been refused unless Dumbledore was there and then it would have been a fight between the two of them not Lily and James.

******* Even with death of an author, I think it's reasonable to take an explanation of what she meant in an unclear passage. It's fanfiction, canon can be changed but there's no point pretending it's not being changed if you're changing it.

Even without author input, it's ridiculous to think James and Lily were capable of personally fighting Voldemort and doing anything but dying quickly. Canon is extremely clear that there is no balance between wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort and people less powerful than them.

******** I always assumed that James and Lily defying Voldemort meant surviving against him. They may not have necessarily dueled, but perhaps Voldemort went after them during a skirmish and they manage to escape with their lives after taking down some Death Eaters. It also fits with how Harry defied him too.

Leaving a passage unclear leaves its meaning up to the interpretation of the reader. I hate it when authors then try to assert their own meanings over it in interviews, personally. If you want people to take the meaning of your writing a specific way, don't make it ambiguous.

It's a prophecy. It's ambiguous almost by definition. Did you want her to write "born to those that once arrested Death Eater 428, once escaped the battlefield after the Dark Lord's arrival, and once refused a representative of the Dark Lord" in the prophecy?

This isn't the same as all of the rest of the bullshit she's pushed into the series in the last ten years. Of all the passages in the series that are reasonable to explain further this one is near the top of the list.

Canon is fairly explicit in telling us that no one but Dumbledore and then Harry after him survived Voldemort making any kind of concerted effort to kill them unless they hid and never came into contact with him. They would have obviously been on his kill list like anyone else known to be connected to the Order, but we're told pretty point blank that no one had done much against him.

*** Defying Voldemort doesn't mean being in a /direct/ duel /with him/. They scoffed at his idealogies, refused to bow to him, and fought with the Order.

But never directly against him. Voldemort was powerful. Extremely so. And had decades of experience over the Potters, who were just fresh outta Hogwarts by a few years (and didn't even have talents that lay in DADA, since they excelled in charms and transfiguation). Add to that the fact that Voldie was in his prime at the time?

Welp. They're all suuuuuper dead. Like... Dead dead.

If it only took three slightly better than average wizards to take down Voldemort, then we wouldn't have 7 books detailing a 20 year long civil war.

** For everyone assuming Voldemort would easily win, I feel Voldemort is being a bit overhyped here.

Is he dangerous? Absolutely. Is he so dangerous that four other exceptional witches/wizards can't seriously challenge him? Doubtful.

If its book version, Fudge seems to think in Half-Blood Prince that Amelia Bones was able to resist Voldemort for a while before being killed by him. Also the trio of McGonnagle, Kingsley, and Slughorn were able to at least put up a fight at the Battle of Hogwarts, although his power was reduced at the time.

If its movie version, Harry duels him pretty evenly in the final battle, and Grindlewald, who is on the same level more or less, is temporarily held off by Tina in the first Fantastic Beasts film.

So its not a case of Dumbledore and Voldemort are so far above anyone else that there's no point even fighting.

The Marauders and Lily, armed and ready to fight, when Voldemort is expecting only two opponents? They probably can't kill him, but they can almost certainly hold him off long enough for one of them to escape with Harry, or for help to arrive from the rest of the Order. Although one or more of them likely die in the process.
