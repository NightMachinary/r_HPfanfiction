** The doors were blasted off their hinges as three aurors dressed in weird outfits charged in. The first one screamed out their battlecry.

"NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!"

Fudge slammed his head into his hands.

"Dammit Potter, another few weeks and we might have managed to get them to forget about that sodding thing but you just had to make that joke."

Sighing, one of the court members raised his wand and changed the number back to '0' on the poster of 'number of days without a Monty Python reference'

** They actually believed he was referring to the actual Spanish Inquisition.

While most wizards/witches were fine during those times, since a simple flame-freezing charm would save them, it's the implication that stunned them.

Some were angry: others suddenly feeling quite ashamed that Potter actually believed them as bad as magic-burning muggles.

...And, looking back on it, summoning the whole Wizengamot for a case of underage magic?

Fudge began to sweat as more than a single baleful eye was directed at him.

**** Really? Maybe I'm weird but I immediately assumed that OP had Harry calling out the Wizengamot on their extremely biased, aggressively spiteful trial. I mean Fudge interrupted him every time he tried to tell his side of the story; illegally changed the time of the trial without prior warning/authorization to try to make Harry late; tried to make /everything/ that Harry actually /managed to say/ seem like lies; but most of all: he held a *FULL HEARING* for use of freaking *UNDERAGE MAGIC* done /in front of a muggle/ when said muggle (and Harry himself) was not only in /life-threatening danger/ -- but was also Harry's /muggle cousin/ who'd seen him do magic practically his entire life -- in Courtroom 10, where only the worst of the Death Eaters were tried in the past. And finally, all this happened while Harry knew *literally nothing* about the Ministry of Magic, the Wizengamot, magical laws, or even how to legally defend himself.

Idk how everyone else got a random Monty Python quote from this... I guess it was a really popular (set of?) movie(s?), so everyone's mind just automatically went there?

****** Okay, 1.) I'm laughing because I didn't realise you ARE the OP.

2.) I guess I should really watch the Monty Python movies(? skits? plays? gosh I really don't know enough about this subject...), so that I can get on everyone else's level. I'm sorry I didn't understand your joke, but either way, the point of it still stands--if you were going to refer to the Spanish Inquisition at any one point in the HP timeline I think that farce of a trial would be the best option.

Sorry again about my not understanding. I'll at least watch some of the more well-known parts (skits?) so that I'll be able to understand better in the future!

******* FWIW, I did, in fact, include a link to said sketch in the main post.

As for Monty Python, much of their material came from /Monty Python's Flying Circus/, which was a sketch comedy series. This is the source for the Spanish Inquisition sketch, and another one that gets referenced frequently, the Lumberjack song. Fair warning, the humour runs from surreal and silly to over-the-top violence.

They have also made several films, the most famous either being /The Life of Brian/, which parodies the life of Jesus Christ, and is the source of the song, /Always Look on the Bright Side of Life/; and /Monty Python and the Holy Grail/, which parodies King Arthur's quest for said artifact, and probably gets the most referenced(You can bet any time some asks “What is your name? What is your Quest? What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?” it's a reference to this film).

** The doors swung open behind Harry with a sharp bang, revealing several men dressed in bright red robes.

"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!" the leader proclaimed proudly. "Our chief weapon is surprise! ... Surprise and fear... Fear and surprise... Our two weapons are fear and surprise... And ruthless efficiency," Harry couldn't look away, what the bloody hell was going on. The man in the centre continued after a slightly even more awkward moment where he rallied himself. "Our /three/ weapons are fear and surprise and ruthless efficiency... And a fanatical devotion to the Pope!" He whinced visibly but continued to struggle through his speach. "Our /four/... No... Amongst our weaponry... Are such elements as fear, surprise... I'll come in again."

With a whirl of crimson robes and an embarrassed but determined air the door closed again and Harry stare at it for a long moment before he slowly looked back at the pale Wizards. Fudge in particular was looking almost green and Harry opened his mouth as he met Fudge's eyes squarely. He didn't know why the Minister was so freaked out but he'd use it.

"Well, I didn't exp-"

"No!" Fudge squeaked out like a dying balloon. "Case dismissed! Don't use magic outside of school, you can go!"

Harry squinted a little as he looked at the rest of the wizards and witches before he nodded and quietly let himself out of the chamber. The three men were waiting almost anxiously for their cue and Harry grinned at them with all his teeth.

"They aren't expecting you now," He said brightly. "I love your robes by the way, very red." He gave them a nodded and headed to where Arthur was waiting for him.

The loud crash of the doors echoed behind him with an even louder /"NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!"/

It was turning into a good day after all.

*** Please excuse the spelling & grammar pundit that chews on my brain.

"Que" is not an English word. The word you want is "cue", meaning "signal or prompt". You can remember it because it's spelled like "clue", which also tells you where to go next. The other similar word is "queue", meaning "people standing in line". You can remember it because it's got two UE's standing next to each other.

** NO ONE EXPECTS...

The red robed man looked around slowly, his lips twisting smoothly into a grin.

"Witches of Satan," his shrill voice dropping to a baritone as smooth as silk, "I have found you."

With a flash of smoke and a loud crack echoing around the hall every witch and wizard found a knife at their throat as a variatable army of similarly garbed "Spaniards" appeared.

"We waited centuries for one of you consorts of evil to slip up and remark that you no longer expected us, and look what you have served to me," he waved his arm slowly around indicating the assembled leaders of magical Britain. "A coven so self obsessed, they believe themselves a government."

IDK where to go with this.
