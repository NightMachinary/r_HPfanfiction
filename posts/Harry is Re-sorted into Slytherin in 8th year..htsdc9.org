:END:
I'm looking for a specific fic where Harry (along with some other students) get re-sorted during 8th year. In the 8th year Slytherin boy's dormitory Harry learns that the boys regularly wank and score each other on their wanking performance, but that alternatively, they have a no crying rule. Draco apparently runs afoul of the no crying rule fairly often. Eventual Harry/Draco.

  Harry doesn't mind that so many Slytherins from his year have returned to finish their NEWTs, really he doesn't. It's just -- do they have to be so friendly? He's not prejudiced, really he's not. It's just -- they've got to be up to something, right? Unnerved by the attention he's attracting from everyone -- the Slytherins are the least of it, to be fair -- and struggling with a raft of changes to Hogwarts itself, Harry wishes he could be happy that one constant remains: Draco Malfoy really fucking hates him.When he's hit by an illegal love-spell though, Harry finds he has more to worry about than whether or not Blaise Zabini actually wants to be his friend. For if everyone affected has been blessed -- or cursed, by the look on Malfoy's face -- with a magical tattoo revealing the name of their soulmate, what does it mean that Harry's skin remains completely bare?

*** Ahhh, it IS Written on the Heart! Looking through my bookmarks I had thought it might be that one, but then I was like, wait, no, that's the one where all the Slytherins annoy Harry by trying to be his friend AND no, that's the one with the love tattoos. Turns out it's the one with all three of those things!

**** Hahaha I've actually never read it but I heard that it had Harry getting resorted into Slytherin and I did a search in the fic for the word "wank" and it had a lot of hits so I was like, this is probably it!
