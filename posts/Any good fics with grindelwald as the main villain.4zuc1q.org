Preferably nothing with non-canon shipping, it's just not my thing and I don't really like romance either way.


** linkffn(3155057) was a pretty interesting one where Harry time traveled back to Grindelwald's time and ended up adopting Tom Riddle and stopped him from becoming a power hungry narcissist. I believe harry goes on an undercover mission to East Europe for a mission against Grindelwald, but i won't spoil it for those that haven't read.

Errr sorry, gott edit this. I guess it might count as non-canon shipping because no one Harry's real age is there, but romance is not the focus of the story at all. Apologies. Most of the other pairings on the fic mirror canon

*** I'd add on, the first 10 chapters or so haven't aged the best, the story really picks up after that.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** Grindelwald isn't the main villain per se but it's a super interesting AU with Slytherin and Grindelwald facing off as the main totems. There's no shipping since they're 11 years old. I would say it's my favorite fic ever (WIP tho)

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
