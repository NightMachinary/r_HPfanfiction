** There was this fic where Harry's future self had become a Dark Lord. And every Dark Lord needs a clever name. Cue Lord Rettop!

*** Oh lawd, that reminded me of a next-gen fic I read on FictionAlley around when OotP came out. The bad guy was the Dark Lord Niloc.

Yeah, it turned out to be Colin Creevey.

** I think the only time I haven't rolled my eyes at a rename, is Hephaestus Peverell. Mostly because it was done in an interesting manner as an alternate identity while he still had his original name.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
