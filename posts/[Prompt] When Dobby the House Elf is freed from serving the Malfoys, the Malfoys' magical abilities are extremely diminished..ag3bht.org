I got the idea a day or two ago.

I've read a few fanfics which justify the enslavement of house elves by tying the elves' magic to their servitude. When they are freed from the House, they lose their magic. I never liked that trope much (though I think the basic idea could work outside of the Harry Potter canon), but it did give me an idea.

What if instead of House Elves losing their magic when they're freed, they take it with them?


** Would that also explain why the black family had their heads mounted on walls? They have to keep them around so the family doesn't lose their magic.

** That would involve a pretty heavy AU since it would be a monumental change in the Wizarding Society. It would also beg the question as to why anyone would even want to have house elves in such a world.

Sure, they are convenient, but the risks seem to outweight the reward pretty heavily. I, for one, wouldn't want to have a house elve if they came with this attachment. Especially since they can be so easily freed if someone tricks you, like Harry did to Lucius.

** Hmm...but how would they 'take it with them'? How would the Malfoys' magic be quantifiable in such a way that when Dobby leaves, so does their magic?

Maybe it's an inbreeding thing; purebloods like the Malfoys don't have enough power to cast high powered magic (especially the dark magic that they'd like to use as Death Eaters) without binding a house-elf or a few to drain their magical potential.\\
Or maybe it's an environmental thing; repeated magic use in an area (especially certain kinds like dark magic) pollutes it with residual energy that eventually reduces the effectiveness of spellcasting there, and house-elves typically have the job of cleaning it up?

That first one is an actual justification for fanfics that have Harry binding Dobby as his elf, I think.\\
"Dobby hears that Harry Potter must defeat powerful Dark Lord. Dobby wants to be free, but this is much more important, so Dobby will tell Harry of secret power that comes from elves..."
