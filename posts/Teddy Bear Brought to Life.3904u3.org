I remember reading a story at some point where harry brought a teddy bear to life. For the life of me I can't remember anything else, even if it was good. The source would be well appreciated.


** If I remember correctly Jeconais [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This means war]] has one.
