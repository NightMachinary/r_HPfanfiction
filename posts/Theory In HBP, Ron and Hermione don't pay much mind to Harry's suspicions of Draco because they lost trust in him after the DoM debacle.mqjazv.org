At the end of OotP, Ron and Hermione followed Harry to the Dept. of Mysteries, which turns out to be a trap. Ron and Hermione both end up grievously injured and scarred in the resulting fight.

Fast forward to HBP, and Harry's spouting conspiracies about Malfoy, and generally, Harry's gut is right about these things - except for one, very recent, very glaring exception. I think the DoM battle shook their belief in Harry's leadership a little bit. This isn't something they're conscious of, of course, I'm pretty sure they don't actually blame him for their injuries - but they're also not as willing to get caught up in another of his wild-goose chase adventures.

So, they ignore Harry even though Draco /is/ acting hella shady and they /should/ probably watch him. Remember that in second year, Hermione spent over a month brewing a potion just so they could try and get him to admit he was the heir. Because again, he was acting shady then. And just like in CoS, in HBP, people are getting attacked. (Though, since he wasn't the culprit in CoS, maybe they were less inclined to believe his guilt in HBP) Either way, if the DoM battle doesn't happen, they wouldn't have dismissed his fears out of hand the way they did.

I think this has repercussions in DH as well, when Ron and Harry fight over the fact that he didn't have more of a plan. I'm sure Ron was remembering what happened the last time Harry bullheadedly led them into danger.

TL;DR: Harry's credibility with Ron and Hermione took a huge hit after the end of OotP

I might be completely wrong though, so I'd love to hear your thoughts!


** I've never thought about it like this before but it totally makes sense!

I've always thought that Ron and Hermione were too dismissive of Harry's suspicion against Malfoy and it would make sense if subconsciously they lost some faith in him due to the events of the previous year.

*** /Ron and Hermione were too dismissive of Harry's suspicion against Malfoy/

That's because they were. The whole thing with no one believing him about Draco and the book was just poor artificial conflict for the plot. I admit, adding this plot point would have been much better to make it more organic. But as with the romance, it's lacking everything in writing that makes it believable, natural, when in theory, it /should/ work. Romance and this drama was one of the more poorly written parts of HBP If you ask me.

So I hold that this theory belongs in a book much better written than HBP, one that had more time to gestate in Rowling's head before it was released

** This is a plausible explanation that would have been believable if it was ever implied or hinted at in canon. It really wasn't. We can say this can make it believable, but the way it was handled in canon makes it seem completely like drama for thesake of drama. So yeah, could have worked but not really that well handled in canon, except for it coming off forced and artificial drama.

But hey, I'm not a fan of HBP and almost all the drama in it feels forced and artificial to me.

*** Of course, you've got a right to that opinion. I hated Ootp when I first read it but now it's my favorite book in the series - it's just so deeply, heartbreakingly tragic, yet still hopeful. I think by HBP Rowling realized she only had two books to wrap up everything so she sort of rushed everything. I mean Harry doesn't even grieve Sirius, he spends more time grieving Cedric and Dumbledore than he does his own godfather. And where the fuck did the Deathly Hallows come from? Also Snape's "redemption" was stupid and creepy.

*** I completely disagree. The whole buildup to Dumbledore's death is so absolutely wonderfully written. I've reread HBP multiple times and honestly I tear up every time the book ends. For Harry it's such a journey in maturing and losing those he trusts. With sirius he lost unconditional love and with Dumbledore he looses the second element of childhood: trust. I know that one fluctuates throughout the series and hp fic writers like to exaggerate Harry's trust issues. And anyone who loves the grey-moral-zone characters has to like the characterisation of Snape, Dumbledore, and Voldemort in this Book.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but Ron was within his right to get pissed at Harry in DH. Here they were with a cursed locket with no solid plan and no doubt Ron is terrified for Ginny, who is still at Hogwarts. Yes the way he acted was childish, but could you blame him?

I don't really remember anything of this sort before that convo, just that Ron was complaining about food and stuff and not about his family or friends.

****** She's not a shoddy writer?

Dumbledore FLEW to the Ministry of Magic in book 1, because */no other form of magical travel existed yet./*

The entire plot of book 6, which tee'd up all of book 7 and the endgame of the entire series, was only possible because Rowling had nobody believe Harry when he said Malfoy was acting suspicious, when Malfoy couldn't go ten feet without clutching a Dark Mark spot on his arm, was jumping at his own shadows constantly, and was disappearing for hours at a time to an unknown part of the castle with no explanation.

If Hermione had decided to take Harry's entirely valid concerns seriously for even thirty minutes, Dumbledore would not be dead in book 7 and the castle would not have fallen. She was willing to brew a post-NEWT potion in a toilet for MONTHS just to /check and see/ if Draco /might/ be the Heir of Slytherin. But she can't be assed to give Harry thirty minutes of her time to help him safely tail Malfoy and see what he might be up to, after */Voldemort has returned to life and is waging a war outside the school./*

Rowling absolutely is a shoddy writer. She left holes in her story that you could drive a truck through. Dumbledore died and Voldemort won Hogwarts because nobody could be assed to listen to Harry. People who want to bash Dumbledore /to this day/ use the broomstick thing to imply that the plot of the first book was all a set-up. In reality, Rowling hadn't even thought of Apparition, Portkeys, or the Floo yet. She introduced them retroactively.

*** I think Ron gets hate because he chose to bring up his issues RIGHT when they were starting to make progress in the Horcrux hunt. That conversation that they overhear, where they find out about Ginny's detention, also leads them to figure out the Sword of Gryffindor connection - which is a major leap forward, a real moment of hope. I remember how excited and hyped I got when I first read Harry and Hermione's back and forth, the way the pieces were coming together for them.

And then Ron sort of pooped the party by getting all whiny about them not caring as much that Ginny got sent to the Forbidden Forest, and then he left, thus setting them back months. I was devastated, it was such a gut punch.

So maybe Ron also gets hate because his big moment of defiance came at, just, like the worst possible time.

*** Yes, I can blame him, because he acted childish but was not a child anymore. Dumbledore gave each of them something he thought they would need, and the object he gave Ron was a way to find his friends after he threw a massive tantrum and bitched off. That more than anything speaks volumes of Ron's character and loyalty: even Dumbledore knew how much of a manchild he was. Even Gives-Second-Chances-To-Marked-Death-Eaters had so little faith in Ronald Weasley that he planned around giving him a golden ticket to get back after he ran off. Dumbledore's entire meta-plan revolved around Draco not having the guts to kill him and Snape being a better person than he's ever shown the capability of being, but Dumbledore was absolutely not willing to count on Ron's loyalty or reliability.

You could argue that Ron was not himself at the time, and that's true. But Dumbledore had no reason to know or believe he would be getting influenced by a Horcrux, either, and yet he still gave Ron the lighter, didn't he? Dumbledore still counted on Ron going full retard and */abandoning the quest to rob Sauron of his immortality/*. How very mature, to potentially doom the entire world forever because he was /hungry and stressed out./

Ron has been full of shit since day one. He's not a great friend, and if Harry Potter had been better written and more realistic, Ron would have eventually fallen away and been replaced by Neville, who was far more of a friend and far more of an interesting character. Because that's what happens in real life: you realize that the people you thought you were friends with were just people you were forced to be in proximity with because of school, and you stop being friends eventually because you don't actually get along all that well or share that many interests. You lose friends, like Ron, and then make newer and better friends, like Neville and Luna. That's life.

Ron is that friend you lose because you aren't really friends, except Rowling couldn't let him go because Hermione is her self-insert and he's the proxy for her husband. She's admitted as much in interviews.

Every excuse you've cooked up for Ron also applies to Harry, except Harry didn't abandon the mission for fundamentally selfish and stupid reasons. If you can somehow look at that situation and feel like Ron was the morally-superior one, then you're either blind or an idiot. Ron could have destroyed the world with his tantrum. And Dumbledore was so certain he would throw one that he prepared in advance for it. Call it whatever you want, but that's not "maturity."

***** Neville was far, far more of a friend that Ron ever was. Neville stood up for Harry when nobody but Hermione was willing to, even against the entire house AND Ron. Neville was less directly involved in their adventures but has an infinitely better track record. He never stabbed Harry in the back. He never called him a liar, or a cheat, or an attention seeking prat, because he knew Harry would never do those things and hated the attention he got. He never walked out on them.

Harry has more in common with Neville and Luna than he does with anyone else in the entire school. They are outsiders who are on the bad side of the popular opinion and the rumor mill. On his worst and most hated day in school, Ron could still get Dean and Seamus to play cards with him or mess around with the twins. On Harry's worst day at school, nobody would even talk to him except Neville and Hermione, and that includes Ron. Neville knows what it's like to be on the outs with their entire house. Ron does not. By the end of the story, when all of Neville's personal problems had been sorted out, he could stand shoulder to shoulder with Harry as an equal. Ron never could. Ron was so filled with jealousy throughout the series that he never bothered try and stand alongside Harry, he gave up on even trying. But Neville never gave up, which is just one more thing that makes him far more similar to Harry than he is different.

Ron doesn't know what it's like to refuse to give up. He doesn't know what it's like to have the whole world against you, to feel the hatred and derision of the entire school and even broader society. Ron doesn't know what it's like to be hated and looked down upon by your own relatives and family. But Neville does. Neville has been spit on and mocked by the entire school, he's been called a squib by his own family and been thrown off a balcony for it. Neville knows better than Ron, or most other people, exactly how it feels to be the real Harry Potter, who struggles and is frustrated and always has the odds against him, who hates having to deal with his family and just wants to be left alone to be normal.

Ron never wished to be normal, not ever. From the very beginning of the series, it was established with the mirror what Ron wanted. To be everything all of his brothers were all at once. To be as cool as Bill, as loved as Charlie, as funny as the twins, and as successful as Percy. Ron, not ever, not even once, wished to be normal. He never wished to be normal, and have a normal life with a normal family that was happy and loved him. Why would he wish for something he already had? But Neville did. Neville did wish for that. And so did Harry. Ron wanted fame and wealth and glory. Harry and Neville both just wanted things to go right in their lives for once, and to be loved for who they really were.

Neville Longbottom is literally Harry Potter with no talent in Quidditch and a wand that didn't choose him. The parallel is even directly drawn, in story, that but for the flip of a coin, their positions could have been switched.

And finally, as to how they're "regarded," as though that even matters, the vast majority of people in school regard Harry the exact same way they do Neville, if not worse, in all even-numbered books. If Harry wasn't single-handedly winning Gryffindor the House Cup in almost every single book by catching a ball in a sports game their entire society is obsessed with, and earning hundreds of house points in the process, he would be in the exact same position Neville is. If Harry didn't play Quidditch, he would be even more similar to Neville than he already is.

** You could certainly spin it that way if you wanted to, but I don't see it as true in canon. Rowling's writing has always been pretty shaky: even though the Harry Potter series is ostensibly written in a mystery novel style format, Rowling is actually really bad at that kind of fiction. It really starts to break down in books 6 and 7, though. The reason nobody listened to Harry's suspicions is because if even one person had, the ENTIRE meta-plot of book 6 would have derailed and Dumbledore would still be alive in book 7. Literally all it would have taken is a plan to tail Malfoy, notice that he's going into the room, and then either tailing him to the cabinet or asking the room to "show me what Malfoy is working on," which would presumably have given a room with just the cabinet in it.

Any exposure of the cabinet subplot means the entire story utterly derails: Dumbledore does not die, Hogwarts does not fall, and Draco gets killed by Voldemort for failing, which in case you've forgotten, was the REAL purpose of Draco's task. Voldemort deliberately gave him something totally impossible so he would have an excuse to kill him when he failed. Draco's task to assassinate Dumbledore and hand the castle over to Voldemort was meant to be punishment for Lucius over losing the diary.

Ron and Hermione were unhelpful, obtuse, and disloyal idiots because they needed to be. It's completely out of character: even if Hermione didn't completely trust Harry anymore, and there was zero indication that this was true, this is still the girl who, in second year, brewed a post-NEWT and illegal potion in a toilet to help Harry infiltrate the Slytherin dorms, just to check and see if Draco was really the heir. She also broke an entire book's worth of laws illegally using a time turner just to try and save a hippogriff from being executed and to try and bail Sirius, a man who had literally just broken Ron's leg twenty minutes earlier, out of danger. Does anyone actually believe that she wouldn't be willing to at least wrap up some homework early to help tail Draco and see if he really has taken the Dark Mark? Really? If Hermione's trust in Harry had fallen that much, then she wouldn't have even been friends with him anymore after book 6.

Though, to be fair, a story that actually chose to really explore that idea would be interesting. I've seen it used in indy!fics before, I think we all have, but it's always just an excuse to burn bridges and have Harry ride off into the sunset on a motorcycle. I don't think I've ever really seen a serious exploration into Year 6 all of Harry's friends lose faith in him.

Idiot balls were handed out left, right, and center in the last few books. Even Harry could have solved this himself, if he had truly wanted to, but he didn't take the initiative, because again, he couldn't. If he had, the entire plot would have de-railed.

Even in the first book, by the first quidditch match Hermione was setting fire to Snape so you can't say she didn't also strongly suspect him by then. And it was her idea in book 2 to make polyjuice, specifically to spy on malfoy. And none of them expected moody to be the impostor.

Throughout the series, Harry always blames Draco and not once, until HBP is it Draco, so it is only logical that they don't believe him. Honestly, Harry only got lucky, really. Even if Draco wasn't a Death Eater, Harry still would have believed he was. When it comes to Draco, Harry's a biased source.

In year one, he was quick to blame Snape for jinxing his broom and outright didn't trust him. An understandable reaction, yes, but still. In year two, he at least wanted to get some proof that it was Malfoy who opened the chamber. Add in the DoM stuff, and I don't think anyone would've just accepted the conspiracies he threw out.

Harry was a good leader during battles, but let's be honest, Hermione was the person who ran things behind the scenes, Ron was the person who /should've been/ the strategist, and Neville the person who led with words.
