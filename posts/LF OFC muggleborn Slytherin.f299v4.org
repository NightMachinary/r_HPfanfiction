Uhhhh I just remember few info about it.

It started at a crime scene with the OFC's dead parents killed by death eaters. The DEs are targeting muggleborn to decrease their number. OFC is accompanied by Prof. Snape to Diagon and is sorted to Slytherin. OFC was an assassin/soldier(?) in her past life. She proceeds to alienate herself but got a friend in Hermione and sometimes Harry. OFC is an enemy of Voldemort and anyone who messes with her really.

Tnx in advance.


** Was it a crossover?
