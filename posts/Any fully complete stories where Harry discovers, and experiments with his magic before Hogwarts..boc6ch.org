I've read ones where he basically recreated Chakra from Naruto with it, and ones where he just did small things like levitate stuff. Anything within those areas are fine, as long as he's actually experimenting a bit with this new energy.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Linkffn(The Perils Of Innocence) isn't complete unfortunately, but it's complete up to first year Hogwarts, so all the pre Hogwarts magic is complete. It's really good with Harry, Hermione and Dean.

Linkffn(Fantastic Elves and where to find them) is also great, even if it's really weird.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) is completed with a sequel. Unfortunately, said sequel has been on and off hiatus for a while now, and even when the author's actively writing it, it doesn't exactly come out at a blistering pace. That said, I won't be satisfied until literally everybody has read this fic, and I'm never gonna miss a chance to recommend it.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
