Does anyone get confused when they read fan fica where in one a character is a mythic bitch and in the next one they are super nice? Is that just me?


** For me it's switching from one fic to a very similar fic. Like it makes me doubt what I remember and what events happened in which fic.

Also going from a bashing fic to a non-bashing fic. When I find a fic that has a good relationship between Harry and dumbledore i'm like: what?

** For me it's when the tic seems like a never ending sentence, even though it has punctuation, one thought leads to another and another, and it doesn't seem to end!
