So I'm writing a story that has a sex scene in it. The question is, how much of it should I put in the story, if any at all? Should I have a quick little one or two word warning before it starts or should I keep it completely out of the story? Feedback, as always, is greatly appreciated!


** As others have said, if it's important to the story, put it in. If not, leave it out. But don't do a warning--that's just going to take the reader out of the story. Imagine if you were reading along, totally into it and then: WARNING SEXYTIMES AHEAD.

Honestly, if you're going to have sexytimes in your story, the writing itself should lead up to it. If you're surprising people with sex, well, you need to do some reevaluating and editing.

***** Agreed, but they are still better than an in-story warning (immersion breaking as fuck IMHO...that's like playing a computer game or watching a movie and suddenly having a warning sign pop up! Nah, get that thing out of there!)...I'd prefer a warning the summary! ("Will contain smut! Consider yourselves warned!")

****** I disagree. If the story has the appropriate rating, then the reader should expect descriptions of sex. If I see a big old E on the rating and a romance tag, then I have a pretty good idea of what I'm in for. Anything else to me seems like coddling. If I pick up a book in a store, I don't expect Stephen King or Neil Gaiman to list a big old bunch of trigger warnings and a warning about a sex scene somewhere in the middle. I expect a good story.

******* Yeah, but on ffn the rating system /sucks/.

An M-rated fic could be M for anything from a single character saying shit one time in chapter 3 to a graphic non-con scene or anything inbetween.

/Technically/ the ratings are fairly clearly defined, but frankly that's bullshit that's rarely enforced.

******** Then it's up to the author to provide a useful summary. If the author wants to make sure the reader knows what they're in for, then they need to be upfront about the story in the summary. Author's notes at the beginning are just an attempt to compensate for a poor summary.

Was I mad that Peter V Brett's /Warded Man/ had a rape scene? No--I was surprised, but I wasn't angry that the author didn't have a note at the beginning of the book or a note at the beginning of the chapter. That's the beauty of reading stories--you don't know what's going to happen. Stephen King surprised the shit out of me as a high schooler for killing off characters I was sure had plot armor; something that had never happened to me and it was thrilling.

I read The Call of the Wild and White Fang in elementary school. Completely savage and beautiful and absolutely no warning. In fact, I think my copy of Call of the Wild had an illustration of a St Bernard pulling a sled--talk about false advertising.

My point is that I think people are too sensitive to story content these days and are not willing to take a risk or they feel betrayed when a story doesn't go the way they think it should and because it's fan fiction, they think they get a say in how they think the author should have behaved. This is not the case. I'm firmly in the 'if you don't like it, then don't read it' camp, but don't feel betrayed when an author does something you don't like or agree with.

** If I'm writing a sex scene, I do a bit of thinking first.

Why is this sex scene here? What information about the characters or the context am I trying to give the reader in this scene, and is there another way to do it? It could be as simple as /Character X wants someone else to take the lead for once/ or /Character Y is quite aggressive/, or /Character Z gets distracted easily/ but what would a sex scene here add to the understanding of the characters?

If there IS going to be a sex scene, I think about the people in it. They have their own way of thinking about sex, they have their own quirks and habits. They have things they like, things they don't like, things they'd maybe like to try but haven't yet. This should be reflected in word usage - Molly and Arthur Weasley have had seven kids, they clearly have a pretty healthy and active sex life...but can you imagine either of them using the word “cock” without giggling? How graphic would the characters you have in mind be, if they were thinking about sex? Even in the middle of a pretty hot and heavy moment, they should still be recognisable as characters who interact with each other, not just sex dolls that you're posing.

Is this going to be angry sex? Does someone want comfort, and if so what would that comfort be like? Passionate sex? Happy giggly laughing silly sex?

Don't put a warning in the middle of the chapter. Having one before the chapter starts is fine if you feel you need one, but putting it in the middle disturbs the flow.

** I'm going to offer a contra-point to all the "it has to be relevant to the plot" comments around here. Even if you aren't writing a smut fic it is IMHO perfectly okay to titillate or just include a sex scenes if it feels right or might be fun to read. There doesn't have to be some kind of huge character arc or conclusion of a plotline in order to include it and, to be perfectly frank, a lot of comments here sound a bit high and mighty and ridiculous.

If you're writing a story for adults and there's some kind of important relationship between the main character and a love interest you should definitely include the sex, as it can offer some kind of closure or satisfying conclusion for the reader. It doesn't have to have any more meaning than that. We don't apply these ridiculous standards to other mundane interactions that are much more meaningless than sex, so why this double standard? "Harry takes Hermione out out to dinner on a date, but I'm not going to write about it, because it isn't important enough!111"

I can think of plenty movies, tv shows or books that feature more or less unnecessary sex scenes and I think it's pretty snobby to thumb your nose at that.

*** Yeah they treat it as a good thing, but tbh in the story it's kind of a source of repulsion and evil. I'm not going to go deep into details, but the scene is supposed to indicate a bit of a bad thing that causes problems.

*** Perhaps "relevant to the plot" isn't necessary, but "relevant to the characters" usually is.

A sex scene where you could find-and-replace the characters names with totally different people and it wouldn't make a difference usually isn't a very good sex scene. They're not blank slates.

**** You're right. I just wanted to move the discussion in another direction. If you just write one repetitive gratuitous sex scene after another (without *any* good reason) it better be a smut fic and you better be good at writing smut. Obviously that would be kinda shit in a story that doesn't focus on porn.

** If you're writing a smutfic, multiple Lemons are perfectly normal. But do prepare to get some shit from whichever site you're posting on. If you're writing a romance fic, a few lemons are fine, especially if its used to show the progress of the relationship.

** Depends on how important it is to either the plot, the characters, or the world. Write what you're comfortable with, and then see if removing it has any effect on the stories or the characters. If it does, leave it in, since it's obviously important to one of those aspects. If it doesn't, then don't put it in, since it's just padding.

** The (detailed, graphic) sex scene should do something necessary to the story, and it should be necessary that it /be/ a (detailed, graphic) sex scene to convey that information.

If not, but you want to write a really hot scene to either satisfy yourself, or because you think it will make a real difference to the story but find, after writing, that it doesn't do anything you couldn't do another way, then, by all means write it, but then publish as a separate shortfic to the appropriate place, with just enough lead in to justify the scene. IME, if you're in the mood for a sex scene, then you'll go and hunt it out. If you're not in the mood, then it turns into something you skip past - unless it's necessary to the story, obviously, but that's already been covered.

Absolutely no lemon warnings mid-chapter, none, please! I've been hurled out of stories where that's done, although less often than I've been brutally ripped from the flow of a story by 'START FLASHBACK' and 'END FLASHBACK'.

** Well, I have no problem with lemons (you could even say: I enjoy them quite a bit if well written - but I mostly read well written stories, so that is kind of a given that the lemons are ok, too)! They spice up things, which is good (I enjoy my tea with a squeeze of lime, too (not always but often!))

Go for it, mate! Go for it!

Don't put them above the plot and you'll do great IMHO :)

Also: Unlike others I don't want a warning in the story (that is immersion breaking...my mind is engaged in re-creating those scenes for me to "watch" and suddenly some warning sign shows up? Nah, don't! RL goes without warning signs before sex, too!), put that in the description/summary!

Same goes for "surprise sex" because in RL we have one night stands (ONS) and they aren't always (hell, I bet most aren't) planned (your characters aren't planning what is happening 24/7 (would be boring to read as well!) so sponteneity is GOOD)
