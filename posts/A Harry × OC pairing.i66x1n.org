I'm tired of all of the pairings between canon characters so I would like one between Harry and OC. Only a few conditions: Preferably 100k+ (or with sequels), must be complete or not abandoned and no slash, only M/F pairings. Thanks in advance. P.S. I hope my definition of OC is correct and it means the writer's own character and not a canon character :)


** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me]])

Romance between Harry/OC. I highly recommend this fic.

Edit: Turns out I have no clue whether or not it's complete. But this fic is almost legendary in the Harry Potter fandom.

  During his childhood, Harry hated being with his aunt and uncle at Privet Drive. Yet there was always the one person who made him happy, who made it bearable. Mia Thatcher was his first and best friend, and nothing could pull them apart. What happens when they both receive letters from Hogwarts? What adventures will they face and will they pull through together?

Harry Potter and The Other Path by Fez8745

Hard to describe without giving too much away. Harry runs away from the Dursleys and lives the years up to Hogwarts homeless on the streets of London. Enters Hogwarts with a totally different mindset as canon. He's adventurous, confident, a trickster, daring, and a lot more hidden below the surface.

The summers between school he goes on little adventures around Europe mostly.

There is an early pairing with Susan Bones, but it really is just a stop on the way to the pairing with the OC.

Lot of other OCs and many many twists.

**** This is one of my favorites because it is all 7 years and they are pretty quick reads but filled with information and everything a fic should be. Whenever I'm suggesting someone to start reading HP fan fictions, I tell them to start with this one.

Also the pairing builds like an actual relationship should be with problems and errors that occur as a teenager. But it's still Harry Potter which means it's a relationship that probably wouldn't happen if he wasn't who he is.

******* I try to keep the nr of fics I'm simultaneously reading to a minimum simply because I keep confusing them. At one point, I was following about 10 at oncw but I ended up so confused I just abandoned all of them for a while. Thus, during quarantine, I'm binging complete works, usually about a 100k+ fic a day + a short crack fic or two. Right now I'm reading You Were Always There and it's a sequel fic so after I finish allnof the parts, I'll move onto The Other Path. What are you currently reading?
