*** New headcanon: The whole "technology doesn't work in Hogwarts" thing comes from a ward that was added by a founder or headmaster who had some skill in divination and saw that Netflix, smartphones, and the like would kill every students' desire to study.

****** A. That's extremely ableist

B. As we all know, Harry is /extremely unobservant/

C. Muggleborns and Halfbloods

D. Even if you argue â€˜magic' the fact remains that a significant portion of disabled people would stay disabled if they had the choice. I'm one of them.

******* And that does not change the fact that for all we know people with disabilities might be banned from attending Hogwarts, like those with lycanthropy...

*** HP Fans: So what that Ron did the chess, went to face giant spiders, went down to the chamber of secrets, confronted who he thought to be a mass murderer with a broken leg, joined the DA, followed Harry into the DoM, faced Death Rates when they attacked Hogwarts, infiltrated the Ministry, etc... The dude left Harry in DH, he's a coward!

Also HP Fans: I stayed up to 3 am watching Netflix at home.

** With stacks of books on the table and all their homework done for the week. Lmfao, even the 16 year old Quidditch players said the DA couldn't conflict with Quidditch.

** Is this like a thing for most people? Cause as a middle schooler I had study groups just like that and yeah that's exactly what happened except for one time this dude was late by 5 minutes And we had music but yeah that's not unreasonable to me

*** Yeah, I think some people underestimate how concerned about school some middle school students can be. When I was that age I was obsessed with good grades and studied constantly. I find it strange when kids in fanfic act like mini adults, but studying a lot isn't particularly abnormal for teenagers
