My favorite author deleted all her works and accounts from the internet and now I find myself in need of new authors/fics to read. I accept all femslash ships and I have a preference for dark fics (specially the ones where a character who is good turns dark).

** linkffn(A butterfly effect by SlyGoddess)

Sadly unfinished, and the author is having some serious health problems so no clue if it will finish or not. If you're looking for smut, it isn't that.
