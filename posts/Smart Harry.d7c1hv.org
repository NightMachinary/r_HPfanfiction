Simple enough request a Harry that instead of only being really good at DADA... you have a Harry that loves to learn and reads anything he gets his hands on. Possibly (and optionally) with eidetic memory and the ability to speed read.

I read one that had Harry already graduated from, at least, muggle high school by the time he gets his Hogwarts letter.

Doesn't have to be a Ravenclaw Harry... could just be a Harry that has more in common with Hermione than he does with Ron.

Beyond "smart" Harry there's no other real conditions. He could be a she for all I care. Optionally though i'd prefer he wasn't evil... Dark? Maybe. Evil? I'd really prefer he wasn't but it's not necessarily a deal killer.

*** Pretty much yeah but even being an asshole isn't necessarily a deal breaker. Like I said i'm good with dark, even asshole-ish... i'm just rather wary of "Evil" Harry who kills Voldemort and basically takes his place as the new psychotic "i'm going to kill or torture most of you!" dark lord or worse joins forces with Voldemort as his right-hand man.

**** I've included a list of a few of my favorites with a Smart!Harry. That said, you may wish to consider the search bar for smart!Harry as there's been a few requests for this topic just this month. They may give additional results that you may be interested in. :)

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi is an AU where HP isn't the BWL nor did James and Lily die. Lily encourages Harry to read and learn about magic from a young age.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

The Art of Self-Fashioning has a smart Harry who's position is switched with Neville (ie Nev is the BWL and Harry's parents are in St. Mungo's). As Harry still is raised by the Dursleys he doesn't realize that his parents are alive. When he does, he immediately focuses all his efforts to try and heal them.

linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning)

If him being a jerk is not a dealbreaker, try HPMOR. It has a smart and arrogant Harry (which puts a lot of readers off) and arguably the best-written Voldemort in fanfiction (if anybody here disagrees with that statement, they can counter rec a fic with a better written Voldemort ;) ). There's a lot of fun stuff in that one too.

** Linkffn(8551180) pretty much replaced his personality with that of Stein from Soul Eater. He views everything as an experiment and works towards whatever scientific research catches his interest.

Pretty good read for the most part (later chapters feel a bit off, and the sequel I couldn't get into.)

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

yeah, well, how many people have heard of something doesn't make it good.

Personally, I think it's quite possibly the worst piece of fanfiction ever written.

That one troll Christian fanfic, and the My Immortal are better, if only because they aren't dreadfully dull and arrogant.

**** One would hope that being popular and being good is correlated, but you are right it isnt universally true. One might consider, that the subreddit of hpmor is about a Third the size of the this subreddit, to be a better sign of quality. I know, that the fic is either loved or hated, and so try and give objective information, and I even give a warning, for the most common reason for disliking it.
