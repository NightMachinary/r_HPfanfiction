Would love to see a scene that's similar to the final battle in the movie Dark city.

Not with the duelist's glaring at each other of course. But initially Aurors and order of the phoenix are fighting a big epic battle with death eaters.

But they stop fighting and possibly even come to a temporary truce just to save their own lives from the sheer carnage of the Harry/Voldy duel.


** linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal) has an overpowered climactic fight scene, though it's not exactly what you're looking for---the Aurors and Death Eaters are fighting simultaneously elsewhere.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
