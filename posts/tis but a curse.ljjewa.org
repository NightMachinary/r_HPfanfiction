"upon reciving the elder wand harry became the master of death. it took 2 weeks before he realized what a curse this was. for the master of death makes you the one responsible for ensuring people kick the bucket per say. no matter how hard he tried to resist. despite every last ditch effort. he was forced to take the life of his best friend." (or for a darker take. "his godson").
