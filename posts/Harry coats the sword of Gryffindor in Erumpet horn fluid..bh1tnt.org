** Wingardium Leviosa! You want this sword far away from anything you want to keep, like your face. You want it floating in mid-air at all times, and maneuvered with accio/banishing/effectively telekinetic. Would take some practice but would be quite lethal once you got there. It's not really a sword anymore so much as a reusable missile.

** An explosiv sword would be kinda pointless though, since the explosion would counteract your swing.

I spent a good few minutes thinking about possible uses, but other than makeshift battering rams, there is no reason why you'd want your sword to explode on impact. And even then you'd want the explosion further away than a yard from your face.

I mean, you could use it as makeshift reactive armour to neutralise HEAT warheads, but I doubt that the Death Eaters went to the former Warsaw Pact and bought themselves RPGs.

*** True, I had imagined it more like a gravity hammer. Though explosive fencing sounds fun aswell.

**** Not sure if you'd want a sword as base for that though. You get much better striking power with an actual hammerhead.

*** Maybe if it could be somehow enchanted to direct the explosion away from the wielder.

**** Then perhaps Fiendfyre would be the better choice to absorb. Or a big laser.

****** Well, Basilisk venom didn't work. Although it remains questionable how useful a flamethrower sword would be.

** I would think it would work like an Erumpet Horn. Inject something.. it go boom. Kinda like in the movie.. but more boom. Combine that with the Basilisk Venom... and you got a dying person being dragged away, turned into a handy dandy bomb.

** As said before, it would make an explosive sword. Problem with it is :

It's a sword, hard to cut anything when the sword make boom everytime you want to it something, may be used as an explosive weapon but something like a mace would probably be more suited\\
Since it explodes, will the sword resist the explosions (Goblin work so probably)? And more importantly, will the user be able to resist the explosion that happen at mere cm from his face, and to not get his arm shattered by the shock?

But then again, Goblin weapon only absorms what make them stronger, and magic in HP is a lot about intent. So would the sword absorbs the fluid in the first place since it may make it weaker?

*** Fantastic Beasts showed that Erumpets inject the explosive, so it could take that property.
