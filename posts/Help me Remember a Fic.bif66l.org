:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Randomly popped into my head. The only bit I can remember is that Harry is talking about various characters and the key to understanding their motivations. He describes Hermione as being a bit of a psychopath, and not being able to tell the difference between a prank and killing your pet - which is why she always makes sure to follow the rules so religously.


** For anyone curious, I had a bit of inspiration and was able to remember it came from The Dark Lord's equal linkffn(6763981).

Here's the bit I was talking about in Chapter 4:

  With Hermione, you've got to realise her little flaw. She's not evil, it's just that she has a bit of trouble telling the difference between turning a person's hair green for a joke, and killing their dog. It is because of this little problem that she always follows the rules strictly, so as to never be caught out.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** I'm pretty sure that this is Seventh Horcrux linkffn(10677106).

The bit you're remembering happens in chapter 13.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

*** That's not the one I remember. Interesting that the same concept came up here as well though. I'm fairly sure the one I'm referencing specifically mentioned her not being able to tell the difference between a prank and murdering a pet, or something similar.
