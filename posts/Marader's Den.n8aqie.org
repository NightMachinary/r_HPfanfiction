I remember reading some FF where Harry goes through Veil after becoming Master of Death and is incredibly vexed by how wizarding world just doesnt change. So after going through the Veil he comes into Avengers world he buys a building and start a Marauder's Den Bar. But of course it wouldnt be Harry to live a quiet life.

So i am looking for something similar. Kind of OP Harry just wanting to be left alone, but failing.
