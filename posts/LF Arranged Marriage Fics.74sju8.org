Kind of self explanatory but I love arranged marriage fics! Preferably no slash but other than that, tell me your favs! :)

Edit: Marriage law fics also acceptable!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345), is a rare Harry/Ginny arranged marriage fic, quite fun and lots of Dumbledore/Molly bashing.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

** For me it has to be Runic Animagi linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi]])

Is a Harry/Daphne fic that is done and worked great, the contract is practically a side-subplot really, but it is used as an initial tool to link the characters and the characterization from there is gold in my opinion (if maybe a bit quick.) so... Yeah, I love it.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

*** I couldn't really get through this one. The main angst of the fic is them circling around each other, it just feels like the author wanted to pad the fic out a bit...

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10667749/1/The-Injunction][The Injunction]] is a Hermione/George marriage law fic that I liked. Word of warning though, it is very very fluffy and I only recommend it for when you need the warmest hug of a fic. It's EWE in the most fan service way in that everyone lives happily ever after and the biggest conflicts are small misunderstandings (like George accidentally laughing at Hermione). The writing is good, but there is no real thrust to the plot at all - it really is just fan service.
