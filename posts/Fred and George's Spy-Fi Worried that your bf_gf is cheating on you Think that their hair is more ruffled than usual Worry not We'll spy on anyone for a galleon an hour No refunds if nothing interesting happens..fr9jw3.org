Pretty much what it says in the title. Could be interesting if they discover a cheating triangle. Possibilities are endless. After all, the Marauder's Map is such a powerful tool.


** Fred and George really missed out here, they wouldn't have need Harry's investment if they had thought of this. I really want to read F+G as world-class super spy's now.

*** I'd love a sort of “trailer” prologue with ridiculous spy stuff, then hard cut in the next chapter of them just sitting and checking the Marauders' Map constantly, because honestly it does 90% of the legwork for them if they're trying to spy on Hogwarts students
