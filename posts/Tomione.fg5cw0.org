  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)

** I think one of the best Tomione resources is Tomione Finds on Tumblr.

They help people find Tomione fics [[https://tomionefinds.tumblr.com][(link here)]], so they have a pretty good collection of stories.

They don't use warnings on the page itself, so you'll need to check what each story is tagged with though. In my experience, Tomione can get a bit dark so if you're not into that you should definitely pay attention to the tags.
