I've been trying to find a fanfiction that i read ages ago, but cannot find it. It contained:

- Snape getting a letter, which leads him to check on harry (pre-hogwarts)

- being taught by the Flamels, Snape and Mcgonagall

- Evil Dumbledore (with Arther Weasley and wormtail helping him)

- Dumbledore can speak parseltongue

- and Fawkes is actually a spy for Flamel

that is all the main points that i can remember. if any of you guys can tell me whats the name of the fanfiction, it would me much appreciated.


** Found it, it's was 'harry potter and the power unknown' by priya ashok
