The best harry owns voldermort, gets all the girls, can do magic no one else can and/or anything else from godly to cracky all are welcome. Everyone needs a good wish fullfillment story every once in a while.


** The best fic by far, in my opinion, in this genre is the 3 part Where in the World is Harry Potter series starting with linkffn(2354771). Just make sure to read them in order

*** Well, anything by nonjon really. He writes fun OP-Harry stories where he also includes some action and kicks ass. /A Black Comedy/ by /nonjon/ also comes to mind.

  [HIATUS - Read Profile!] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

** linkffn(Angry Harry and the Seven by Sinyk)

It's full of Lord Potter wank and a hilariously stupid manipulative!Dumbledore.

It even makes canon stuff really tropey. Undetected extension charm? No, that's /Wizard's Space/...

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
