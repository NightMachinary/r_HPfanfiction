The best and most realistic part of Cursed Child was Harry Potter being a complete rubbish parent. It makes perfect sense. He had a terrible traumatic childhood and adolescence that he never dealt with canonically, all his father figures other than Arthur Weasley were either dead, seriously (geddit?) flawed, or incapable of being what he needed. He also rushed into a marriage with his best friend's sister who looks like his mother so there's that. I want to read fics where he is a flawed father, Sure, he can still love his kids, but I want to read a fic that's more realistic than idealistic. This doesn't mean I want to read Harry Bashing. I'd just like to read fics where he has to work on his relationship with his family, and where there is a real struggle with his family life. I love domestic noir.


** I'm sorry, despite the "Request" Tag, I don't have any story in mind. I'm just there to correct a misconception : Ginny does NOT look like Lily.

It's something you often see in fanfiction because they both have "red hairs", but they look nothing alike. Ginny is a petite girl with flaming red hairs, bright brown eyes and a freckled complexion. While Lily has dark red hairs and extremely distinctive green eyes. The only thing they has in common is that they are both described as "attractive".

*** i really don't get why people use that, there's plenty of other excuses to separate Harry and Ginny other then "she looks like Harry's mother because she's a ginger"
