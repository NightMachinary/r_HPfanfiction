#+TITLE: Your typical story where an older, war-hardened Harry gets sent back in time to fix his mistakes, get the girl and save the world... right? That's how the story usually plays out. Just, not this time.

/A Ghost of Good Intentions/ by Loquatorious

Link to story: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26014120/chapters/63252160]]

A short story I wrote exploring a different take on a well-worn trope of HP fanfiction. Can't give too much away without spoiling the twist but to those who have read these kinds of stories and want to see something new, this is the story for you. Does have a heavy Harry/Hermione focus so if you're just not into that, turn away.

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  We all know the story, we all know how it goes. However, a life is never lived by just one person, and pain is never easy to conceal from someone who knows you better than yourself. So when Harry wakes up from an episode... different than usual, Hermione makes it her mission to get to the bottom of it.
