Hey! I'm really sorry for self promoting but I'd really like to hear your guy's opinion on my story- it's not finished yet but I'm working on it, the more readers the more motivation! ðŸ˜Š

Here it is:

** I'm always happy to review and give my opinion, but I'm a harsh critic. Are you sure you want my advice in particular? I rip everything I read to shreds. Some end up being 10/10 most end up with a score below a 5. But I'll gladly read it and give you my opinion.

If I'm reading it as a review I'll do so as objectively as possible. In the sense that I won't rate a fic 1/10 because I don't like the main pairing. I'll rate it based on how the romance was written.

*** Oh boy- I'd really like it if you read it, I don't mind harsh criticism either. There isn't really any romance yet, but I hope to add some (a whole ton, once I start I can't finish) I really haven't done much (3-4 chapters) so the story isn't quite flowing yet! I hope you enjoy it, warning you though- it might be a little cliche, but I'm trying to make it original. Bye! Thank you for considering my story.
