Interested in seeing how Harry having moderate or traditional political views.

Edit: looking more at the pure blood and pagan traditions of the wizarding world. Would also like to see Harry being more in line with the traditions of the wizarding world and how that effects the plot/characters.

** I mean, Wizarding Tradition seems to mostly be 'kill all the muggleborn' in canon, so could you be a lil' more specific? Might help folks find some specific stuff for you.

Like, do you want pagan-rituals level traditional, pureblood bigotry level traditional, medieval-gentry-esque traditional views, thinly-veiled-Christianity traditional, etc?

And do you want those beliefs to play a large part in the plot/character development arc, or is it being a secondary or minor passing issue okay too?

That's rather fanon, actually. In canon, the pureblood faction doesn't actually fight for the sake of tradition. Instead, we see plenty of Wizarding traditions, and Harry and co do participate in them. Hogwarts alone has a lot of traditions: the express, the first year boat trip and ghost scare, the sorting ceremony. In society in general they have a unique dress style - robes, traditional sports - Quidditch. Using parchment and quills for writing is probably for tradition's sake as well. Likely there are plenty more, they simply aren't the focus.

**** Yeah, In fanon writers tend to white wash Voldemort's side with the whole “preserve Wizarding traditions and culture”

In canon most of the hatred towards muggleborn was because of their background. There was only one line I think where Malfoy talked about how they didn't know traditions and the wizarding world. Afterwards that stance seemed to be dropped by JKR and she was pretty explicit that most of the hatred was because of bigotry. We don't really see any more lines about Wizarding culture being erased, etc

So a more traditional Harry would be less accepting of Muggle culture and ideas (ie not listening to Muggle music or wearing their clothes).

He might also have a more negative view of muggles and those with muggle relations as well

Alternatively, a more traditional Harry could have a pretty positive view of muggles and those with muggle relations, and egalitarian ethics. However, he would explore wizarding culture more than in canon. He may be more interested in History of magic. He would have probably read "The Tales of Beedle the Bard" before the Deathly Hallows. He may participate in old rituals (that have cultural significance, not huge magical benefits - if they had huge magical benefits, everyone would participate, traditional or not). Learn wizard folklore songs and dances.

**** True - I admit, I was being a tad facetious to make a point that 'traditional' is vague and subject to interpretation. Though Tradition is definitely one of the more interesting aspects of Rowling's world, given the longevity of wizards - culture passed down through the generations takes on a different tone when your great, great aunt could still be alive and active in government while you're in school. I do wonder what that kind of multi-generational pressure to conform might've been like.

Huh. Now I think about it, that might actually make for an interesting fic. Snippet-scenes of the static, stagnant wizards watching the rapid advancements and changes made by muggles through the muggleborn arriving in their world.

Anyway, I would also argue that 'kill all the muggleborn' is partly tradition as well, given that it was so prevalent 'muggle-baiting' was a thing (ie. it was a solid presence in Wizarding Culture, like Mafia Activity was a tradition for the Corleone's in The Godfather) and that level of bigotry has been passed down through the generations (Abraxas-Lucius-Draco, for one example, the Blacks for another), so it fits the definition of tradition as well.

** linkffn(Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven) and its sequels focus quite heavily on tradition, with it being a rift between Harry and Sirius for a while. It does an interesting seperation between blood purism and traditionalism (i.e. actually having Voldemort shit on tradition, with his followers being visibly displeased by it, but too afraid to speak up.)

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
