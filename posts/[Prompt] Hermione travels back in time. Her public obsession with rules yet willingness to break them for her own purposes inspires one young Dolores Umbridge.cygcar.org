e.g. Hermione's afraid of getting expelled, yet sabotages a potion in Snape's class and steals ingredients to brew illegal potions because she /suspects/ Malfoy's the heir of Slytherin.

Compare to Umbridge's "What Fudge doesn't know won't hurt him."

Bonus points if Hermione thinks inspiring Umbridge is a /good/ thing, because she's forgotten that time travel is a stable time loop.


** "You're a fucking moron Hermione."

Hermione looked taken aback.

"Excuse me Harry!"

"Yes, it's your fault that fucking Umbridge is like how she is. I accepted your slightly hypocritical goody two-shoes attitude because of your loyalty, but you're the reason we had a teacher who tortures children. Frankly, I shouldn't be surprised."

"I was trying to make her a better person!'

"Time Travel is a closed loop! Anything that happens already happened. What did you think happened with the dementors and the patronus? It's just like you to assume you're right with no evidence. I could forgive you for a lot, but Umbridge, no."

*** One could argue that in a universe where time travel is a closed loop that free will is an illusion and, as such, no one is responsible for anything.

**** Only for actions taken with a time-turner, and even then that's murky at best.
