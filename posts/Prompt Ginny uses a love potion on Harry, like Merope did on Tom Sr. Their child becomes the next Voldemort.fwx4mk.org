Disclaimer: It's been a while since I read the books and I'm not going passage hunting for a shower thought, so I might get some things wrong about canon. Also, I am by no means a psychologist/psychiatrist.

One of the factors Dumbledore believed to lead to Tom Riddle's ascent/descent into Voldemort was that he was conceived with his father under the influence of a love potion, and therefore was totally incapable of feeling love himself.

What's interesting about this though is that the nature vs nurture debate could be explored. Was Riddle born that way, or was it a due to his upbringing as the strange child in the orphanage that lead to his evil. Was there some childhood trauma there such as an exorcism or abuse like some fics suggest? If so, is it the sole cause of his mentality, or did it merely exacerbate what was already there? Is Harry's child fated to be the same way, or could the way they were raised make a difference?

Whether or not the child is extremely magically gifted and becomes a powerful wizard/witch or not, I'm more interested in the theoretical psychological effects on the child, and perhaps the historical parallels between Tom, Harry, and Harry's Child.

Say for example, Ginny does what Merope does, and after she falls pregnant/the child is born, she stops giving Harry the potion. Does Harry leave Ginny, and if so, does he also abandon the child? Does he leave Ginny to her prison sentence or whatever happens, and takes the child with him, or does he stay with them both despite being tricked/influenced? If the child is abandoned by Harry and Ginny is no longer in the picture, does the child go to one of the Weasleys? To an orphanage? To Dudley?

There are already similarities between Harry and Tom, and it would be interesting to see it continue for a third 'generation' so to speak. Because seriously, if the Dursleys were a bit more abusive, Harry could have been the second coming of Voldemort himself, or at least hated/feared muggles, if we are looking at it from a nurture point of view.

Alternatively, you ignore the nature/nurture thing and just accept Dumbledore was right, and write about Harry's kid being a Dark Lord/Lady

TLDR, Is harry's kid mental from a love potion, or can they be raised to not murder people.

Discussion welcome in the comments of course


** Sometimes, a woman and man love each other very much. Sometimes, the man stops loving the woman, for some reason or another. Maybe she doesn't understand that a certain part of him can't help but try to save others, needlessly at the risk of his own life, or maybe she doesn't understand that he isn't a man to settle down and retire, but a man to die in battle some day against an opponent he finally couldn't win against.

Unfortunately for Harry Potter, his wife happened to be one of these women. And when things went down the drain, bit by bit - he had always felt a bit of reluctance, after the shellshock of Voldemort's body lying against the ground, cold and lifeless. Harry had never felt the same, after that, but maybe that was just him experiencing death, in a way. It made fearing it seem so immature.

Either way, Harry's concerns were slowly drowned out. It wasn't particularly strong, no, but Ginny was desperate, and maybe she had learned a few things from Tom after all. Just a few things to convince him to keep going, she told herself, but then it turned out to be another dose, and another. It was just so nice to feel loved.

Then she was pregnant, and she felt so terribly guilty. Like a cold, coiled serpent in her heart had started to melt into who she was at her core, realizing what she had done, and she felt horror. She wished she could blame this on another diary, another smooth whispering voice, but there was none but the voice in her own head.

So she fled. Ginny would've been a pariah in the eyes of her family, in the eyes of everyone, if she had stayed. Most of all, Harry would have looked at her like she was a monster. Ever since he had learned the tale of little Tom Riddle he had always viewed love potions with disgust, and yet, to someone who had been raised with joking ones that also ensured that it wouldn't go beyond cheek-kissing.. It wasn't so bad.

Thus, Harry was left to only remember what she had done, and to never know his own child would be born to a terribly guilty mother who would never be a good one, like this.

This is the story that a child is told by that guilty mother, though more delicately and less raw, because she could not bear hiding it from him. That child's eyes only grow colder and colder, no matter how many quiet stories of his father he hears or tales of the foe he faced.

Ginny, on the other hand, just wished she could see something, anything of Harry inside him, not the brown eyes of her mother that seemed so much darker on her child. His hair was his color, she supposed, but it had none of the messiness and only a curl that reminded her, again, of a face she only saw in her nightmares.

She, among all else, felt worse than ever for being afraid of her own child. She was ashamed, incredibly so, knowing that he had to get a makeshift wand that would probably simply stop working in his lifetime, knowing he knew that his mother barely got by. He probably thought that Harry Potter was a fantasy to make him feel better about having no father.

For whatever reason, however, that boy suddenly latched onto the stories. But only the stories about the war, never about Harry himself. Only the darkest moments when he had faced against Lord Voldemort, but never the moments of light that he had regained strength.

Bit by bit, a child who was born distant walked farther and farther away as he grew older. Maybe there was a mistake in two people touched by horcruxes having a child together. Because magic of the soul is finicky, and some things should be left alone.

Ginny could not particularly stop him from doing what he wanted - these days, she felt more like a squib than a witch, but that in particular is something she should've stopped and thought about - but even she couldn't stand idly by as he grew more and more into something she didn't want to see. But what room did she have to fight, with the future had she given him, with his father knowing nothing of his existence and Ginny being who she was?

Somehow, a kindhearted but brave and strong-willed woman had turned into this. It was not any remnant of a horcrux, or anything that she could not discover. She was the one who hadn't looked out for her child and what exactly he was doing in the dark crannies of the night, who had learned that magic was at its most malleable when one was young. And theoretically it could be stolen for someone else, but that would be a terrible thing to do.

Dark magic, but when had the boy-who-was-abandoned ever cared about that? It was funny, he supposed, how he was more invigorated by the bits of story about the villain his father faced rather than his father himself. Hallows and Horcruxes, and were those really anything a child should know about?

One Hallow was already his birthright. And Tom Riddle had made mistakes he did not intend to follow through with. But he almost wished there was still some phantom of Tom left, so he could converse, maybe, just .. see what he was. More than the insane madman he had been.

But that didn't matter, now. Power flowed through his veins, both his and stolen from someone weak and unworthy, and this was exactly what was right. But maybe a child just resented someone who had stopped him from feeling like he had anything but despair in his future, too. Maybe he resented someone who had feared him just slightly since he smiled a certain way and his features developed in a certain manner.

So as Ginny stared on in horror, the young man raised his new wand that was truly meant for him. And he said the words that had changed his father's life forever, knowing they would do the same for him, too.

( wanted to take an actual try at the prompt, lmao, hopefully its welcome )

*** This is amazing, great take on Ginny's rationalization of using the potion.

**** Thanks! I didn't want a carbon copy of Tom's background, but also wanted something to happen that could feasibly cause that kind of bitterness in a child. And two horcrux-touched people making a child being possibly bad was just a bit of my own touch.

** I believe the way the child is raised could be a major factor, say being conceived under a love potion did prevent Voldemort from feeling love, he was then still raised in an environment that brought out the worst in him. Let's imagine instead of going to the orphanage, Merope was found by a lovely wizarding couple who adopted Tom after she died, he would still never be able to love someone, but he would grow up knowing love and not feeling like an outsider.

And even if he did still show psycho/sociopathic tendencies, he'd be a lot better off than in the orphanage whose policy just seemed to be to ignore it and hope it goes away.
