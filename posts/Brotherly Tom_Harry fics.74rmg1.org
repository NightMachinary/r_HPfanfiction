Does anybody know of any fics with Tom and Harry growing up together as brothers through some sort of time travel? I really liked the start of Colubrina's Unlikely Brothers, linkffn(12505708).

Unfortunately, she is not sure if she is going to continue with the story or not, so my craving for this pair of parseltongue speaking orphans going to Hogwarts together has not been satisfied.


** You bet I do. List mostly features time-travel (though sometimes other situations as well).

Twist of Fate, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5925524/]])

Old Souls, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7319686/]])

Chocolate Frogs and Time Turners, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5992579/1/Chocolate-Frogs-and-Time-Turners]])

(kind of fits:) In Wonderland, linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10241474][www.fanfiction.net/s/10241474]])

Rewritten, linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5924098]])

Rebirth, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth]])

Fire Born, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9081608/]]) -- fem HP.

*** A couple of those look like they might be right what I'm looking for. I'm not opposed to slash if it's not made a big deal but my main focus with this request is that brotherly relationship from going through the orphanage/early life/ early Hogwarts together. Would you say that most of the slash fics you posted fit with that?

**** Okay, most of those aren't actively slash or slash at all -- in fact, I'd say the only fic really focused on slash of the lot is Rebirth, but it /is/ by Athey, after all.

Twist of Fate says it's slash, but it doesn't really come into play until later on (and considering that it's 700k words long, that's a lot of /later/). Honestly, I reckon that for most of those 700k words, you could skip the actively slash parts and come out none the wiser.

Old Souls & Chocolate Frogs and Time Turners aren't slash.

Fire Born isn't slash (technically, by the virtue of fem!HP), & does focus on their relationship in the orphanage; the fic overall is kind of trite, but whatever.

In Wonderland is slash, but it's only really evident in the prologue -- though I guess it isn't two parseltongue orphans at Hogwarts; adoptive big brother and a little brother is more accurate, for the most part.

Rewritten is more brotherly/generally familial than slash, for the most part.

Rebirth is blatantly slash -- and, quite frankly, the exception out of the list -- but still focuses on a more brotherly relationship early on.
