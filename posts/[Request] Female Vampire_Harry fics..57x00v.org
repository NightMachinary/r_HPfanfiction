Haven't read the (just uploaded) second chapter yet but the first was pretty entertaining.

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.

  AU Harry disappears ten years ago, from his relatives. When he comes back he is not the innocent boy everyone knows. The Boy Who Lived, grew up differently than anyone would have imagined. He's not the goody goody way to polite boy from Number Four, he's a sarcastic, arrogant little twit, who has love deep down and wants to be loved. But can he open up to anyone around him?
