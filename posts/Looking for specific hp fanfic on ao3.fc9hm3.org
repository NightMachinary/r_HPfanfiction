I'm looking for a specific fic, I think it's only on ao3. It takes place during 5th year and involves immortal (?) female Salazar Slytherin coming to Hogwarts as a student, she claims to be part of some sort of royal line in another country I believe in order to get umbridge fired after a the blood quill is used on her. After that, also immortal Godric Gryffindor takes over as dada teacher (the two of them are married). There's also some building up to drarry and alternative classes like art, as well I think in the end harry goes with the two of them over the summer.

If anyone knows what fic this is I would be very grateful. Thank you :)
