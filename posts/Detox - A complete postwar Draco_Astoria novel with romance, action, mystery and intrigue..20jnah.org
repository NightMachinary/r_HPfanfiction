*** I'm glad you enjoyed it. If you liked that one, you might also like Marked, by the same author.

** 8/10. A nice little novella that bridges the end of DH and the epilogue. The entire thing felt like something JK Rowling would write, but it doesn't have an air of "fanfiction" to it. Characterization is perfect, I don't mind the OC(Astoria), but its a little too short for my taste. Ah well.

OT: The search function for that website is bloody terrible. Is there anyway to filter it AO3/FF.net style?

*** Nope. The code behind the HPFF archives has been essentially static for over 5 years. I can't imagine Jay deciding to overhaul it, which would probably be required to address the shortcomings in the filtering and search. It's a shame, really. There are so many fantastic authors there, but they never get the kind of readership that even so-so authors draw on FF.net.

**** Yup, the old fandom archives like fictionalley and skyhawke are horribly neglected, some are dead (illuminatedtext's remix archive for one), and the rest of the fandom are spread out on blogging services like Livejournal and Dreamwidth and personal website on old ISP hosts. Its pretty sad to see some gems with little no to exposure, or worse - locked down like a virgin's bedroom
