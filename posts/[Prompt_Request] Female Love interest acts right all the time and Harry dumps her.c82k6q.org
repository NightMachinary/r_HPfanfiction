You see this [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser][trope]] in television a lot. A couple fights because the guy does something and the girl tells him off, then the girl does the same thing, but tries justifying it. Or there's conflict between the couple in a sitcom and the man is seen as wrong, when the argument wouldn't hold in [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease][Real Life]]. Or the guy is seen as clueless without a female influence in his life. It's seen a bit in canon with Hermione's relationship with Ron.

It's a bad trope and I see it in fanfiction quite a bit too. Give your prompts or fic recommendations where when someone tries this with Harry and it gets shut down. linkffn(Potter Ever After) is a bit of an inspiration for this.

What I'm asking for is a heavy subversion of romance fics.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

**** One of my all-time favorite fics. Fictional relationships that follow those trope are terrible. It's why Harry and Ginny seem much better than Ron and Hermione to me. They treated each other as equals.

**** Yep. I'm actually looking for something like it. I mean in Harry Potter fandom, marriage laws, soulmates, and Lordships bother me more, but this is a general thing. I mean seriously.

I've read Harry/Hermione stories like this. Harry talks to a girl, Hermione gets jealous, Hermione talks to boy, no one bats an eye. It's not just the trope being bad, but it's people taking teenage girls seriously.

I don't. Look at Hermione in Canon. Dates Krum, an 18 year as a barely 15 year old with a very physical relationship. Goes on a date with the world's biggest jerk to make Ron jealous, attacks Ron with birds, and finally gets together with him for saying something about House-Elves.

She has pretty much the same maturity as Ron throughout the series and it's my headcanon that Harry and Ginny got together in spite of her advice. It's a problem in any genre, not just Harry Potter.

Just to know, where does it say their relation was physical? The only thing I remember about it is Hermione saying they didn't talk really much and that Krum spent most time watching her read in the library, and I'm not even sure it's not just in movie.

  Viktor's more of a physical being.

That line, coupled with Ginny mentioning Hermione snogged Krum.
