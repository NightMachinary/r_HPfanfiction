The marvel cinematic universe, middle earth, star wars, doesn't matter.

The closest I've seen is linkffn(What's a Little Death between friends? by kathryn518), but that's time travel instead of a crossover.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3655940/1/Harry-Potter-Dark-Memories][Dark Memories by blueowl]], complete, and the premise is that harry has Voldemorts memoriea from the get go. A surprisingly feel good story, quite well written with a lot of character redemption.

  After the defeat of Voldmort didn't turn out quite like he envisioned, Harry stared into the Abyss preparing to prove something to himself, instead he tumbles into an experience he never expected, and he doesn't go alone.

** the best i know of is linkffn(what lies beneath by master slytherin)

it's relatively short and complete

divergence from chamber of secrets

very good hermione in supporting role

terrifying voldemort

also, i put off reading this because the of first chapter, but boy did this pay off

edit:

most importantly --> powerful!Harry but believably so; he inherits V's powers, but he's never OP

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.
