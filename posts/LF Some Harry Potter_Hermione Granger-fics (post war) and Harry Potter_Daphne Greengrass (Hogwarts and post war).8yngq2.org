*** The premise behind how they end up married in this story is just hilarious to me.

#+begin_quote
  Harry: hey, you wanna fuck?

  Daphne: sure, but I can't have sex before I'm married

  Harry: ok, let's get married then
#+end_quote

Overall, I think the writing of all of her stories (that I've read) is solid, albeit without a ton of conflict, but after reading two or three of them I ended up stopping because the weird obsession with mineral water that was there in all of them was starting to get really annoying to me. Which has got to be just about the pettiest reason to stop reading a story ever.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Daphne find themseves trapped in a hasty marriage after a drunken night, and there is no way out. How will they cope with that? Warnings: underage drinking, probably a lemon or two, and Weasley bashing. Also, English is not my first language, so be prepared for strange language quirks or don't read. Chapter 3 partly rewritten.

** My favorite postwar Harry/Hermione fic is now [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097). The story begins after Year 2, but things really get interesting after Voldemort's defeat. It's a very slow burn between them, but very satisfying when they finally get together.

My favorite postwar Harry/Daphne is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407). Here, a highly manipulative Harry used Daphne to advance his agenda and career.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

  Daphne Greengrass wouldn't realise that a chance encounter at the age of eleven could have led her to have a life of adventure. Fourteen years later she meets Harry Potter again, this time over a dead body, but will she walk away or stay? He's a consulting detective and she's a healer, worlds apart from some, but for others, it could be just the beginning. AU.

  After the war, Harry Potter is desperate to make sure that not a single life more is ruined by Voldemort's legacy. Aided by the ever loyal Hermione Granger, he makes a decision which will forever change more than one life. An epilogue disregarding, Cursed Child inspired, Harmony romance.
