I've made it like 65 chapters in, but it is almost torturously boring at this point. My breaking point was when Harry's secret goblin friend Sapphire was brought in. I just can't handle it anymore, but I've already invested way too much time into it.


** Hermione is a goddess, Harry is Fitzwilliam Darcy; together, they fight crime and prejudice.

At least I'm pretty sure that's the basic premise.

** Now I don't exactly remember what happened when so some of those you could've already read. And things probably are out-of-order.

Something, something, Rookwood escapes with Bellatrix from Azkaban and have her have sex with him as a payment to bust him out, they have a kid, something, something, Berta Jorkins represents Ministry which is an enemy of Voldemort and she is used in resurrection ritual, but Voldie fails to gather more support, tries to do some mess, but everybody has Super Goblin Wards TM which protects from anything, meanwhile, some goblin reactionaries try to kill Grangers, something, something, Voldie attacks Quidditch World Cup by hiding inferi underground, something, something, Umbridge which was delegated to Sport Department organises TWT, sometime during all that Harry becomes a Baron and gets rollercoaster on his grounds, something, something, Harry gets chosen to be in the TWT by the Goblet, he destroys the goblet with a sword of Gryffindor, gets chosen by McGonagall regardless, something, something, Umbridge works for Voldemort and prepares Cup as portkey, something, something, Dumbledore who got there (with a Durmstrang I think?) modifies the portkey Cup to stun Harry, so he can get killed by Voldemort, fulfil prophecy and allow Dumbledore to steal all the glory, something, something, Harry learns of this, prepares with the support of goblins, muggles, wizards and everyone, goes to his special island in to prepare himself by having sex with Hermione (Neville and Padma take the other house, Lupin and Tonks the third one), something, Harry gets TP-ed to Voldemort with Hermione, she sacrifices herself to save him while their allies destroy the outer barrier, Voldemort gets killed with sniper riffles, turns out deus ex soul bond saved Hermione, everyone lives long and happily and helped reformed magical Britain, except for Dumbledore who died in Azkaban from licking shit.

*** The sad thing is, you could pretty much cut and paste 80% of this and have it perfectly substitute for any old Dumbledore bashing, HP/HG shipfic.

** I finished this one once when I first started reading fics and remembered it being pretty decent. I went back to reread it six months ago and only made it about 50 chapters in. It's just too slow. And Robst has these little quirks about his writing style that drive me insane and show up in almost every chapter.

Examples:

1) Harry /was always/ going to ask Hermione to the Yule Ball.

2) /That/ Harry didn't giggle at Dan's unintended pun, /meant that/ he was finally starting to mature.

**** Haha. The story begins very well. The premise is unique, and reading about goblins is fun. The main problem is that it just takes too damn long for things to happen.
