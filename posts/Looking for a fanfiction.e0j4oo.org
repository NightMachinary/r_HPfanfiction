Was there ever a story where Harry or femHarry or Hermione lost his/her virginity in the muggle world and when the people in the magical world learn of this they freak out because being a virgin in the magical world is for some reason very important?

Yes, I know that this is a taboo topic and do not call me a lover of incel, please!!!!

Just a link / title of the fanfic!


** Linkffn(Broken Chains) Broken Chains has that concept but its Harmony. Dunno if that helps. Good fic, even if it isnt what you want.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][the Problem with Purity]] places an importance of virginity in the wizarding world. Not quite what you were looking for though.
