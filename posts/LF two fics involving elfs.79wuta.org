Hello What i remember from the first fic is that is a harry/Hermione/luna and maybe daphne. Luna is part elf and has to travel to their "dimension" but returns whit 2 children (Lunas and Harrys).

From the second i can only remember the pairing beign Harry/Hermione plus one more and later on the elf Queen. They travel and spend time in the elf world where they study and harry goes into politics, the Queen moves in and teaches harry but under another namn so they don't know Its here.

Thank you in advance
