** this is such an awful take. Fanfiction should not operate like traditional publishing. If it did it wouldn't be.... fanfiction??

People do this for a hobby. They are not compensated for their work, are rarely celebrated, & almost never have their real names attached to their work. Authors do not owe you entire books of fanfiction. In fact, THEY DON'T OWE YOU ANYTHING. What fanfiction authors give is a gift that you can accept or not. But if you're not paying people to write novels, then.....I don't know where this critique is coming from.

*** You must be an author, I take it? Or perhaps you're reading too much into an internet rant...I've been reading fanfic for going on 20 years now. It's just a frustration because as a reader it sucks. I've been both a writer and a reader. The critique isn't even a critique haha it's a rant.

I know it will never change, and I know that it wouldn't likely work I was just venting because you HAVE to admit abandoned stories, especially well-written ones,\\
are frustrating. So are 3-4 months or years between chapters. I understand they are not paid, they do it for fun...but they also do it for the readers. The reviews. So...it's a balanced sword - if they don't update often enough they aren't going to get as many reviews or reads as they would if they consistently updated on a relatively often basis. As a reader a broken up story isn't as good, it doesn't flow as well.

**** I do occasionally write, but not much. I just really don't understand how giving reviews to an author means that they should produce 50k words for me at a time ðŸ˜‚

Part of being a consumer of any media is dealing with the norms of distribution of that media. That means waiting for tv episodes, waiting for albums to drop, waiting for podcasts to release, waiting for fics to be updated. Yes, I realize that in most other media people distribute the entire entity at once, but again, people are getting paid to do that. Fanfic writers aren't.

***** I know. Doesn't mean it won't change how frustrating it is waiting for chapters on a story you are invested in to drop at random if ever. I find it frustrating enough to wait a week for tv episodes but I know they are coming. Shows are not renewed sometimes and that's just as frustrating as abandoned fics.

** u/BigFatNo:
#+begin_quote
  I dislike the ones that prolong it anyway by have a posting schedule....I mean...why? What's the point?
#+end_quote

I do this, happily. I write everything, edit everything, let a beta sift through it, edit it again, and then publish with a set schedule. Like other people said: comments, kudos, likes, favourites, they're all very important for me as a writer. So by posting chapter by chapter, I'm increasing the time my fic is seen on the front pages of AO3 and ffn.net, and this kind of posting chapter by chapter encourages people to leave more reviews, rather than them reading through everything and then leaving a short comment (or just a like, or, in many cases, nothing).

Why are these things important to me? For one: the validation. This is a basic human need that everyone has, and me as well. My fics already get very little traffic compared to other fanfics, and if I just published it all at once that traffic would be way, way less still.

And second: I write because I want to practice, because I have the ambition of becoming a published author of original fanfiction. I need the feedback of readers, I need to know what they think of specific parts of the story so that I can know what works and what needs improvement.

I hope that by shedding a floodlight on my reasoning, you can emphasise with us writers a bit better, rather than saying you "dislike" me because /you/ forget to check whether or not my fic is complete. Just remember, the next time you want to rant on the internet, that these authors you're shitting on are giving you hours and hours of free entertainment.

*** I'm also a writer and it's more that I hate unfinished work. And honestly, I was not really meaning to attack anyone so I apologize if it came off that way. I'm just frustrated honestly that there are some phenomenal fics out there that are never going to be completed or authors that, yes have their own lives, are unable to upload chapters often. I do actually understand that.

I certainly don't dislike you. I really do understand the need for validation but I also know that it often falls short. Honestly it was just a rant because I keep finding these great fics that are recommended that are not complete or sometimes, not even CLOSE to complete. I also understand that things will never be the way that I would want it to be, which is the whole story in one go. It would be nice though, you have to admit.

I didn't mean for you get defensive about it. I really just want wanting a little "yeah that would be great but unlikely" camaraderie but I guess I forgot this is the internet I guess. I have no one else in my life who would understand where I'm coming from or even what a fanfic is.

Being able to get reviews/comments are a big source of motivation for writers to continue. They're doing it for fun, not to cater to the whims of their readers.

*** That's true, I've written some of my own before. It's just a frustration for me honestly. Perhaps I've just ran into too many very slowly updated(like 2-3 chapters a year) fics that I love but find that when they update a new chapter I honestly can't remember a lot of what happened in the fic by then.

When I read I'm the reader that sinks into the story - I literally cannot hear you if you try to talk to me when I'm really into a book. It's like a movie in my brain and for it to suddenly screech to a halt or be interrupted often by chapter updates it's just frustrating for me personally. I really was mostly just saying I wish things were different haha that the whole story could come out as one.

***** I discovered a new to me really well-written story on a trope that I enjoy but that has been over-done or poorly written too often. I also discovered the author is still active and uploading but has been working on it for 2 years. I take comfort seeing that they are active but also knowing the story is only really getting started and is updated, it seems, about once a month. I didn't think to check until I was several chapters in and I'm dreading getting to that last chapter knowing that I'm just as likely to forget entirely about this story in a months time even though I will save it. I have the memory of a goldfish haha.

** As a reader I've gone through the same pain. You find a fic, you like it , it gets you hooked and them BAM! the writer goes AWOL or on hiatus and it sucks. But you gotta remember people write fanfics for fun

1. They do it as a hobby. This is not their job. They don't owe you anything instead the entertainment they are providing should be taken as added bonus imo. They don't get money for it, hell they don't given get credit or appreciation at times.
2. Like some people have rightly pointed out if a long fic came out altogether, I might miss it if I am not present at the right place at the right time esp for Fandoms that have large no. of new fics going up everyday.
3. And I think if people weren't allowed to post chapter by chapter a lot of long fics won't be written. People would stick to writing one shots and drabbles.

** People stop writing because they, and maybe this is something you're having trouble grasping, /they're people with people things going on/. God forbid, your favorite series literally stops being written while you're following it, due to shit happening like the author /dying/, or simply losing interest. This actually happened to me a couple times, and you know what I did about it? /I mourned the loss, and then I found something else to read./

Periodic, sporadic, episodic, whatever-the-/fuck/-you-wanna-call-it publishing has been around since way before even the original Sherlock Holmes (and hey, guess how /that/ got popular?), and it isn't going away anytime soon. And you wanna know something? Content creators don't owe a goddamn thing if they're doing it for free, or worse, going out of pocket, as they must have done to get their word on print back in those days.

tl;dr: Writers have their own lives outside of writing, or maybe they just don't want to anymore. Get over it.

** I get it dude. We all read fanfiction here, we all get frustrated when a story doesn't have an ending. No one is ever going to disagree with you on that point. I'm sure it must feel like we are coming out of the woodwork to attack you, but you really just came about this the wrong way. There are plenty of rant/vent threads on here about being surprised by abandoned fics that don't go down like this but they don't come at it from an angle of telling authors what to do.

Some of the most influential fics are either abandoned or on hiatus. Nightmares of Futures Past practically defined the dark future time travel fic for Harry Potter, and it's been on hiatus for years due to the authors health conditions. On His Way To Greatness did some similar things for Slytherin Harry and is abandoned. These fics have been read and enjoyed countless times and have gone on to inspire other authors to right excellent fics that have been completed. If these authors had waited until they finished the story to post none of that would have happened.

For many authors the feedback and response they get from their first chapters is what encourages them to keep writing at all. Most people don't write in a vacuum, only writing for themselves. They write because they want people to read their fics and enjoy them. Weekly updates keep fics fresh in the searches for fic sites and keep them fresh in people's minds, which means more people read the fic.

*** That's very true - well I was really just saying I wish fics would be completed. Didn't realize it was coming off as telling the authors what to do or that I am not allowed to have the opinion that if someone starts something they should do what they can to finish it. Not posting it until it's completed would alleviate that but I do know where you are coming from in that some of the best fics we would never be exposed to as the authors never finished, or in some very sad cases, passed away. I also know quite a few writers suffer from depression and it can be debilitating to their entire life and especially on their hobbies.

I sometimes forget the internet doesn't take the time to ferret out what someone really means when they say or express an opinion while frustrated or upset. The internet doesn't know me and doesn't want to, and people on the internet often jump to a lot of assumptions based on some poorly phrased wording on my part. Some great people take the time to not jump down another persons throat on the internet and I appreciate that. People vent, and often they say things they know are unrealistic but they still can wish for it. I mean, I can wish everyone had food on their table no matter the situation but the wish isn't just unrealistic it's just not the way life works. Similar to this. My wish is unrealistic and isn't the way life works.

**** If you are interested to know, just expressing the opinion that you wish people wouldn't abandon fics would still get some pushback, but there are certain things you've said that really tip the scales for a lot of people.

In online communication the words we write are all we have, there are no tones of voice, no facial expressions, no past interactions to rely on to ensure that our meaning is understood by others. It's not on others to divine your true meaning from your words when your words themselves already have meaning.

"should not be allowed" is a strong wish. Most likely hyberpole, but as mentioned, that's not what you actually said. You said that writers should be prevented from sharing their work with others if they didn't do it in the way you preferred.

As writers and readers the importance of words should never be discounted.

** Also those authors who are 'what pairing do you prefer?' And 'help me decide the direction of this story''

No, that's YOUR job as a writer to decide whwre the story is supposed to go. Otherwise you turn out like JKR when she was being influenced by the actors for the films and started to mess things up in the last books.

Also good reason to remove chapter-by-chapter updates: the spoilers in thw author's notes. Let people figure things out in the story. If you feel like the readers need to know something, you include it in the story
