So I've read a lot of Harry/Ginny Soul Bond fics.

And I find it really strange how Ginny's family in story is always SOOOO protective of her "virtue," even when she's married!

I'm in a tiny minority in modern day culture: I think sexual activity belongs inside of a marriage union. Most people who hear that would then assume I'm probably anti-sex, want to oppress others, or whatever. Not true, but people like to assume things to make themselves feel superior to others I guess.

I don't identify with the Weasley "protect Ginny from her Harry" attitude AT ALL.

I have an eight-year-old daughter. I want her to refrain from sexual activity until she gets married, but then she can do it all she wants (as long as I don't have to hear about it). If she was somehow magically bonded to someone and could communicate telepathicly with him, etc, then I think I would naturally assume that she was going to end up married to this boy.

(I think the whole "you're magically married as soon as you're bonded" thing is foolish - marriage is a choice and a committment, it doesn't just happen to you. Theoretically you could have a soul bond and never marry that person. However, I don't see how you could ever marry anyone ELSE under those circumstances...)

For the sorts of bond stories where they can't even sleep in separate beds without medical calamities befalling them... it's really not that hard a problem! The Weaseleys expend so much energy trying to "protect" Ginny and there is no need. They are bonded. They're OBVIOUSLY going to be together for the rest of their lives.

JUST HAVE A WEDDING.

Then let them do whatever they want to do! If they feel they are too young, that's fine. If they want to explore, that's fine too. They are bonded. They are now married. There is no sin in this. It's not icky (for them).

For the bond stories where they CAN be kept apart: explain to them why it would be advantageous to NOT rush into a physical relationship at their age. Persuade them. But at the end, explain that if they can't keep their hands off each other, they can just get truly married.

Then let them do whatever they want to do!

In the Bible, the apotle Paul was recommending that people stay celibate (because there were current dangerous situations going on, and not having to worry about a family in danger made some sense). But it was just his suggestion. He then said "But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."

Within marriage, Paul actually said it would be a sin to withhold sex from the other partner.

It's just really funny to me that I live in a world where I am treated as very backwards thinking, for not agreeing with the modern day culture of sex-without-marriage, but then I read these Harry/Ginny fics and I end up feeling ridiculously progressive.

If you don't agree with my views on when sex is appropriate, I understand that, but you can at least recognize it has something to base it on, in this case religion.

What are the Weasleys basing /their/ decisions on? WHY are they so dead set on Ginny getting married and then doing what married people do? Because she's too young? Getting married too young is usually a bad thing because PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT YET and they CHOOSE THE WRONG PERSON.

But if Harry and Ginny already have a permanent soul bond... if you already know they are GOING to get married some day... why bother waiting? For WHAT benefit? What is the point of any of it?

They never explain why they have such a problem (except in fics where Molly is clearly irrational and against everyone just because she doesn't want to see her child grow up too soon).

I mean, I wouldn't want my daughter to get magically bonded to some boy when she's 11. But if it already happened and I couldn't change it, I can't imagine making her life HARDER by being such a prat about it.

I like Harry/Ginny fics, I really do, but it's just so odd for me to read them and feel all progressive and the Weasleys seem like the most backwards, arbitrary, controlling, oppressive, judgmental jerks ever.

Hey, Weasleys? It's okay for married people to have sex. It's a good thing! Just let Ginny marry her soul mate and then stay out of it.

Then the other weird thing (perhaps just for me) is when Harry/Ginny are bonded as mid/late teens, and decide to have sex with one another, and it never even occurs to them to get married. Most sexually active teens are not thinking of marriage at their age, but then most are not soul-bonded with magic powers either. In the story they already know their relationship is permanent and life-long, they declare their undying love to one another, and yet they sneak around hiding from Ron or whoever so they can have sex and again there's not really a need for it. Why does it never even occur to them to even /discuss/ marriage?


** Because this is a trope? Like the overprotective dad who wants his daughter to stay a virgin forever. Or the brothers who will give any suitor a hard time, even if he saved their sister's life.

That said, there is an age of consent for a reason.

*** Weirdly, it's always Molly that's shown to be the overprotective and prudish one.

She popped out 7 kids. It's possible that Arthur is really, really convincing, which we never ever see, so it's far more likely that Molly loves the D.

I'd like to see a Molly that's all for a bonded couple to going at it like rabbits; cause it means babies for her to spoil.

**** Or just as, if not more, likely, she had seven kids because she (and Arthur) wanted a daughter.

***** This, my mother's cousin has 6 boys for this exact reason, she then got divorced over the issue (she wanted to continue trying for a girl, he didn't and got a vasectomy, so she divorced him). It happens often enough that people have more children when they don't get the gender they want with the number they initially planned for.

*** I believe in age-of-consent in real life but as described most soul bonds would make it irrelevant.

** Hmm... I would say that stories thrive on conflict, and when you've removed the main obstacles to a relationship (unclear communication, getting to know the person, actually being attracted to the person they are), then I'm not surprised that something is shoved in to fill the void. In this case, 'we want to be together, but my parents are stuffy about it' is a reasonable conflict in the absence of other romantic plots. It's just kinda out-of-the-blue for the Weasleys, and probably OOC unless handled very carefully. I can totally see reservations over age of consent and such though, especially if such bonds aren't well understood and/or are quite rare.

  They're OBVIOUSLY going to be together for the rest of their lives.

I would argue that, depending on the nature of the bond, no, it is not a basis for lifelong commitment. Maybe I have a different sense of what 'love' means, but Soul Bond fics often come across as a rather invasive kind of mind control to me. And what happens if you end up bonded to someone, are able to see who they /truly/ are, and despite that (or perhaps because of that) you dislike them? I doubt Soul Bonds, were they to exist, would be perfect. Sometimes you'd get bonded people who despise each other... and then you have Harry and Voldemort's relationship in canon, depending on the depth of their ideological conflict (quite shallow, in this case). So no, I don't take it as a given that just because people share some kind of magical bond, that means they're going to become partners. It just means that the other person will become an important part of their life from that moment on, for good or for /ill/, as the canonical case of Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort would show. After all, in what way does holding a piece of someone else's soul /not/ constitute a soul bond? Well, good to see you doing your part in supporting gay marriage, I guess, even if I don't personally enjoy HP/LV shipping...

Since I don't agree with the assertion that marriage is assured in the event of a soul bond, the idea that they declare undying love for each other and sneak around like teenagers without discussing marriage seems... about what we would expect, actually. Because they're teenagers, and in my experience of teen years, marriage is pretty far down on the agenda, if it appears at all. And teens are quite prone to premature declarations of eternal love, for that matter.

I'm not saying that you're backwards, but I guess I'm saying that most people don't share Paul's hangups about marriage and sex these days. And he had them in spades. He wanted women to cover their hair, and various other things that Christians today would stone him fo- oh, wait, you don't do that either. Jokes aside, for me it'd be kind of weird to jump from 'weird attraction and telepathy' to 'let's get married', even if I was in a relationship with the person in question. And that's probably because I'm trying to look at this from a mature, adult perspective, because being magically bonded to a person seems like a shaky foundation for a relationship. But I would agree that discussing marriage at some point would be a mature thing to do. It's just a pity that most soul bond fics deal with teenagers, who are often nowhere near as mature as they think, hence why it doesn't happen.
