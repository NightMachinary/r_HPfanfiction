With Cursed Child coming out in a month and a half, I figured it would make sense to get in the spirit of the play. Give me all of your favorite Post-DH fics.

My personal favorites are anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]


** linkffn(grow young with me by Taliesin19) is DH compliant but not epilogue compliant.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.

** I divide them into epilogue compliant ones:

*Children's Crusade*, linkffn(6989327), where the Trio and Ginny were called by a Hermione from another dimension to defeat Voldemort one more time. It's pretty good story.

*In Case of Emergency*, linkffn(4625848), is a very nice Harry/Ginny smut fic with a plot.

--------------

And non-epilogue compliant ones. I generally prefer stories that have them doing more than just settle down for senior bureaucrat positions in the Ministry:

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005): the real war began after Voldemort's fall.

*The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig*, linkffn(7135971): the muggles surprised and seriously threatened the survival of magicals. Under Harry's leadership, they built a magical spaceship and headed out for stars, only to encounter forces far more terrifying than a Dark Lord. The ending is quite sad, but there is always A NEW HOPE.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): the Ministry still sucked after Voldemort's fall, so Harry and his friends decided to fight back. Brilliant writing, very emotional, I especially loved the Trio relationship.

--------------

Then there is the *The Sea King*, linkffn(7502511), a very cute one shot in which Harry retired from the wizarding world and became a muggle fishing boat captain.
