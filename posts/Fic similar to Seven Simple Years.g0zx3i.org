It's a romione fic that I felt did a really great job capturing how their relationship developed during the years they were at Hogwarts. I'm mainly looking for fics that mirror those parts of the fic (years 1-6) more so than Deathly Hallows stuff just because I feel like that's sometimes a bit overdone, but I'm not against the fic including DH stuff I'd just prefer it not be the only/vast majority of it. TIA


** Stories written by Pinky Brown are exactly what you are looking for.
