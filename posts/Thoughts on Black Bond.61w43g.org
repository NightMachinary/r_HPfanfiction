I haven't read it, but I also wonder how many of the 1,222,826 words should have been removed during editing.

** I have a special term for this fanfic, "A waste of words," the author has so many pointless scenes and so much forced drama that's unnecessary . Plus it's longer than the whole Harry Potter series combined yet still only up to the third year [I can't remember if it was third or fourth.] It isn't a bad concept it just has poor execution in my opinion.

** That's 200k more words than the canon books. Or, to put that in perspective, one Deathly Hallows.

Pass.

** I dropped it because scenes and dialogue kept repeating themselves. Draco would go up to the OFC and say the same thing and get the same response every chapter.

** I started to read thinking it was finished or near to finish seeing its length. But reading about 400k+ words, the story is meh at best, too much of unnecessary dramas, tons of forced scenarios, too lengthy to keep an interest in.

** Pretty sure he's actually writing a sequel if you can believe it. I like a decently long fic (300kish) but i steer clear of anything that bloated.
