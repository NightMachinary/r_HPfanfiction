To be more specific, I'm looking for fanfiction where a character from another fandom/universe/world (so not limited to crossovers. Can be alternate dimension Harry ) comes to the canon HP world for whatever reason, and Canon Harry is bashed, or ignored, or shunned, or whatever for being foolish/naive/whiny or whatever the author comes up with. I love canon Harry, but I like reading different types of stories, and I've never seen this specific type explored other than a Naruto/HP crossover where young Kakashi traveled to Britain. Bring on the recs??


** How about [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council]]? Buffy/Addams Family/HP multi-cross. Harry's not really bashed, but he's laid into by Xander and Wednesday several times for laziness.
