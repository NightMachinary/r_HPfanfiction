It's called 'good taste'. Look it up.

Jokes aside, it's because age difference aside they make a better match than arguably every other Harry/female character, although much of it is Fleur not having enough of a role for JKR to manage inserting negative interactions between the two like she did with Ginny and Hermione. She's basically a cross between the two of them without the baggage, plus more similar social context with Harry than both of them put together.

All this good stuff however is generally wasted because most flowerpot fics are power fantasies and of course Fleur is the choicest bird of the setting.

Wait, why? The biggest obstacle I can see to Harry/Ginny is that Ginny gets hardly any screen time, so their relationship is kind of "surprise! dating now!" - but Fleur gets even less time than that.

In Ginny's case, we at least know that she has a temperament not entirely unlike Harry's best friend, that they share some interests and laugh at each other's jokes. In Fleur's case...well, she's part-Veela, so naturally she's stunning to look at, but that's pretty shallow and Harry definitely finds Ginny attractive too. Why does Harry/Fleur make "much more sense"?

****** At least for me, its that she has inherent understanding of Harry's main hangup. People seem to look at her and see only the half-veela, just as they only see "The Boy-Who-Lived" when looking at Harry. They both are isolated thanks to external factors that they can't control, of which very few people would actually understand.

â€‹

It's a stronger foundation for a relationship than he has with Ginny. The only scenario that comes close is in OotP when she brings up her possession, but that's used once and then never mentioned again.

#+end_quote

Agree with the seeing Harry as only the BWL thing, but the seeing only the veela thing in Fleur is pure fanon. She's never shown as isolated at all in Book 4 - she seemed pretty outgoing, confident and sure of herself, like most 17 year old girls who know they're beautiful are. In fact, her confidence almost borders on arrogance.

Fleur is just not descirbed well at all in canon. She's shown to be very talented, both from being the Champion of her school and being hired by Gringotts immediately after graduating, and fiercely protective of her little sister, as shown by her reaction to the Second Task, but the rest of her is a blank slate.

She dates Bill for a few months, and is suddenly engaged to him at the start of Book 6 - I always found that to be super weird.

  She's treated as a sex object throughout GoF
#+end_quote

A few hormonal teenage boys ogling a girl does not make for "treatment like a sex object". Treatment like a sex object would mean that boys and men would be constantly hounding her for sex. That does not, in spite of fanon's best efforts, ever happen.

Hormonal teenagers ogling at pretty girls is the most natural thing in the world. It is not, in any way or form, treating said girl as a sex object.

#+begin_quote
  Ron tried to ask her to the ball
#+end_quote

14 yo Ron is absolutely clueless about girls. He yells at her, asking for a date, due to his own lack of...several things, manners and courtesy being a few of them, and runs off mortified. That's just Ron being an immature teenager, not Ron treating her like a sex object. Get real.

#+begin_quote
  her actual Yule Ball experience with Roger Davies
#+end_quote

Read up the Yule Ball chapter again. She enjoys the Ball with Davies - HP sees them walking in the gardens with Davies, kissing along the way.

#+begin_quote
  Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.

  "'Ow dare you!" shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him. Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall out of their rosebush. "I 'ave nevair been more insulted in my life! 'Alf-giant? Moi? I 'ave - I 'ave big bones!"

  Fleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall.
#+end_quote

As you can see, she's clearly having a good time, like any other 17 year old at a social event involving dancing and alcohol.

That just shows that the female Weasleys are terrible hosts, and are uncouth - which shouldn't come as a surprise when you remember what Molly says to Sirius in Book 5. None of the other members in the Order treat her that way.

When people refer to pairings they are mostly referring to how the defining fanon has made them out to be.

There's a reason Draco/Hermione is a popular pairing and it has everything to do with how Fanon Draco might as well be a completely original character.

Having said that, DM/HG is one the worst pairings there can be, right there with Snape/anyone and Voldemort/anyone, especially while they're still in school.

Saying that canon Fleur is a lonely wallflower though, is just too much.

To me it would also suggest rather less agency on her part than is actually portrayed. When Ron is captivated and asks her to go to the Yule Ball with him, she's not interested - so she shuts him down without even needing to speak. She is passionately devoted to her little sister. She makes it very clear to Molly Weasley that she has chosen Bill - for his personality, not his looks - and woe betide anyone who thinks they can get in her way. She definitely comes through as a person rather than an object.

It follows canon but at some point she breaks up with Bill and then her and Harry are together. It wasn't nearly as angsty as it sounded. I read it like 9 years ago. It was definitely complete.

  Harry has been alone his entire life, Dudley had made sure of that. On the brink of heading off into a whole new world, Harry finds himself scared he always will be alone. He writes a letter, more for himself than anything. Then Hedwig takes it upon herself to deliver it to someone just as alone as him.

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

*** You have great taste :) - it's among my faves (the others being Harry/Hermione (but only if he doesn't become whipped and is constantly bossed around by her and as long as she doesn't turn into a servile walking encyclopedia!), Harry/Tonks (seriously, she deserves better than the professional victim, Remus Lupin, who always runs when the going gets tough!) and Harry/Slytherin-Girl...with Harry/Older Woman (Narcissa, Bellatrix etc.) being a guilty pleasure I don't actually feel guilty for! Hell, I also read power-trips sometimes, they are funny if you don't take them too seriously!)...especially since Fleur would probably push Harry to be the best he can be (she is ambitious and talented (she charmed a Dragon to sleep after all!) IMHO, because otherwise she would not have been the Champion for her school), while he would keep her grounded (she's a bit of snob after all!)

Really recommend! Don't get attached to anything or anyone. :(((((((((

**** I was into fetish and bdsm things since I was about 7. Obviously I didn't know the terms and I really didn't have much context for such feelings, but the idea of domination and submission, humiliation and sadism, the concept of tying and being tied were present and powerful even back then.

When I got into the internet years later (I am that old), a new world opened up for me and many things got explained (and I found out I wasn't the only one with such feelings).

EDIT: to prevent misunderstanding, I've had a pretty normal and happy childhood, nobody abused me and I never saw someone abused either. I simply had these feelings as something not really sexual at first (I became sexually active late, actually). Some people are just wired that way, mostly like someone can be gay or straight without it being sexual, you just prefer looking at cute boys instead of cute girls.
