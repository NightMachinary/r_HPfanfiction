*** /Not/ having to be “careful” about a plot idea or plot device just because of concerns that it may end up looking anti-PC is one of the advantages towards good storytelling that fanfiction as a format has over the printed literature, which has to first jump through all kinds of hoops to meet the prerequisites of a publishing house.

****** Ok, but good art takes into account what people's associations are likely to be, and deals with them one way or another. That's like the very basis of how art works. It's a method of communication.

When most people say "be careful" about this issue, they don't mean "don't write the fic", they mean literally "be careful, and keep in mind these are the associations people are likely to make, these are the comparisons your readers are going to assume you're making." And then the author has to figure out a way to subvert or avert or utilize those allusions in a way that doesn't make them seem like a racist asshole. Or not.

***** The difference is that the Death Eaters are clearly the villains of Harry Potter, there's nothing controversial about that.

Whereas the proposed scenario mirrors the kind of garbage real-life racists have used for centuries to justify their hatred.

**** That is an absurd way to characterize this, to the extent that I almost have to think you're full of it in saying it. "Anti-PC" is not an artistic virtue, that's an asinine view and childish, honestly. Avoiding obvious and known cultural taboos (which exist for good reason) is not "jumping through hoops", you're showing your own bias in how you frame this. It's kind of hilarious.

****** Some art offends, that's fine. That doesn't mean "Offend with my art" is a virtue in art. In fact, let's try to follow this thread to it's logical conclusion. If offending with art is something artists ought to do, and that matters more than avoiding giving credence to existing hateful conspiracies (or else pretending not to know they exist), then art matters more than people. But I'm pretty sure you don't believe that because the ethics that result from that are ridiculous.

What in fact such art (can't speak to the Ofili example) sets out to do by offending (if it intended to) is to criticize current social phenomena that are or have become calcified, repressive or some gained other negative trait (the church (or certain denominations) have been frequent targets of this). Is avoiding anti-semtism such a negative trait? Is avoiding it (or treading carefully at least) "jumping through hoops"? If you don't defend these or something similar, your entire argument is either banal or not genuine, certainly besides the point anyway.

And anyway, as I said originally it can be done if one is careful. I gave a general piece of advice, not something I saw as necessary to enforce or require of others. But something something Anti-PC is a good in itself I suppose.

not smarter really. just something they don't know to defend against or have never seen before. perhaps someone made a unique discovery or did something they didn't think would actually work and it did

imagine for example that the research that resulted in the fidelious charm actually produced two charms but the knowledge of one is hidden by it's current use. any member of a hidden organization is a secret to all magic using non-members.

suddenly one researcher finds that none of his colleagues know who he is and they all forget he was ever there when he leaves the area. it doesn't affect muggles for some reason. during review he discovers he can invite people to join him and now they are covered by the same effect.

I wouldn't find it unbelievable. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect][The Flynn effect]] is a bit controversial but to this layman the explanation of greater intelligence arising from a more intellectually stimulating environment in childhood is at least plausible.

I also figure that nobody ever really comes close to being at their maximum potential. It's not really something you have control over either since by the time you can even understand this you're already too old to redo things.

***** *Flynn effect*

The Flynn effect is the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores that was measured in many parts of the world over the 20th century. When intelligence quotient (IQ) tests are initially standardized using a sample of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their standard deviation is set to 15 or 16 IQ points. When IQ tests are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first. Again, the average result is set to 100.

*** Nah, they're just nastier and would have access to a more sophisticated political playbook than their opposition does. You would be surprised at just how much that helps.

The shadow cabal thing might as well just be a stand-in meaning for what we consider to be the areas of 'campaign financing', 'lobbying', 'gerrymandering' and 'public relations meta-strategising'. It would amount to the same thing.

Stack the boards of various political interest groups with people the board members believe to simply be moderate pureblood representatives and even if a pureblood purist manages to produce conclusive evidence that the conspiracy exists, those that run these organisations will dismiss it as fanciful lies because hey, the guy accused of being a muggleborn is sitting right there, asking why a formerly esteemed member of the community just accused him of all people of being a mudblood.

** I have thought about a system like that while writing my own stories... However, I mostly focused on first responders and the likes. I find it difficult to imagine that Wizards are undetected by such means. The folly series (starting with rivers of London) also uses such a concept. Magic works vastly different in those books, of course. For Harry potter it sometimes doesn't feel right because I still imagine magic to be superior because it finds its way when the caster has a wish or concept of the solution. Muggle repelling charms just repel Muggle in a way that it would be impossible for muggles to break them, for example.

** It's a good idea but I think it would require some serious deviations from cannon to actually work.

If you just tried rehashing with occasional asides to the illuminati sitting in a closet somewhere twirling their wands then the premise is wasted.

I think there is an interesting angle here though; flipping the cannon world over.

On the side of good you have the ministry (presumably under the control of the illuminati although it is far from obvious); competent, beneficial to the protagonists, well connected, but severely lacking in magical strength.

The antagonists are Voldemort and the death eaters no political power whatsoever, but all really powerful personally due to bloodline magics, ancient artifacts, unspeakable rituals and what have you.

It certainly has potential if done right.
