:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember finding the fic on fanfiction.net it didn't have many chapters maybe 7-14 Harry find himself sent to an alternate universe where his parents are alive and he had a sister everyone is aware that he is from an alternate dimension and his counterpart is 14/15 and a hufflepuff original Harry is 17/18 or is at least mentally that age alternate Harry is nice to and so is Lilly and James I'm pretty sure alt Sirius showed up to


** Originally I thought it was this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7118223/2/Elsewhere-but-not-Elsewhen]]

But I think it might've been Past Mistakes by EmptySurface, though it looks like the author took it down recently.
