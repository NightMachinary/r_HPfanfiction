Ancient history:

1) On the origins of Magic:

- Where does Magic come from? Is it a blessing/curse from gods/higher beings? Is it a random mutation? Has it always been there?

- Did someone "discover" magic? How did people discovered/created spells? Were there magical cavemen? What did the ancients thought about magical/non-magical people?

- Ancient mythology: Did the ancients believe in God(s)? How were the magical societies of ancient civilization? Were the magical people treated as gods/demons, or just as regular people with special skills?

2) On the limits of Magic:

We know that Magic can't do a few things, like creating food/gold, or bringing people back from the dead (special situations do not count).

- Does it have any other limits? Have those limits been pushed? Maybe the Old Magics could do that, and they became the present myths?

- Who created/discovered wands? How did wizards use magic before wands? Did anyone try to give Magic to non-magical people? What did the other magical think of them?

3) To add later.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
