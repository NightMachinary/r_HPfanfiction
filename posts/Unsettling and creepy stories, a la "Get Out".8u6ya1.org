Great movie, by the way. Got anything like that?


** I tried to write my story the Aurors with a growing sense of dread and unease, and it's following through into the sequel, which is still in progress but is probably closer to what you're looking for. Some reviewers said they had to put the Aurors down during the climax because they felt anxious, and have said the sequel is creepy.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

  When a mysterious woman comes to the Auror office claiming to be the victim of a terrible crime, Theia and Harry want to do everything they can to help her. The problem is, she has no memory of what has happened. As they piece together the sinister events, their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface, causing them to question who they really are. Sequel to The Aurors.
