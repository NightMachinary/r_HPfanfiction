:FlairText: What's That Fic???
:END:
The lost fanfiction of my dreams, is one where a Female Harry Potter, Luna Lovegood, Draco Malfoy and others travel to the Lotr Universe via a Ritual. They build a city/Kingdom together. I'm Pretty sure Harry takes on the Name of Gryffin and Kreature went with them too.

I don't have much info on this fic, since it has been a while since i last read it. Anyone got any clue what it is?

  Fem!Harry. Heather wants to hide in the bottom of the ocean. Hermione wants to change the world. Draco wants to be seen as himself and not his father. And Luna? Well...she's Luna. An idea starts a chain of events and none of them regret it.
