The world opened up to Hebe Potter when Hagrid arrived on her eleventh birthday. Not only did she learn the truth about her parents and receive the first real invitation into a whole new world, she was finally given the freedom and resources to pull away from the dogmatic abusive control her Aunt and Uncle had over her life.

This is something her soon to be best friend both did and did not understand.

Hermione Granger could fathom that Hebe's family life was horrendous, but she'd never understand:

- sleeping in a cupboard under the stairs,

- the lack of privacy from an uncaring family,

- the jeers and teasing of a girl who could only wear her cousins oversized cast offs,

- the labelling as a troublemaker

- being bullied by boys so much bigger and stronger than her

- those who saw her as an easy mark.

Like it or not, as much as she loved Hermione, she was a well-loved academic girl from a middle class background. She didn't get Hebe's obsession with makeup or skirts because she'd never been completed barred from it. She looked down on Hebe's time with Lavender and Parvati (discussing cosmetics and all things frills and fancies) because she could never comprehend how dehumanised Hebe had been before Hogwarts.

▪︎▪︎▪︎

Long story short, I want a fic where FemHarry has a friendly relationship with all of her dorm mates, but Hermione doesn't really see eye-to-eye with Lavender and Parvati.

Hermione is kind of a closed minded girl who (with the exception of GoF) doesn't really seem to tap into her "feminine side" as she is more comfortable the way she is. This is perfectly fine, but she often looks down on Lavender and Parvati for not being the same.

So imagine Hebe, who's basically been treated as a slave her whole life and not even been allowed to think of herself as a girl (let alone anything other than a freak) being fascinated by her new, fashionista gossip queen dorm mates. Who'd more than happily take her under their wing. It'd cause all kinds of tension, especially if Hermione slowly learned how Hebe was actually treated by the Dursley's.

(Bonus if we go with the Indian Heritage headcanon for the Potter family, which would give Hebe even more to discuss with Parvati)


** Side honest question: why the fixation with Indian Harry/Potters?

I get people try to put more diversity in this british school (though it already seemed like canon had a good representation of uk population, the problem was not that there weren't diverse characters, but that they were all background)... That aside, why Indian? I mean almost all the race change to Harry are to Indian, why not Chinese? Or New Zealand? Or Mexican? Or Madagascar penguin? Is there something in canon that specially points to the possibility not Indian?

Honest doubt there.

The Potter surname always felt uk native to me... And don't remember indications of Lily being Indian or James for that matter.

It would be cool to have more fics around people who are actually these races. They get sidelined a lot. Where's my Dean Thomas series? Or Lee Jordan? Or Some Chang or Shafiq or whatever...

*** I think the reason Indian Potter's is so popular is because it is one of the most plausible race changes for Harry.

For me personally, I like the idea of Harry's grandmother being an Indian woman, thus making James mixed race and so on. I think the Indian setting works so well as the British Raj was still a thing back when James's parents were young so it is feasible that Fleamont Potter (a successful businessman who sold his company) could feasibly have done business there. And though Euphemia doesn't stand out as a traditional Indian name (as far as I'm aware) we know literally nothing about her, so it's easy to give her something, just like the fandom did with Daphne Greengrass.

Additionally, making Harry of Indian descent doesn't really change much, but it does add to his character in certain contexts (especially if you take it in AU directions). For me personally, it's easier to understand why a neighbourhood of, presumably, middle-upper class white families would arbitrarily label Harry Potter (a quiet, sweetheart who only wore clothes that didn't fit him and was constantly bullied by the other kids) as a troublemaker and ignore his plight if he was a little brown boy in a place where that wasn't quite so common in the 80's.

It's a harmless change to Harry that allows writers to explore something different about a pre-established character without breaking them off from what they are. Being Indian doesn't change anything about Harry's personality or motivations, but can give different angles to approach his story and a new, fresh lense to discuss his character (as Hermione being black does too) whilst also being somewhat plausible.

**** I get why they do it, though it felt weird it was always indian. Why not Greek? Euphemia's name is greek, I think... or middle eastern? Or something in between? Turkish seems feasible.

Anyhow, whatever race you make Harry it needs to be more than a grandmother. Otherwise Harry is not a brown kid. If you have Euphemia Indian but Fleamont and both of Lily's parents white... Harry's brown skin may be barely noticeable and could pass as "lightly tanned" or something.

***** If you wanna do it that way, it would be super interesting. I personally roll with the Indian headcanon with Euphemia being Indian but I only speak for myself there (as even then, Harry's not going to be white).

You'd have to scour through somewhere like Tumblr or Twitter to find out the exact history of where it came from, as I'm just someone on the sidelines who kinda likes the idea.

*** And of the other characters who are actually diverse... they're not really very good characters.

I personally like Cho, Kingsley and Angelina. I think they stand out well enough and they do deserve more love by the fandom. But everyone else feels really one note at best.

I barely remember Dean, and that's mostly with him being attached to Seamus. He doesn't really stand out as his own character with his own wants and desires beyond: I like football and I dated Ginny.

Lee is pure comic relief, yes it was a nice callback to have him over the wireless during DH, but it really just cemented him as "the guy over the microphone" who's friends with the Twins and has a pet tarantula (at some point).

Everyone else is even more forgettable:

- Blaise Zabini is only interesting because he got the Daphne Greengrass treatment (on that the fandom had to create his character for him as canon didn't give a rats ass about him before or after the meeting with Slughorn).

- Alicia Spinnet is a complete non-entity.

- What has Su Li ever done?

- As much as I like her, Cho was propped up as a crush in one book then written off as a teary mess that Harry didn't have time for in the next.

- Again, I personally like Kingsley, but (like Blaise) this is because fandom has fleshed him out. He was kinda just... there in the books, standing around looking/sounding cool.

- Who else even is there?!

**** Dude, Dean is a halfblood who thinks he is a muggleborn because his father ran away to save his family in the first war, and died there. We don't know if Dean ever found out that and could make some good fic.

Won't argue about the others but Cho is actually a good character to explore on the whole Diggory thing. She has more than a few things to explore.

You're missing the Parvati twins, There's a jew wizard in Ravenclaw and aside from that more blank slates.

I think the problem is the same Percy Jackson got in its first series (Charles Beckendorf anybody? Black dude who dies first and had the potential to be more than a background dude). Though, seems the author overcompensated for diversity in following books.

***** Genuinely forgot the Patil twins, thank you.

The issue, I think, is that they don't really have much in terms of their own individuality. Blank slates are fun and all, but fanfiction is about taking what is already there and morphing it into something else. E.g: Dean has a BACKSTORY in regards to his dad, but he doesn't have his own story/arc through the series. He's a side character, window dressing. Like it or not, he exists to fill out the register in class and give the main cast someone to talk about/mention every once in a while. Backstory doesn't equal character.

Blank slate characters are basically OC's and it's both difficult to write a whole new character and their interactions with the story and cast (especially if you want them to be good) but also most people just aren't interested. Less to do with their race and more due to lack of familiarity (think Sophie Roper or Lisa Turpin, not very popular are they?)

And I agree with Cho, though she does tend to be typecast into depressing stories involving Cedric as her character really does revolve around him, which is unfortunate.

****** People and Harry forget Cho is really loyal, to her friend Marietta in this case. Though Harry only seemed to appreciate loyalty when it didn't went against his wants and needs. He was at a point when he couldn't see how Cho sticking up for Marietta even if she made a mistake was the same as him sticking up for Ron or Hermione or Hagrid.

******* Hagrid participated in the illegal dragon trade of his own free will, regardless of the fact that he had no long-term way of caring for said dragon. Harry was entirely fine with this. Or when Hagrid repaid Harry's willingness to break laws for him by sending Harry after something that murders unicorns alone. A dog isn't exactly a deterrent for something that murders much larger, more dangerous animals. Or that time when Hagrid knowingly told Harry and Ron to walk to their deaths, when they were saved by a literary and literal deus ex machina. After all of that, Harry is entirely fine with Hagrid.

Marietta was dealing with a no-win situation where she either betrays her friends or Umbridge goes after her family. This betrayal merits permanent scarring and shunning by her friends. Yes. Coercion is much worse than Hagrid regularly risking Harry's life.

In fairness to Harry, he's an abused child who has been regularly encouraged that acting out is a valid threat response. He's not making completely rational decisions. But that's the unwritten tragedy, isn't it? Harry desperately needs help, but nobody cares about the psychological damage inflicted on their child hero/soldier.

#+end_quote

She was never threatened at all in canon. She went to Umbridge of her own volition and told her to go to the Room of Requirement since they held meetings there.

After she saw that the jinx activated, she refused to say anything else. If she was being threatened by Umbridge, why would she refuse to say anything else about the DA after she got jinxed? Wouldn't that mean she was endangering her family?

This theory that Marietta is actually innocent is so stupid (no offense). She knew the torture that Umbridge was putting people through. She knew that Umbridge would punish the DA (which included her /friends/) extremely harshly for their disobedience. She knew everything, but she chose to do it. She wasn't ever threatened or anything like that. She betrayed them because she wanted to.

******** Valid. However, I think Harry's actions are a bit less bad childhood trauma and more teenage angst drama, increased by the actual isolation caused by Dumbledore, the Ministry and Cedric's death circumstances.
