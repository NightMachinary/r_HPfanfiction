*** As a Time Lady she would fit perfectly well in Haphne fanfics:

"Morning, Lord Potter," the teacher said bowing lightly. Neville and Daphne bowed as well.

"Morning, Lady Frizzle," a second round of bows.

"Nice to see you here, Lord Longbottom," secret handshake. A third round of bowing.

"You too Lady Greengrass," more secret handshake, touching of secret rings against secret rings. Fourth round of bowing.

** Ohh The could get cooked into Polyjuice Potion and consumed. Imagine learning potions from an ingredients point of view!

Or they could enter a Mimbulus Mimbletonia seed! Or Devils Snare!!!!

Ohh They could surf the sound waves of Parsletongue to see how Snakes hear it.

And they go into Voldemort to learn about the effects of ancient dark rituals on genetics.

The Bus encounters a Dementor. Spoiler Alert, the Bus wins.

Exploring Azkaban.

Time Traveling to meet Slytherin during CoS

Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil become Charms experts so they can design clothes like the ones Frizzle wears.

Arthur Weasley is obsessed with the bus and sends 1000s of letters so he can play with it and help modify it.

Harry is Arnold.

Draco is Janet

Snape hates her because the kids share so many stories but he thinks they are making it up until one day he gets trapped in the bus and they all turn into Microscopic Nargles and enter Luna's World (aka the 42nd Dimension).

I love this concept, I keep adding more lol

Willy Wonka first, Ms Frizzle second, Mary Poppins third. Read the whole damn thing, it's worth it.
