Fics set during book 7 seem to me to be the rarest. And the ones I do find and read tend to be set within Hogwarts while the main characters are away. So I'd be interested in any fic where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and whoever else the writer wants to throw in go off Horcrux hunting together. Doesn't have to be canon, could just be the starting point for an AU, and it'd be perfectly fine if the story focused on those left at Hogwarts and those on the run. I'd prefer if there are other characters with them its in addition to the three not in replacement.


** There are a few like this or that have this aspect. For Het stuff, part 1 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time][The Debt of Time]] is a horcrux hunt with Sirius added. Its eventually HG/RL and HG/SB, but in this section of the fic there's just the barest beginning of HG/SB.

For slash, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594][Temptation on the Warfront]] is a Drarry where Draco is forced into hiding at Grimmauld place during the Horcrux hunt when the trio are there. At first they HATE Draco, but over time he is helpful and joins in their hunt.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/979182][Cartographer's Craft]] is a really well done Sirius/Harry where 16 year old Sirius comes out of the Marauders Map right before the horcrux hunt. This fic is totally AU for the hunt though, and the horcruxes are all in different places/situations.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/753415][Paradox]] and the sequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/753418][Convergence]] are Drarry really good 6th and 7th year re-dos with the change being that Draco from the future gets accidentally sent back in time to inhabit his 16 year old body and he makes some different choices - one of them being aligning himself with Harry and co. and reluctantly joining the horcrux hunt. Draco in this is suuuper in character and is great if you think Drarry is usual totally OOC.

  Thanks to a clever bit of magic and the help of an old acquaintance, Draco is given the chance to relive his years at Hogwarts with the knowledge of what exactly is in store for the future. However, when things tumble out of Draco's grasp, he finds himself losing his memories of the life he's already led as everything takes a startling turn away from what he'd always assumed to be his destiny.

*** While I'm glad that those stories exist for the people who would like to read them, none of them really fit my taste. I don't mind a slash pairing in a fic, but not when it involves the any member of the main trio or Neville (or Ginny and Luna unless its both of them with Harry AND its well written). To be honest, I don't like any fic that is made for the sole reason of putting two characters together. Now a "what would it be like if these two characters were together" story is something I would possibly read. And I dislike any pairing with a large age gap unless the youngest person is at least 30 in the story. Also not into fics where any twist on someone's age is used to pair them together, whether through time travel or, worst of all, "veela look really young until they are 13 and their bodies mature really fast at that point."

I'm realizing now as I write this that I have a super long list of things that will prevent me from reading a fic, and the stuff I am truly interested in reading is so specific its hard to find. Maybe I should should write some of those myself, or at least try to, but I don't really have too much time right now.

But I really love the premise of Temptation on the Warfront except for the pairing. I would possibly be willing to check it out but the title scares me off.
