** Good luck with this. In a day this post will have disappeared from the front page of the sub and everyone will go back to their "LF a fic" titles with "Can someone recommend some good stories? I don't like bad ones." content.

** Yes, please. There are only so many times I can comment some variety of

#+begin_quote
  We won't be able to help without more info
#+end_quote

without wanting to drink unpleasant chemicals.

EDIT: Misread the post. Yes, please put some basic info in the title. But for the love of God, if you're looking a kind of fic, give some examples of it you have read before. Or, if you are looking for a specific fic, give literally all the details you can remember. If there are only a couple very vague or generic points, we will not be able to help.

** To be honest, I find long titles hard on the eyes. It doesn't fit too well with the UI. I agree with you that you should put some info in the title but only generic info that narrows down the story type you want to find like ‚ÄòHarry studies Runes w/ Manipulative!Dumbledore' instead of ‚ÄòHarry gets adopted by Professor Babbling, whose nickname is Shiva, and he becomes a Rune Savant and he is constantly being harassed by Manipulative!Dumbledore'. The first should already give you an idea about what type of story you're trying to find/look for and would make sure that only the people who know stories in that category would click on your post.
