** Appear to use all the popular tropes.

Then subvert them all magnificently.

Also, make sure to end the story since leaving twinwholived stories incomplete is also a popular trope.

**** Not too sure really. Maybe someone made some satire fanfics with them.

Some of them are:

1.Harry is 'abandoned'

2.Harry is the 'true' Boy-who-lived.

3.Dumbledore makes Harry out to be useless and sidelines him

4.His parents seem to get absorbed in the fame/responsibility of the 'boy-who-lived' and ignore Harry

1. Harry is usually the older brother and thus the 'heir' to the family name and fortune

2. Many fics make him a cripple magically, usually by him losing his magic when Voldemort attacks and being said that his twin used/drew on his magic to 'vanquish' Voldemort using a 'twin bond'

3. Harry either spends his childhood in the Potter home forgotten and/or ignored at all major events or even outright abused, and/or is sent to the Dursleys for his own protection/to ensure his twin can be trained without 'distractions'/because Dumbledore wants him gone/his parents want him gone/because he is corrupted by Voldemorts death/because he is a 'squib' and it would be 'cruel' for him to stay in the magical world.

4. Many such fics have him sorted into non-Gryffindor, usually Ravenclaw or Slytherin

Should be many more, but I can't recall off the top of my head now.

Prince of Slytherin has managed to do wonderfully with the twin-fic genre. Since you love those stories, if you haven't read it already, you really should.

** A loving family. Lily died for Harry so she certainly would not abandon Harry, for whatever reason. Dumbledore can say what he wants, it's not happening.

The twins have a good relationship. There's enough shit going on with Voldemort, no need for more melodrama. Also no drama for drama's sake. With a bunch of genocidal terrorists running rampant, we really don't need Harry's girlfriend cheating on him.

Follow these simple steps and your story will already be better than 95% of the WBWL fics.

** Have them share an unbreakable bond that is continuously tested over the years. I'm doing it in a fic I'm writing now where Harry is Darker and Neville (the BWL) defends him with everything he has. Not exactly the same, but people have commented on it and I got some good reviews for it.

Lily died for Harry, as did James. I cannot fathom them ever abandoning Harry or any child.

** I know it's stating the bleedin' obvious, but you write an interesting 'Twin-Harry' story the same way you write any other interesting story. You write a proper plot arc with engaging, well developed characters and pay attention to SPaG and formatting. And you finish it. If you do all those things you'll aready be ahead of the curve.

** Twins generally fall into two categories: Inseparable and interchangeable (i.e. Fred and George) or trying to be as different from each other as possible (i.e. Parvati and Padma). Probably don't go for the Fred and George style unless you're doing a comedy/crack and want them to bounce one-liners off each other. If you go for 2 different perspectives working together at the challenges of Hogwarts then it could be good.

P.S. Magical twins always seem to be identical.

P.P.S. If you have a smart twin then there's no reason not to kill off Hermione.

*** But don't we just see pure blood twins being identical? Are the Patils confirmed pure blood?

I think you could write fraternal twins, maybe base them like the core of personality the Pines twins had and without the eccentricities they had.
