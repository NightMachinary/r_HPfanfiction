Hey! I'm an author on fan fiction.net, and just recently published my very first fanfic! It's a dramione story set in their sixth year, when Draco is given the task of killing Dumbledore, and Hermione is facing heartbreak over Ron. Both have their own problems, but they find comfort in each other. This isn't a fluffy story, I'm aiming for something angsty and almost dark. I'm taking this slowly, because I want to make this as believable as possible. Draco and Hermione are both characters that absolutely hate each other, so I'm writing it in a way that will make it actually realistic. I'd love it if anyone could take a read and let me know how it is. My pen name is Sydney Hill, and the story is called All Mine.
