#+TITLE: Harry Potter's only ambition in life is to have a quiet, uneventful existence. Trolls? Giant Man-Eating Spiders? Basilisks? No thanks. Harry is no hero, which is why it would be great if he could stop getting dragged in the deadly adventures of his brother, Daniel Potter, the boy-who-lived.

1. Harry REALLY isn't the boy-who-lived, he doesn't have the scar nor does he have the holly wood, phoenix feather wand, his brother does.
2. Harry isn't neglected by James & Lily and he has a normal, loving relationship with his family.
3. Harry is in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff

Starts in GOF, with Harry selected as Hogwarts Champion instead of Cedric even though he didn't put his name in. Daniel is the fourth champion.

1. Turns out the Goblet of Fire has a special feature that makes it show in third person like a pensieve the memories of a champion so that others know why they were chosen. In the first chapter, we're shown Harry's memories of him getting his wand, being sorted and the last three years. Harry's memories also show why Daniel was chosen and we're not shown Fleur or Viktor memories because they're of age.

Harry just wants to live a quiet life but gets dragged into his brother's shenanigans because he keeps trying to save him from his own stupidity:

  "So, let me get this straight, you're going into the Forbidden Forest, at night, without telling anyone, with only a cowardly dog to keep you safe, because Hagrid said something vague about following the spiders?"

  Daniel and Ron both nodded.

** My name is Harry Potter. I'm 15 years old. My home is in the northeast section of Godric's Hollow, where all the wizards are, and I don't have a girlfriend. I attend Hogwarts as a student in the hufflepuff house, and I get back to the common house every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink a butterbeer.

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of pumpkin juice and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any rubbish, like dark wizards or tournaments, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

*** What's left of Harry? Plenty, I think.

Harry in canon never wanted the scar and all the attention made him uncomfortable. He also spent most of Year 5 and 7 and a little of Year 6 angsting about how he just wanted to be normal and everyone he loved dies and fuck the prophecy and really, why couldn't Voldemort just leave him alone?

Canon!Harry had no drive either. Despite what Fanon may says, he was as lazy as Ron and he only ever studied because Hermione nagged him into it or because he needed it to solve a problem related to his yearly near-death experiences. When asked what he wanted to do after school, his answer is along the lines of "If I survive Voldemort? Well...an Auror, I guess..."

+ Canon!Harry was an emotionally stunted orphan raised in an abusive home who had no friends for the first eleven years of his life. He believed that his life was worth less than the lives of others and was okay with dying for The Greater Good™.

It should go without saying that a Harry raised by his parents in a loving home with a twin is going to have a *significantly* different outlook on life compared to his Canon counterpart.

** He was rubbing tight circles on his temples and trying to even his breathing. He would be able to do so for about three deep breaths then his brother's face fluttered behind his closed eyelids and his chest started to rapidly move once again.

He finally opened his eyes and turned to Hannah, who was in the process of creating a wizard version of the Tamagotchi. "Hannah, you're my friend right?"

"It's a trap," Ernie hissed as he passed by the couch in the common room.

"I'm aware," She deadpanned but looked up at Harry anyway.

"Can you just off me?" He pleaded, "A stray spell would work. Just shrink my lungs until I can no longer survive. All I ask is for you to cry at my funeral."

"No."

"I'll pay you."

"Mmm, no."

Harry scoffed turning back to his potion essay, "Some kind of friend you are."

"Ask Susan," Thomas a fifth-year suggest through bits of a pumpkin pastry. "With her Aunt being head of the Aurora department she could probably get away with."

Harry looked thoughtful before Hannah kicked his hip, 'You ask Susan to kill you and I'll mention to Sprout that you need therapy again." Harry cut his eyes at her but she already returned to her project.

"I just can't do this," He hissed throwing his hands up and leaning back, "I don't want to be part of some stupid tournament where people get killed. I just want a quiet and relaxed year, is that too much to ask for?"

"With your brother? We saw the memories, I'm pretty sure you'll be safer in the tournament then within five feet of your brother."

"That is my brother you are talking about," Harry reminded.

"Am I wrong?"

"Well, no. I should see if my parents had any luck pulling me out of this death trap." Harry stood and stretched before rolling his essay up and shoving it into his bag. "Want me to hit the kitchens and grab you something on the way back?"

"Carrots sound good," Cedric remarked behind a book about dragons.

"Anyone else?" Harry asked as he stepped through the portrait. When no one responded he shrugged his shoulders and started the climb to the Owlery. As he passed several students they gave him sad looks or stopped him to share condolences . Apparently, them seeing how he got drug into preventable situations if his brother just listened, made them more inclined to believe he didn't actually put his name in the goblet. On the other hand, no one really believed Daniel when he said that he didn't his name in. They had seen him run headfirst into danger with a smile. Harry was usually several feet behind them calling him and his friends idiots and trying to convince them to use the slab of meat that sat between their ears.

"And where are you off to, Mr. Potter," Professor Snape drawled as he descended the stairs to the third floor.

"Off the Owlery. I'm either going to send post or jump headfirst out the window, haven't decided yet." He intoned waiting for the flight of stairs to swing his direction.

Snape stopped and narrowed his eyes at the boy, "Do I need to talk to Pomona?"

"Hannah already used that threat," Harry relayed as he stepped off the platform.

"That does not fill me with confidence," Snape walked away and Harry knew that he was more than likely going to send a letter to his mother. Apparently jokes about suicide aren't a healthy coping mechanism. At least that's what his parents and therapist have told him.

Hedwig was happy to see him. She landed on his shoulder and ruffled with his hair before pecking at his ear. He laughed and pushed her beak away presenting her with two letters. One for Remus Lupin, asking for more defense books, and one for his Parents. She happily took the letters and disappeared into the night.

After procuring several peeled and wash carrots he made his way back into the common room. He dropped the snack onto Cedric who thanked him. Hannah had disappeared from the couch and in her place was Susan.

"Hey Susan," he cheerfully stated with fake enthusiasm.

"Hannah already said I can't kill you."

He sniffed, "Well, Hannah's a bitch."

"Excuse me?" Said friend yelled from the stairs.

"I SAID HANNAH'S A BITCH."

"Them fighting words, Potter."

For the first night, since his name flamed out of the stupid cup, he laughed. This is what he wanted in his life. He wanted to worry about homework and exams. He wanted to banter with his friends and dormmates. He wanted something stress free. Harry wanted to able to do his own thing without having to burst in at the last minute and drag his suicidal brother out of harm's way. Thankfully, his small little family in Hufflepuff knew this and kept the tournament out of the dorms as best as they could.

Dropping next to Susan, "So wanna go over your flashcards again?"

**** Harry dropped his bag to the stone floor and slapped the pass that Professor Snape handed to him in the hallway on to the table. He climbed over the bench and started grabbing one of the bowls of mixed fruit while Hannah snatched the pass away.

"Do you mind?" He asked before ripping it out of her grasp.

"Therapy?" She wondered while picking a grape off the boy's plate. He slapped at her hand.

"Yeah, Professor Snape floo called my Mom last night," He muttered.

"Must suck having your professors being friends with your parents." She replied with a smirk.

"Stop enjoying my suffering."

"Hey," Terry called behind the two, "Did you finish the transfiguration essay yet?"

"Yeah, I wrote mine on the effects of metal," Harry confirmed after shoving a piece of pineapple in his mouth. "Why?"

"I'm two inches short."

"Just bullshit a closing paragraph that's what I always do. It recaps the essay and prevents from just a sudden stop." Harry wiped his hands on a napkin before turning his entire body around to face Terry. "Let me see yours."

It didn't take long for Harry to skim through the essay. He mentioned to Terry the few spelling mistakes before handing it back. "Just say something like, /In conclusion, this essay provided examples to support my/ blah blah blah. Works for me."

"Thanks, Harry."

"Herbology with the Slytherins today," Susan announced as she appeared to the left of Harry.

"Let me guess you're pairing with Hannah and letting me hang?"

"You know me so well," She laughed reaching for some toast.

"Ugh, I'll see if Daphne has a partner," He mumbled before scooping his bag off the ground and flung it over his head. Rearranging it on his shoulder, he grabbed the pass from the table and stuffed it into his front pocket.

He had to walk around several groups of idling students just to get halfway down to where Daphne was sitting between Blaise and Pansy. Some Slytherins looked up at him before looking away, others waved slightly, and a few just sneered at him with disgust. He ignored him, most of the ones who didn't like him were because of his idiotic brother.

"Daphne," Harry voiced grabbing the attention of the blonde, "Do you have a partner for Herbology today?"

"Yeah, I'm actually working with Blaise."

"I can be your partner," Pansy spoke up. The left side of her short hair was pinned behind her ear allowing Harry to see the dangling diamond earrings.

"Sure. Is Draco being whiny again?"

Pansy rolled her eyes which confirmed Harry's suspicions. He worked with Pansy before, they worked fluently together. The only time they worked together, though, was when Draco had either annoyed Pansy or upset her. He guessed it was a combination of the two this time around.

"We can head there now."

"You guys coming?" Pansy asked after standing and straightening her outfit. She always wore patterned leggings with her skirt. This time they were black and gray with a floral pattern winding its way around her legs.

The two didn't answer only grabbed their belongings and followed out the door. Once at the end of the hallway, the group heard thudding footsteps and saw Hannah and Susan huffing after them.

They nearly made it outside the school before they were stopped. It was Daniel and Hermione. They had called to Harry, the entire group stopped and watched them run-up to the messy-haired Hufflepuff. Daniel's Gryffindor tie was loose and lopsided and his glasses were crooked on his face. Hermione's frizzy hair was pulled back into a tight bun at the nape of her neck.

"What's up, Daniel," Harry coolly asked.

"I think we should use Dad's cloak to get into the restricted section. We are both at an advantage and I-"

Harry stopped listening at that point and the frustration that had been building in his chest since Halloween seemed to burst out of him. Before he knew it, he was speaking.

"No. No! I'm done. I'm done with the sneaking around. I'm done with the detentions. I'm just done. You want to go out on some half-ass idea? Fine. Leave me out of it. I'm sick and tired of telling you that there are better ways to deal with things just to ignored and be proven right at the end.

"Take the cloak and do whatever you freaking want with it but I refuse to aid you. You are me brother and I love you but at this point, I don't want to be anywhere near you."

Harry's ranting had attracted a crowd of students and several teachers, but he just couldn't stop himself. He was so frustrated from the past years of being dragged around. He wasn't a puppet.

"Stay away from me right now. Hannah was right, every time I'm around you, I seem to be in danger. I want a quiet and normal life and if I keep following you into god know's what, I'll never have it. So just leave me out of it."

Part of him regretted what he said seeing the twisted look on his brother's face but a bigger of him was relieved. He had been ignoring what he wanted for so long just to make sure his brother would stay out of trouble. He was done with it. His brother had to know he couldn't put his life on hold just, so he could go off on a half-baked plan.

"Come on guys, let's get to class." With that, Harry pushed passed the loitering students and out towards the greenhouses.
