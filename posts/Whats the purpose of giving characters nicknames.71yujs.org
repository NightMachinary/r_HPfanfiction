Things like voldewhore, dumbledork, an all that crap.

Makes me cringe, good fics have been dropped because this is abused. And i cant find a good reason to do this.


** It's not entirely unbelievable. When my friends and I were 13-15 or so, we had an absolutely bitch of an assistant principal. I don't remember what her actual last name was anymore, because we only ever referred to her as Mrs. DeBitch, just changing the last syllable to an insult. And we obviously weren't personally involved in a war, just showing disrespect and unhappiness with the situation.

Teenagers are silly. They take what they can get, and sometimes that's pranks or rude names.

*** Exactly. Lots of people do that IRL; it's a way to try for realistic dialog. Like anything else, it can be over-done and backfire. It's a fine line, and YMMV is definitely a thing.

Also, shortening a name instead of using "Mate" or "Love", or doing it to needle someone, is fairly common IRL. Lots of people really hate this IRL, too, and some of those go ballistic when they see it in fanfiction. It can be a fine line between irritating one of your characters and irritating your readers.

Aside from YMMV, the "reason" for over-use of nicknames is probably just inexperience as a writer. It's not like people set out to write flat dialog and characters, "As you know, Bob..." backstory, or wildly improbable plots; they just can't do better or haven't learned how yet. Talent and practice; all like that. Dialog is one of the hardest things to get right, and "right" is a moving target.

Me, I like it when a ficwriter has a character shorten someone's name for whatever reason and another character hates it and blasts them for it. It's like they were writing about people...

It's often young people who're writing power fantasies via the Lord!Potter trope or something similar; the stupid nicknames come across as edgy to the authors, and childish and ridiculous to anybody else.

*** Minor, OT nitpick --- do we really need the "!" when discussing Lord Potter stories? Unlike Indy!Harry or Dark!Harry, "Lord Potter" is an actual phrase used in the stories. Maybe you could use "Lord!Harry" as an alternative to "Lord Potter", but "Lord!Potter" strikes me as off.

**** It's actually a hold over from the very roots of internet programming and culture. At this point, it's just tradition, but IIRC originally it was written that way because of actual coding reasons and because the programmers and nerds who used the earliest forms of commercial internet found it much easier to say stuff like "modern!Kirk" instead of "Kirk, but in a modern AU" to get across their point.

***** I get that, and I don't complain about things like "Dark!Harry". However, "Lord!Potter" rang false for me because it's a mixture of the actual phrase used in-story ("Lord Potter") with the common template. To refer to a story where Harry is Lord Potter, the pattern of "Dark!Harry" or "Manipulative!Dumbledore" suggests "Lord!Harry" or "LordPotter!Harry", not "Lord!Potter", since Harry isn't usually referred to as "Potter".

****** Though, to be fair, when he becomes a lord it usually ends up with him being even less of an actual Harry than in the average blarghy story, so I can see why people would see using the surname in this one case as valid.

But yeah, I can see why it irks you. It's better to have something that is consistent.

** I think against a narcissistic psychopath like Voldemort, calling him ridiculous names was an effective way of conducting psychological warfare. In his enraged state, he would make mistakes and be more prone to setups.

During WW2, ridiculing Hitler not only helped Allied morale, but also forced him into serious mistakes on multiple occasions. For example, during the height of Battle of Britain in 1940, RAF was hard pressed and on the verge of losing. The British high command decided to risk a raid on Berlin that had really not caused much damage, but with additional propaganda, Hitler became enraged and he directed German bombers away from RAF airfields to attack British cities. Thousands of civilians died, but RAF gained a critical respite and inflicted heavy losses on German Luftwaffe. The Battle of Britain was soon won, and the Allies would pay back Nazi atrocities within two years.

Ridiculing enemy leaders is a practice that has been proven effective throughout history. Generally the side, who couldn't control its temper, was destroyed.

***** In my own writing, Harry calls Ginny "Gin", but he's the only one that does and only in dialog or thoughts. It probably comes from my own habit of shortening names, including my own. I agree that nicknames in narration passages is not good style.

** Depends. When it's something dumb that doesn't really relate to the character ("Voldewhore" and "Dumbledork", as you mention, or "Moldyshorts"), then I'm with you --- and most important, if it's there at all, it shouldn't be used in the narration, just in dialogue.

On the other hand, there are clever and actually hilarious ones that pop up once in a while. The running gag of "Sleepy the Wonder Turban" in /Like a Red-Headed Stepchild/ comes to mind.

Also, I find it entirely possible that werewolf communities would start spitefully calling Umbridge "Umbitch" as many fics hold, though I wouldn't want it to become widely used in the story.

** Why does there need to be a purpose?

Think back to when you were 11 years old. Did you do things because they had a purpose? Sure but you probably also did them because you felt like it and had no purpose beyond that.

It is often very annoying to read in a story but not unrealistic. Kids can be annoying shits because they feel like doing something and either don't care or don't even know they're annoying.

The unrealistic thing is how every story starting in first year (even canon) shows kids acting like they're 15+ and not 11. Why is that? Because realistic acting 11 year olds would be a terrible story. Honestly for fanfiction they really need to change it up so 1st year starts at 15 years old.

** I only like it if it is done by a) a character who normally gives nicknames or uses humor in the face of adversity like the twins, and b) as a way to fight the psychological part of the war which means there are also other things going on in the story via that line of thought. If that makes it trope-y so be it.

** For me, it'd be one thing if characters came up with the idea onscreen and it slowly took hold, like what might happen in real life. Umbitch and Moldyshorts and the like would still be annoying but it would be tolerable. But when characters who have never once called these characters anything other than their names start using the fan nicknames for them, and they do so universally and in conversation, that's a sign I need to close the fic.

Oddly, those nicknames quite often seem to show up in fics with shite grammar/spelling.

** The childish nicknames for the big bad are pretty cringe, but what's worse is when the main characters get nicknames that feel shoehorned in and awful.

I remember reading a fic where Harry was nicknamed after a different fictional character who he isn't even like, and then he was pretty much only referred to by that alias for the rest of the fic by nearly everyone sans Voldemort.
