For those who don't know, this is Manipulative!Dumbledore's "Grand Master Plan":

He sends Harry to the Dursleys so they could abuse and torture him to near death multiple times, So when he comes to hogwarts, broken, he'll have a hero complexity and also obeys those that saved him and showed him kindness which are himself and the memebers of "Light Families". While Harry is with the Dursleys, him and the Weasleys keep taking Harry's money from his gringotts vault for their own personal needs. Then he molds Harry to what he wants and Harry sacrefises himself while fighting Voldemort, destroying his horcrux and becoming a martyr. Then he, Dumbledore, the Leader of the Light and the Light Lord, swoops in and kills Voldemort. And everyone will declear him Merlin Returned.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824342/1/Dumbledore-s-Next-Great-Adventure-Part-1]]) play with this idea where a Good!Dumbledore who did his best during the First Wizarding World and managed to defeat Voldemort for real end up replacing a Manipulative!Dumbledore in a world similar to canon.

** It's like sending book!Jon Snow to confront show!Jon Snow. I wish there were more canon characters putting ridiculous fanon characters in their place.

#+begin_quote
  Seized by Voldemort at the end of his fifth year, in the Department of Mysteries, Harry was transformed into a cat and sent tumbling through time. Armed with nothing except teeth and claws, Harry has to handle the threat posed by Tom Riddle and his teenage followers. He intends to stop the genius young Dark Lord and sabotage him at every turn...in the form of a cat. Sounds simple?
