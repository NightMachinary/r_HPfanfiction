Are there any fics where the relationship dynamics between the Marauders are portrayed as in canon? Can you recommend some?

While there's nothing wrong with fanfics and writers portraying their friendship as an 'ideal' one --- the kind of friendship where they immediately bond in first year and continue to have close relationships until the end of the war --- I would much like to see a fanfic that creates relationship dynamics based on the little tidbits of the Marauders from canon.

Things like:

- How Peter is seen as the least important member of the group by others inside and outside the group. We see this in canon where Peter is chosen as the secret keeper only because he is so insignificant that the Death Eaters wouldn't even consider him. I'd like to see how other writers would make him react to this over the years and how it shapes his mindset, self esteem and actions.

- How Remus was suspected to be a spy in the First Wizarding War in canon by the rest of the group. If the Marauders were such close friends and even became animagi for Remus, it doesn't line up with how they would be willing to hold enough suspicion to change secret keepers and risk James and Lily's lives. There would have had to been a series of developments over the years in order for them to have reacted like that. It would be interesting to see what they were and if Remus felt this shift in their friendship too.

- How Remus and Sirius' relationship would have played out after that werewolf prank gone wrong with Severus. While I've seen this explored in many fics, a lot of them are wolfstar. I haven't come across a well written one where it only explores their friendship and where they are not in a relationship or won't be in a relationship in the future.

- How Sirius and James' relationship could have potentially overshadowed and undermined other relationships in the Marauders. There's always been a lot of focus in canon on how their relationship was the ideal best-friends-forever and until-the-end-of-the-line kind of thing. It is canon that James and Sirius were arrogant and egotistical during their Hogwarts years, so I'd like to read fics that show them placing their relationship with themselves above their relationship with the others in the group. A hypothetical example: James and Sirius always take each others' sides in arguments even when they know they're in the wrong.

Thanks for reading through all of that if you did. Please let me know if you have any fic recommendations besides ATYD!


** You're probably better off looking for oneshots? Rather than whole stories?

Linkao3(Age of Lies by TheDivineComedian) is a good "Everyone is suspicious of Remus the Spy". In fact, everything by The Divine comedian is awesome, you should read it all. They're really good at those, balancing the lines between fear and trust.

Linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies) has a lot of flashbacks to Marauder Era that explore things like Peter and the Prank and everything else which is very good. Though it's not the whole story.

Linkao3(The Art of Getting By by sarewolf) is an incredible Remus raising Harry story that is just brilliant. It looks at the emotional struggles a 24 year old Remus goes through trying to come to terms with everything that's happened, I highly reccomend it.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10283045]]) is a Peter Pettigrew story you might enjoy. It's written like an argument. While I don't agree with all their points, it was super interesting to have that debate on why he was secret keeper and all the rest. Very good.

Hopefully they help? I think you'll like TheDivineComedian's stories.

*** I can second The Art of Getting by

It's super angsty, the main point of the fic is about Remus tortured emotions and its a very unhealthy woflstar but is very well done and it touches all of the points mentioned.\\
Peter's characterization is actually my favorite thing about the fic so far.

** All fanfics usually go overboard with the first one. Peter, while more of a follower, was still one of their best friends. Keep in mind that while he was viewed as the one who would seem insignificant to the death eaters, he was still trusted enough that they would put the Potters' lives in his hand. Most fanfics portray him as overly cowardly, clingy, and as a hanger-on, not as an actual friend. It's not like he was a slimy bastard who sought to plot against and use the others, nor did his friends view him as inferior to the rest of them. It's just that his fear won out against his loyalty to his friends. I think TheBlack'sResurgence's Stepping Back does a good job of portraying Peter, and lays out a realistic path in which Peter doesn't turn to the dark side.

****** Lily and Snape talking about James saving Snape's life is definitely before SWM - both in the pensieve and as they happened. Snape threatens to sleep out in the corridor the night of the worst memory and that is when they part ways for good. The memories go in order: the sorting, the argument about Lupin and James (that's the big time jump, between the sorting and this part) and then the DADA exam and worst memory and then that night Severus outside the portrait and Lily telling him this is the end.

We never get told what year it happened in as many words but - along with the timing as shown in the pensieve - we're told Sirius was 16 when it happened. 16 is 5th year - Harry is unusually young in his year group, his birthday is not until the school year is over but most people (Sirius included) turn 16 in their 5th year of high school (or yr 11 as it's called in the muggle world)

** I mean this might be a bit of self-promotion but I wrote a one shot about the marauders spending time at a Muggle pub and making friends with the borough bar owner it's called McGregors so maybe try that I would also perhaps consider the art of getting by and there's a very good one shot called the era of the pack about 10,000 words I haven't been able to find it recently but it's an archive of our own somewhere it's from Remus his point of you and just has a lot of how their relationships formed starts in first year and ends somewhere around six I think before James and Lily get together just their friendship some pranks they pulled and some of the drama of like serious dealing with his family Remus

  Long haul Remus Lupin story. Book 1 covers his 1st Year at Hogwarts, and all its ups and downs. Making friends, keeping his secret, and trying to cope with being in the real world for the first time in his life. The world of Shifting Lines will eventually have Wolfstar. Mostly canon with a few exceptions. COMPLETE; Book Two Out Now!
