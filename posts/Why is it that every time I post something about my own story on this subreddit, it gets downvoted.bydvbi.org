** Unless it's 100% relevant to the post it is being commented on, it's going to be downvoted for self promotion.

There's a reason we've added a self promotion tag for posts, and that's because the traditional readers who frequent the subreddit don't think that stories should need to be advertised to get reviews.

My honest opinion? I think you made this post for more shameless self promotion and not for any feedback.

---edit--- Ok I double my opinion, the last time you promoted was 11 days ago on a request that was completely fucking unrelated to your fic yet you still posted it.

** I am tempted to downvote you here for not linking to your relevant previous posts.

This is the only one I see, I assume you deleted the others due to getting a worse reception. That makes it hard to assess why your requests are getting downvoted.

** 1) It is generally fine to talk about your fic as long as it is appropriate to the thread. So if you talk about your Dramione fic in a H/G thread, that will get downvoted. But if someone asks for H/G and you link your H/G fic, it will generally be left at around +5-10.

2) Your story has an unpopular pairing. So, for example, anything with Death Eaters (sometimes, exceptions are made for Bellatrix, but that is a coin toss). That is perhaps the most common reason for downvotes.

3) Your story is poorly written and/or uninteresting. Perhaps people look at the description and are simply not inclined to click on it.

4) The "official" Discord likes to break the sub's rules and organise downvote parties. Deathcrow provided screenshots which did prove such behaviour, even one Mod was involved, yet all that happened was that Deathcrow's post got deleted. So if you happen to land on their shit-list, you will get downvoted a lot.

5) Without providing a link to your story, it is difficult to say more about it. I remember one guy who spammed a PoA snippet where Harry killed Marge and then Ron and Hermione were gloating to Dudley about the incident. It was poorly written and not very funny, yet the guy posted it again and again. I bothered once to give an in-depth critique and yet the author kept reposting the original work again and again. Perhaps something similar has happened to you.

Again, without a link, it is difficult to provide a clear answer.

*** Regarding your post 4, since I know there are people here who are not familiar with the official, yes official, Discord, and will unfortunately base their opinion on your post (coincidentally, you were actually banned from the server for breaking the rules, repeatedly in your very short time there, so where you get your information from is quite a mystery to me):

1. We changed the rules regarding this.

2. We haven't had a single instance of brigading since this was brought up almost half a year ago.

3. Deathcrow's post got deleted because it broke the Reddit and Discord rules ("No cross-posting of conversations/screen caps to other servers in order to stir up drama.").

**** Since when is pointing out toxic behaviour in the hope that something is changed for the better and addressing Reddit rule violations (which vote brigading is) "stirring up drama"?

***** Since:

1. Deathcrow did nothing to approach the mods first, which you would normally do if you were actually out to solve the issue, and not out to make it a drama party.

2. He made it a public spectacle, cordially inviting everyone to come join the server itself. To no one's surprise, least of all Deathcrow's, it indeed lead to a lot of drama.

It's a textbook example of shitstirring. We would have been a lot more open to his points if he didn't lurk on our server for months on end, all the while gathering screenshots, and then posting them without any sort of context on a public server, with all the expected consequences. We mods say time and time again on the server: if you have an issue, message us. He didn't do that.

Last question: why do you still bring it up? Like I said earlier, we changed the rules, and it doesn't happen anymore. One would think the issue got resolved.
