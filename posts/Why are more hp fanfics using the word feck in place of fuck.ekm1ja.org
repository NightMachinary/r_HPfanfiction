Is this a British thing? I've been seeing more and more fanfics use the word Feck and I'm kind of confused as to why.


** It's a Scottish and Irish word. It comes from the same root as feckless, which is a Scots word meaning weak, ineffectual or incompetent. It's sort of a generic curse word and using it in place of fuck doesn't really work at all. They mean two separate things really:

“Feck off” or “Feck aff” is a rather light-hearted expression, all things considered. Usually, at least in my own experience, it conveys more of a mild exasperation with something, similar to “piss off” though it depends on context.

“Fuck off!” is a harsher expression to denote a more serious annoyance or anger. The difference is subtle between the two but they have different outcomes.

** It's an Irish thing that Brits know due to cultural osmosis; it's a slightly less harsh version of 'fuck' for all intents and purposes.

** It's a British thing according to urban dictionary and I'm assuming other nationalities are Brit picking it as well.

** It's an Irish word I believe, which like many Brits I got used to by watching 'Father Ted', the Irish comedy show.
