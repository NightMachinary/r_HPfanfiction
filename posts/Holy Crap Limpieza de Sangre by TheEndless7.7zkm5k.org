I know he saw their creations and has come into contact with them, but has Emily ever explained to him what they will do? And even if he does understand [[/spoiler][He just successfully used a killing curse which probably wasn't good for his mental state. He used it on someone he care's about which has to be traumatic (ask Snape). Last time her resurrection took 13 years so her being 'alive' isn't much of a comfort to him at the moment... but I still think he is an idiot for showing his feeling about it openly]]

** Ahhh... today's update made me sad even though it was a really good chapter.

I see two ways that this is going to proceed. [[/spoiler][Either Harry is going to take up her mantle---Emily already has Avery referring to Harry as 'My Lord' and possibly other Death Eaters as well---though he may bring about a magical revolution in a slightly less bloody manner because he is respected among most wizards for being the Boy-Who-Lived and re-vanquisher of LV as of this chapter. Or Harry is going to be depressed and mope about for 20 chapters while everyone around him trods all over him and his feelings.]]

[[/spoiler][At some point, he's going to realize that he can resurrect her and her popping out of the cauldron, wrapping him in a hug will probably be the end of the story.]]

Whatever the case, there may also be a time skip to the above ending.

***** The premise of the story throws up so many red flags that it's almost ridiculous. Female Voldemort, angsty Harry, manipulative Dumbledore, etc. But it's just so well written. [[/u/TE7]] has a habit of taking concepts that are seemingly impossible to write well and then absolutely smashing them.

[[/spoiler][If I was a betting man, I reckon Harry's going to realise he can resurrect her. But he'll use the Stone to talk with Emily's shade and find out that she'd much rather stay dead. Then he could carry on building on her work alongside Hermione and the others. But this is TE7, so who the fuck really knows where this is going. :P]]

****** I know! Do I count?

Ironically enough I didn't really intend for Dumbledore to come off as manipulative. He's just framed as the villain because the story is told more from Emily's perspective.

I personally don't think he's wrong in like, not offering a job to someone who he's pretty sure murdered at least five people by that point. The blacklisting was compounded more by the fact that Emily didn't really try that hard to find a job outside of the few specific areas she was looking for.

He does things that hindsight can tell us is wrong. Had he listened to her earlier on, had he paid more attention to her, had he called her by her damn name, a lot would have been different.

But while I'm pointing that out. He also didn't make her choices for her. Yes, she had a lot of bad shit happen to her, but she still chose to do what she did.

Dumbledore is still a hero who ended a massive war. And yes, he screwed up with Emily. But that was also during the 1940s when he was pretty obviously worried about something else.

**** I know what you mean but I feel it fits the story. The main theme of the story is perspective. You know the facts (LV is evil, did evil things) but seeing the perspective changes how the characters are seen and muddies the morals. Ultimatly you know Dumbledore is the good guy and Snape is his spy looking for redemption (and is a supreme asshole). But from the perspective of the story these actions get twisted by how the pov sees it.

But thats just my take on it.

** Still waiting for it to be complete. I've read it once and was /hooked/, but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't read it a third time if I once again end up hitting the end in the middle of the story.

But it's a good wait. I'll gladly wait for it to be complete and it's always nice to see it updated in my alerts. It has pretty much the /only/ good fem!Voldemort in the entirety of HP fanfiction, it seems. I like the Harry of the story a lot. Overall its well paced and well written. I'm pretty sure that once it's complete it will be a often reoccuring recommendation, not just on this sub.

** Read the latest chapter this morning in bed. Absolutely fantastic way to start the day! The pacing is excellent and the characters he's created are very intriguing. What I find particularly nice about this story is he isn't afraid to leave things a little subtle. I can't be certain it's on purpose or not, but Harry's relationship with Ron and Hermione is this strange mix of unspoken closeness and increasing distance at the same time that reallly draws me in when a scene with them all together pops up. There's no reliance on outright stating changes in mood or tone, and even conversations generally break down to “he said, she said” instead of “he shouted /passionately/” or some other nonsense. You have to intuit to tone in a lot of dialogue and I find that helps a lot in getting the reader invested in the story while they read. (Although it does sometimes leads to issues where I'm not sure exactly how a conversation is supposed to be read.)

Honestly, it's my favorite story this year by far.

There isn't a H/Hr Pairing. Emily was swaying him toward that so he'd stop thinking about putting his dick in her. Every time he fantasizes about Hermione it slowly changes to Emily.

Some of the light flirting is just Harry being Harry. But when it gets more serious it's Emily pushing him toward that. Hence why he always stops and argues with 'himself' when it becomes anything remotely serious.
