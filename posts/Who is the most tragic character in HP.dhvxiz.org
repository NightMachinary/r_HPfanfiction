Remus Lupin gets viciously attacked as a child and infected with a painful incurable illness which can also put people around him in danger and he is forced to hide it in order not to be shunned from society. He gets acceptance from a few friends, but then has to fight in a war, and then in one night loses all the people that had accepted him fully. He spends years dealing with guilt, self loathing, depression and in poverty. Then he fights in a war (again), loses his best friend (again), so he forces himself to avoid getting close to anyone. He falls in love and finally starts feeling better, but then he dies literally days after becoming a father.

Sirius Black is raised in a hateful household in a family where he isn't accepted which makes him become a runaway. He finds a new home where he is loved, but then both of his surrogate parents die. Then he fights in a war in which his birth family is on the opposite side. He gets betrayed, resulting in the death of his best friend. He gets arrested and put into a prison for 12 years surrounded by creatures that drain him of any kind of positive emotion. When he escapes he lives on the street, often forced to eat dead animals out of starvation. Then he gets put in the home where he spend his miserable childhood and isn't allowed to leave. Then he dies.

Harry Potter becomes an orphan as a baby. He is raised in a household where he is unloved and unwanted and is a victim of all kinds of physical and mental abuse and he gets physically bullied by other children. He is then introduced into a world in which people either see him as Jesus or they want him dead. He goes to a school where he is constantly bullied by both students and teachers and his life is danger almost all the time. He witnesses the death of a schoolmate, gets tortured, gets humiliated in various ways, witnesses the death of various father-figures and a bunch of other horrible stuff. All this culminates in a war which only he can end. Unfortunately, the only way to end the war is for him to die.

Who is the unluckiest? (Or can you think of someone who has it worse?)


** I've always felt the saddest character was Frank Bryce, the caretaker of the Riddle House. Went away to war young, came back with PTSD, wrongly accused of and forever persecuted for the murders of the Riddle family, isolated with no friends or family, figured he deserved it all (or at least was resigned to it), eventually murdered and eaten by a snake.

It's weird how much his story stuck with me, but the phrase "He had a hard war" just broke my heart.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** For me, it's Sirius. Or close to, at least.

Harry still has a future after the whole war, and had his happy feelings of a true home at Hogwarts, despite all the misfortune that befell him. Remus was still a free man, and despite his condition, still had a few shots worth it keeping him kind and gentle - I imagine the year teaching at Hogwarts was very significant.

But what did Sirius have? The only few good years he ever had were at Hogwarts, same as Remus, but he had to deal with abuse, a dark family that banished him out and after MAYBE two years with the Potters. At this point, there's still parrallels with Harry, but from this point on, it's only a horror that lasts a decade and a half. Even worse than Remus, who feels the loss, Sirius has to deal with far more guilt and the horror that he's innocent - yet not for himself. He's put into a prison that clearly made him unable to ever be like Lupin - consistently kind or gentle or stable - Sirius was damaged goods when he escaped. Then it's on the run and imprisonment in the one place he hates almost as much as Azkaban. He doesn't have a year at hogwarts or consistent friends for company. What's his highlight? A few brief days per two years with a godson that he couldn't really know, he never got a real chance?

The fact that he dies fighting, even when murdered by his own family, is practically a highlight for him. In most ways, Sirius died on halloween 1981 too. he was just tortured for 15 years after.

*** Its Sirius for me too that death really fucked me up as a kid. When he died all I could think of was how he wanted to travel in book 3, and how much he hated being back in the house he ran away from and hoped hed never have to go back to. I remember him like going to the platform with Harry in dog form. He knew the risks but he was just so desperate to be free.

I read that death scene 50 times in a row trying to find a loop hole that could help me believe he lived the first time I read it. I dont think id cried harder at a death scene.

I just remember starting book 6 and reading about Fudge telling the Prime Minister that Sirius was innocent and just feeling so bitter. It just had to be after he died. He couldnt at least have 1 day as a free man.

He never even got to know what Regulus did. He would have been so proud. Order of the Pheonix came out 16 years ago and im still salty about how miserable Sirius's life was.

*** Between Sirius and Lupin I can't decide who's the most tragic although I think Sirius's story has more layers. there's a recent thread about the adults in Harry Potter and the implications that they had, but Harry himself didn't understand.

I feel like even if Sirius did get freed and Harry got to live with him, he would just be happy as a 13 year old to live in an unabusive household. He wouldn't understand the whole lot of issues Sirius would have. Even if freed he'd be met with suspicion and his name has already been dragged through the mud. Azkaban offers no respect and basic human needs for its prisoners, he jumps at being addressed politely. He's been isolated, so he doesn't know how to with even adults and yet he's going to live with Harry who the last time he's seen was only one year old. Now he's almost 14.

The mental gymnastics of 12 years passing and feeling the need to urgently fit in to offer the best life possible for Harry is straining, especially when the world as he knew it as an aware teenager and young adult has changed drastically since he's last been in it. Sirius is a man out of time, he might as well have grabbed a time turner and transported himself 12 years into the future.

** Sirius is to me the one that feels the most tragic. But im going to highlight another person cuz I dont see him get much acknowledgement even though personally I think Sirius is more tragic as are others.

Tom Riddle Sr.

Like imagine living your regular life you got a girl you like maybe you want to marry her. But suddenly one day you fall in love with the random other girl. The feeling is intense its obsessive. No one understands but you dont care you love her you get married and things are great. One day she says shes pregnant and the world crashes down on you. You dont love this woman, you dont even like her. Why are you here with her ? Why did you leave the girl you actually liked? Did you marry her ? Did you have sex with her? You feel sick what is happening it seems like a dream you run back home. You tell the truth as much as you can. You cant say everyrthing. They may think you are insane you probably think you are insane

The townspeople say she isnt really pregnant that she lied. They run her out of town. You dont know if she was lying or not but you hope she wasn't. And yet...youre afraid she was. You're not the same afterwards, you can never explain what happened afterwards only that whatever happened during your marriage to that woman wasnt you. It has likely damaged you irreversibly maybe thats why you dont get married despite being attractive and rich. You are 37 still living with your parents. The year is 1943. And then one day you see him. You see him and you immediately know who he is. You have to he looks so much like you. The realization is so horrific that when the towns people find your dead body the expression on your corpse is enough to traumatize them

** merope gaunt. i gauge ~tragedy not just by the presence of bad things, but the absence of good things. quantitatively, more bad things happened to harry than merope. but 'bad things' was more or less merope's entire life

merope & snape are two of the most tragic characters in hp. albus as well, in large part because of the responsibility his power confers on him. no one (but gellert) was his peer

** Obviously Voldemort. Born with nothing, rises up to the heights of power on the basis of no more than his own talent and hard work, willing to endure extreme pain and suffering in order to achieve his goals, pushes past the frontiers of magical knowledge into the unknown, clearly more deserving of victory than his enemies...

He would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those pesky kids.

*** The fact that Snape actually shot his own chances in the foot counts against his tragedy score, though. The girl repeatedly told him to his face, "Those people are using dark magic, they're evil, leave them alone" and he chose to laugh at her concerns. So it was more his fault than eg Remus being bitten or Sirius being arrested.

**** Nah, a lot of tragedy is self-inflicted. That's why many characters have 'tragic flaws' that are technically within their control, but they can't manage the one time it counts. The Count of Monte Cristo didn't /have/ to be so obsessed with his revenge, Achilles didn't /have/ to be so proud, Snape didn't /have/ to be a sadistic racist... but they were.

** Sirius Black it is. Bad home life, sent to azkaban at very young age, died as fugitive in late thirties or early fourties.

Remus life was bad but he atleast he was free and got smoking-hot young metamorphmagus.

Harry's home life was not as bad as some fics show. Ffs We are talking about 80's, roughing up kids was normal at that time. His Hogwarts life was good and got great friends and married his high school love. What else you want in life. He lost his parents, Sirius at a young age but in the end he got what he got big family.

Snape wasted his youth by brooding over dead girl and bullying little kids. He joined DEs by his own choice so no sympathy from me.

Neville was another character. His parents were tortured to insanity, bullied in school by others for his miserable wand work but he evolved into strong wizard at the end.

** So to highlight another person I didnt earlier because I thought someone else already did so I picked Tom Riddle Sr. But I looked through again dont see him so...

Regulus Black. The lengths he went through to destroy then horcrux. And he went against Voldemort for a house elf. Someone that other wizards wouldnt even spare a second glance he was willing to fight the dark lord for.

And the death itself like...can you imagine how fucking terrifying that death would have been? He was so young too. I imagine if he went so far for a house elf hed likely change his mind about muggleborns if he had lived too had he not already done so.

** It's gotta be Lupin. Turned into a werewolf as a child because your father took a stand for what's right; made to undergo horrible, painful transformations; told you're less than human; finally finding friends, then having them uncover your secret; have them try to help you while knowing that you're putting them in danger; having three of your friends die at the hands of a fourth; realizing that you were wrong, and they were betrayed by one of the other friends, and you've let your innocent best friend rot in Azkaban for a decade; realizing that the reason you didn't know from the beginning was because they thought you were a spy; having the spy get away, your friend go on the run, and losing your job in one fell swoop; finding love and having a child, only to be shaken by your old fears and trying to run; reconciling just in time to orphan your own child.

** I think Snape. He was poor and probably abused/neglected as a kid. Then bullied relentlessly, caused the death of the one person he cared about, was forced to teach Potions (a job he clearly hated and wasn't suited for), and then continued spying for the Order especially during book 7 where literally even except the Death Eaters would have wanted to see him dead.

*** It is harder to feel sorry for Snape because of the way he dealt with his tragedy. I mean, unlike Lupin, Snape's feeling of regret didn't manifest in sadness, but in anger. Sure, him being unkind is understandable considering his life, but he did some things that are really hard to excuse.

After a beef with her, she stops loving him. However, she continues to become his only love. I don't blame him for being a jerk. Snape never knew kindness, nor did he know how to give it.
