Finished reading what was written of that fic and loved the premise. Was just wondering if anyone had any other recommendations that fall in this niche.

Many thanks.


** Linkffn(Season of Change)

Linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black)

Linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool), in a way.

Linkffn(Another Day in the Life of Potter Redux), is crack.

  There were only a few things in Harry Potter's life that were absolutes. He was the son of Lily and James Potter and that he was born male. What happens when he discovers the truth. AU Strong/Independent, Gender-Switch, Fem!Harry, Fem!Slash Mature Themes

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Harry's troubled life is further complicated when his sex is changed due to a shoddy potion and a rebounding blood seal, she is the only one not surprised at this turn of events, blasted Potter luck. Now known as Lilly follow her as she embraces her new found freedom and powers as she and her friends toy with the world, for she solemnly swears she is up to no good. A rewrite.

*** Hey thanks a lot, should keep me busy for a while haha.

Just out of curiosity, are you the author of Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise?

**** Yep, a couple hundred thousand words there. Season of Change is unfortunately incomplete and likely abandoned, but still worth a read. Son of Potter, Daughter of Black goes a little too much into that pureblood formal behavior stuff for my liking, but it's well written, I think, and exactly what you're looking for.

******* I wish I was better at putting my thoughts to paper, as it were.

Your tournament changes were awesome and the fight against the hippogriff was really cool. The imagery in the second task was really well done.

The way you write the dialogue feel more...organic I suppose for lack of a better word. They talk more like teenagers and less stilted like some fics do.

Your Dumbledore portrayal is a breath of fresh air after some of the fics I had been reading lately.

I could go on and on but I would probably repeat myself.

Just wanted to say thanks, and I wish you nothing but the best. Have an awesome night :)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.
