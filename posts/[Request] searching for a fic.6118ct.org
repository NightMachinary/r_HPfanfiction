Trying to find a specific fic. I remember there was a scene, after having gotten Harry's emancipation cancelled and having applied for Guardianship, where Dumbledore confronts Harry and gives him a list of things he will HAVE to do. Things like allowing them to search his trunk, allowing them to use legilimency on him, and he was forbidden from seeing the person he was in love with.

Of course, then Harry rips the entire form to pieces and informs and reveals he already HAS a guardian (I think it was Tonks). They'd already seen what Dumbledore was planning and took steps to counter him.

*** Actually, I just found it not even 10 minutes ago. It was Bobmin's Sunset over Britain.

Was that the one you were thinking of?
