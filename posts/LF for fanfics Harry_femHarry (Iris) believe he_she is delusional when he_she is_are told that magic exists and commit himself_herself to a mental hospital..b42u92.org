This is in part based on the theory that Harry hallucinated the entire series, Voldemort. Hogwarts, Dumbledore. etc etc, due to having been abused so much and so terribly to the point that he became insane as a young boy. so Harry (or fem!Harry if that suits you better) gets the Hogwarts reception letter, a Hogwarts staff representative comes to inform him/her and Dursleys that he's accepted to Hogwarts like his/her parents James and Lily Potter. but Harry/genderbent version with a name that suits her far better and is not Harriet refuses to believe that magic exists and thinks she's insane, so he/she requests that Vernon/Petunia have him/her admitted to a mental hospital at once (you can insert an actual mental breakdown here or when she gets into the mental hospital if it suits you). the point of contention between the theory and my post is that yes, magic does exist.


** Hmm...I don't know of any that go that way in particular...the issue is that home visitors like McGonagall are perfectly willing to demonstrate magic as much as necessary to convince muggleborns/etc that they aren't insane.\\
So it'd be pretty tricky for Harry/Harriet to believe that they're insane if their hallucinations are self-consistent and the others around them can see it too.

If you want one where Harry believes that the professors themselves are insane asylum patients, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10928739/2/Insane-Asylum-Escapees-Years-1-7][Insane Asylum Escapees]].\\
And there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][The Perils of Innocence]], where Harry lives in a facility under the care of (extremely competent) muggle doctors, who are trying to understand how magic works.
