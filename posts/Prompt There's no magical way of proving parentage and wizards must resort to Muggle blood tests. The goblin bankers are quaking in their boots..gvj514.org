** Holy crap, I just looked up paternity testing and found out we only figured out Blood typing in the 1930s. And DNA of course in the 1990s. I remembered a TV Show set in the early 1920s where the Professor guy did Blood typing in a small bowl with some chemicals and thought it was a thing in the late 1800s.

Can you imagine the mess if people find out their lineage is not what they thought?

*** I can imagine a version of the magical world that never really looked into proof of parenthood because they're already inter-related, so finding out someone had slipped a non-pureblood in somewhere could take out several families' standing.

It would be a fantastic mess - especially if they used DNA testing on bones and so the modern Malfoy's (etc) discover some hidden family secrets.
