*** Let me know what you think!! I'm co-writing with one of my best friends, neither of us have written before but we're long time fanfic followers! I recently lost my job due to covid so I'm channeling my work energy into something that brings me joy - we won't be everyone's cup of tea as amateurs but so far we're having a lot of fun.

**** The fanfic is off to a good start. I liked how you developed Draco's character and the reasoning behind him saving Harry in the forest.

** Out of curiosity: is there any reason why you chose this particular name for your fic?

*** Hi thanks for your question! I'm writing this story with one of my best friends and something we've always bonded over was our love for Draco. Draco Dormiens means Sleeping Dragon - you'll have to wait and see how our blonde friend relates!

**** It's just that there already is a rather famous fanfic with that title, also focusing on Draco.

Not saying you should change the name or anything, but it did confuse me somewhat at first.

***** Oh gotcha!! We're definitely amateur fanfic writers but longtime followers! We've been so cooped up with covid we thought, what the heck, why not write our own! We absolutely do not mean to copy a title - we're so late in the game it's no surprise the title has been taken for something with a much larger following.

** Rule of thumb: fanfictions that have a description that starts with literal "What if..." or a variant thereof are essentially always bad.

*** Interesting theory... appreciate the feedback! I'm having a great time writing with one of my best friends after losing my job due to covid. I don't expect to be everyone's cup of tea. I hope you find joy in other stories if not ours!
