(Crosspost from [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]]) So, since I started getting into forums again, I noticed Harry Potter still seems to be going strong considering how old it is. I'm curious what kind of fics everyone here prefers to read and/or write. Do you like sticking with canon characters? Or do you prefer to see more OCs? Or is there a happy medium you look for?


** OCs are a lot more difficult to get right and generally suck in fics.

** Canon characters - especially the trio - and original plotlines and AU settings are my favourite combination.

** People say OCs are generally badly written but frankly they're no more badly written than the canon characters. It's a pretty fair bet that if an OC is badly done, the canon characters are as well; and vice-versa. I write OCs so obviously I like them.

I like adult characters or young children so fics set at school usually don't appeal. I like stories that happen 'behind the scenes' with minor characters but don't affect canon. And I do require an actual plot.

**** I'm terrible at favouriting things and I don't find a lot of the sort of thing I would like to see, but I think these have good OC characters. This one is Hogwarts-set, so not my usual preference but I think the OC is very good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10810579/1/The-Rebel-Snakes]]

This one is a historical and could be an original fic without too much difficulty [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht]]

This is about Lucius Malfoy and has good OCs [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11166683/1/Of-Beasts-And-Men]]

And this is a delight. The author sadly died a while back, but left beautiful stories. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2736250/1/The-Garden-Gate]]

** I would say people mostly stick with canon characters but have different plots. There are some OC fics or ones that involve a lot of OCs, the best I think being linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian).

Most OC fics aren't writte very well but if you look, there are a few gems.

** The canon characters have been in my life for nearly two decades so I naturally feel more of a connection to them. I have no qualms about the insertion of a OC; however, I usually don't like them to dominate the story. But if I'm reading post-war fics, it's inevitable and justified to insert some new blood and almost weird when I read a post-war fic with no OC.

** I generally don't write Hogwarts-era, so Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione are out in the adult world doing adult things. This entails meeting new people, so OCs abound as supporting characters. I've gotten some compliments on some of my OCs, so if they're interesting characters, I don't find anything wrong with them. I don't know that I would be super-interested in a HP-set fic with an OC as the main focus, but again, interesting character is key.

** It depends exactly what you mean by Canon. A lot of stories have a character called Harry Potter who, within a couple of chapters, has fixed his eyesight, changed his hair, magically repaired his malnourished body, attained a Lordship, become one of the wealthiest people in the world and is lusted after by the entire female population of the wizarding world. You may as well have just invented a character called Wayne Clams and gone with that instead.

On the other hand there are stories with characters like Daphne Greengrass, who's mentioned a grand total of once in the books, or Susan Bones who appears slightly more but isn't exactly fully developed. Can these really be described as Canon when used in fanfiction? Obviously they exist in the original books but we know basically nothing about them.

My point really is that there aren't all that many characters in the books that are well-developed enough to matter when it comes to the Canon/OC debate. The Trio, the other Weasleys, some of the adults... that's about it.

For me, a story has to have Harry, Hermione and Ron in it unless there's a very good reason. beyond that, I don't much care where the rest come from.

** I like to use OCs to round out a fic and encourage development for canon characters (it sounds awful when put like that, but... yeah).

For what I like to read, I'm mostly into adult-world fics, mostly romance, with some kind of interesting plot thing going on. Muggle world AUs have been fun recently too, I might actually write one soon.

I don't mind OCs, I find them necessary for most stories, as long as they aren't clearly overpowered Sues.

** As for main characters definitely the canon ones. I might make up some OCs when the plot calls for it (and I have to do that a lot for "Dawn of Darkness") but generally, I prefer to use canon background characters as much as possible since they are a blank sheet to work with but at the same time have some established characteristics which the readers are familiar with. And for them, it is easier to "attach" information to a known name than to keep track of a legion of new characters.

** My stories tend to focus on both Canon characters and OC. Although, the OC is my main. I mainly write about Charlie Weasley or Lee Jordan so it's believable that there's some OCs in there.

** Unless the OC is a self-insert (which I do like), I would say canon to start with and not have the OC be the main character. I've liked some OC's but if they're featured prominently in the description I probably wouldn't read it at all, so.

** Well, generally I do like canon characters. I am not averse to OCs, and there are some great ones, but most people can't really write OCs (or OC stand-ins, for that matter ... and often enough not even canon characters) that have their own proper place in a story so it's easy to put canon characters above them.
