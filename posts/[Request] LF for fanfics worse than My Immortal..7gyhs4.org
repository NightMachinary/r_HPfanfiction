*** DAYD is bad, but not the "so bad it's funny" kind of story. It's just bad. I especially hate the glorification of child soldiers in this fic. I've had some elderly relatives who were child soldiers in their youth and seen what it does to people even seventy years later.

Because these two are decisively different

**** I just read the summary but Krum raped Hermione and now Harry has to fix her so that she can have sex again by sleeping with her. Because that is the worst part about sex and how you deal with trauma.

**** I'm guessing it was someone who used to be on the sub, and caused what may have been literally the only actual drama I've seen here in my (not really that long) tenure.
