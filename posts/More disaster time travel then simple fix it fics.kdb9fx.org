Say Harry goes back (or whoever): Destroys the horcruxes, only to find some of them have changed because of the time line.

Maybe Dumbledore dies earlier then in canon.

Maybe mental adult Harry can't befriend Ron and Hermione, finding them too immature. Or whoever goes back in the past: Let's say Snape, finds it difficult to be as cruel as he once was, with the information he has, or Draco is nicer to Harry this time around, if it's Draco who goes back in time, etc.

Just things that are heavily different this time around for being there.

Bonus if Sirius doesn't die at the Ministry. Don't understand fanfics who have him continuously die no matter what. Though that's not mandatory

Would rather not have any Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.
