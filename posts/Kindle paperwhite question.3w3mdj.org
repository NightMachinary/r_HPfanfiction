Does anyone have a kindle paperwhite? I read so much fanfiction, and so many books, I'm just wondering if it's worth the investment. I'm nearsighted and often play the "glasses on and hold the phone away or glasses off and hold the phone up close" game because I read for hours and hours a day. Sometimes I read on my chromebook with the font turned way up but either way after awhile I get that screen-shaped "I've burned my retinas" block going on so I'm thinking of the paper ereaders. Does anyone else use a non-LCD screen for this? Is it worth the $120ish bucks? I've had pneumonia since turkey day and been doing not much else but reading in bed and at this point I'm feeling cross-eyed and desperate.


** I've had every generation of the Kindle (except the big one they don't make anymore), and I would gladly buy each and every one of them again. At the moment I have over 100 novel-length (60k+ words) fanfics and a similar number of traditionally published books on there and at least 4x that of each in the cloud. I am NEVER without something to read. Get a Kindle. It's worth every cent of the investment.

*** Can you connect the kindle to Google books also? I assume you sideload epubs?

**** The Kindle doesn't read epubs at all, so I don't think you can connect to Google Books. For epubs you would need either a different reader or a program like Calibre to convert them to mobi or azw format.

***** Ah I would need the mobi versions then. Too bad no Google books. But most everything can be put in mobi! It is going on my Xmas wish list.

** Well my friend has a Kindle and I have used it a couple of times. To me it felt like reading from a book. It looks just like a paper, and doesn't tax your eyes. Not much sure about PDF support though. So if you spend a lot of time reading epub/mobi docs then I would say it's worth the price.

** I only have a regular Kindle (without the backlight) but I love it. I use it to read fanfiction and everything else. So much better than an LCD screen.

** I have a 2 hour commute and use one. It's been pretty amazing so far, but then again my mobile phone is a piece of crap so I'm not sure how I'd feel if it had a screen worth a damn. I CAN say that I notice little eye strain when using one, so their claims of reducing screen glare or whatever seems pretty solid.

** I have a Kindle paperwhite. It feels absolutely lovely to read from, and pretty much like a book. Sometimes a book with one of those little book lights, depending on how bright I've got it.

I don't use it that much tbh, because I have the attention span of a goldfish and like to check reddit while reading, but that's hardly the Kindle's fault.

** I'm on my third Kindle. My first two are still being used by friends (including a second gen), to give you an idea how well they hold up. I LOVE the paperwhite. Without the backlight it is just like reading a book. With the backlight it's more like reading an improved version of paper books. I currently have over 600 books on mine and it's so wonderful to be able to not have to physically look for the book I want to re-read. Two thumbs up, would buy again (and again and again).

** I use a Kindle Paperwhite everyday, and let me tell you, it is so much better than reading online. You can read it like a book instead of an online story, and you can read whenever you want. 10/10 would recommend.

** I have the paperwhite, I was worried I wouldn't use it much when I first got it, but I've had it for about a year now and I use it pretty much every day. I can't comment on the glasses issue, but I have never felt strained reading it. Thoroughly recommend it.

** E-ink is so much better for extended reading than backlit. I love my Kindle (I'm on my 3rd, a Voyage).

Plus, considering where you posted this, there are archives that will provide .mobi files for download (Ao3), and even online converters that will email a story directly to your Kindle [[http://fanfictiondownloader.net/webversion_kindle.php][FanfictionDownloader]]. I wouldn't recommend PDFs, though, they don't scale to the small screen well.

There are more examples of both types of sites, those are just the big ones that I know of.

Eh. They each have their pros and cons. I use a Nexus 7 tablet and, with the brightness turned all the way down and reading with a dark background, I don't have any problems with eyestrain. With the tablet, though, you can read in the dark while an e-ink device is much easier to read in brightly lit conditions, like in direct sunlight. For me the versatility of a tablet wins out.

**** If you can only have one, than yes, a tablet would be the way to go. I have both. The tablet is great to have nearby for email, searching, blog reading, etc. But any single item I'm going to be reading for more than say, 45 minutes, I tend to transfer to the Kindle. Even some shorter things (more like long-form articles than fanfiction) I'll send to Instapaper and have emailed to my Kindle daily.

** I love my paperwhite! I was concerned about the light never being completely off, but you hardly even notice it at the lowest setting.

I mostly use it when going on long trips though. For every day I just read on my phone, since I can download the fics directly to it. When on long trips, I download a bunch of fics and add them to the kindle ahead via calibre.

Aside from the easier-on-the-eyes factor, the battery life is amazing. It took a week of heavy reading to drain the battery, and left on standby it could go on for months on a single charge. Plus one of the airlines in my country is still weird about using phones on planes, so the kindle was a godsend.

While paper books are lovely, I appreciate the larger font on the kindle.

** I still have my first Kindle, and still use it. I have been considering an upgrade but since I'm fine with what I have I've been putting it off. E-ink is wonderful, having thousands of books at your fingertips is wonderful, the free books and content you can find online is great and being able to pick up where you left off on multiple devices is nifty.

Thumbs up.

** I bought a first-gen nook a while ago, and it works great. You can usually find them for ~$40-50 from Craigslist.
