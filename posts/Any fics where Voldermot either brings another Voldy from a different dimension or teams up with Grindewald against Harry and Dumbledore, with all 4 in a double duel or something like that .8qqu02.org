Bonus points if the battle is well written, with ancient magics or smart use of transfiguration. Blood boils, cutters, bone breakers are just too boring read.


** Something sort of like this happens in linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane), though its not Grindelwald and it happens at the very end. Yes, there is a four-way throwdown.

In linkffn(Realignment), as a minor spoiler Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and MoD!Harry duel in the Ministry of Magic (after Dumbledore and Harry solo-dueled for a while), before Tom gets in on the action. If you think it sounds awesome, you're setting your standards too low.

Also, linkffn(Para Bellum), sequel to Delenda Est, sort of has the Voldemort from one dimension travelling to the dimension of another (its complicated).

*** Yeah, Para Bellum looked like it was gearing up for that, but it didn't get all that far, and looks abandoned now.

You might be interested in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus by White Squirrel) and its sequel; also incomplete, but with a reasonable chance of being continued down the track. Voldemort teams up with several Dark Lords/Ladies from around the world.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

  An ambitious Voldemort prepares to lead his armies into the Delenda Est dimension to topple Minister Black III. But, he has lost the element of surprise, and there is a Pre-OotP dimension in between his dimension and the DE dimension where he will have to fight Minister Black's armies, spies, and civilian meddlers, not to mention two Harry Potters and the infamous Black Triplets.

*** Realignment sounds extremely interesting, I've seen it mentioned a couple of times before, but the summary doesn't explain all that much.

Sadly, I could'nt read more than a few of Magicks of the Arcane before I got annoyed and bored, dunno why, but I just didn't like Harry. It tries to be funny at times when the whole premise screams for a somber tone. I'm probably just not a fan of the humor of the author.

Para Bellum wasn't all that interesting when I started reading right after I read DE, so I stopped like 2 chapters in. Thanks for the suggestions.

**** Here is a short summary for Realignment:

Imagine if the T-700 got sent back in time to kill John Connor, but John had the T-1000 to protect him. Now replace Harry, Tom Riddle, and Dumbledore with those respectively, and that is the main premise of this fic. The disruption and mentorship of Dumbledore begins to change Tom, and in a fairly believable way: he still wants power, but he sees that the power Dumbledore wields is so far above anything he had dreamt of. Bonus: the T-X in that metaphor is Grindelwald.

Magicks of the Arcane...I think I said my piece in the library post, so I will just offer [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/27/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][this chapter]] for you to decide whether reading is worth it.

Para Bellum, honestly, seems to have building to something more interesting than its predecessor, before it died a quiet death.

***** OK, you sold me on the Magicks. Still don't like the random pieces of humor though, hope it isn't that used later on. Also disliked the throwaway way he used Daphne in the begining. Maybe that was it. Dunno. It seems really interesting though. Gonna put it in my "to-read" list. Thanks.
