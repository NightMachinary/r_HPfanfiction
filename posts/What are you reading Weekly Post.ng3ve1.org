** Finished reading Harry Crow as I wanted to know what the similtaneous fuss and hate was about. ((I had read like 40-50 chapters of it years ago, but got bored, busy with other things, or both, and never finished it.))

I wanted to put my thoughts about it somewhere, but wasn't sure a full fledged thread would be okay, so I thought I'd share it here.

Starting off with some positivity, it's complete and the grammar's good. Descriptions aren't bad either, and the world building is decent.

I don't really like how overly perfect Harry and Hermione are though. They don't feel like themselves, and the relationship between them feels "flat" somehow. ((Same with Padma and Neville's relationship, and I feel they would have been better off as friends.)). I also wish they had slowed the relationships down some and not have had them pretty much married at the tender age of twelve. That's WAY too young.

Neville was written pretty flat too, and he didn't feel like himself either. I enjoyed Padma's character though, as I know so little about her in canon and her snarky personality was fun to read. I also enjoyed Barchoke and Hermione's parents were pretty cool, though I wish Dan hadn't been bashed for being freaked out that his daughter was practically married before she even became a teen. And speaking of that, I hate how Parvati and Lavender were bashed for the unholy crime of...flirting with boys. They were fourteen! Fourteen year old girls do that! And I don't know why Parvati was bashed for not wanting to be betrothed to Blaise when she wasn't sure how she felt about him yet. Honestly, the way she had originally decided to handle it, wanting to make sure she was truly in love with someone, was much more mature than the way Harry and Hermione handled their own romance. Her desire to not rush into marriage should be respected, not bashed. Also, when Harry said he and the goblins would shun anyone who had dated/slept with multiple partners...that was really rude and hypocritical, considering he and Hermione were only fourteen and fifteen respectively when they had sex, and it's up to the individual to decide how they want to live their lives!

That said, there were some parts I liked about it. The proactive ministry handling situations like the Death Eaters and the basilisk was much better than how they hid their heads in the sand in canon. I love it when adults actually act like adults and don't make the children do all the work. Things were solved much more quickly than in canon (great, but also sort of bad as there were so many boring filler chapters in second year, though the Basilisk situation was handled amazingly.)

I also ADORED how Robst wrote Augustus Rookwood. Now there's a villain who actually knew how to handle things! He was intelligent enough to keep the ministry on their toes and did things in an unconventional way. He also was rather complex, and while he was evil, I did love how he wanted to make sure his baby son was safe. I could have read a whole story about just him. It's too bad Bellatrix and Voldemort held him back in a way(though their behavior was pretty canonical.)) And while the Bellatrix/Augustus relationship was toxic and began in deceit, they had so much more life and chemistry than the two main couples did that I couldn't help but root for them despite how twisted their relationship was.

I do wish there had been more to the conflict with the three bad guys. The final battle left me disappointed, and you could tell all the while that OP!Harry was going to win and save the day. The only spark was when it was Augustus and Bellatrix leading the ministry and Harry on a wild goose case. I wish Voldemort had been brighter to compete with the more proactive ministry and OP Harry. It would have made things so much better. Harry Crow could have had so much potential.

Sorry for my long post! These thoughts have been burning in my head for a while and I just wanted to get them down and share them with someone.

*** Can't disagree with much about this. I've said before that the Rookwood stuff was incredibly original and written really well.... and then he finishes it all off in a couple of paragraphs.

And that's the problem with robst. He can't do conflict. Harry (and almost always Hermione) are so powerful that it's pointless. He gives the slightest nod to this in the final battle that I summarised in a review as "We won. We thought Hermione was dead, but she wasn't".

There's probably a really, really good story in robst somewhere. I have no clue how to get it out though.

**** I normally love fluff and filler, but it's laid on way too thick in Harry Crow, which isn't something I'd normally say. During the arc in third year, I always looked forward to seeing what Augustus and Bellatrix were doing(mostly Augustus), and even though I hated what they did, Augustus was such an incredibly written character that I almost rooted for him.

It would have been cool if Voldemort had listened and gone into hiding for a few years so he could create a big army, but instead we got a battle that barely lasted a few paragraphs, with Voldemort having only two death eaters beside him, and Harry having a whole army and Hermione having Deus Ex Machina Soul Bond Armor. I know you're supposed to want the good guys to win, and I definitely like seeing my favorite characters survive and triumph, but it was a huge letdown. It was way too easy for the good guys. I was honestly hoping for something huge and thrilling that would take my breath away, considering the setup with Augustus, Bellatrix, and Voldemort's revival. Though considering what you said about that he can't write conflict and Voldemort isn't exactly the genius everyone said he was as Tom Riddle, I don't know why the heck I expected other than what I got.

**** Yeah, that's not likely for Hermione to do, though it could have been out of disillusionment/loneliness, as Harry was the first person her age to care about her, and the only other Hogwarts students she had met at that point(the Slytherin girls) had been mean. ((Though Canon!Hermione cared more about rules/education than making friends at first, so it was a bit OOC. Granted it is fanfiction though, and divergent from canon, so characters don't always act the same in different circumstances.))

******* Evil Dumbledore is very common and I use to like it but I kind of just grew sick of it and I'm not the biggest fan of Robst's fics as in them Harry and Hermione are nothing like Canon but instead perfect op gods who everyone loves apart from the weaselys and Dumbledore.

Also for some reason I seem to have developed a dislike for Hermione, I don't even know why, I just have.

Though I'll admit they have a certain appeal I've read a few when I've felt too lazy to read anything proper that provokes any form of thought.

*********** I think it's one of his but there's one where Harry follows Sirius into the Veil. Iirc the horror dies and he soends decades in between worlds with his dead family and other notable dead people liek the founders, he then comes write back out as super God Harry, where time hasn't passed for anyone but him.

Dumbledore proceeds to go properly senile, Harry and hermione date and marry and Harry if I recall correctly somehow enlists the British military and attack drones to blow up and kill death eaters, and he kills dementia with the sword of Gryffindor. Its called No Hurry at all

I might be confusing the details with one where post war, Ron straight up rapes Hermione and Harry and her are betrayed with the weaselys taking all the credit and having them kissed, then time travel stuff. Where no one seems to care that Harry and Hermione are married at age 11, literally, even Hermione's because apparently they keep their memories too. Now that I think about it I think this is the one where Dumbleodre goes full on senile and other classic Robst shenanigans.

The details get very confused after you have read more than 1 of his fics.

** This week I read All The Young Dudes by MsKingBean89. It was pretty good, though a little frustrating and depressing. It felt very British, which is always nice in HP fic. The author was also not kidding about it being slow burn, Sirius and Remus don't get together until like 200k into the fic. I liked the side characters, they had a lot of nuance. I wasn't thrilled with the way the fic ended, but I suppose it really couldn't end any other way.

** The Gem Cannot Be Polished Without Friction

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23250745]])

This is a side story within the Darkening Of Your Soul series, set to the modern era with COVID-19 pandemic happening in the Muggle World. Harry got himself infected and this led to plans/actions to raise awareness of the pandemic within the Wizarding World.

Meanwhile, the main story titled Darkning of Your Soul is Tom/Harry, where Tom is sane and all for reform while Harry is Master of Death and gave a second chance at life to Tom upon realizing he was not in his right mind as Voldemort.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22230682/chapters/53080453]])

I recommend both stories as they are quite well-written and engaging, not to mention hilarious at times with shenanigans revolving around house elves and Dumbledore.

** *Title*: Mendacium

*Author:* SomeoneFromBrazil

*Rating:* M

*Link*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13883437/1/Mendacium]]

*Summary:* It's a non-BWL Harry, who grew up with a different identity in an orphanage. He enters the Wizarding World when he receives his Hogwarts letter and the author is trying to make a parallel between young Tom Riddle and Harry. The twist, is that Harry has a brother who is the BWL (for real, no WBWL), his parents are alive and we still don't know why he was in an orphanage (the author claims not be due to "We need to focus on the BWL" type of explanation).

*What I Like About It:* So far, there are no annoying tropes. It's well-written (considering the author is a foreigner), and there is no bashing, child politics, or Lord Peverell-Black-Potter kind of thing. Honestly, in chapter two, the Weasleys make a small appearance and I was so relieved to read them as ordinary people and not the stupid ones we usually see in fanfiction.

Another positive point is that Harry isn't a right away genius (the next Merlin) on magic because he read three books in a week. I personally got interested in this fic because it's a No-BWL Harry, intead of the classical WBWL trope.

*What I don't Like About It:* I don't like much the name the author chose for Harry's new identity (although I reckon he chose it to avoid the Hadrian kind of thing). It's not finished, but the author seems to have it mostly done (or, at least, planned).

I recommend this fanfiction because I think there are more positive points than negative ones. I would give it an 8 out of 10.

*summary:*

/Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley./

/In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever./

*why i like it?* i really like fics that feature dudley redemption arcs because i felt like there was always so much potential for it in the books but then it didn't really happen, at least not much. anyhow this is probably my favourite fic to re-read when i need a pick-me-up feel-good fic because it's really hilarious and the banter and flirting between dudley and cho is really well written, and dudley didn't just magically become this super cool person, if that makes sense. there's proper character development...and just, i don't know, it's a pairing you would never imagine but then it somehow works really really well in this fic, and i really enjoy it every time i re-read it. i think it's also posted on ao3 possibly, but i'm not 100% sure

** This oneshot makes me want to give Harry a hug. A tragic take on the pre-Hogwarts timeframe. What if Harry's scar wasn't from Voldemort, but from Uncle Vernon? Let me know what you think. This one's been on my mind for a long time. linkao3(26358568)

  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.

**** yeah! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]]

It's a Black family focused story which really gets into the nuances of the Black family and is just so incredibly mind blowing with all its plot twists and the light horror (nothing very horror just some elements which r uncredited written). It's written so well I forgot it was a fic and not an actual book when I was reading. It's like a murder mystery novel that with names that aren't hp is incredible enough to be published lol. I'm reading it again now to catch all the clues and stuff and even more mind blown reading it the second time. I feel like i'm reading harry potter for the second time and catching things I didnt the first it's so good. Oh yeah and it's regulus centric and he's my favorite character and i'm a sucker for the Black brother's relationship.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

**** Yeah! Let me just copy and paste my whole fic rec list lol.

- the Young Dudes by mskingbean89. Loooong fic charting the marauders lives frok Remus' POV.
- Starman by rsbarelle - all the young dudes from Sirius' pov but can also just be marauders one shots if you haven't read atyd.
- Airplanes with the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black by rsbarelle bc more self promo and my subconscious is absolutely hilarious if I do say so myself. I'd like to thank the great gatsby I fell asleep watching and the fantastic beats marathon I did on the plane.
- these cuts I have by melindaleo - canon compliment post war fic, literally pics up like after the last chapter. SO GOOD. LITERALLY WILL RAVE ABOUT THIS FIC FOREVER. AND THE SEQUAL IS PROBABLY GOOD TOO BUT I HAVENT READ IT YET.
- Hogwarts, to welcome you home by gedsparrowhawk (FaceChanger) is the epilogue we should have gotten. It's so well written and has such a special place in my heart.
- Twin Size Matteress by han_the_banan - mmm jegulus angst.
- Seeking Ginny by Casca - Ginny coffee shop AU vibes. SUCH A GOOD STORY. Second fic I ever read so has a special place in my heart and I love the OC's. Ginny is cool and lives in Paris and studying languages like shes so cool I love her. Harry is kinda annoying but ig he stressed from work so whateves but it's such a good story and I scream whenever I read the ending.
- As Soon As He Can by Trex_patronus “For someone who planned on dying, Regulus Black hadn't given much thought to what would come after. For him, it's becoming a ghost, and hunting horcruxes with his idiot brother and company. Yay.” he's so sarcastic I wanna slap him and hug him at the same time. It's soooo well written I love it sm.
- Little Box of Memories by jewishsiriusblack - OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS FIC SO MUCH. DESI JEWISH JAMES, JEWISH REMUS, JEWISH LILY- WHAT MORE IN LIFE DO I NEED. THIS FIC MAKES MY HEART SO FREAKING HAPPY.
- La Magique étude du Bonheur by xslytherclawx - Regulus sorted into Ravenclaw AU with major focus on OC's. BOTH OF WHOM ARE JEWISH AND SPEAK YIDDISH AND ARE ALL AROUND MY NEW FAVORITE PEOPLE EVEN THO THEY R FICTIONAL BUT IDC I LOVE ISSAC AND MAX

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

  Sirius Orion Black, our favorite 'star man' and Bowie fanatic- it's as though the title chose itself!Compilation of one shots from MsKingBean89's 'All The Young Dudes' from Sirius Black's perspective & original 'Bootleg chapters' from other special characters perspectives that take place in MsKingBean89's Marauders' world! Lots of Wolfstar, lots of Sirius and James' friendship, and lots of Sirius and Regulus' relationship! If you haven't read ATYD, feel free to read as Marauders one shots!DISCLAIMER: We do not support or tolerate JKR's transphobia and bigotry at all. Also, the chapters are not being written in a particular order and we will not be writing the entire fic from Sirius' perspective, just whichever strike inspiration, but we hope you enjoy these glimpse's into Sirius' & others lives in ATYD!

Started reading only because of the quality of /olivieblake's/ other works and the general observation that Muggle AU's have higher writing quality. Has anyone finished this fic?

*** I truly love this fic. Yes it's way longer than almost anything but the friendship dynamics, the semi-angsty love story and the banter really make it move fast. Also as an American with a passing interest and no real idea how British monarchy works I also enjoyed that aspect to it. No clue how accurate it was but that was great. There is a sequel olivieblake has written as well but that didn't hold my attention as much as the original story. Also I love the au aspect bringing in HP characters to this world and she nails their muggle alter egos pretty well.

  Objectively speaking, Hermione Granger knows Britain has a monarchy, just as she knows Prince Draco (the grandson of the current King of England) is probably off somewhere living his royal life in total unrelation to hers. Seeing as she isn't delusional, she doesn't really expect to be his friend. She doesn't expect anything that comes after, either. Dramione, modern royalty AU. COMPLETE.

** I'm reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13234016/1/The-Lost-Horcrux][The Lost Horcrux]] by Th3Alchemist (M).

Quite a few twists and turns in it, which has got me interested to see what happens next. A few references to a TV series called the Worst Witch (I mean, Ethel Hallow's Young Witches Academy & Mildred Hubble's Academy, those two names taking me back to the late 90s!)

** *Title*: The Dementor's Curse\\
*Author*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4640360/mimifreed][mimifreed]]\\
*Rating*: M\\
*Link*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13686510/1/The-Dementor-s-Curse]]

*Summary*\\
The Resistance discovers how Dementors are created. Hermione takes on the curse and goes back in time to discover the cure.

*The Good*\\
This has managed to stay on my FFN Alerts list for six months now so deserves a mention at least. There's some good writing here and the main plot point is totally original. The way the characters decide to deal with the problem at the start is done really well too. Once Hermione goes back in time - and sorry for that spoiler but there's really no way to describe it otherwise - the Previous Generation characters are written well, and canon events like the break in trust with the Marauders are handled plausibly.

*The Bad*\\
The Hermione/Remus thing never works for me. I get it's a fantasy for a certain section of the fandom but it's almost always forced. This story also has an unnecessarily gay Harry. If you're going to change canon, make it a Chekov's Gun thing and make it essential to the plot. Combined with the Hr/RL thing it makes the story seem like a bit of a teenage girl fantasy. Sorry if that sounds sexist but it's just the way it is.

*Verdict*\\
As I said earlier, this has stayed on my alerts list for months, and discounting my increasingly desperate hopes that some older stories will ever update, there aren't many that make the cut. It's a bit of a female sexual fantasy story but it's still worth a read.

  When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary he does not write 'Hello.' He does not write anything at all. He draws. Tom Riddle falls in love with the artwork._________________Sketch by sketch, drawing by drawing, the ink Harry pours into the diary manifests as creations in Tom's monochrome world.

#+begin_quote
  A fifteen-year-old Tom Riddle slips through time, pulled by a scarred boy into a seemingly idyllic future. Harry Potter falls with him into a reality untouched by Voldemort's reign. Taken into the Potter household, the two form an unlikely bond -- but between centaur magic, governmental plots, and the darkness at the heart of the Forbidden Forest, this new world is not as it seems.(In which Tom learns to be kind, Harry learns to be cruel, and ancient magic sings to them both from the woods. Meanwhile, a war of metal and secrets brews in the shadows, threatening an end to the fragile peace.)
