*** Yes, but there are wizard-run Dragon preserves, and Dragons are beasts. By contrast, Acromantulas are a sentient race, and one on spectacularly bad terms with wizards, who (Hagrid notwithstanding) live deep inside the forests of Borneo, doing their very best to hide from wizards. Where do the fanon-makers think the wizards are getting the silk /from/, exactly?

As far as we know, Acromantulas are only found in the wild and the wizards would love to genocide the hell out of them if they could locate all the nests, Acromantulas are sentient, and Acromantulas were created by wizards; whereas Dragons are only found in preserves rather than in the wild, are non-sentient, and are treated as a legitimate clade of animals.

******* Acromantulas aren't supposed to /exist/ as far as wizarding law is concerned. 18th-century wizards from Borneo bred the entire species into existence to guard their ill-acquired treasure, then belatedly realized they shouldn't have made them fully intelligent beings when they rebelled against their masters, killing a fair few of them and escaping into the jungle. No one but Hagrid was ever crazy enough to intentionally breed /more/.

***** For Basilisks, my view on the matter is that Basilisk Venom is so corrosive and destructive that it never degrades because all degrading agents that come in contact with it are dissolved away. So the world's supply of Basilisk Venom is small, but extant, and it goes back to the Dark Ages when a Basilisk was last officially slayed.

**** If you want acromantula silk to be a thing in your fic, here are two moral options:

1. A population of acromantulas who are not too bloodthirsty to trade with humans. They produce silk and sell it. It might be an aberration that that population is relatively gentle, or it might be an aberration that Aragog's group is so bloodthirsty.
2. A population of acromantulas who are not sentient -- and, for practical purposes, are likely smaller, less aggressive, or less resistant to magic. Aragog is different because he's the product of Hagrid's early hybridization efforts. (Maybe it's for the best that Hagrid was kicked out of school?)

That the ministry only had a say in one teacher implies it can't be entirely state funded, but the Weasley's seven kids on a single income implies it's not privately funded, so maybe it's a mixture of alumni donations, sales from the forest, and enough ministry funding for them to have just a little bit of say.

What happened with 'Professor' Umbridge was that the Ministry just made a decree that legally Hogwarts would /have/ to obey them on this issue. End of story.

As to your suggestion, I find that extremely unlikely, because, first, Hagrid viewed Aragog and his ilk as friends, not a resource to be harvested; and second, he kept them a /secret/. It's debatable whether even Dumbledore himself knew Aragog survived his encounter with Riddle, and if so, I'm pretty damn sure he didn't know about Mosag and the Children.
