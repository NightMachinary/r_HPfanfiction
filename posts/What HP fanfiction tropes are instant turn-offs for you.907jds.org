Don't make her better (or crazier) than she is. Marriage Law and House Elves rights are all about politics and politics is all about compromises.

There're might be reasons for her to support some version of Marriage Law. For example, if she gets political support for her “spew” project (what is more important for her: slavery of the whole race or total immunity of some human rights?)

*** Agreed. However what I find most "funny" is that many Marriage Law fics institute such legislation because of low birth rates and small or soon-to-be, if not already, decreasing population numbers. I wonder why authors would feel the need to enact any sort of Marriage Law to spur growth rates. For some reason, Fanfiction authors don't understand that bigger is not always better (I mean, seriously, how hard is it to simply Google the happiest countries in the world?) nor do they care to understand negative impacts of having sudden large spurts in population numbers. Lazy writing and maybe an absence of any critical thinking is my guess.

But, yeah, authors who write these storylines really don't look at the big picture of how this would affect a society. Smaller, in the case of populations, is typically better as long as they keep a fairly steady replacement rate.

It's not really "funny" if you look at [[https://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=25][the countries rating by birth rate]]. On the top are countries where human rights (and consequently woman rights) don't exist.

From that standpoint Marriage Laws are horrible, but unfortunately very rational solution.

***** I was being sarcastic. In grad school, I wrote a paper about low birth rates in East Asia and the positive and negative effects it could have on their economies. I compared that with decreasing populations in Eastern Europe. But you're right, there is a strong correlation between countries with high birth rates and those where there is a lack of any form of human rights. Also, I meant "funny" in the sense that many writers of such laws don't take into account outside factors of why such a law would exist in the first place. Like [[/u/Lucylouluna]] said, it's mainly just a way to force two people together who'd have nothing to do with one another to interact and fall in "love."

I see nothing bad it it. "Titanic" was filmed for that purpose only (and to the male MC to die in the end of course).

I can see some reasons when Marriage Law has two purposes:

1. to increase birth rate;
2. to mix muggleborns and purebloods together.

******* Titanic had a more natural flair about it. From my recollection, the romance between Jack and Rose wasn't too forced (though I can't even remember the last time I watched Titanic). Plus, Jack and Rose weren't the two participants in any sort of Marriage Law (Rose was in an arranged marriage by her mother but not with Jack).

#+begin_quote
  To increase birth rate
#+end_quote

Like my initial response to [[/u/Lucylouluna]], why would a Marriage Law have to be instated for the birth rate to rise? I can understand giving children a home setting but in many Marriage Law stories I have read, many authors stipulate that a divorce is possible after 5 or so years. Marriages don't need to happen for births to take place. The U.S. was a fine example of that in the 2000s though even our birth rate and the number of live births have decreased recently.

It's to mitigate taking away women freedom. If a marriage is bad enough that even common children can't save it, a woman can get a divorce.

Therein lies the problem of actually referring to such as a *Marriage Law*. Call it a Family Planning Initiative instead. Introduce tax breaks (or tax increases) on singles and those unwilling to have children (like Hungary did back in the 1960s). Allow for cash baby bonuses, 100% of salaries for first-time mothers on paternity leave, allow part-time work for first time mothers and fathers with full wages paid, etc. To make such into an actual law, and to call it a *Marriage Law* on top of that when the end-goal is to *increase births*, is just ridiculous. Again, we're operating in the magical community of Great Britain as many authors of this trope just want to force people together because more often than not, they can't think of a better situation (one that's more natural) to allow two seemingly random people to fall in love.

****************** It could go three ways: he didn't know the incantation, it was deliberate underage magic, or he did know the incantation. And if he did know the incantation, it doesn't change the fact that Transfiguration is the hardest branch of magic and he managed to cast it at only five years of age, whether he intended for it to be a spider or a tiger. That to me, is on par with someone controlling their magic at nine years of age. And I personally can't see a five year old saying the incantation correctly and flawlessly.

Yes, I repeated your point because you seem to be saying it as a favor towards your argument and it could just as well apply to mine. So it's a 50/50 situation. I meant 'did'.

Worse still, if this is somehow used to glorify Snape to get him together with Lily. I actually like Snape as a character, and have read some stories where he was redeemed, but if the author feels the need to bring James down in the process, then I don't think so.

I get it. The "Always" quote got a lot of people, but to me, so did James' /“Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!”/

One was willing to die for Lily, the other actually died for her /and/ Harry, wandlessly faced off against Voldemort. James grew out of his bullying phase, Snape grew /into/ it. But just because one got more screentime and is a tragic 'hero' (yeah, right, like James' death while he was still young and just had his first son, betrayed by one of his best friends, is not tragic, or heroic, at all), the other is often forgotten by the fans.

We see Winky as an example of "proper" House Elf and what freedom did to her. It won't be enough to just make a law about their freedom (do they really care about human laws?), but it's required to start a slow process of teaching them and their children about making choices for themselves.

When they could live in the society by themselves and make decisions for themselves, then the freedom will com itself.

Purebloods do have their own culture (like nobles in the our world).

Muggleborn Hermione is arrogant and ignoring everything that contradicts her opinion.

It seems it's not a fanfic trope, but actually the canon.

So we have a KKK-like subculture, who does not seem to act when deprived of their leader, happy in their legal and financial-backed superiority, with influential members having barely escaped prison with flimsy excuses a decade before and half hiding since, raising their children with their views and ready to drop everything and answer in minutes when the call comes.\\

Malfoy is a dumb kid that parrots his father's words (and, by book 7, seems to have doubts), Crabbe is the kid that likes to pluck insects wings and kick dogs and was never punished for it, Parkinson is an arrogant teenage girl that throw a fit because the brand new car her parents bought her is watermelon yellow instead of tangerine yellow.\\

Not once, in the entire fucking history of HPFanfiction, has Harry ever had a good marauder name. I still don't get how she fucking managed it, but JKR's nicknames for the marauders are literally perfect. They're elegant in their subtlety, simple and catchy, a little wacky, and incredibly /clever/. Maruder!Harry's nickname is, at best, only ever simple and short. It's never witty, and it's never subtle. I's always bullshit like 'Stripeclaw' or 'Shadow,' because he's some magical shadowpanther/wolf.

Anyways I do agree when Harry and /only/ Harry gets like 4 /magical/ animagus forms, including a phoenix that allows him to travel wherever he wants - with no explanation whatsoever as to how he can do it.

The issue there is that /that/ kind of harry is usually also the god!Harry who always, always wins (basically a Mary Sue).

Since its a fanfic and JKR basically set no limits to the universe , one could get the multi-animagus trope and make it /interesting/. For example: making it so Harry can't use some type of magic because he can transform in any animals when he learnt from a Shaman in an african country. So no Harry is forced to use his wit to best Voldemort as a multi-animagus without the use of a wand.

Its just an idea, the point is to make it interesting, so magic can have mechanics that allow the reader to immerse without Harry basically being a god.

The general logic seems to be that you don't have the same reaction time to put up a shield (a bullet can travel at 3000 foot/s while a spell can be dodged, so let's say 140 feet/s max, with something like 30-80 more probable) and the spell to slow movement (arresto momentum) needs to be aimed, and good luck hitting a bullet. And honestly, I don't see anything wrong there. Maybe the Weasley shield gear would be more useful, but that is supposed to be rather weak magic.

******** To be honest I don't like most interaction between Muggle stuff and magic for exactly this reason. The problem is that magic in HP is not fleshed-out to work in tandem with physics because it's... well... magic.

But equally so, trying to quantify everything to work within a set of rules like RL physics just turns me off from a story, because then it doesn't feel like magic any more.

I agree in that the scale of "wizards can stop bullets" needs further consideration in terms of how that would actually work, but it is a general issue in mugglewank stories or vice-versa (and indeed in a big portion of fanfiction) that detailed plans for how the magic systems work are not often executed to the extent that would answer those questions.

**** First of all, JKR left very little frame of reference regarding the mechanica of dark mafic. so here it goes.

Every source on JKR works point to the unforgivables needing a malevolent intent towards its intended victim. In other words (paraphrasing Bellatrix's actually - You need someone /more/ evil?) "You have to mean them"

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses#cite_note-HBP28-3]]

There are many instances of this (Harry not being able to cast Cruciatus is one of the main examples)

That they were made legal does not mean that they aren't evil. That is not an argument.

So, dark magic does exist or it doesnt, and the three unforgivables have reason to be called that way. Moody (fake one) explicitly says that they cannot be easily casted (they need power and intent, and the words ->even Voldemort cannot do them wordlessly).

/"You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain --- to enjoy it --- righteous anger won't hurt me for long --- I'll show you how it is done, shall I?"/---Bellatrix Lestrange's instructions on how to use an Unforgivable Curse[src]

That doesn't sound like something that is not evil.

So when authors state that dark magic is "misunderstood" i immediately dislike it and my suspension of disbelief is broken.

Another way of seeing this is: you cant have it both ways. If avada kedavra is not "evil" (etymology says it means "let things be destroyed" - which is /not/ derived from abracadabra) then neither are horcruxes.

And man you would have to give me some serious arguments to justify to me horcruxes not being evil.

***** Lol, I would never say that horcruxes weren't evil :) I'm also well aware that, at this point, talking about Dark Magic so far in depth goes beyond Canon into the realm of pure conjecture.

Dark Magic working, as you say, on manivolent intent allows for the likely hypothesis that JKR's magic as a whole works through intent, especially since we also see this play out with the Patronus. The problem here is that we then have to assign intentions to individual spells in order to determine where they lie on the scale of magical morality.

With certain spells and disciplines, it seems that sheer willpower, along with the repetition of specific rituals, is enough to make magic happen. Wingardium Leviosa, for instance, or apparently most transfiguration. The trouble comes when you look at other magic performed by the characters.

Case study: Hermione setting the birds on Ron in HBP. Are the birds willed to go to a certain position that just so happens to include Ron, or is Hermione using her anger to intend to harm him? Physically, this makes little difference - does it make a difference magically? Are people dipping into Dark Magic all the time without realizing it? Is Dark Magic a moral definiton or something that does active harm to your soul? Are there people who create magic spells in such a way that they technically weasel around being Dark?

And what about otherwise harmless spells used with an intent to harm - think James Potter using Scorgify in SWM? Do they stay non-Dark, or do they count as Dark Magic? If its the former, that implies the the malicious intent element is dependent on the creator of the spell rather then the caster.

This is all incredibly irrelevant and wildly speculative, of course, but hey, it's fun!

****** Scourgify and avis are not Dark magic. They are transfiguration and a charm respectively. Why would those corrupt? there are also mentions of neutral spells in defense (reducto is the one on too of my head).

Another example of dark magic is sectumsempra, which Harry used. He immediately regrets it when using it on Malfoy in HBP. Also any injuries with dark magic prevens correcr healing (George not able to grow hos ear back due to Sectumsempra as well).

Your point is that neutral spells csn be used to evil purposes.

And that is why your argument actually helps mine.

They are neutral, scourgify is explicitly used for cleaning. Wingardium leviosa is just a levitation chsrm. But you csn still kill with it.

So why risk using dark magiv that /will/ have effects on the user , when you can just get creative with neutral spells.

There are also neutral DADA spells. That is the whole point of that class.

And my point was rhat some authors just use dark magic as if it was not "evil" or "morally wrong" to use spells that need the use of negstive emotions to fuel them and cause irreparably damage to both user and victim.

Their usual example is avada kedavra. But itd perfectoy stated in the books that the specific intent for the killng curse is to commit murder. Not "kill for mercy" or any thing like that but /murder/. Which if you ignore that it has some physical effect in its own, its phycological effect would be incredible.

Lets say you want to use it for a terminal cancer patient. Your whole state of mind qould have to chsnge from "sparing him mor pain" to "i want to murder him/her because i hate him". Can you imagine how badly can that affect someone?

I csnt imagine a healer trying to murder every terminal patient. At least a good healer.

That is why Avada Kedavra is evil for me (and should be for everyone IMO).

Cruciatus has no defense argument just pure plain wanting to hurt another. If you want to use it like a "defribilator" like some authors mention, hell there should be a medical spell that does it without hurting every nerve in the body.

******* I think we have slightly different ideas of how magic works in general. Which is fine since JKR never actually says how it works :)

Your idea, if I'm understanding you correctly, is that Dark Magic is something materially and magically distinct from other forms of magic, something that has both soul-damaging intentions behind it and by its capacity to do irreparable damage to the target - as something, in short, that /cannot/ be mistaken for anything else.

My idea of how magic works, on the other hand, is that magic is a kind of amoral force that wizards and witches can tap into. This moves the Dark aspect from the magic/spell itself to the caster. There are some spells that would be more difficult to cast without Dark intentions - the Cruciatus, as you said, has no defense argument. But in what I'd been imagining magic to be - completely different from yours, of course, so also completely irrelevant to what you've said! - there are circumstances in which spells that could be used in a Dark manner could also be used in a non-Dark way.

The Avanda Kedavra we have an example of in Canon, where Snape kills Dumbledore not because he full on wants to murder hom but because it is necessary. The Imperius, as well, could both be used to force someone to do evil (a Dark manner) or to lead someone too young to follow directions to safety (a non-Dark manner).

Again, different models of how magic works, vastly different interpretations of Dark magic :)

Is it when they try to say the unforgivable's are misunderstood or dark magic as a whole?

Dark magic is beyond the unforgivables. In your opinion would it be evil to use dark magic in the defense of another or for justice?

Interesting. It seems like you have a very narrow reading of what is considered dark magic and that is why you dislike the trope dark magic is not evil. The trope dark magic is not evil just tends to have a much broader reading of what is considered dark magic.

In canon, dark magic isn't exactly explained but its pretty fair to say it is magic that is meant to harm another. Literally every "good" wizard and witch are now "evil" for using dark magic.

Is there anywhere in canon that says using dark magic has to corrupt? Don't say unforgivables either because those are the darkest of the dark. There are a lot of dark magic in canon that doesn't require the user to sacifice their soul or other equally terrible requirements. Jinxes would be dark magic because they are meant to harm, yet is used regularly by everyone. Hexes, and some curses are the same.

Would you say doing any one thing evil makes you evil?

******** On the contrary ive read Dark Harry fics that you wouldn't believe. Harry goed bad, Harry is LV heir, even crossovers where Harry is a sith.

It's kind of a popular theme to have Harry being dark and that is somehow "cool".

But a single instsnce of dark magic wouldn't corrupt i think, as in it would make you evil. But if you routinely use a curse that require a negative frame of mind - or "evilness" if you like - it /will/ have repercussions in the phsyche, starting by desensitization.

Honestly the problem I have is when its taken to an extreme like saying using Crucio and AK constantly doesn't have consequences in your mind.

What i am saying is that /those/ curses are inherently evil. The curses, not the person. But if a person uses them then they are evil because murder and torture are evil no matter what.

This argument can go on and on, we can continue if you like.

Imperio is also an evil curse becaust it /subjugates/ the victim (if they dont have mental fortitude or whatever that means).

Also there is the analogy to guns. So like i said the discussion can go on and on.

One of my points was that sometimes thr fic underestimates the gravity of a major Curse and even trivializes them (e.g. AK which does need murderous intent)

Really it all depends on the fic.

In Hp Methods of Rationality there is a chapter where Quirrell absolutely destroys DADA class stating that an AK can defend you from pretty much any dark creature. (Though its validty is debatable since its obviously Voldemort giving the lecture).

I would haha. I've read a lot of fics across the board. I've gotten to the point where I don't mind any trope anymore so long as it is done well.

I'm not arguing about the unforgivables because unless the author changes how those spells are cast, its difficult to say it isn't evil.

However, dark magic /does not/ require a negative frame of mind. There are a lot of dark magic that gets used in canon by everyone. It sounds like you have dislike the trope unforgivables aren't evil, not the trope dark magic isn't evil.

Where does it say dark magic requires a negative frame of mind. Please give a reference that is not the unforgivable because i'm not disagreeing with those. If you're saying magic is only considered dark magic when it requires a negative frame of mind, then that goes against canon and that's fine to have as head canon and I won't argue against that because that is your opinion.

Dark magic in canon however includes things like:

Bat-Bogey Hex Stinging Hex Blasting Curse Body-Bind Curse Knockback Jinx Oppugno Jinx

All of these are dark magic per Rowlings definition, yet it does not state in canon that any of these requires a negative state of mind.

*************** Gotcha, and if you're using this site to determine dark magic then I'm not too sure how you say dark magic = evil because [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Jinx][jinxes are dark magic]]. To be honest, this entire chain so far seems to validate the trope that dark magic is misunderstood since a ton of people say dark magic is evil when it clearly isn't.

And don't read into this as me saying the unforgivables are misunderstood, because I'm not. I'm saying dark magic as the category, not specific spells.

But with the info of the books, must evidence points that the unforgivables do need the intent of muder and torture.

So usually when in fics they refer to dark magic , they talk about the really bad curses like the unforgivables, not jinxes and so.

Trivializing such matters is what i do not agree on.

****************** In other topic, i personally dislike that the spellwords are tivialized.

I mean if an AK doesn't need the actual words, why eas the point of name it then.

I guess i am more or less biased to the /Name/ of the spell, since i read the Kingkiller chronicles (not hp fanfic)

I mean casting /Avada Kedavra/ out loud should be terryfing.

For example:

"Lord Voldemort turned to the old bearded man and brandished his wand.

The green light flew, and Harry suddenly felt cold crept through his back, a rushing sound following, only to be intercepted".

Now insert the words:

"Lord Voldemort turned to the old bearded man and brandished his wand. And his voice was deep, almost unnatural.

/Avada Kedavra/

The green light flew, and Harry suddenly felt cold crept through his back, a rushing sound following, only to be intercepted".

I hste the "words are not needed" trope for the really powerful stuff.

***** *Manic Pixie Dream Girl*

Manic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG) is a stock character type in films. Film critic Nathan Rabin, who coined the term after observing Kirsten Dunst's character in Elizabethtown (2005), said that the MPDG "exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures." MPDGs are said to help their men without pursuing their own happiness, and such characters never grow up; thus, their men never grow up.The Manic Pixie Dream Girl has been compared to another stock character, the Magical Negro, a black character who seems to exist only to provide spiritual or mystical help to the white savior protagonist. In both cases, the stock character has no discernible inner life, and usually only exists to provide the protagonist some important life lessons.
