I'm looking for something which echoes the original series. Something with adventure/mystery/action. Something that looks like it could be the next great adventure. Something you wouldn't be suprised at it someone told you it's the sequel series to the original. I'm not a huge fan of pairings so the less of them the better but if they are there then, meh, I'll live with it. Preferably looking for something set post DH, with old/new characters. Thanks!


** If you don't mind a series with a cast of entirely original characters, I definitely recommend the Alexandra Quick series. It's set post-DH in wizarding America. To me it channels the feel of the original series more than any other fics I've read while standing on its own and not feeling like a copy.

** I've posted this before, but it seems to fit your bill. It's a novel I wrote a couple of years ago. Includes both canon and original characters. Set around fifty years after Voldemort's death. Action, mystery and not a lot of romance.

** Well, there is the James Potter series! It's an extremely elaborate fanfiction, and even though it's not the best well-written story out there, it's certainly fun to read. Also, he's got it illustrated and put in a pdf, so you can read it on a Kindle.
