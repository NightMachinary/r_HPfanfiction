** Hogwarts /has/ a mandatory exercise program. It's called "seven floors, multiple towers, classes in the dungeons and out on the grounds - and the staircases move around."

That's an awful lot of walking.

*** You forgot the PE classes of the school :

- Herbology, also called "wrestle this plant or die"
- Care of Magical Creature, or "wrestle this animal or die"

**** Care of Magical Creatures is an elective. One nobody took after electives weren't required.

*** Even worse, Gryffindor tower's entrance is on the seventh floor, but then there are multiple (seven) floors inside of the tower. So, it is actually fourteen floors for the seventh year Gryffindors.

  There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; *some that led somewhere different on a Friday*; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump.

Rowling also alludes to it in an [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0200-scholastic-chat.htm][interview]].

  /Do you have an actual floorplan for Hogwarts? Do you use it when writing the books?/

  A. I haven't drawn it, because it would be difficult for the most skilled architect to draw, owing to the fact that *the staircases and the rooms keep moving*. However, I have a very vivid mental image of what it looks like.

** If I'm not mistaken, pumpkin juice is the drink of choice because it helps give the students enough energy to perform magic at the quantity that their studies require. Magic burns energy, so there may not be a lot of excess to store as fat.
