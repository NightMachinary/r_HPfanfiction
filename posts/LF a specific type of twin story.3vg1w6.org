I love twin stories where Harry's brother/sister is thought to be the bwl and is then ignored by his family and friends. Then he swears to make them pay while he dicks around at hogwarts without really doing anything to his family, then more times then not the story will end up being abandoned. Is there any story where it actually follows through with his revenge preferably post graduation?


** I don't know any the make it to post-graduation, but here are some of the one's I've read that happen while he's still in school.

linkffn(Too Young To Die) is pretty good for the whole revenge thing. It's got some of the best dark magic stuff I've read in the fandom imo even if the writing is a little bit janky.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11589304/1/Blood-is-not-family][Blood is not Family]] is also pretty good, probably not quite what you're looking for though. It's a crossover with FEAR where Harry gets dumped into the same facility that Alma Wade is and eventually gets summoned to Hogwarts. I've never actually played FEAR, so I can't tell you that much about the background to it other than there's a guy runs horrific tests on his psychic daughter, daughter murderizes everyone in the building and turns the place into some sort of a reality marble.

Edit: Also gonna rec [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1115311][Wait, What?]] It's the opposite of what you're looking for, but it's kinda funny to see Dumbledore trying to convince someone that dropping Harry off at the Dursleys and splitting up the brothers is for the best. There's also [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2861750/1/][Mistaken Identity]] which I kinda treat as the prequel to most of the wrong boy who lived stories. Again, not quite what you're looking for because they're both still babies, but it's short and it's a fun read.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

*** Seconded for Too Young to Die, which is one of the (if not the one) best neglected brother of the boy who lived story, with actually a REAL reason for it (explained at the end, so don't worry).

** Here's one, complete as well, and post graduation. It's not entirely "ignored by his family and friends", but should fit your request well enough: "Harry Potter: The Forgotten Brother"

  For years, the world has hailed Arnold Potter as the Boy-Who-Lived. For years Arnold was said to be the one who will throw down Voldemort. But now Arnold is dead, and the world turns its attentions to Harry. Mostly H/Hr/L. Finished.

** I mean there's the brief cameo in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Something Something) I think it was in Chapter 2 where Harry meets his very overqualified brother who might be the actual Boy Who Lived. Technically fits your criteria but might not be what you really want to read.

  Hey, wouldn't it be cool if someone took as many fanfic cliches as possible and stuffed them all into one story? No? Well, I went ahead and did it anyway. Multi-chapter Mockfic. This summary is actually a lot better than I originally thought.
