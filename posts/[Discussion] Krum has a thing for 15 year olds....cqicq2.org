I think it's creepy and wrong, even if it's written unintentionally.

What's your opinion?

Yule Ball: 25 December 1994 Wedding: 1 August 1997

** I like the theory that Viktor choose Hermione because she was a known mudblood:

fanon: there aren't muggleborns at Durmstrang, he sits at Slytherin table, with a very chatty Draco Malfoy, mudblood Granger this, mudblood Granger that, and Viktor thought, ”I wish to know a mudblood, she will be fascinant" (as Arthur Weasley think about dancing with a muggle).

*** Well, there really aren't any consent laws about accepting or offering a date to a dance.

I would not freak out if an 18 year old boy asked my 15 year old daughter to a school dance. (Most especially if they're both in the same high school. How uncommon is it for a sophomore and senior to date?)

And how would she be 15? Hermione's birthday is in September. She turned 12 after a few weeks in first year. So she would be 16 and 4 months at the time of the ball.

He was 18 in the summer of Goblet of fire. She turned 15 in September.

Of course Rowling is bad at math.

All of the citations about his age end up with him as 18 in the summer although the exact month is variable.

****** Close, '18 or something' according to Ron at the world cup.

“Really grumpy?” Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. “Who cares what he looks like? He's unbelievable. He's really young too. Only just eighteen or something. He's a genius, you wait until tonight, you'll see.”

If Drumstang follows the same rules as Hogwarts, unless he failed a year and was set back, Krum couldn't have been 18 at the world cup. A whole lot of supposition with no proof one way or the other, but that's what a fandom is all about.

******* Pottermore also backs up him being 18 in 1994, as he's 38 in the 2014 world cup. Also, Ron's a fairly valid authority on this, mixed up Bagman, by bad.

Or he started late, but Rowling kept that age consistent with that sequel story.

** This is mental. Any 18 year old dating a 15 year old at school is getting abuse from everyone and probably called in by the teachers.

The ball is fine, it's a 16 year old dressed up and all he does is ask if she's seeing someone. Would be creepy if he knew her age and still went after her.

*** He was dating a 15 year old Hermione in Goblet of Fire. He's an old 7th year (he turned 18 in the summer, so technically he would have graduated if not for some reason), and she turns 15 September of that year. It was confirmed they made out and that he tried to invite her over the summer to Bulgaria. Even worse, the movies made jokes about it... (I follow book canon, but that's just icing on the cake)

The wedding scene was a bit more innocent, but I just wanted to make a point about the character. I think you got that mixed up.

*** I hate the term 'mature beyond her years', people call me that and it doesn't mean that you're more prepared or better at anything than others your age, it just means that you appear more in control. In truth, you're just as vulnerable as others your age only better at hiding it. I realize I've just babbled on, but I had to say that. I can see why people would think it was acceptable or unacceptable, but I think it the problem isn't the physical age difference but the mental age difference. Krum would, being 18, have experience. Hermione on the other hand is, though highly intelligent, naive to the world of dating and the emotional strain of it.

** Hermione was a few months off the legal age of consent is clearly both mature, intelligent and assertive enough to handle herself, and there's no suggestion of any kind of physical intimacy anyway. Plus, Krum's inital attraction to her is explicitly based in her personality, which is unlikely to change too fundamentally as she ages, rather than her pubescent looks.

It's maybe a little odd, but certainly within the bounds of normal or acceptable behaviour for the time and place.
