In the typical fanfic Harry becomes richer than Jeff Bezos as soon as he hits Hogwarts age and never has to worry about anything like 'money' or the 'economy' or 'employment' in his life. Is there any fanfics where Harry also struggles in his growth to become financially successful as well as avoid being killed by the scary snake man?


** Try (linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations)]]) He doesn't realise he has a vault and works for Filch to buy his supplies.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** Linkffn(No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim) it's right there in the title. Harry starts out with almost less than nothing, and it took until Year Three for anyone to respect him.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

*** Variety is the spice of life and in most fanfics this isn't an issue.

it is actually interesting because it completely changes the dynamic between harry Hermione and Ron and makes problems that will allow authors a lot of creative story paths.

Suddenly Ron isn't that jealous of Harry because he doesn't have money. Harry can't just straight up buy all of his supplies. Maybe he has to steal? Perhaps Harry decides to study and focus on classes that have the most lucrative professions instead of only DDA.

What if Harry decides to create a small business in Hogwarts for some side money. Maybe Harry decides to hang out with the Slytherins to make connections with rich people as but isn't seen as this ultra rich powerful lord because of his poverty.

I could see a story like this having potential but I don't know any authors or fanfics that took this path.

**** Idk if it's just me but writing a fic about him chasing money would put me off because it's a story about magic with 1000 of things to do and explore, and countless problems with who he is and having money as a problem just seems so minuscule and insignificant when your the most well known wizard in the world and you have a dark lord after you...

Rons isn't jealous of the money he's jealous of Harry's fame and spotlight.

*** Read the Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. "Scraping to get by" and using magic as well as hare-brained schemes to try to get rich can be very interesting.
