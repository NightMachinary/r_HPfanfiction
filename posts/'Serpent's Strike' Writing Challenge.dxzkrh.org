*FanFiction*: Harry Potter

*Plot*: It is common knowledge that Salazar Slytherin was a dark wizard who led a crusade against muggles. What is not known is why.

*Compulsory*:

- Only Het pairings (if any) or Gen.

- Salazar must be dark by the end of the story.

- Salazar must have a reason to kill muggles.

- The other three founders (if set during the time of, or after, the founding of Hogwarts) must be against Salazar.

*Allowed*:

- Oneshot or Multi Chapter story.

- Salazar is the one to coin the term â€˜muggle'.

*Forbidden*:

- Light/Grey Salazar.

- Slash pairings.

- The other founders joining Salazar.

*/Note/*

The challenge is pretty straightforward and so there aren't many guidelines. It's just a story about why Salazar hates muggles and, if you want, you can expand it to make a full multi-chaptered story.
