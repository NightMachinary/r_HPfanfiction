I'm looking for this Harry/Ginny fic

Post war .Most likely post epilogue

It had Harry returning from an auror conference or something to, find out, from Ron, that Ron and Hermione are getting divorced since she was cheating with some guy (not Malfoy).

Ron mentions that he wondered whether it was with Harry, but wasn't.

Harry goes home to Ginny who was rushing to cover a match somewhere. Harry joins her and they stay together in a hotel.

It also had something about how a match was cancelled because a team had food poisoning and some other journalist tells Ginny that while trying to hit on her

. He goes away after finding that Harry is with her.

A picture of them at their hotel balcony or something snapped by some paparazzi gets in the front page of the Prophet.

This picture is seen by everyone(obviously) and their 3 kids, in Hogwarts, talk about it and send them a letter about how embarassed they are.

There's also this part where Ginny in retaliation, sends a howler in the middle of some ministry meeting (Howler to Percy)

Then when the kids find out how Ron and Hermione are divorcing send a letter to Harry and Ginny about how they prefer that their picture is on the front of the prophet than them divorcing, and that they have ideas on some family activities they can do during the winter holidays.

This was NOT a dramione fic. Hermione was having an affair with some random dude.

Wow. That got lengthy

Please let me know if you have any ideas. Thanks
