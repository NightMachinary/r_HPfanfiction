What is the best description of them, what do you think of when you think of them, have you ever come across any images/art of them with or with without regards to fanfiction? Thanks!


** They do top secret research on the mysteries of life.

** Death Chamber
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: death-chamber
   :END:
They may be attempting to find out more about the afterlife. The Veil appears to be a portal, and they could be trying to see if they can enter it and return to life at will.

** Love Chamber
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: love-chamber
   :END:
JKR said that they have Amortentia in there. They're attempting to replicate the emotion.

** Time Room

   :CUSTOM_ID: time-room
   :END:
Attempting to be in control of time, rather than be controlled by it.

** Hall of Prophecy
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hall-of-prophecy
   :END:
Or, perhaps, an ongoing study of how the future is shaped.

** Brain Room
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: brain-room
   :END:
For finding out how human thoughts run through minds. Maybe they cultivated the brains themselves; maybe those were brains of past researchers who dedicated everything to their studies and they want to fully preserve everything.

** Space Chamber
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: space-chamber
   :END:
Maybe a way to simulate magic in space? Or, on a deeper level, find out out the universe and magic was created?*

I didn't say it was a two-way thing, only that they're probably attempting stuff.

** Hm, honestly I like the edit: depiction in "In The Mind Of A Scientist" linkffn(8551180) (Part one of a trilogy/series- part two has him joining Star Gate, and highly recommend both, the third, not so much.)

In it, they are scientists/researchers really, and just regular people more or less. Well, regular aside from being intelligent, wizards/witches and, ya know, messing with things man was not meant to know.

Don't get to see all that much of em, but some as Harry is recruited.

--------------

What do I think of them? I think they suck balls at security, and are underutilized in fanfiction. No fan art that I've seen, but I don't go looking for any fan art.

  Unspeakables, Harry discovers, do not wear masks.

  He doesn't know why he assumed that they did - he'd known for a while that Unspeakables worked anonymously in the Ministry due to the dangerous and confidential nature of a lot of their work, and his mind had simply conjured up the image of an Unspeakable in their deep, purple robes and wearing a mask not that different to those of the Death Eaters, but they don't. As Harry and Snape follow Dorian Keats down the corridors of the Department of Mysteries, which Keats traverses with ease, Unspeakables pass them by, and although Harry looks at their faces, he finds that as soon as they pass by, he forgets the features of them.

  "Professor," Harry murmurs quietly, and Snape glances at him.

  "It's an enchantment embedded in their robes, Potter," he answers at length, and he says, "Unspeakables have always been anonymous, and have worn similar enchantments since the advent of the Ministry of Magic."

The above is from my fic, The Serpent's Gaze.

I really love the thought of the Unspeakables, honestly: I like the idea that they're effectively researchers pushing the very boundaries of magic and trying to see what their limits are. The Unspeakables, to me, aren't necessarily like hugely exciting, but I definitely see them as being like, scientists in many ways. They try to understand the elements of the universe they don't yet know in detail, whether those elements are to do with magic, the soul, death, time, or even the secret of life itself.

I see them as being completely anonymous, and people pretty much always thinking Unspeakables work in other areas of the Ministry of Magic, just because a lot of what they deal with is dangerous and /extremely/ contentious with the Wizarding World as a whole. A lot of the experiments they perform or the stuff they look into could easily be deemed very offensive or very /dangerous/ by a lot of people across the society, and I can see people having issues with it - Unspeakables trying to figure out immortality, for example, or messing with time streams or the like.

Because I see the Department of Mysteries as so very complex and ineffable, though, I kind of prefer when they're just a mildly ominous concept in the background. As soon as people explore them in detail, I pretty much lose interest, as it takes /away/ from the effect rather than adding to it.

** I think Unspeakables work great in many different forms. They are just mysterious enough to give multiple options in fanfiction.

I feel that the most canon appropriate use is as magical researchers delving into things beyond what the average wizard should know. This can be as boring or as interesting as you want in fanfiction.

My other favorite interpretation is as magical special agents with all the fun magic that comes with that such as robes and spells that hide their identities. I think this one is especially fun to see explored.

*** In the fic I'm writing, the Unspeakables are divided into two groups: The Researchers, and the Field Agents.

Researchers are the ones who study the deepest mysteries of magic, and have a liason to the Department of Experimental Charms.

Field Agents are pretty much Warehouse 13 Agents. Their job is to track down dangerous magical artifacts and contain or destroy them. They basically combine the professions of Curse-Breaker and Auror, and in some cases have them working undercover in said professions.
