Vampires are one of the least explored aspects of magic in the Harry Potter universe. Whilst information regarding Werewolves is abundant, Goblins have their special place in the books and fanfiction, while we get to read quite a lot regarding Centaurs and Merpeople and even bloody Hags, Vampires are somewhat left out.

In a way, this makes perfect sense. JK had stated that Vampires have been extensively talked about in other fantasy series and that they are not really a part of English folklore. Thus, the only Vampire we get to see (albeit only in the books) is Sanguini (HBP) and there are a few scattered references to a Vampire in Minsk, Lockhart's story about how he supposedly beat a Vampire, Quirrel's fear of them and a mention by Lupin are the only instances that Vampires are even mentioned. Nevertheless, for the most part, these are only quick and meaningless mentions of the beings. Sadly, almost nothing in known to us about the Vampire lifestyle, their status (are they Human or not), culture and if they have any interesting features.

I've searched for some fanfiction where vampires are at least discussed, but to no avail. I have found a fic where Luna has Vampire sister but I didn't like it very much. It was somewhat poorly written for my taste. I've also found a fic where Harry was turned into a Vampire and cared for by Lupin, but found the fic lacking and clumsily written.

So are there any good fics where we get to see more Vampires? Vampires don't have to be the centre of the storyline, but they should be prominent at least.

** My story has chapters of Harry taking on a vampire at their own game and discusses /very briefly/ how their magic works.

That said, in this particular fic, anything or anyone that features is discussed only very briefly. The style is deliberately sparse. The vampire is around for several chapters but is not a 'main storyline' event. Vampires that arrive later on appear even more briefly than that.

  After a few too many hard knocks in early childhood, magic has turned Harry into a tough, twisted, somewhat impaired and very ugly version of himself with a severe speech defect.Magic is also going to help him learn how to kick everybody's backside.This is the tale of a Harry who has learned the hard way that adults are fallible and that he will have to rely only on himself, and his long, slow journey to a very different life than the one Dumbledore had in store for him. The lessons he learns are not the ones most adults wanted to teach him and the family he ends up with is not the one Dumbledore set him with.This story is written in a very sparse style and chapters are very short. The longest chapter is still less than one thousand, five hundred words long and the beginning chapters tend towards five hundred words. It is COMPLETE!

*** Well yes, Vampires could in theory pose a somewhat awkward part in JK Rowling's narrative regarding death and the limits of human endurance. However, that is only true if we believe that Vampires in the World of JK Rowling function the same as in the rest of fiction. Moreover, that - of course - is not a priori true. Nobody says that Vampires need to live forever or be categorised as an anomaly. Vampirism could theoretically be a very similar phenomenon to Lycanthropy; i. e. a phenomenon that affects the human body in such a way that it makes it dependent on some natural phenomenon (for example, Werewolves are defined by Lunar phases, but they are in essence stil human. Is it such an offshot to think that Vampires are simply humans with a simmilar dilemma?)

**** Well, one of the qualifying characteristics of vampires, if I know anything about them, is that they are dead (or undead) and ever-lasting. If you start work with it in your story, you soon discover how weird and ill-fitting to the rest of the world that makes them. Of course, it is possible to say that it is just a Muggle prejudice, and in reality they are much closer to normal humans except for something.
