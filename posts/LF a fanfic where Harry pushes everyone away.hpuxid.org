:END:
I think he breaks up with Ginny on their anniversary, so all the Weasleys hate him. Fred and George throw the reward money back at him, saying that they don't want to be associated with him?? Ron is really mad, Molly /might/ have sent a howler. I forgot what happened in the end, but I think Harry is on his deathbed then a pensive memory is revealed that Dumbledore wanted Harry to do that so they wouldn't get targeted by LV. was on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], and was one of the first stories I read.

tl;dr Harrry is bullied for breaking up with Ginny, in the end it's actually Dumbledore's fault
