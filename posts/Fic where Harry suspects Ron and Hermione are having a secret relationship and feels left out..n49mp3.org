:END:
I read this fic a while ago but I remember that Harry is quite panicked about having to confront Voldemort and is quite bummed when Ron and Hermione start avoiding him after he reveals the prophecy to them. He suspects that they are having an affair and throws a tantrum but turns out they are just researching ways to help him beat Voldemort.

Also he befriends Parvati who falls in love with him. However he's in love with Ginny and Parvati feels like he's stringing her along so she and Padma keep playing tricks on him by switching places. This might be part of a different fic but I'm pretty sure it's the same as the one from the paragraph above.

Anyone know this fic? Thanks in advance!
