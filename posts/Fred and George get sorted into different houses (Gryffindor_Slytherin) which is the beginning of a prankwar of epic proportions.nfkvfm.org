Like both steal each others ties/uniforms and always try to blame their pranks on the other. The teachers eventually give up and take/assign points to a random house (McGonagall obviously favors Gryffindor/Snape Slytherin. The latter occasionally takes points from Gryffindor even knowing that it's a Slytherin!Fred sitting in his class)

Fred and George have both seen and lived in the other twin's respective common rooms for various timespans.

The longest was 4 weeks during their first year in which they pretended to have had a falling out due to house rivalry. It started with some comment of another student that a Gryffindor wouldn't last a day in Slytherin/a Slytherin would be to cowardly for Gryffindor anyway which set the whole thing in motion. Charlie is the one who eventually caught on. He wouldn't have told anyone, too amused by the whole thing but at that point the twins were rather bored by the pretense.

They have a healthy rivalry going between them i.e. Quidditch and they lead their respective house mates into a prankwar against each other.

Of course they're still thick as thieves getting into trouble together.

By the time Ron goes to school, Snape accidentally takes points from Slytherin when he get's into a fight with Malfoy.


** There's a little of that here, but it's not the main point of the fic.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** And I love the fact that Fred and George wouldn't let a little house rivalry come between them, because of course they won't, that they don't really underscores the theme that they won't for anyone else in their family either, which they kinda do a lot in fanfic oof.

I believe you mean "trying to take credit for the other's pranks."
