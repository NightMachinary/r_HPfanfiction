**** Dumbledore himself notes that Voldemort is drawn to grandeur. Consider Voldemort's insistence on using powerful artifacts for his Horcruxes--Slytherin's Locket, Hufflepuff's Cup, Ravenclaw's Diadem.

Harry noted that Horcruxes could literally be anything--tin cans or potion bottles, which would be nearly impossible to trace, but Dumbledore explains that Voldemort was too power-hungry to be practical.

** Children in neglected homes are often far more mature and independent than their peers. This common phenomenon held true for one Harry James Potter as well.

Hearing Hagrid say this Dark Lord is just in hiding froze Harry to the quick. First it chilled him with a bone numbing fear. The man who killed his parents was still out there. Then it transformed into something even colder. Cold hard hatred pulsed through his veins. The man who killed his parents was still out there!

Young Harry steeled himself and decided his course. He would destroy this man who had done this to him. ~~~~~~~~~~~

Harry's uncle was a small minded bigoted and selfish person to name some of his better qualities. He was not however stupid, just mean to the core of his soul.

When Harry approached his uncle after shopping with Hagrid it was with great care.

"There's an evil freak out there killing regular folks and I want your help in killing him!"

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snape tried to kill him during his first Quidditch match! Hermione had to set the bugger on fire to save him even.

Harry vowed right then to settle this debt first chance.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

What the fuck! Harry held the shifting material in his hands as his mind raced with possibilities. He owned a bloody invisibility cloak! Debts would be settled rather sooner than he had imagined.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

"It is with deep sadness that I must inform the school the Professor Snape and most of the first year slytherin potions class have passed in a horrible potions accident this day."

Dumbledore was just glad Harry had been injured that morning rather bad. Harry being in the infirmary resting had kept the boy out of the class when someone had added Erumpent Horn to their potion. Hells bells including Harry only five first year Gryffindors still lived!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Harry knew it would make a huge explosion and had run the second he tossed the thing in Malfoys cauldron. That it would blow the place to hell and back was not something he had planned on. Well at least he had gotten clear of it and no one suspected him.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As Quirrel stood talking about his master Harry did the one thing his uncle had helped him prepare for. Pulling out his derringer he aimed and fired in a smooth controlled fashion. Firing a few more times he saw Quirrel collapse to the ground.

Wizard or not, a bullet or five to the chest will kill anyone.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

End of drabble.

** As Harry faced Voldemort, he knew that he needed to avenge those Voldemort had killed. Most notibly, his namesake who died trying to protect his mother and him. His mother who then died to infuse potection within him. His father gave her that chance. HIS FATHER GAVE HER THAT CHANCE, and as such, gave Harry a chance.

"VOLDEMORT!" harry shouted.

"I have defeated your death eater pawns. I have avenged many who have died by those pawns and now I challenge you. I challenge you and you shall not win."

*"MY NAME IS HARRY POTTER!"*

*"YOU KILLED MY FATHER!"*

*"PREPARE TO DIE!"*

As Harry whiped up his wand in preparation to cast a spell, Voldemort suddenly lowered his and held up a hand in peace.

/Was it a trick?/ Harry thought.

"Harry," Voldemort said in a surprisingly compassionate voice. "I did not kill your father."

"James Potter was nothing but a rebound. A replacement. A stand in."

"He was simply a man capable of providing your mother with what she needed after her childhood friend turned his back on her. After Severus Snape failed to become the man she wished for. I should know, for I mentored Snape, and through him, met your mother."

"Your lovely mudblood mother."

"She even captured my interest, just as she captured the interest of Severus and your replacement father James."

"A mudblood she may have been, but a talent and beauty like no other."

"We were even intimate a time or two after Severus let her down."

"Of course, she was unaware of my true identity. HA! If she had known. If Severus or James had known! Oh what amusment that would bring me."

"But no Harry, a few memory charms here, some minor magical adjustments, and it was all forgotten and covered up."

"Harry, Harry, Harry... I did not kill your father no. I killed James Potter."

"Did you not wonder why you of all people were fated to face me?"

"I am your father Harry."

"Lord Voldemort is your father."

"Now prepare to die."

*** It's a writing prompt. Despite what [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]] would have you believe, a writing prompt doesn't have to tell you exactly what the plot should look like. I could make a writing prompt that says "Alcohol solves all problems" And that would be a valid writing prompt. Maybe it wouldn't be popular, or maybe I'd get some stunning replies, who knows? But a writing prompt that plays off a famous line from a very well known movie is a good writing prompt.
