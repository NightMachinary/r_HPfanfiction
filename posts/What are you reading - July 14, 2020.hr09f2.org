** I just read Harry Potter and the Enemy Within and its sequel. I think it's the oldest fic I remember reading (written in about 2005, and not on ffnet or ao3. It's absolutely fascinating to read a well-fleshed out replacement for what might have happened before the final books were published. I've also saved a copy for myself in case this site ever gets taken down.

**** *COMPLETED* As Harry enters his sixth year at Hogwarts, Voldemort's lengthening shadow stretches across the wizarding world and Harry is tormented by the knowledge that he alone can end this reign of terror. Worse, his mysterious mental link to Voldemort is stronger than ever and threatens to overwhelm him. Only Snape can teach him to control the nightmarish visions, but can Harry and Snape learn to trust one another, or will an old grudge that refuses to die destroy the wizarding world's sole hope of defeating the Dark Lord?"

** - linkffn(3480843) ... “What if Ginny really got over Harry during his fourth year, and then he fell for her and found love while she was with someone else?” Rather persuasively written post-DoM slow burn, from friends to engagement, and something which looks from distance like soul-bond (just gently touched, no craziness). Not bad.

- linkao3(23090008) ... this time Petunia is thrown back to the Marauders past trying to save her sister; another slow burn into Petunia/Snape (Jilly in the background, of course). I don't like most Marauders-time stories, and certainly not like positive Snape, but this is really nicely written. WIP, regularly updated.

- linkffn(13113518;13561400) ... two unrelated stories with the shared idea of Ginny being locked in the Chamber of Secrets for multiple years. The first is weaker, both Harry and Ginny are locked in the Room of Requirement (without knowing, where they are and how does it work) for many years, and it is HP-variant of “The Blue Lagoon” (1980 film), and in the end it is just smut. Thus I haven't expected from the latter story much, but I have been pleasantly surprised: this is very different story. Ginny is (alone) locked in the Chamber of Secrets until OotP, when she manages to escape. For security reasons, she is still living hidden in 12 Grimmauld Place, and both her and Harry are suddenly thrown into complete confusion: only two unrelated unattached teenagers living together, just discovering what boy-girl relationship means, etc. Slow burn, WIP progress, still updated.

  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

*** Hmm. The Petunia/Severus premise is definitely interesting, although the latest chapter is rather more graphic than I prefer to read. Also it seems like a remarkably high percentage of the male characters are gay or bi; there's Regulus/Barty, Regulus/Moody endgame, the gender of Moody's two former lovers isn't stated, and Remus/Sirius on the side in addition to them both being interested in girls. Rather higher than population averages, it seems.

Having Petunia come back in time with only very minimal foreknowledge has an interesting impact; she can't exactly orchestrate the war, but she can improve her relationships with the people around her.

** Linkffn(The Colour of Everything by FloreatCastellum). I love this story so much, its positives seem to never end. Firstly, characterisation is mostly on point. Remus Lupin is as true to his canon characterisation as you could possibly get, and the way the author manages to capture his spirit is astounding. This Lily Evans has likely created a disturbance in Tumblr's hivemind with her personality, which is the truest you could possibly get to what JK intended; she's allowed to weep, she's allowed to giggle and she's not Saint Mary. And I just /adore/ James Potter's humor here. There isn't much to go about on him in canon, but this seems like a very plausible personality he could've had. Peter Pettigrew shockingly has a personality and displays affection towards his friends, and it's very natural and cohesive.

Secondly, the spirit of the first war and its setting in the 1970s is very genuine and not shoehorned in the slightest, Remus and co. do not jam to Stayin' Alive just so you can know that they're 70s youth, which is such a fresh take on them. The threat of Voldemort is also emphasized quite strongly, but he's not some sort of comical threat who is prone to throw nasty insults at Dumbledore. Third of all and I'll stop here because I'm rambling, I love how Remus is displayed as an optimist in contrast to his father as he graduates school. I doubt Remus would be a cynic from the get go, he still thinks he can be a bit normal, and he's very sheltered and supported by his friends; he'd grow more jaded and cynical as the years passed and especially after he'd lost all his friends.

** I finally caught up with the latest updates from /Black Mask/ linkao3(15457248) from [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611][The Black Sheep Dog]] series!

This story is amazing for exploring the family dynamics of the Black family (and others) during the First Wizarding War. The focus is specifically on Sirius and his immediate family (Regulus, Walburga, Orion). The author portrays Sirius's family in a very different way I hadn't seen before. She takes events that we read about in the books (ex: Sirius running away to the Potters) and adds additional context to it. This story really reminds me of the premise to Gilmore Girls - after a period of estrangement and no contact, circumstances force the parents and child to interact with each other. Everyone has unresolved feelings about past events and different coping mechanisms.

I really like how izzy (the author) writes side characters who may have minor plotlines. There is one major OC in this story and she is pretty interesting to read about.

This is a very slow paced story (if looking at how many "days" have passed since the first chapter). But a lot of stuff happens within this short timeframe.

Definitely would recommend this to those who like reading fics about the Black family.

Also there is a story before this /In the Black/ linkao3(14800721) that sets up the premise of this story

  Christmas 1979---danger, secrets, lies and their shared history looms large over the Blacks' first Yuletide season as a reunited family. While life as a fugitive proves bleaker (and more boring) than Regulus could have imagined, a botched espionage mission at Malfoy Manor draws Sirius deeper into the Black family web---and his cousin Narcissa's social set.Meanwhile, Walburga hatches a daring scheme to restore her wild firstborn's damaged reputation in the family---finding him a suitable bride---while Orion grapples with the past, and the high price his two sons have paid for his inaction.[Regulus Black Lives/Black Family Witness Protection AU. The continuing story of how Regulus stealing part of Voldemort's soul brings a broken, dysfunctional family together]

The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety.

** I'm currently reading linkffn(magicks of the arcane) and it's quickly becoming an all time favorite! It allows Harry to be a lot more powerful than in canon, but /not/ overpowered. The mentor/apprentice & friendly relationship between Harry and Dumbledore is something I've been looking for, for a *LONG* time. I'm only about a third of the way through, but so far I'd give it a 8/10 score. And I have harsh standards! Another thing I enjoy is how well the author creates their own spells & magical lore, and does an amazing job of fitting it seamlessly in with Canon. A must read!

** I just got done reading Back to the Beginning, and I really liked it because it mixes Magic and Science, and it actually works. Nothing gets pulled out of nowhere, it's all built upon what came before. It's complete, and there's an ongoing sequel, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes.

Maybe a 9/10, for me, though the sequel is in the Stargate verse as a crossover, and it's still incredibly good, which is exceedingly rare.

** Today I discovered that the always wonderful CeruleanSlane has written an incomplete HP fanfic, linkffn(Duplicitous Destiny).

The premise of the fic is that Voldemort kills Harry in the mirror room in PS, and Daphne, who's followed him down, takes his place. It's been recced here a couple times before, from a casual Google search, and so far is very good and along the lines of writing style. He has a very freewheeling, light style with a lot of humor and good dialogue, particularly banter.

I'd also recommend his web serials, the fantasy Heretical Edge and its spinoff, the superhero story Summus Proelium. The latter is in many ways a much lighter, whimsical, and imaginative retelling of /Worm/, but very much in Cerulean's own voice.
