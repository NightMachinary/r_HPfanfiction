I like the ideas of the kids of nextgen somehow going back to the past and they meet their parents or people from the 90s meeting their future selves or their children. If it's AU future, I want to read it too (don't mind if FutureHarry is not married or with someone else).

Please don't rec Cursed Child. It was funny the first 4 times of posts LF time travel fics. Thanks!

Only fic I can think of. It's kinda hard to recommend this fic when it's immediately spoiled but I recommend it anyway. One of the better time travel stories I've read. Might not be fully what you want as they don't exactly know who the traveler is and whether they are hostile or not. It's partially finished with a part 2 from the travelers point of view and a part 3 which is unfinished but continues the story.

*** Thanks! That was actually my first ever read fanfiction. I tried to read Book 2 but it gave me a headache. I will see if I read Book 3,knowing that book 2 only explains the adventures of the mysterious helper.

** This topic actually has been done too many times. I enjoyed the first couple times until a pattern became too obvious: 2nd gen broke a time turner (usually James) -> three to seven kids get to throw back 20-25 years -> surprise, shock, and there are lots of rejoicing -> a couple kids, but always James, play a few pranks with marauders -> adult versions show up, more laughs and tears -> younger version gets their memories wiped and time travelers go back home.

When you search for James Sirius on the fanfic.net, it's very easy to encounter that type of fics: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=4&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=0&len=0&s=2&v1=0&c1=0&c2=14865&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=6&_c2=0&_v1=0]]

What I want to read is the new Trio (Al, Scorp, Rose) traveling to an alternate dimension 20 years in their past and changing things. I'd like to see the kids using their advance knowledge and working with younger version of their parents to make things better.

Unfortunately, those fics don't exit yet.

*** The last thing you mentioned is actually what I'm looking for, but I'll settle with the former. I've already read a couple after all. Thanks for the link!
