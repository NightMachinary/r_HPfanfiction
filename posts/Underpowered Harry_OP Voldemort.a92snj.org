There's a lot of wish fulfillment/power fantasy fiction, ignoring the rule that If you make Frodo a Jedi, you have to give Sauron the Death Star. Sometimes it's fun to read something like that, but what good fics are the reverse, where Harry has less to work with than canon, or Voldemort has more? I've come across linkffn(Almost a Squib), which was an interesting read.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.
