There are a lot of fics of other people taking Harry and raising him but I can't say I have seen a Dumbledore raised Harry. Preferably Albus treats him like a son and actually loves him, giving him a proper childhood that isn't endless training to make a super weapon of Harry.

*** I wanted to like this because fics with a Dumbledore who's not a moustache twirling villain are few and far between, but some things about it really weirds me out. There's a lot of sex discussion between (child) Harry and Dumbledore, and even a scene where Dumbledore accidentally casts a kind of tickling charm meant to be used by couples on Harry. He then teaches Harry, who is like 12, said charm, though reluctantly, clearly under the premise that it will be used for sexual purposes.

I don't know if I'm overreacting or not, but around then I stopped reading. Worth mentioning that some of the authors other stories are Dumbledore/underage Harry fics. I don't think the author is implying anything or planning to make this fic anything like that, I'm just saying it made me uncomfortable. But hey, maybe I'm a prude.

**** I actually stopped reading right around those chapters, to be honest. I really enjoyed the beginning and the dynamic between them, and then like you got a bit weirded out. I've considered picking it up again but haven't yet done so. But it was refreshing to not see a soldier Harry and mastermind Dumbledore.

**** No you are not overreacting! I liked it for the first few chapters too, but when it got to that kind of sick crap I stopped reading it too!

  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

**** Thank you so much!!! I did see this story on fanfiction dot net but there it was not updated after chapter ten, and i didn't think it just meant the author moved to ao3, now that i know the story continues and is still being updated I'm so happy
