#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.

  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]

  A misspoken mistake transports Hermione through time, binding her to the Malfoy family, causing her to come whenever they call. Warnings: violence, limes.

  Hermione is offered a war-stake by Dumbledore. She ignorantly accepts the beautiful scroll only to find she has thereby agreed to become Wife to the House of Malfoy. An on-the-go education by Minerva, Molly, and Astoria ensues as Hermione enters formal courtship by Draco and Lucius. Utterly absurd and a tad naughty. AU, OOC. Utter tripe.

  "You see the desperation in that one's eyes? The one with the red fur. I placed my bets on her." Beneath the bloodied sand of the Colosseum, Abraxas Malfoy buys a new werewolf pet for his son, setting events in motion that neither he nor young Lucius are prepared for. Ongoing.
