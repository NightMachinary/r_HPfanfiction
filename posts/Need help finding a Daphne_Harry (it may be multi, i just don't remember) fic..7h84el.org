So, this fic... I remember it being slightly angst, romance, drama. I remember it having a scene of major importance to the ship of Daph and Harry during their first year at the Mirror of Erised, something about Daph's family. Another thing I do remember is that Daph refuses to acknowledge the bond (not a soul bond) they both developed over that moment (Erised) and they don't even talk to each other for years, until Daph finally caves in and stops stopping herself from being away from Harry (if that makes sense, I may have botched my point). Another thing i do remember is that there's a scene in the Express where the two look at eachother and its that moment that Daph decides to stop hiding her feelings.

I've tried looking through my history to see if i can find that fic but no luck. Any help would be appreciated.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter grows up on Privet Drive, where he is neither loved nor hated; rather, he is treated with indifference. Will his relentless pursuit of knowledge allow him to defeat the Dark Lord? Will he ever be able to live the life he desires?
