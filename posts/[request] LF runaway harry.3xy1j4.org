As the title says, anything were harry runs away from either the dursleys or hogwarts. either pre-hogwarts (under age 11) or during year 1-5 would have the most impact i think. i dont care about the pairings- het, slash or nonexistant is just fine. i guess i am hoping for a bit more of independant harry here, or maybe a slytherin harry, but anyway is ok. ideas?


** And my favorite "Harry doesn't really run away so much as the Dursley's leave him in the forest and he raises himself with the help of some animal friends and/or fae" story, would be: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them]])

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Oh, I can't believe I forgot this one. It's slash, supposedly, though more pre-slash at this point, and one of my favorite fanfics ever, of all times, and I miss paimpont and wish they would come back from wherever they went and keep writing, because this is such an amazing story (as are the rest of paimpont's stories, actually): linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild]])
