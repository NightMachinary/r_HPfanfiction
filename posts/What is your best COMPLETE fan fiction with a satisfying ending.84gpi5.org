I just got done reading The Blindness and SPOILERS! Harry finally gets the elder wand as the two other hallows have been slowly warping his soul into something unrecognizable then just sort of ends. I want to avoid that in the future. Any thoughts?


** I'd say if you want to avoid that in the future, check the reviews for the final chapter of a finished work. If the tone of the short comments is 'You can't end it there' or 'Seems rushed', you'll know what to expect. If there seems to be a number of long reviews along with a few 'Exhausted but happy' comments, you're looking at a winner.

***** Yeah, and what a great story that would make. I'm sure many would line right up to buy that paragraph. If you're going to make a counter argument, at least have it be valid.

My point is pretty obvious. The majority of the fic is completely unnecessary, doesn't add anything to the story, and is just incredibly boring and bland. If you left only the good parts, you'd have less than 50k words. Most of the run throughs of Daphne's day to day life is pointless.

So there's a huge difference between my problem with the fic and summarizing the Philosopher's Stone into one paragraph. Cutting down that fic by like 80% would not only not be harmful at all, but would /add/ to the story. Cutting down the first book into a paragraph is only destroying the story and nothing more.

***** [[/u/TE7]] and I were just discussing this last night. We both consider the actual plot of a story secondary to the issue of which two characters get to grin sappily at each other for the majority of the text. We discussed at length the pairings that are less common in fanfics, and Charlie/Hermione was the one we picked!

So thanks to TE7 for letting me be the one to announce that we'll be co-writing an epic story of love and romance called /Taming the Dragon/, in which Charlie and Hermione will gradually fall in love despite having absolutely no obvious reason for ever even meeting. Their total lack of any common interests is a hindrance at first, but they overcome it. However, I can reveal a very special twist. At one point, something will happen that causes the happy couple to have an argument! They'll even break up!

Will they get back together, or will the dragon refuse to be tamed? We're aiming for a story ~4 million words, and that won't be revealed until about the 3.5M mark, so I won't spoil it for you.

So stay tuned for /Taming the Dragon/!

I'm on record as detesting shipping. [[/u/Rpeh]] agrees with me for the most part when it comes to it. I specifically do not write stories with the premise of getting two characters together and that I think pairings and shipping are the absolute worst part of the community. My general comment to anything along these lines is, "Fuck your ship."

Rpeh's post was being sarcastic. hence things like 'Two characters that have no actual mutual interest or reason for meeting each other!"

** Full Pensieve's The Last Horcrux. Well written an excellent take on the characters with really good dialog. The author liked to bring in other magical communities fully fleshed out as well.

side note: He also has an unfinished one that I think will never be finished (it's been 6 years) due to failing health - The Years of Rebellion (post OotP). But it's still a great read and really expands out the magical community of Britain. I also think he deals with the post-ministry raid and Sirius' death in a deeper fashion than Rowling ever would.

** Vox Corporis. A solid ending to the prophecy (mind you, Vox Corporis was written before books 6 & 7 came out iirc) and H/Hr live happily ever after!

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. Basically, what happen to Bill, Fleur, and Percy (also how he met Audrey) during the war. It also includes the aftermath and a satisfying epilogue. linkffn(12181042)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines][Crossing Lines]] by plutoplex. My favorite Fred and George time travel story. How it ended actually completed a full circle and tied the plot in a nice bow so I admit it was satisfying even though I would like more. (It was a really good fic). linkffn(11993367)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5715586/1/Proving-Them-Wrong][Proving Them Wrong]] by GriffinSky. I definitely love this Percy centric fic. It really redeems him from beginning to end. linkffn(5715586)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][The Scarlet Pimpernel]] by AMarguerite. Also a really good Percy centric fic that has an amusing but happy ending. linkffn(3784000)

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.
