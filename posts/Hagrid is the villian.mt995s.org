** Don't forget Hagrid just straight up abandoned Harry (11 years old!) at a train station without telling him how to get to Hogwarts Express. Sheer dumb luck the Weasleys were there ranting about Muggles.

***** The only time I let that particular bit slide is that magical families can volunteer to make sure muggleborn first years can find the right place to go. Molly Weasley is just a bit more obvious about it than all the others.

*** That was only in the movie. In the book Harry went back 'home' to Privet Drive, and then spent the rest of the summer reading through all his new magic textbooks; and then on September 1, it was the Dursleys who dumped him off at Kings Cross on their way to find a doctor who wouldn't ask questions to get Dudley's pig tail removed. Now while it is on Hagrid that he didn't tell Harry how to get to Platform 9 3/4, it's possible that he just plain forgot about that tiny little detail, what with everything else he had to do that day.

** Absurd. Hagrid was obviously the one true light lord. The Master Manipulator who guided Dumbledore throughout his life, who blocked Riddle at every turn, and who hid his power from the Wizarding World, until he didn't.

** Nah, that means that Hagrid is the Hero.

Fuck you for trying to kill Hedwig! You're evil!

Hagrid would never kill an owl and familiar just because you wan to cause pain to the dude.

Obviously you're trying to twist black and white, to replace the other.

So ... screw off.
