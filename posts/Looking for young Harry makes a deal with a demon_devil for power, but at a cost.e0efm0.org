:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Having that frustrating moment where I want to reread a fic, but no matter how much I search I can't find it.

What I can remember is:

Harry is young and suffering under the Dursley's abuse

Doesn't yet know about magic, I believe he summons the demon/devil after learning about it at the library

I think he summons it at a crossroads

In exchange for the power he will die, or maybe it was lose his soul, in so many years time. I believe it was about ten years time, but to young Harry that didn't seem like long.

When he finds out about the wizarding world he doesn't tell anybody about his power for some time.


** I think I remember a HP/Supernatural crossover like that but sadly can't remember the name or find it in my bookmarks. Do you remember if it was? You mentioning "Crossroads" could be a hint that it was, so maybe that will give you a place to start looking. The HP/Supernatural crossover section is a lot smaller to look through than the whole of ffnet after all :D

** I actually found it myself, just as I decided to give up. Typical. Not quite as I remember it, but I'm reading for nostalgias sake. Thank you both :)

*** How well would you say that story does on the anti-canon-stations test? And Completed means the whole story's done, right? Not just the volume?

**** Looking at the "Price of a Soul" series, it's not complete. There's an A/N in the last chapter though:

  Will there be a sequel? Short answer: maybe. Long answer: see the FPS tumblr. Hopefully this ending wraps things up enough that it satisfies even if a sequel never comes.

No idea about stations of canon though since I haven't read it.

**** It changes things enough that it's not a canon rehash and changes some things a lot/enough so that I was surprised multiple times.

You can definitely read it and feel like the story is complete although the ending is left open enough that the author could go for a sequel if they wanted.

** I know it's not the same, but this request reminds me of the Hellraiser crossover by Ruskbyte, so linking it here in case others are interested. Definitely mature - dismemberment, gore, and damnation. I've never seen the original Hellraiser, so can't speak to whether it's a good crossover.
