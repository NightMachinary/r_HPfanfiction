I am trying to find the story where Dumbledore replaces Harry Potter with Draco's older twin by accident. Dumbledore had believed he had kidnapped a kid in Diagon Alley who wasn't from a well known family if I remember correctly. He had done so as the Dursley's had killed 'Harry Potter', who was actually a replacement for someone as they had killed those Dumbledore had given them charge over before. This Harry Potter managed to make it into Hogwarts. Also, I know Draco's twin had control over elements and had great mind control. His mind was blocked by/set up with jungles, an apothecary, dessert, a maze and more. Please help me find this wonderful story. Thank you!


** Linkffn(The malfoy twins)? It doesn't seem that well written.
