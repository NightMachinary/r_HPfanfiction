One of my favourite fics got updated the other day after a few years silence on the authors part. Now they are back with three new chapters and two stories.\\
So I was wondering what people were really hoping was going to be updated soon?

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) We're coming up on a year after his update that was 3 years after the previous. Hope!

linkffn(C'est La Vie) My favorite fic. The author says it isn't abandoned unless they say so, but really thats just semantics. There is still a small part of me that thinks it'll update one day.

Also both of these fics stopped at the Yule Ball. Coincidence or conspiracy?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Linkffn(the thief of hogwarts) I only started reading this over the last year, I loved it. Loved the premise, the execution, the relationships, and the portrayal of the flamels. I was so disappointed to see it all but abandoned. Although I would say linkffn(deprived) was going somewhere amazing before its untimely stall.

*** Its been years, I don't know why no one has copied the idea of this fic, its just so damn good. It allows Harry the ability to gain power in the story without it being contrived. The dynamic between the two is an excellent way to demonstrate character growth and internal deliberation. And with it being a dimensional hop it opens the door for OCs and character interaction we never get to see in canon. I'm always a sucker for Harry interacting with his /not-family/ and seeing characters like Dumbledore realize the truth is so much fun.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will.
