  as well as Castelobruxo and they all just sound so mystical.
#+end_quote

Nope. That basically means "wizard's castle". Hell, the Japanese magic school is called Mahoutokoro, which literally just means "Magic place", lmao. Only half of the major magic schools have a decent name (meaning one that doesn't sound silly when you know the meaning). xD

They do sound nice though. Though, I have no particular advice aside from trying to smush together two words that kind of mean something magical and hope no one is too literal with them. Haha

****** Not exactly. I'm drafting a crossover with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I ended up making K'un-Lun be the location of another major magical school (it's in Tibet). So I didn't really need to come up with a name, I just used a Marvel place, lol.

** A few alternates to consider:

- Vaults of Hatta, underneath Cappadocia [teaching in Greek, Arabic]

- Before Thought (a.k.a Temple of Zero), Nepal [Nepalese, ancient Tibetan]

- The Bo-lor, Sierra Leone [Krio, Mande (old Bantu)]

- Caana's Shadow, Belize - [Spanish, Ch'olti'an]

- Murphy's Un-Natural Wildlife Preserve and Toxicology Lab, Gibson Desert, West Australia [English]

Some other non-scholastic libraries have survived as well, including the Vatican, Stockholm's Sequestry and the Smithsonian archives.

Other schools have been destroyed over the centuries, most notably Alexandria in Egypt, the House of Wisdom in Baghdad and the Dynastic libraries in China (16 different centers of learning, each destroyed as harbinger of that dynasty's loss of the Mandate of Heaven).

**** My current operating theory is that Xanadu exists as a pocket realm accessible from the Nepalese school, and that 98% of magical people appearing anywhere in East Asia are removed from their families and brought to live solely in that magical realm.

It's the only way to keep them from interfering. The ones left behind are typically of mixed Asian/British descent, so that the West doesn't get uppity about their children disappearing.

The move to Shangri-La/KunLun was precipitated by the Opium wars, as opiates have a detrimental effect on spell casting. The weakened will makes it difficult to focus.

** Hogwarts is similar to Hogwort, a type of flower, so maybe look up local flowers that sound equally whimsical? Another option is to base it on a magical symbol in that culture.

** I quite like nicking things from mythology, like the Scholomance [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholomance]]

I have a vague recollection that the city of Toledo is meant to have magical connections, too.

Here is my list of international schools I am using in my AU, feel free to use:

- Library of Alexandria, Egypt
- Pandidakterion, Istanbul
- Scholomance, Transylvania
- Domdaniel, Tunis
- Miskatonic University, Arkham, Massachusetts
- Samarkand (it's hard finding magic stories in that area, but the place is ancient)
- Shangri-La (can't remember the school name I came up with)
- Toledo Grand Observatory

*** Wizards have a habit of locating themselves as far as possible from Muggle civilisation (see below). So if you really want to mirror the canon approach to magical schools, they should be in remote locations, potentially mythical ones.

In my own fanfic, I up the number of permanent magical schools from the 11 in canon to 13, as follows:

- Brazil - Castelobruxo - Amazon Rainforest

- China - Xifang Xuexiao ("School of the West") - Jade Mountain (Chinese/Tibetan Himalayas)

- Egypt - Wadi Al Mujawis ("Valley of the Magi") - Theban Necropolis

- France - Beauxbatons - Pyrennes

- Great Britain - Hogwarts - Scottish Highlands

- India - Suvaloka - Mount Meru (Indian Himalayas)

- Japan - Mahoutokoro - Minami Iwo Jima

- Persia - Alcaraz (Palace) - Badab-e Surt

- Peru - El Dorado - Peruvian Altiplano

- Russia - Koldovstoretz - Mount Elbrus

- Svalbard (Muggle Norway) - Durmstrang - Svalbard

- Uganda - Uagadou - Mountains of the Moon

- USA - Ilvermorney - Mount Greylock, Massachusetts

I like the idea that the Indian and Chinese schools have an intense rivalry, a result not only of their close geographical proximity, but also because they have overlapping and contradictory founding myths (Jade Mountain, the residence of the Queen Mother of the West, is supposed to be part of the mythical Kunlun Mountains, the Chinese version of Mount Meru).

*** *Scholomance*

The Scholomance (Romanian: Şolomanţă, Solomonărie) was a fabled school of black magic in Transylvania, which was run by the Devil. The school enrolled about ten students to become the Solomonari. Courses taught included the speech of animals and magic spells. One of the graduates was chosen by the Devil to be the Weathermaker and tasked with riding the dragon to control the weather.

** Look let me use an example to help you understand what your problem is.

I'm practicing the magical arts. Sounds pretty banal right? But what if I said I was practicing the mystic arts. How about the Arcane practices? The left-hand path? Magecraft?

I'm guessing all of those sound better to you.

Here's the thing though: they basically mean the same thing. Technically they're meant for variations of magic and arts, but like many cases certain words and phrases are twisted to use in slightly different contexts.

This is an important technique they teach you in marketing: how to get peoples attention. One of the ways you do this in writing is to use words that are less common that draw peoples focus, even if in fact their use is often incorrect.

The reason you find those school names ‘magical' has nothing to do with creativity. Mostly it's just because they are languages and cultures your not familiar with (similar things occur among western anime fans as well).

This is something that, like it or not, is also used prominently by religious figures and politicians to make them sound important and numinous and different. It's not difficult to learn; just start by finding some words, look for slightly similar but not entirely accurate words that are not used commonly in normal human dialogue, and presto, suddenly you have fantastic sounding words/names. Its astonishingly easy.

The Nephedrin School of the Caucasus Mountains.

**** Here:

*New Alexandria Association of Magecraft* - in Egypt, reformed under the first emperor Justinian in the 6th century, protected by the 12 members of the Justinian Guard, near ancient Thebes.

*Kunlun* *School of Magical Excellence* - in Xinjang province of China, hidden on Chakgril (mountain), focuses on alchemical studies and sigil-based magic, formed during the period of Kublai Khan's rule over mainland China.

*Zurvanac School of the Flames* */-/* in Persian heartlands (modern-day Iran), formed in the ruins of an abandoned city founded by the Parthian Empire, strong emphasis on elemental transfiguration and divination (Zoroastrian basis).

​

That should get you started.

** Beauxbatons means "beautiful sticks", and you can reasonably associate the word "sticks" with "wands", so "beautiful wands".

Durmstrang looks like a play on the German "sturm und drang", or "storm and stress" -- drop the middle article and swap the first couple of letters.

As other commenters have pointed out, the other foreign magical schools have names that translate to shockingly boring descriptions.

So to me it sounds like the "magicalness" of the non-English names is just because it's not English and therefore it comes across as something more exotic and interesting.

Something worth considering for a brief giggle, if you're making up a sizeable number of schools, is having one stand out from the rest by being a very dry, plain English descriptor. "The North American Academy for Magical Children" or some rot. Imagine the characters reading through a list of the various institutions -- Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, Ilvermorny...then whatever /that/ is. Cue sarcastic commentary.

** There is nothing quirky about most of her school names.

​

If you want to follow her example name a spanish speaking school Escuela de magia and it will be 100% canon. Even better forget spaces, EscuelaMagia, LiceoMagia, Academia Magica, etc.

​

Or dont bother thinking too much and look for a countries magical myths and choose the one that sounds better for you.

​

Just make up any name and tag of Witchcraft and Wizardry on it and its done.
