it was a queerly carved wooden charm hung by a thick and black string. Pulling off his black-line square glasses, he blew lightly on them and placed them back on over his eyes. He checked himself twice over and tried swiping back his black hair before feeling the dark scruff on his jaw and groaned to himself, "Forgot to shave."

He tucked his hands behind his back almost at attention before the lift stopped at a dark brick wall. The bricks before him twisted and shifted as they were opening up to form a doorway, through which he stepped through and continued on through the large marbled room with grey pillars gilded with silver and gold with purple drapes hanging from the ceiling.

Approaching a dark wood door with no handle, he cleared his throat before attempting to knock and was interrupted when a woman's stern-sounding voice spoke from the other side, "You may come in," the door opened before him and he stepped in before straightening himself and he replied to the formally-dressed woman at her large birch wood desk; she had a bright tan office jacket with two tails at the back, her knee-low skirt also bright tan in color, "You summoned me, Madam Minister?" She looked up at him. She had a seasoned but well-kept face, her curled hair was tied at the end into a messy ponytail, brown but with a fair hint of grey, showing her age. Her ears were both pierced with small silver earrings but her left one adorned with a small queerly carved charm made of wood, same as the necklace.

"Harry," she said, almost disappointedly in response to Harry's formal and somewhat seemingly militant greeting, "I said you dont have to be so formal. Relax, take a seat," she said so casually. Harry chuckled and replied as he relaxed his shoulders, "I thought I knew you Ms. Grainger," he stepped forward and sat down onto the seat in front of the desk. Hermione stood up and stepped around her desk. The piles of papers, books, and files were lifted from the desk and left it barren, flowing almost as if they were just water, and floated into place onto shelves, drawers, and cabinets. She reached out pulled out a filing drawer from the wall and a pair of folders were lifted out of it and gently laid out on the desk and swung open. She leaned over her desk and stared at Harry seriously. "I needed you specifically; I couldn't trust anybody else to be head of such a dangerous case," she said.

Harry raised his eyebrow, confused by her admittance, "Why me?" he asked. "I didn't make you Head of Defence just because we're friends, or because of how you saved our school. As soon as you came in you began to make a name for yourself and I vouched you as the best candidate." she replied, confidently. "Plus this case is dire." "What's the case?"

Hermione pulled a sheet of paper from one of the opened folders and handed it to Harry, it was top to bottom full of gruesome crime scenes that made the hair on the back of Harry's neck stand on end. She nodded at the filed she gave Harry, "That is just one list of crimes a man has committed in Ireland alone. He has come calling himself the Yellow King; he is a deranged but powerful wizard.

Harry set down the list and stood up, straightening his jacket. He reached over to take one of the folders and review any other lists and details, "Mutilations? Missing organs? Stolen skin tissue and teeth?" His face grew pale as he flipped through the pages, "How has this been kept secret from my department?" Harry faced Hermione with eyes widened, his face still pale. Hermione let out a sigh and simply replied, "I couldn't risk letting it out. I myself had just recieved these due to the source being so cautious, apparently this Yellow King has been hunting them; they are safe and hidden now. If this ended up becoming public i can't even imagine the panic."

    "Anything on this King's last crime scene?"
    "Here," Hermione replied, pulling the list of most recent scenes from the other folder an handing it to Harry, "Last one found was in Germany, our man can get around. I'm suspecting Apperation; a broom would be too noticeable." Harry's eyes darted around as he skimmed through the paper, "Doesn't look like a method to his pattern. He must be either killing as he travels or we have a big Jack the Ripper fanatic," he took all the papers and slipped them back in the folders and tucked them under his arm, "I'll look over these as soon as i return to my office and I'll head out to Poland by this time tomorrow, see if I can pick up a trail there." Harry pushed his chair in before Hermione straightened up and asked, "How's Ronald?"
    "I haven't heard anything from him in a month. Would expect so seeing how busy he's been."
    "Is he still writing music?"
    "Yeah, I've had to finish his guitar with Hagrid's help."
    "And how has he been?"
    "Very well, he and Grawp managed to get a home in Scotland and Grawp is still learning to read."

Hermione thanked Harry for his time and nodded as she shook Harry's hand. She walked with him to the dark wood door, shook his hand once again, and patted his shoulder. She gave him a friendly smile and said, "It's good to see you," Harry grinned back and responded, "It's great to see you too," before thanking her and stepping out of the door and headed to the gilded lift.

*** In that case, I like most of what I see. I'd be more careful of formatting(starting a new paragraph for new dialog is an absolute must), there are some super-minor spelling errors, and smoothing out the dialog. It seems a bit.. stilted? Like very rapid changes in their tone, it's a little jarring. Otherwise, it's a radical premise and Im looking forward to seeing what you do with it!
