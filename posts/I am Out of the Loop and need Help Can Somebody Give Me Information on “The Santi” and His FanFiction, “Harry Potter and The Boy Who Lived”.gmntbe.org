*** Pretty much this. The author moved on with their life, and the fic is dead.

** He killed his own story with a really bad 4th year "plot twist" and then decided to go cold turkey and quit the fandom entirely. There's being busy with lawyer stuff, but not logging on for even 5 minutes in the last 5 years should be enough of an answer.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Specifically, he stopped writing fanfic so he'd have time for law school.

I believe he pops into DLP occasionally, but I think at this point it's more for the community than the fanfiction.
