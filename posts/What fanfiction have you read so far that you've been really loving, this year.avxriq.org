  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

******* the biggest difference to me when it comes to navigating is the inability to use Ctrl+End to jump to the bottom of the chapter (End of Page isn't End of Page on Forums) so I end up using middle-mouse button

this is because I use Text to Speech, (on my clipboard through voice commands) so I want to copy the text...

******** I'm trying to understand this. So you use Ctrl+End to get to the bottom of the page, but that doesn't work on spacebattles because that'll take you past the chapter to the bottom of the comments. I get that.

You copy the text.. the whole chapter? Or what? Why?

I have that connected to to [[https://voiceattack.com/][Voice Attack]] which means that I go:

- Select text

- Ctrl+C

  - possible cleaning in Notepad++ (regex stuff)

- say "Reading" aloud

- wait ~1sec and the text will be read.

I got separate option "Read into File" which will read the text into file for transfer to Phone for on the go book-listening.

***** Personally, FFN clearly sends you an update when the fic is updated. Spacebattles sends you an update whenever the authors posts anything, which could be a new chapter, or it could be them responding to comments.

** "Addendum", as recc'd by [[/u/chiruochiba][u/chiruochiba]]. linkffn(11562871)

It has shares a lot of the drawbacks of many Peggy Sue Harry-centric fics, where Year One drags on and on because the author keeps adding more details, characters, factions, and politics in an effort not to repeat the canon rails of HP&PS. It also has teenage politicians acting way too mature for their age, 10 year old kids who don't sound or behave like children.

On the good side, it's well-written, and the characterization is very good, at least for the main characters. I hate poor, Woobie!Tom Riddle who was abused by the other orphans, Mrs. Cole, and Dumbledore, and that's why he turned bad. I like this Tom Riddle who is a nasty little grubber with no remorse, and knows it. That feels age-appropriate, and makes up for the other times in the fic when he talks like a junior politician.

#+begin_quote
  Tom took one last look at Stubbs' face. The blond was inconsolable in his grief, his features tearstained and twisted, a perfect mask of pain. He sobbed as if the world had ended, and Tom soaked in his cries like a cruel god at the most ancient of altars. Once he was sure that he'd seen the best of Stubbs' anguish, Tom slipped from the crowd and headed outside. It would look guilty, he knew, but he didn't care. He was guilty and no one could prove it.

#+begin_quote
  Despite his impoverished circumstances, Tom Riddle always knew he was destined for great things. The ability to travel back and forth through time was a bit of a surprise, though. Also a surprise: the bushy-haired little girl he meets in the future who possesses powers to match his own. Eventual Tomione; starts pre-Hogwarts.
