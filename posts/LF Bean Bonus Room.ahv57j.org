** It would help if you explained what the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Bean_Bonus_Room][Bean Bonus Room]] is.

TL;DR: it's a minigame reward from the CoS video game.

**** I thought it was the "bean prank" ending from the first game on PC.

** I dearly love the games 1-3 (the weird platformer era). I've thought about writing a crack fic where it's Harry Potter, but the plot is only what happens in the games exactly. It would be pretty nonsensical and hard to follow, but I'd love to read about book 1: Harry and the fireseeds (why is hagrid making me risk my life?), Book 2: Harry and the polyjuice ingredient gathering and book 3: oh boy, cauldron cakes! The bean bonus room would feature heavily, obviously.

*** I had a similar idea to write a Harmony Dumbledore bashing fic on only what happens in the Lego Harry Potter game. You lose all fanon and most canon, but you gain tons of interesting ideas from game mechanics and changes made for the sake of game mechanics.

44 students need to be saved by you during the course of the game. (There are 50 [[https://www.bonefishgamer.com/2011/06/lego-harry-potter-years-1-4-student-in-peril-list/]["students in peril"]] in the game. I am only counting the ones on hogwarts grounds, I am not counting the one where you do a favor for the student, nor the one you put in peril before fixing it, nor the one in tom's memories, nor the one you save from bullies, but I am counting Hermione and Ginny.) How safe is hogwarts?

The other interesting change to canon in the game is that due to the "a friend can always join you" multiplayer you always have two playable characters, for the second and third task of the triwizard tournament you have Harry and Cedric, but for the first task you have Harry and Hermione. This gives you:

1. some trauma bonding between the two
2. more shade to throw at the organisers. Not only is there a fourth student in the competition that doesn't want to be there, but a fifth that isn't even entered!

Not that I'm likely to write this, I'm a horribly slow writer (It took me an hour to write this comment!)

**** Have you read the blog posts by the guy who never read or watched Harry Potter and attempted to summarize the plot based on the HP Lego games? They're hilarious.
