I'm of the belief that when first person fics are done right, they are done extremely right. There is almost no in-between for me--either they are utter garbage or among the best fics I've ever read. I can tell within the first paragraph which one it is. Even when a story can be somewhat lacking in grammar or plot or just downright weird, a strong first-person voice keeps me reading. Case in point, linkffn(Someone To Run To). I see a lot of hate for Snape/(female)Harry pairings, or any Snape pairing at all, and I too cringe at the over-the-top aristocracy *stuff*, and this fic contains some of that. But the narration is fantastic, just what first person narration should be, in my most humble opinion.

I've always shied away from trying to write first person fics, even though my first person writing is, if I do say so myself, very good, although I'm planning out one right now. I'm going to quit being such a coward about it :p

That said, when I was younger, it was garbage because I tried to make every first person narrator think like me. That doesn't work. Seldom can a good quasi-author narrator be pulled off, and I feel as though most of the first-person fics I abandon in the first chapter or some form of self-insert wish-fulfillment, even when the narrator is *supposed* to be Hermione. Perhaps especially when the narrator is supposed to be Hermione.

The other thing I've noticed is people fail to take advantage of what makes me choose first person narration, personally.--the closeness to the narrator. They write it as pretty much third person with thoughts interspersed, or worse third person narration framed through *I*.

*"I watched him cast the spell. My heart pounded and I could not help but think of the disastrous consequences of what could happen, my thoughts racing. I knew too many people who had died at Voldemort's hands. I feared there would be no stopping it. I could not turn away as the light struck the well-dressed man in his chest and he crumpled lifelessly to the ground."*

Exaggerated, yeah, but I see a lot of this stuff. I get not wanting to get too into a character's head in third person, but if you do this type of thing, imo, you're losing the value of first person narration. People tend to forget that you're not bound to I, I, I sentence constructions. Or they focus on the immediate person and moment of the narrator--I don't know about you, but I live half my life in my head, and I wonder what sort of fake, half person would narrate like the above excerpt.

*"He cast the spell. A green bolt shot from the end of his wand, the eerie light reflecting in his red, slitted eyes. My heart pounded and my mouth went dry--this was the light that had plagued me since I was only a year old, the light I had seen times beyond counting in my nightmares, even before I knew what it was, when I so innocently though it must be the headlights of the car that claimed my parent's lives. I closed my eyes, but it couldn't stop the onslaught to come. Not for me or for Voldemort's victim. Mum's piercing screams, her last words, begging for the life of her only child. Cedric, who never had a chance, not that I really did either when this same madman cast his killing curse at me, either time. I always escaped on luck no one else ever seemed to have. Certainly this poor Muggle didn't. The curse struck him in the chest, and he crumpled to the ground like a puppet cut from its strings. He was no one to Voldemort. He couldn't have been. He was just another Muggle who wore a grey business suit, a faceless and nameless Muggle in a mass of them, and tomorrow he could pluck another from an office building in London and have his fun all over again."*

Not perfect by any means--I don't think this captures Harry's voice and it's a bit melodramatic, but not bad for a midnight first draft. The point is, I think the second one is much stronger than the first, but infinitely rarer in fanfiction--a little attention to detail and thought has high returns in first person, imo. For the love of God, if you say "racing thoughts" or "lost in my thoughts" or really any variation of a phrase involving "thoughts" please, please, please consider how elaborating on those would fit, particularly, especially, most importantly in first person.

Anyways, my pet peeves and struggles are pretty much what I've said above. I'd rather read a bad voice than no voice. I think the voiceless narrators come from a lack of confidence or emotion for what is being written--I know that's usually what's up with me. It helps me to think of someone else telling a story to me with a particular voice and opinion, rather than thinking of me telling their story. Sorry for the wall of text, but I'd like to hear y'all's opinions.


** I strongly dislike first person point of view. I have practised writing it myself in a humour one shot, but that was a diary format. I still don't think I would ever use it in a "proper" fic.

I just think these fics have a tendency for melodrama, self-pitying characters and thinly veiled self inserts. Double this tendency when it's present tense too.

** When someone is writing in first person, and they change to another character *and they keep it in first person after the point of view change* I leave the fic.

**** The entire point of first person is to understand/see the story as the narrator character does, with all the limits that implies. Using, in one story, first person from multiple characters breaks this. Furthermore, it makes the story more difficult to read by forcing the reader to stop and figure out who the current narrator is /not because of designed mystery but either poor writing or laziness/.

***** Perhaps it is true of most /Harry Potter/ fanfiction, but with a large enough world and clueless enough characters it brings other "spots of light" in a big picture that remains dark overall (staying in the fantasy genre, I'm thinking, for instance, of /The Wandering Inn/). As to making sure the reader knows we switched perspective, well, that would naturally take writing talent, but in the absolute there's nothing too far-fetched about giving each character a distinctive "voice".

** First person for me is so I can be more immediately in the story, rather than watching it from the outside. That means access to all the sights, smells and weird, entirely-unobservable sensations, and the relevant memories that pop up.

You seem to get that too. Like you say, it's a bad example but your second piece contains exactly what I go to first person fiction for, reading /or/ writing. The last sentence is actually what loses me, it wanders a bit off the immediate point.

*** Actually, my original instinct was to end at "certainly this poor Muggle didn't." I agree that the paragraph wonders a bit--I added the last bit as a point to say "well-dressed man" is a bit of a hanging description, to me--why is he well-dressed? What kind of well-dressed? What on Earth is murdering a "well-dressed" man trying to communicate?

I would probably prune that last bit, because as you say, it wanders from the immediate point. If I wanted to use it, it would probably best be moved to a new paragraph somehow or incorporated in another part, though that runs the risk of seeming forced.

Not that really matters though, because it's not part of anything I'm actually writing :p

** I prefer fics from 1st person POV if they're written well, like a Visual Novel style. First person POV also lets you get away with hating characters from a biased perspective, without it being bashing. Snape POV would hate on Harry, but not be bashing.

** I enjoy first person writing and reading. I don't always do it. If I feel the emotion of the story could benefit from a first person POV, I'll do it. Sometimes I'll have trouble staying only in my POV character's head, but I feel like I seldom make that mistake anymore. It's also important to keep the POV in that particular character's voice.

Your example above is pretty much passive voice which is terrible for either first or third person.

My heart pounded in my chest as he cast the spell. The well-dressed man crumpled to the ground the instant the light of the unstoppable spell hit his chest, his eyes staring lifelessly up at me.

That puts it in a bit of a more active situation and gets rid of the problematic racing thoughts.
