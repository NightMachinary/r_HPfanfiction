I am looking for a fic, where harry travels back in time and has a really hard time with seeing people who died in his old timeline. Where he avoids them or breaks out in tears when they talk. Bonus points if he was in love with Fred the first time around (but it doesn't have to be in it)

I just really want to see him suffer over especially Freds death and not tell anyone what is wrong with him.
