For example, Tom Riddle, born to a MUGGLE and an almost-squib turned out more magically powerful or at least on par with Dumbledore. And then you have Vincent Crabbe for example, born to magical parents, unremarkable. So, it isn't blood then. What is it? Randomness? Fate? Genetics? What do you guys think?


** Intelligence and self-belief. The weakest wizards we see are invariably either extremely stupid or have no confidence in themselves. We see no idiots flinging around world-crackers, and no geniuses that can't maintain a lumos.

Canon makes no mention of power levels or magical exhaustion (beyond the physical effort of performing wand movements). It seems to boil directly down to knowledge, confidence, and of course practice.

** Taure wrote something up (based from canon) here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gaquik/magical_cores_or_the_limits_of_a_wizard/#fp1dc84]].

Personally, I think the three main elements of being able to cast spells are self-belief, desire, and focus. Desire can sometimes override belief (accidental magic) but it generally goes in that order. You have to believe in yourself/your abilities to perform magic, you have to want it to happen, and you have to focus on what you want. Practice/skill comes later after a spell has been done repeatedly. Everything else (knowledge, age, words/wand movements, emotional state, etc) is just a bonus. Helpful to know/have, but not strictly necessary to perform (basic) magic.

Of course, for stronger, more powerful spells you'll need knowledge (Summoning/Patronus Charm), for consistant results you'll need a calm/relaxed emotional state (or experience casting spells in different moods), magic changes as a wizard ages (the Trace), verbal spells are stronger than non-verbal (words have power), and so on.

** It is clear that the Magical Power does not come from blood. Making it so would mean that the Blood Purist had a point.

Concerning the Magical Power, I like to compare Magic to Music. Every wizard is able to use Magic like everyone is able to do music, and yet some people are more talented than others. Practising may help an average person to become better, but a genius could learn in one hour when he took 3 days to learn. And in the end, only the people blessed with both talent and hard work are able to rise at the top.

Ancestry and environment may help a little (the child of a genius may have a little more chance to be talented even if he doesn't reach the level of his parent, and a child raised in a magical family may get a headstart compared to the muggleborn), but in the end, talent make the difference and a Muggleborn can become the best if he is talented or hardworking enough.

*** JK kind of contradicts herself with inheritance. She makes it clear that magical power does not come from blood but then makes the Gaunts almost squiblike and the sole inheritors (outside of India?) of the rare inherited magical trait Parselmouth. And then she goes on and makes the half blood characters the seemingly most powerful.

Just to be clear, I like your theory and I think its a large part of canon, but I am just so dang confused.

**** I think that "Inherited Magical Traits" and "Magical Power" are 2 different things that have nothing to do with each other.

Yes, the Gaunt are Parselmouth, and yes, this is an inherited trait that stuck in the family since Slytherin himself . . . but being a Parselmouth is kinda useless. Sure, being able to talk to snake is pretty cool, and if you have a basilisk nearby you can become a threat to others, but this trait does not automatically give someone a better understanding of magic, or let you use a new school of spells (Parselmagic is 100% canon).

In the same way, Tonks Metamorphmagus abilities are pretty neat, and it may even have a use in Transfiguration (if anything, constantly changing your appearance may at least help a little when you try "Self Transfiguration"), but her talents are her own, nor her family. It is not impossible for an individual to have both an inherited magical trait and be a mediocre wizard (the Gaunts kinda proved this point with their life).

In the story, the strongest wizard may be Half Blood (and in Voldemort case, his muggle father probably helped to wash generation of inbreeding), but it doesn't mean that the Half Blood are automatically stronger than the others. According to Ron, Half Blood represent the majority of the Magical World (which make sense), and most of them are average. As an example, Alberforth Dumbledore, while not a slouch, can't be compared with his brother at all, even though they have the same family and similar circunstances.

Concerning the Squibbs, canon doesn't give any information about the family of Squibbs. What are the chances for their children to be magical? Same as the wizards? Same as the Muggles? Or something in between?\\
But it's not really a revelant point since Merope is not a Squibb. As long as she was able to use a spell, she was a witch no matter how weak she was. Dumbledore said himself that Merope weak abilities probably came from her circunstances. She was abused for most of her life, which hindered her magic (like how depressed Tonk had trouble using magic in HBP). She also never received a good education (since apparently, no Gaunts had gone to Hogwarts for generation by the time Merope was around). And finally, she probably had an ill suited wand (can't see the Gaunt willing, or even being able to pay the 7 Galleons to Olivander).

My point is that Voldemort was not among the strongest because he was an Half Blood. He was among the strongest because he was an incredibly talented individual, who happened to be a Half Blood. Just like Dumbledore.

** Quick note that I agree with Taure and Notus's theories besides an additional note of my belief that there is something inherent with magical strength, similar to a phenotypic range we might see with intelligence or strength, for example, where environment factors (like study, education, and use) might have an impact on magic.

However, my main point is that I'm super disappointed this is being downvoted. Yeah, there have been a lot of posts on magical cores and why they suck. Yes, people have posted their own theories on magical power before. But this post is, at the very least, a discussion post of an issue with substance. It certainly contributes to the subreddit and is on-topic. At any rate, it contributes far more than the constant spam of request posts or silly title-only prompt posts.
