I'd love to see some fics where Dumbledore or Mcgonagall or the Weasleys or anyone really notices Harry being mistreated at Privet Drive and takes him in


** Maybe the Harry Weasley kinda of fics. Though I believe there are only two lengthy ones. There's also this series. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/959625]]

  When Hadrian James Potter felled the Dark Lord Voldemort, it wasn't only wixenkind who celebrated their newfound freedoms. When the Chief Warlock then moves to leave their apparently beloved little Harry Potter on a doorstep on a blustery November night it is the creatures that step up to care for and raise the Boy-Who-Lived. In the process the Boy-Who-Was-Left-Alone becomes something that no one quite expected. Not Voldemort, certainly not Dumbledore, nor any other wizard either.

** Hail Odysseus - Grindelwald takes him.

The Daring Win - Umbridge takes him.

Those two are /very/ good. Don't avoid them because of who takes him in imo. And then there's....

Raising a Wizard - Natasha Romanov (Marvel) is his aunt, and takes him. First of a series (still a WIP, slow updates.)

Innocent - McGonnagal decides the Dursleys are shit, and gets Sirius freed. Sirius takes him.

The Accidental Animagus - Harry /runs away/ and the Grangers take him. First of a series (I've only read the first one, and I /think/ part two is still in progress?)

  When S.H.I.E.L.D. dumps everyone's secrets post CA:WS, Natasha discovers who her biological family was and that she wasn't born Natalia Romanova, but Mallory Evans. When she goes looking for her family, what she finds is a 6 year old Harry Potter and for the first time in her life she has someone who is all her own. Together, with the family she chose, they decide to raise him as their own. This is the story of how the avengers raise a young wizard, and how they teach him and each other how they all deserve the love and comfort having a family can offer.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
