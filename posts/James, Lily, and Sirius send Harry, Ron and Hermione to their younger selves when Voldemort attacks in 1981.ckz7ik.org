I need help finding a story I found many moons ago. Harry, Ron and Hermione were friends at a young age and they were either kidnapped or at the Potter home when Voldemort attacked. The only other thing I remember is that they (James, Sirius, and Lily) send the trio to their younger selves to live with James's Parents. I think they lived at Hogwarts for a time too and were being looked after by the marauders( minus Peter) and Lily.

That's all I can remember, I'm not sure of its quality but I just hate when I can't find a story I've read before.


** How would Hermione be friends with the other two? She'd be a muggle and wizards and muggles don't really move together at all.

Harry and Ron, even that's not really something possible, seeing as neither of the Weasley parents were members of the original Order of the Phoenix.

*** I don't really remember how Hermione came to be there. With regards to Ron, iirc it was the fanfiction cliche that the weasleys' didn't want him and didn't pay him enough attention blah blah blah. Again, the story was most likely not a masterpiece, but just something that I'd like to re-remember.

*** The weasley parents no... But Molly's brothers were. And Hermione would still be a witch... She just doesn't know it yet. Perhaps the potters saw her do accidental magic once and befriended the Muggle parents to keep an eye on things?

**** Molly's brothers were killed long before the attack on Godric's Hollow. Even when they were members, the Order is a secret group - Fabian and Gideon aren't about to give away the secret to the family that's at the top of the Death Eaters' hit-list to Molly or Arthur (two non-members), especially when they have so many young children in their house.

As for Hermione showing magic at 1 and the Potters just happening to be there and moving house to keep an eye on one random Muggleborn putting the safety of their own son at stake, that plot-idea is just plain bad. It's also been overused to the ground.

***** Well it is a fanfiction story so pretty much anything is possible... You asked questions and I posed possible answers...
