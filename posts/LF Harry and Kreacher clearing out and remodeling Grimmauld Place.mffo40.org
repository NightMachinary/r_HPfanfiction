Basically post war, Harry's got to decide what to do with his life and starts by reclaiming Grimmauld Place with Kreacher's help. In the process, he learns all kind of nifty magic like curse breaking, transfigurations, charms, enchanting, wards, magical architecture etc. He ends up learning a bunch of history through learning about the Blacks as well as more about the magical world, like the more day to day stuff regular Joe grew up with and less the 'I know about this bc it once tried to kill me' kinda stuff. Being more a practical learner than a theory guy, he ends up enjoying it and decides not to return to Hogwarts and continue his 'self study'. Maybe he ends up tracking down any other Potter or Black property and doing the same or buys newly 'abandoned' properties to do so. Possibly after making nice with the Goblins he finds interesting stuff in the vaults he inherits. Regular appearances of other characters such as Teddy and Andromeda, the professors and Bill/Arthur W. when he needs extra help or direction etc etc

TLDR Harry decides to clean up Grimmauld place, slowly recovers from the war and his childhood, explores his new freedom, learns a whole bunch of things and expands his world view.

Got any fics along those lines? Thanks!! :)

** Not exactly, but Grimmauld Place remodelling with surprising participants is in the stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer is before Winter; the real story is Winter, but Summer is required to understand).
