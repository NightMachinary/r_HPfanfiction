I'd really like to read some Harry potter fabrics that deal with pure blood religion. I imagine something pagan-y but not necessarily. Any suggestions would be great!


** Mmm.

Well probably my favourite fanfic of all time has elements about it.

Deals with what it /truly/ means to be a dark wizard ect.

The problem is that it's abandoned.

Not only abandoned but has been deleted by the author.

Thankfully there are copies of it kicking around.

I could have sworn someone picked it up on another site but I could be mistaken.

Edit: Someone did pick it up, posted one new chapter then a year later deleted their account for no visible reason. Maybe the fic is cursed /shrug/.

*** Damn, I was looking for this one, thanks for posting it. I lost it due to only having bookmarked the "adopted" version.

**** I lost it too!

I had no idea that the adopter removed their account up until yesterday.

I do still like to reread it from time to time.

***** I noticed because I wrote them a review asking if they'd continue, because I found it a while after it was adopted and wondered why someone would adopt something and then only write one chapter. And the review vanished from my history, where I looked after I couldn't find it anymore. But I couldn't even remember enough details to post a "looking for" here (or rather, I couldn't be sure what was part of this story and what belonged to others), so I'm really glad to have it safe now. Reading it for the third or fourth time now :D

** There is one... I've not been able to find it but there are articles about it, a play or fic, written by an Orthodox Priest, where Harry discovers he was baptized into the Church as a baby.... [[http://themoscownews.com/arts/20110420/188600359.html]]

** Hey - in terms of developing pure blood culture and religion [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2473502/1/Oath-Breaker][Oath Breaker]] is phenomenally written.
