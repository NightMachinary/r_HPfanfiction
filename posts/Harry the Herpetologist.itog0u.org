We've all seen the trope where Harry gets a pet snake because he's a parselmouth. I'm looking for fics that take that one step further, to a Harry that knows everything about snakes due to his 'gift'. This, of course would lead to a much different second year for him.


** I remember student-mentor fic where baby Harry switched places with Voldemort when in high stress. It led to him living hours as a snake, getting fascinated about varius species and learning about them a lot. It did not progress through Hogwarts years, in fact he went to different school and all drama was skipped.
