My first time posting on this subreddit, so if I got something wrong please don't crucio me! I was wondering if there are any fanfictions in which Tom Riddle is the main character or one of the main characters. If you know of any fics in which Harry is similar to Tom Riddle they too would be greatly appreciated.


** There are lots. I don't read it but I know of these two that people like- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11248015/1/Pygmalion][Pygmalion]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132624/1/Persephone][Persephone]]

** Hey, I've read plenty of Tom Riddle/LV fics... can you just clarify what you mean... Just a TR?LV fic that, if it does ship him, it is with someone cannon?

** Not sure exactly what you are looking for but I have linkffn(3155057) in which Tom is a child and linkffn(8163784) where Tom is single and more grey than dark.

I most likely have more if you can be a bit more descriptive about what you are looking for. Politics? Romance? Etc.

  Hermione is killed by Voldemort, and is now dead. Well, sort of. Turns out that death is a little more complex than she knew... Ignores epilogue and last 50ish pages of DH.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

  Modern AU - Primarily Tomione but other pairings will happen (het/slash) - Hermione's just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world. She took the midnight plane on a journey to LA in order to pursue her dream. What could possibly go wrong? - Not quite a crack!fic. Un-beta'd and rated M for sexual references, situations, and a lot of language. An a cappella story of aca-love.
