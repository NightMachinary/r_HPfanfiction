Do you guys have any stories were like the Potters get so caught up in the bwl stuff that they don't realize that they're unintentionally ignoring Harry. They still love him and try their best to care for him but with the prophecy over their heads it just happens. Harry runs away and the Potters freak out they find him years later wanting to apologize but Harry thinks they neglected him on purpose and is still angry about it.


** The Fall of the house of Potter by Bobmin356 AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks. M, English, Romance & Drama, words: 42k+, favs: 4k+, follows: 1k+, Oct 30, 2011, Harry P., Daphne G.

I really like this one, not exactly what you're looking for but close.

These are the 2 fics I loved. I am a huge sucker for wbwl fics without bashing the Potters as well.

Note: unfortunately, both these are unfinished :(

  On that fateful day, two Potters were born. One was destined to be the Boy-Who-Lived. The other was forgotten by the Wizarding World. Now, as the Triwizard Tournament nears, a strange boy is contracted to defend a beautiful girl.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

Focused on an adult Harry coming to terms with the way he's been raised. There's two sequels on the author's page.

  Six years after leaving Hogwarts, Harry Potter shares dinner with someone from his past and remembers some of the more important moments of his life. My take on the "brother of the boy who lived" story.
