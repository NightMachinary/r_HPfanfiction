I'm on break so I need some new recs. Since I've been here for years I'm tired of all the usually recommended stories. My only two preferences are:

1- please no focus on romance, though canon pairings are fine if they're mostly irrelevant and in the background\\
2- no stations of canon, and no Harry-at-Hogwarts, in fact I'd prefer nothing involving defeating Voldemort at all but if the premise is new I'll give it a try.

Crossovers, oneshots, long fics, anything well-written (a bit of logic, no bashing) goes.

edit - Thank you all very much!!! I'm now fueled and ready to waste a day or five reading :)


** Oneshots:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/105485][Five Women Who Hate Fleur Delacour]] linkao3(105485) - Fleur character study, through the eyes of other characters, background canon pairings
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278272][Wonderful Tragic Mysterious]] linkao3(278272) - time travel fic involving Luna and Dumbledore
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4818488][five people lily evans never fell in love with]] linkao3(4818488) - Lily character study
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1028945][Roads Not Taken]] linkao3(1028945) - how things could have gone differently for both Molly Weasley and Minerva McGonagall, background pairings

Longer fics:

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] - in which something fey is wrong with Harry and his family gradually realizes it. Written by the same person who did Antithesis and is doing Diablerie. Completed oneshot.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3175804][The Magic Bullet]] - oneshot crossover with Worm, a sort of grimdark superhero setting where you get your powers on the day you break psychologically; Hermione gets Miss Militia's gun-summoning power.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16676536/chapters/39106660][Dust and Wonders]] - by Lomonaaeren. Harry gets adopted/apprenticed to a necromancer pre-Hogwarts and skips the whole 'being a wizard who fights Voldemort' thing entirely. Completed twoshot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5001827/1/Grimm-A-Fairy-s-Tale][Grimm: A Fairy's Tale]] - in which Harry is adopted as a changeling by the Queen of the Winter Court. Complete, longer, and very good. Sadly, the sequel never materialized.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12203742][Scenes from a War: The Marriage of Alice and Frank]] - Dark!Lily as an Order healer uses ritual magic and the intercession of the dark gods to save the life of Frank Longbottom. Oneshot.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/400315][insurgere]] - Tom Riddle gets sorted into Hufflepuff. Oneshot.

** Harry Potter, Lord of the Swamp is a play on the whole Harry-becomes-a-lord trope. As the title suggests, instead of obtaining a manor, he inherits a swamp. Incomplete, but hilarious.

linkao3(2673074)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2673074/chapters/5976971]]

​

Somewhere All My Darkest Dreams Are Gathering is a canon compliant tale of Colin Creevey, who uses his skills in potions and chemistry to brew potions and sell to the student population. Rather dark, but a fun read nonetheless. It has my favorite interpretation of Colin Creevey.

** Caveat Inimici linkffn(5508237)

One of the more, if not the most, famous quotes from the Harry Potter series is Ron remarking that "[Hermione's] a little scary sometimes. Brilliant, but scary." And most of the time, this is in reference to her intimidating intelligence. The 13 year old girl that single-handedly figured out the Monster of Slytherin., the 14 year old that could handle a class load so large that it literally aged her an extra week over the course of a year, etc.

But we do catch sideways glimpses of Hermione being legitimately scary. The 12 year old girl whose first reaction in trying to distract a professor was "Let's set that motherfucker on fire." The 15 year old that successfully kidnapped an adult witch, fed her with flies (and somehow kept the disappearance of the most famous reporter at the only real newspaper from making any sort of news) for months, and was so intimidating that Rita didn't seek any sort of retribution against the school girl once she was freed. The 16 year old who helped run an illegal fight training organization, casually put all members of such under a curse that would permanently mar their face should they betray them (without telling them of such), and sent the Headmistress off to suffer all sorts of potential terrible fate at the hands of the centaurs.

This is a canon compliant one shot looking at /that/ Hermione, years older and wiser, and a new target in her sights.

** I haven't seen these fics recommended that I can recall

linkffn(9370162) It's a fun AU in which Remus Lupin is the 2nd year DADA professor instead of lockhart. Writing readable but not exceptional. Complete This probably has the stations of canon thing but I thought it was a really original premise.

linkffn(6535446) I read this recently. I thought the world building and writing was good. Muggleborns are slaves basically. Stars Hermione and Remus. WiP and hasn't been updated for a longass time.

linkffn(6671596) I really like this story. The writing is good and I like the addition and descriptions of different magic. Basically Harry gets a do over and poses as Sirius' son. Abit of dumbledore bashing but not excessive. Incomplete likely abandoned

linkffn(2595818) Alternate universe Voldemort that never went full evil comes to the main universe and helps to defeat other voldemort. Interesting premise IMO writing is decent. Incomplete and likely abandoned.

linkffn(3745998) The writing isn't great but I thought it was a decent time travel fic. The Marauders in their 7th year time travel to the the trio's 5th year.

** I try to rec linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) whenever I get a chance, but it's an odd duck: written before OoTP and total divergence from canon after GoF, it's a hero's journey story where Harry spends 90% of it outside of Hogwarts. It introduces several OCs that are interesting and memorable without taking the main stage, has one of my favorite takes on Nicholas Flamel, and has my favorite, bar none, "Power He Knows Not" which is PERFECT for countering Voldemort.

It's unfortunately unfinished, but it wraps up a major story point before doing so and it's a hell of a ride up to that point.

** linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Sirius escapes and kidnaps/rescues Harry years before Hogwarts. Focus on Harry and Padfoot on the run searching for Wormtail and Auror trainee Tonks, Moody and Moony hunting them. Villains are Umbridge (and Fudge and Malfoy), Fenrir Greyback (Moonys Sidequest) and later the mysterious Serpents Sworn.

In the sequel they do go to Hogwarts, and it somewhat follows the canon storyline of the Stone, the Chamber, the Azkaban Eacapee (although it's not Sirius) and the tournament in fourth year, but it's quite different. Complete until the Goblet of Fire scene with weekly updates.

There's quite a few interesting characters like Marlene McKinnon (I think she's mentioned once in canon as a dead order member), Hydrus Malfoy (Draco's brother, acts like canon Draco while Draco is actually a interesting character rather than just a bully), and Blaise Benson.

All in all, my favorite fanfiction I've read so far.

** linkffn(Salvation in Shadow).

This is an old fic, but I found it just recently, and it's been left in a strange place - you can technically take the last line as an ending in itself, sort of.

It's indy!Harry, but it's one of the best I've read. The pacing, the tones and the overall quality is absolutely riveting.

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.

Romance is minimal. Harry is at hogwarts for a bit but iirc there isn't a focus on his classes or anything. Defeating Voldemort is not what Harry is trying to do. There are some parts I don't like, but I found it really well-written compared to the usual fanfiction.

**** Basically the last 3 chapters. I felt like there were too many things left unresolved and a lot of questions I had weren't answered. I know there was a sequel planned and the author is going to answer those questions, but when I read it as a standalone the ending seemed very abrupt and unsatisfying. I think when I read it there wasn't even a sequel announced yet, so that was probably the reason it frustrated me. I'd say give it a read though, definitely better than most.
