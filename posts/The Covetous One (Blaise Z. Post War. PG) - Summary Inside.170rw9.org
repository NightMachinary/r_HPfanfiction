** There was one thing Blaise coveted more than anything else. And he would get it---oh yes, he would get it. He'd get it, he'd polish it like a gem, he'd turn it into a prize to be envied, and then he'd add it to his collection [...] Every person has a special talent, you see, and Blaise Zabini's was getting what he wanted.

** Perhaps I should note that the content of this story is somewhat disturbing, as the PG rating indicates. It was written for a challenge based around Shakespeare plays--and I drew Richard III. Hardly a nice man in Shakespeare's world. Obviously, I quite love him as a historical figure (Anne Neville was R3's queen).

The above story, however, was inspired by the famous seduction scene between R3 and Anne Neville in the play, and is correspondingly creepy.

Not my usual stuff, but hopefully still a good story.

ETA: Thank you for the upvote to take this story out of oblivion. I realize I should have explained in the comment that the content might be disturbing from the beginning. Sorry about that. I am not used to Dark!Fics. New author, as I said. I've only got about four months of writing under my belt.
