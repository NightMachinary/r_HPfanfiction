I'm looking for a story I read a little while back but don't remember the name of. It might be a one-shot or just really short. Harry ran away to hogsmeade summer before fifth year and got Hermione to join him. He scoffs at someone who calls Harry Potter dangerous and gets people thinking, eventually leading to the public to come around to his side.


** Is it this one?

linkffn(Public Safety by Yunaine)

Took me ages to go back through my past reviews to find it. I knew the fic as soon as I saw your post but couldn't for the life of me recall either title or author.

  Harry fails to draw his wand quicker than Dudley manages to punch him. Harry is kicked out of the house and travels to the magical world where he's confronted with the steady destruction of his reputation. The public should have realised Harry never stands idle when faced with injustice. - Set after fourth year
