Preferably all male/ all female main pairing(s). I would like if it's complete or 50,000+ words, but if you think it's still amazing and worth the read despite being neither of those, I'd like to take that suggestion as well. Thanks!

While this does contain some Gary-Sue moments, it's completed and has a lot of fun content as well.

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.

then throwing at =ffnbot!directlinks= the end of your post

#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  Crazy idea. What if Harry was Tony's dad?Not in a million years would Harry thought that by letting Anthony be held for a moment by a woman whom just lost her baby, would let the press go wild. In under an hour, the whole city knew about his baby. And under a couple of hours so did the whole United States of America. And soon the whole world would know. The worst thing was that they thought Anthony was the Stark heir.This work is a slow burn. So basically it will cover Tony as a baby, kid, teen, young man 'till adult. And mostly i used Howard, Harry, and Tony's POVPs. This work is 70% marvel and 30% Harpot world. And neither marvel or harpot charactrs are mine, but most of the story ideas are mine. So hope u enjoy reading itCOMPLETED

  Thanos has come close to death more than once. He saw a being who fascinated him. Death is a man of great beauty with the most captivating green eyes. Thanos will try everything to see him again and especially to seduce him. He therefore thinks that destroying worlds will bring him the favors of the Master of Death. Harry is the intermediary between the world of the dead and Hellfeim where a goddess helps maintain peace and balance. The more Thanos kills, the more angry Harry gets. His limit is reached when he attacks the planet under his protection, the Earth. Thanos is going to drool. He doesn't know what will fall on him. Harry Potter is more than a God.All rights go to the amazing author - memepotter952504.

#+begin_quote
  Many years have passed since the great battle of Hogwarts, and Harry's life has only gotten worse. Of course, he had imagined that after the battle ended, everything would go back to normal; at least, as normal as possible. But it wasn't long until the Ministry was taken over by yet more evil, dark, corrupt wizards. Wizards who wanted Harry out of the picture. After a series of unfortunate events, Harry is left on the run. Running from both the ministry and himself, it seemed. He has nowhere to go, and year after year passes by. He doesn't want to live like this anymore. He wants something better for himself; he wants the life that he once had. Being compared to Voldemort takes it's toll though, and the wizarding world no longer looks upon the boy who lived with wonder. They look upon him with disgust, with suspicious eyes and wands at the ready. He is an outcast in the only place he could call home. Stories about him are riddled with evil and lies, being passed down from generation to generation. But it all changes when a storm above London, England, at 9:46 am on August 13th, brings an outsider to earth, a powerful sorcerer with shoulder length black hair and and charming yet somehow malicious smile.

  Harry turned his head back to his Starkpad and flipped to the next page. Quite happily, to himself he said, "Not my circus, not my monkeys." Whether it was a meteor or a piece of an airplane, it mattered nothing. "The Boy Who Lived is in retirement." He shifted in his hammock, moving to a more comfortable position, and looked up just in time to watch the object fall into his vegetable garden. Harry stifled a strangled sound as he surveyed the damage. What had once been the center of his vegetable garden was a crater more than a meter in diameter. The vegetables that he'd planted were gone. Left behind was a single hammer.

He raised his right hand, making sure Thanos could see the Stones his nano-suit was even now incorporating into itself.Ah, gormless despair.

** Ooo I been waiting for this one!

First off is Prometheus Bound by Anarchic Muse. One of the best fics I've had the pleasure of reading. It's about Harry becoming the MoD and having to deal with the fallout, which involves accidentally time traveling to when Steve and Bucky had just enlisted, then coming back. Beautifully written, and heart-wrenching. Updates are usually about 6 months apart, but the author's Tumblr hasn't updated since October last year, so there's a /chance/ it's abandoned (I doubt it though, a prolonged update waiting time is more likely). It was /supposed/ to be Harry/Steve, but the author changed their mind and made it gen, so you should be good.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12187840/1/Prometheus-Bound]]

Then there's A New Man by Steelbadger. Standard Dimension Travel, unlikely to ever be finished, but peasant to read.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11196345/1/A-New-Man]]

Then there's Wand and Shield, by Morta's Priest. Featuring Harry traveling alternate realities until landing in the Marvel verse. Extremely engaging and well written, and the author recently indicated that they'll come back soon, though it's been on hiatus for a few years.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield]]

If you're looking for some lighthearted stuff with a bit of plot and don't mind slash, I'd recommend Friendly Neighborhood Falcon Mage and Welcome to Earth. Also both feature Harry going to another dimension of the Marvel world, and he gets together with Peter Parker--- it's an unexpectedly cute pairing. Both are still updating.

  “Just tell me you've got somewhere to stay kid.” Stark practically begged.At least this one Harry could answer positively.“Oh yeah, it's fine. My house came with me."...“I've changed my mind. You're not Oliver Twist. You're Dorothy.” Thanks to good old Black family paranoia, Harry finds himself stranded in a world full of superheroes.Peter's got a crush, Harry's oblivious, and Tony thinks his kids are hilarious.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

  A collection of shorts, homages, omakes and generally bad ideas that come from my Invincible Technomage fic. Some of these may actually appear in the main story, but most won't.
