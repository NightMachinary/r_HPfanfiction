Hey guys, so for some reason I really feel like reading this type of fanfic today. I've been going through the comments on a Snape x Lily thread and I was curious to know how it could have potentially worked out for the two and whether it would've been an unhealthy relationship.

So I'm looking for probably the most basic type of fanfic and the problem is I can't seem to be able to find one!

I'm looking for a canon-like, realistic Snily love story, based in the Marauder's time, in their Hogwarts years; everything is the same, except Lily actually has feelings for him and they try to form a relationship, but Snape starts to hang out with the other soon-to-be Deatheater Slytherins and it gets very difficult; then the whole "mudblood" thing happens and forbidden love and sobs and bla bla bla

No time-travel or Snape dying and going to Heaven and stuff like that, please

See, it's as basic as that, I'm pretty sure there must be a ton of those around, but for some reason I can't find one! :D

The closest thing I could find was this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5684569/1/The-Unbreakable-Vow][The Unbreakable Vow]]

But I read it way too fast and I'm looking for similar ones. I'm desperate, please help me around if you can think of anything! Thanks in advance!


** Snape / Lily is my ship of choice but I'm not sure how much out there is what you're looking for! Almost everything is fix-it AU. I personally don't feel comfortable writing Hogwarts-era romance anymore and mostly stick to the characters after they've graduated. I mean, I wrote [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15042299][seventeen moons]] (a oneshot AU where Snape is infected the night of the werewolf incident) but that's the only thing I can come up with that's even in the ballpark. There's also linkao3(11457669) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669][a life of smoke and silvered glass]] if you're looking for stuff that's more canon-compliant.

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)
