As title says. Harry shows up at Hogwarts muggleraised, and someone asks Harry about it, which leads to Harry beeing trained in his house duties, and leading to all sorts of changes.


** linkao3(Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven) pretty tropey, but well written, and it's Draco who takes upon the Neville role in your prompt.

*** Mmmm. I can't stand Good Malfoy fanfictions. I'd like to see to see someone step in and intervene for Harry, but it being Malfoy is a step too far.

**** It's different in this one, because it's a total retcon. I don't know how to do the spoiler text(but this isn't much of a spoiler, it's revealed early on), that Lucius was a spy for Amelia, so they've been good all along!
