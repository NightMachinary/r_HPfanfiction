Magic: noun; the power of apparently influencing events by using mysterious or supernatural forces.

Supernatural: adjective; attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature.

The thing about 'magic' in Harry Potter is that it's not particularly supernatural; even if its rules are tricky to follow, it's self-consistent. All potions of the same type use the same ingredients, the same method, and work the same way, each particular spell has its own incantation and wand movement for a repeatable effect, and all manner of magical creatures breed true.

There's even a certain school that young teenagers go to to learn how these rules of magic work and how to cast magic with a wand.

But, what if there was a case, where a character in this world could do magic-magic? Things that defy not just mundane but magical laws of physics, and oftentimes defy basic logical assumptions too, (except maybe cause and effect). Conjuring food in violation of Gamp's Law, raising the dead, doing a naked dance to hex someone on the other side of the world. Runes and diagrams drawn in ways that shouldn't work but do.

Anyone know any stories which have Harry or some other character doing that? And how the other characters who use 'normal' magic react to them?

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

*** Mm, I remember reading this one recently. I don't remember too much about it though, aside from 'Harry turns his pets into pokemon'.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
