** I just wrote a scene like that for one of my fem!Voldemort fics

#+begin_quote
  "So, if you prefer going by Voldemort, then why are people afraid of saying the name?" Harry asked.

  Voldemort groaned. "It's a bit of a stupid story. So, to start with, it's worth noting that very few people know that Lady Voldemort and Miss Riddle are the same person. I took pains to ensure that the identities are very separate. The only people who know the truth are a few members of my inner circle, and Dumbledore. Dumbledore made a point of calling me by my birth name the first few times we met on the field of battle, but I dissuaded him of that notion. Violently."

  "Um... I'm not sure if I want to know, but how did you do that?"

  "By violently killing every spectator. After the second time I did that, he connected the dots and hasn't called me by my birth name since."

  Harry didn't know what he expected. "That seems excessive. So how does this tie in to people being afraid of referring to you as Voldemort? Because it seems like that was the opposite of what you wanted."

  "Ah, well, it's kind of stupid. Basically, word got around that I was killing anyone who said my birth name. However, most people didn't know that I wasn't originally named Voldemort, and thus became afraid of saying that instead."

  "That's..."

  Voldemort shrugged. "Yeah, like I said, it was kind of stupid. It did technically work, though, as the few people who know my birth name certainly aren't spreading the info around."

  Not all wars are black and white, as Harry learns when the second war with Voldemort seems to be painted in nothing but shades of grey. In which Harry is confused, Tonks is overwhelmed, Barty is a genius, Snape hates everyone, Dumbledore is trying his best, and Voldemort is having the time of her life. fem!Voldemort

** There was one story where Tom came up with 'Lord Voldemort' as part of a 3rd-year charms project, being 13, he thought it was cool that his name could anagramize to "I am Lord Voldemort" only to realizes what a feeb he sounded like a couple of years later. By then, he was stuck with it, which is why he stuck the taboo on it, so he didn't have to be reminded of what an idiot he had been at 13.

Harry is part of the same project in his 3rd year and of the possibilities, he ends up with Pyjamas the Terror, which he knows is stupid and certainly never calls himself that except when he's messing with Tom

** Of course, he wants people to use that - being called a Lord would be very satisfying for this poor Orphan. Later on, when he puts a taboo on his name, he also wants people to use this name.
