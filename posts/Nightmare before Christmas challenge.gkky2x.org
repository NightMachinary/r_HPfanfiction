Alright here's the challenge, a young Harry Potter who knows nothing of magic watches Tim Burton's The nightmare before Christmas. maybe a substitute teacher shows it to him or something when the regular teacher is out. By Harry seeing things like his weird abilities asks the substitute about it the substitute says the characters use magic. Harry being a young boy who doesn't understand anything like that asked how he can learn more about it like they were doing, the teacher thanking he was joking tells him maybe you can call up Jack This is exactly what Harry does with Harry's missunderstanding of magic he actually summon Jack skellington who teaches him about magic Halloween style magic. I would like this too not be a slashfic please
