I found this app (logo looks like books stacked on a shelf) over a year ago and I love it, but ever since the Apple OS upgrade it's been shutting out and now it says something about a chat feature and I can't even access and stories at all? Anyone else struggling with this? (I've tried the fanfiction.net app and it just isn't as streamlined)

** Exact same thing happened to me; the name has also been changed to fanfiction chats or something like that. If you search the app store with "fanfiction," the second option or so should be fanfiction - 300,00+ books and it has the same logo. I've downloaded it and it seems exactly the same as the app used to be, but you'll lose access to all of your saved stories.

*** Yeah, only thing I don't like about the fanfiction app is that it doesn't automatically store all follows/favs offline, the offline ones have to be individually downloaded.

On the other hand, maybe this is why I stopped being told that my phone was out of storage space...

** I use PocketFiction and though it has some issues with crashing on occasion I still find it very functional and good for downloading stories for times without internet
