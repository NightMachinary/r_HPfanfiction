"The Young Adventurer's Club" hits a lot of my favorite things all in one fic -- but I welcome you to pick and choose more specific aspects to recommend if you can't find them all.

A few highlights:

- "Adventuring", with aspects of cursebreaking and battles
- "Forgotten Magic", where the characters find/learn/use old magic
- "Time Travel", used to interact with known characters at different ages and to meet mythical/historical figures during their times.

This isn't a perfect story by any means, but it has many enjoyable bits to it and I would recommend it if you haven't read it. But if you have read it, I'd love to read more stories that are similar!


** Well, if it's old magic and curse-breaking, my story "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis" features both, as does the first story in the series, "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider". No time travel, though.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

*** I /loved/ the first, but even though I tried I just fizzled out on secret of Atlantis. Not sure what it was specifically, but I definitely felt it just was dragging. I made it to about chapter 18 for reference. It was sad, since I had been waiting excitedly for you to finish updating it to read it all in one go too.

Anyway, thanks for the recs! Got any others to add?

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
