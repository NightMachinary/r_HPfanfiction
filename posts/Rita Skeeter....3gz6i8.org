What if Rita Skeeter was shunned from the daily profit for her methods and outraged fans, so she decided to find work where no one had heard of her. Taking all of the information she had gathered over the years and writing a series of books, filling in the gaps with her quick quotes quill...Publishing them under a false identity, A.K.A. J.K. Rowling.


** If that were the case, then the true story might be completely different... Think about the people who get slammed in the books - the ones who are made out be badguys, asshats, and slimeballs. Some of them might be just that, but how many just slighted Skeeter in some way and get painted as evil? How many people on Skeeter's nice-list get painted as heroes?

Edit: what if Hermione is a self-insert: "I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really."

** Ever read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]]? It's about a muggle named /Joanna/ whose brother gets killed by Deatheaters. The story centers around obliviation and the crappy way muggles are treated. It's set around 1995 I think. It made me wonder if Joanna maybe became JKR and wrote the story as a big middle finger: using real names and events, she gave fame to people that want to stay hidden, got rich while using their names and made herself famous enough that it would be impossible to obliviate her. I don't think the timeline quite matches but it's a interesting idea.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

*** Reason I posted this I think there is enough of a character clash between Skeeter and JKR that your idea wouldn't work as such. I think it could be that Skeeter or another witch/wizard that got burned by the magical world decided to provide JKR with the material for her books. Maybe Skeeter is JKR's muggleborn sister that grew apart from her muggle family. When Skeeter gets run out of town she goes back to her sister (JKR) who takes her in, provided that she tell her about the wizarding world. Naturally JKR would have taken what Skeeter said with a grain of salt, and would have done some creative editing while writing up the stories.

** Assuming for a moment that we humor the idea, why would she describe herself in such a negative way?? If it were true she would have described herself as an honest journalist known for her integrity.

*** Because she knows things a bug-animagus might know, and she'd be Hermoine's first suspect... Unless she trashed herself in the book.

*** Low self esteem? If we're talking about JK she did suffer depression which could lend itself to low self esteem or hell even reckless decisions (leaving the wizarding world for a career as a muggle author).

*** looking into that yes i would have to agree, but she does know good journalism, and if to alleviate any notion of this possibility she could portray herself as such so no one was the wiser

** I've read a story like this where Ginny is with Draco who actually did very little throughout the entire series in reality but because he's in Slytherin Rita saw the opportunity to make it into an epic rivalry. I think Harry's with Susan Bones or something who wasn't mentioned because she thought it would be pathetic for him to end up with a Hufflepuff.
