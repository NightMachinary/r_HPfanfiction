Any recommendations? Also, no slash plis...


** In a similar vein, can we get some "Adult Reincarnated in Harry Potter" fics where the MC actually staunchly refuses to even consider romance until the girl (or guy) is at least 17-18 because the thought of dating an underaged teenager disgusts them? It's kinda squicky when a 30 year old dude gets blipped into an 11 year old HP's body and immediately starts GROOMING GIRLS TO DATE LATER.

*** I don't read slash in general, but I can see how some would like it.. that said, I can't see how you read a ship between Harry and Voldemort. Not ridiculing, I'm honestly curious how that happens without an equally evil Harry - and even then, does he just forgive the murder of his parents..? Does it come back up if they bicker in the relationship like cheating would in non-enemy relationships?

I know that sounds like I mean it in an insulting way, but I honestly can't wrap my head around the idea.

**** Not insulting at all, I understand where you're coming from. I think it depends on how the writer writes the relationship. Sure there are some fiction where it's all instantaneous with soul bonds or mates, I don't always like it but some stories are okay. With good structured fan fiction, a Harry and Voldemort ship can work. It all down to the situation that is being presented by the writer themselves and how they're playing in the sandbox.

With the death of his parents, I think it depends on how they're trying to portray Harry. Is he the sometimes angry teen who loves his friends to pieces? Or has Harry been abandoned at an orphanage, having lived through a similar childhood as Riddle? Perhaps a neutral Harry in the war, knowing that the only the people he cares about are safe?

All of those types of Harry also depends on the type of Voldemort the writer wants. Is he really just a madman, with the mindset of only the Pure-Bloods are worthy of magic? Or could he be restored to a better state of mind if Harry gathered all of his soul into one body?

It's not my go-to ship, not by a mile, but it was the only fiction I thought of that matched the OP's request very closely with the way Harry is presented in this.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
