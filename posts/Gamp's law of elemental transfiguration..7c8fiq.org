According to beyondhogwarts four of the five laws are that;

1.You cannot make food out of nothing. (Unless you are Molly Weasley)

2.You cannot create money (gold) out of nothing. (Without a philosopher's stone)

3.You cannot reverse curse damage. (So the HP universe can have some scarred characters, literary)

4.Bring a human back from the dead. (Or at least not completely, even with /the ring/)

5.?

The fifth is still up for debate unless JKR discloses it in the next play. What are your opinions on the subject? Do you think the 2,3 and 4 are correct? (only food is known as one of the five laws for sure)


** First, 'Beyondhogwarts' is an unofficial website that was active ~8 years ago, and shouldn't be considered as a reference for anything. Both canon and fan theories have developed quite a bit since then.

Second, there aren't five laws, there's one law with five exceptions. While it never is explicitly stated anywhere, there have been several discussions here, on other Potter-related subreddits, other forums, and perhaps even in the author's mind that have explored and extrapolated the rest of what Gamp was trying to say.

Here's my version:

Gamp's law of Elemental Transfiguration = A perfect transfiguration results in an object with the properties and qualities of the intended end-result, with no vestiges of the object's prior state left behind.

There are five exceptions- qualities where magic cannot transfigure or conjure them properly. It can be done, but it doesn't last.

1. Food- life feeds on life; conjured food has no nutritive value and non-consumables transfigured into food are similarly incomplete

2. Life - one cannot conjure sentience, nor can a non-animal be made into an animal with the capacity to procreate. Hearkening back to the first exception, such an animal will deteriorate as the living material that originally had no life fails to replicate new cells

3. Rare elements - darn those leprechauns, turning sod into gold coins to taunt their enemies. The goblins know- it may look like gold (or silver, or platinum, or uranium...) but the fake stuff just doesn't work right. The trick Flamel figured out with the philosopher's stone has probably put him on the goblins' blacklist for the rest of his extraordinarily long life. EDIT: may apply to any material from higher on the periodic table, based upon rarity of appearance on earth. Still, we shouldn't rely on physics/chemistry to explain this...

4. Enchantment - transfiguration in and of itself cannot bestow or remove magical properties; turn a horse into a unicorn and it may be attractive but its blood and horn will have no greater value than that of any mundane creature

5. Magic - magical creatures resist permanent transfiguration while still alive- the effect will wear off, unless the creature is actually happier in its new state (see Quintaped; Animagi 'going native')

People in the habit of 'conjuring' beverages and sauces with their wands are actually using a charm to draw the fluid from a known nearby source- water condensed from the air, mead from a flask, Hollandaise from the pot on the stove or even breathable air from above the surface of a lake (cf. Bubblehead charm)

*** I don't dislike your attempt at the definition of Gamp's Law (though my own take is more simple: "any object can be turned into any other object"), but I think you're blurring a few lines by making the exceptions an attempt to lay down fundamental rules of general magic rather that specific matters related to transfiguration. We shouldn't try to shoe horn everything we know about magic into a rule of transfiguration.

So, for example, I doubt that the "enchantment" one is actually an exception, because transfiguration doesn't even attempt to do that - enchantment is simply beyond the definition of transfiguration.

Similarly, "you cannot resurrect the dead" is clearly a rule of general magic but "life" is a bad exception to Gamp's law, because we have seen transfiguration used to create life on many occasions (in the form of animals). Of course transfiguration cannot create souls, but again this is not so much an exception than part of the definition of transfiguration - souls are not physical, so transfiguration doesn't deal with them at all.

Gold/currency is a generally accepted good candidate for one of the exceptions, and that's actually a further good reason to avoid treating Gamp's exceptions as matters of general magic, because we know that in branches of magic other than Transfiguration it is possible to create gold (alchemy).

Keeping Gamp's law in its proper place, and not overstating its importance, also helps avoid some problems. For example, we know from OotP and DH that conjuration creates things out of non-being (vanishing sends things into non-being, and in OotP McGonagall defines conjuration as the opposite process of vanishing), so your proposal for conjuration actually being a version of the summoning charm doesn't really fit with canon.

But there's actually no problem to solve: Aguamenti is a Charm, as are Mrs Weasley's cooking Charms. They don't have to obey rules of transfiguration (though they will presumably have their own rules, unknown to us).

Anyway, my candidates for the five exceptions are:

1. Nutrition

2. Currency

3. Creativity

4. Novelty

5. Secrets

To explain:

"Creativity" refers to products of human creativity. Transfiguration can create natural objects without the caster's knowledge of the thing, but it cannot write a book for you, or produce an LP, without your own mind providing the contents.

"Novelty" refers to unique objects. You cannot (re)create something which there is or was only ever one of, such as "the spear which pierced Jesus on the cross".

"Secrets" refers to objects which contain or refer to secret information, such as "a clay model of Voldemort's fifth horcrux" or "a nude photo of 2005 Lindsay Lohan". We know magic already recognises secrets from the Fidelius Charm so it's a nice tie-in, I feel.

All of these are based on what I believe to be the same consideration which led to JKR deciding on food as an exception, which we might call Gamp's Meta-Rule of Transfiguration: transfiguration can break physics, but it cannot break the plot.

**** Can you not condense those three into Information? Wait nevermind -- if you conjure a pig you can learn biology. (Or does that violate Secrets? (Assuming a time in which biology isn't known.))

Separate from that: Novelty feels like a specific thing from a larger exception. If McGonagall had that spear in her hand, she should definitely be able to copy it physically. She wouldn't be able to recreate any magical significance -- it's history -- with transfiguration. I think changing Novelty to History or Significance would fit better.

***** Well, not being able to replicate a thing's magical significance I think falls under the same issue as "enchantment" - no, transfiguration can't do it, but that's because transfiguration is the manipulation of physical stuff. So its inability to do so is not an exception to a general rule, it's just part of what transfiguration /is/.

What I mean with novelty is that you would be able to transfigure a generic Roman spear but you would not be able to replicate any particular physical aspects of a particular Roman spear, e.g. having a notch in a certain part of the blade. That is not the same thing as manually creating the notch with transfiguration - of course you can do that - but what I'm getting at is that you can't create the notch merely by reference to some unique historical spear. You have to do that manually yourself.

A consequence to the novelty rule which I quite like is that if you lose your homework, you can't transfigure it back even though you know all the contents. It's not excluded under the "human creativity" exception, as your mind can supply all the detail required, but it /is/ excluded under the "unique items" exception.

And yes, an exclusion for information would be too broad, as the whole basis of transfiguration is that the magic supplies the physical information required - all the wizard needs to know is how the magic works.

****** So, I think I got this:

Transfiguration cannot reference a specific entity to base on, but it can a generic one. If you know about the specific one, you can modify the generic to copy it.

For the homework example: You can reference a generic piece of paper and apply your own knowledge to fill it. However, you cannot reference your previous work, because it's unique. The new paper may have different wording, slightly different handwriting, the paper might not be crumpled, etc.

Does this mean someone with eidetic memory could /appear/ to break this rule?

Yeah, I think that's a good exception.

Explanations:

1. Nutrition is non-physical, but wizards do not know this, so it's listed as an exception.

2. ...Author fiat? Value is a non-physical property, and transfigured objects are known to be worthless? Wow that explains why there's an economy. ^{I think.}

3. There has to be reference material, i.e. transfiguration cannot innovate.

4. Reference material only includes generic entities.

5. See 4.

Wait, now why is Secrets an exception? Voldemort's horcrux is a specific object. You can't reference it. The photo should be replicable /if/ it's widespread, otherwise it's not a generic object. Now I think Secrets are a part of Novelty. Can you distinguish them further?

It depends on how you interpret the rule. One interpretation is that you can use transfiguration to make stuff that looks and tastes like food but carries no nutritive value. If that's the case then yes, strictly speaking it's a "definition of transfiguration" matter rather than an exception. But an alternative interpretation is that you simply cannot create food, at all. That would make it a genuine exception.

The ability to create animals which could be used for food rather pushes you towards the first interpretation. However, the fact that during DH camping they couldn't even use transfiguration to make the food they had taste better supports the idea of "you can't make food, period". Hermione says she doesn't know cooking charms, which is why she couldn't use Charms to make the taste better like Mrs Weasley does. But she definitely knows animate transfiguration.

Ultimately all of them are pretty arbitrary in the author fiat sense. They're the basic rules of transfiguration, so I'm not sure that they can be /explained/ (in the sense of putting them in terms of something more basic). They can just be described.

Your decision to go specific/generic is not quite what I had in mind with novelty, which was more narrowly focused on one-of-a-kind items. However, on reflection the generic/specific definition is better.

That of course leaves a fifth exception to be filled. My inclination is for it to have something to do with size. My version of Gamp's law - any object can be changed into any object - leaves open the possibility of transforming a stone into a star. Now, while this possibility can easily be closed off by reference to things wizards know how to do vs. theoretical magical possibilities, it might be nice to close off the possibility. That said, I would be extremely averse to any kind of "equivalent mass" rule or anything so connected to the concepts of Muggle physics.

EDIT: I have changed my mind on further consideration, and after reading [[/u/Kazeto][u/Kazeto]] below. The problem is possession, not just knowledge. Let's say you're an Auror investigating a crime. You know Lucius Malfoy did it. You know he used a knife purchased from Dervish and Banges to do it. You know if you had the knife, you would find the fingerprints of the victim on the handle. But you don't have the knife, so you can't prove it.

If "secrets" is not an exception, then under the generic/specific rule developed above, the Auror can transfigure the knife with the fingerprint on, because they have all the specific knowledge required to do so. But possession adds a huge amount of value over mere knowledge, because now you have an object you can enter into evidence. The only way Lucius can prove it's a transfiguration is by producing the original knife, which of course lands him in the same trouble.

I like reductionism: food is an exception because it has an unknown non-physical property (or so I wish). Money would be the same. Your exceptions all refer to the same mechanic of transfiguration: reference material, which is what I like about them.

The more fundamental point being made was that possession of an item is distinguishable both conceptually and practically from mere knowledge of the item's existence. In that specific example one can of course come up with legal procedures to check against it. But it's not just about that example. The request was for a conceptual difference which demonstrates that the secrets exception does not, in your terms, reduce to the novelty exception. This is that conceptual difference.

********* *Theory of forms*

The theory of Forms or theory of Ideas is Plato's argument that non-physical (but substantial) forms (or ideas) represent the most accurate reality. When used in this sense, the word form or idea is often capitalized. Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily Socrates) of his dialogues who sometimes suggest that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge; thus even apart from the very controversial status of the theory, Plato's own views are much in doubt. However, the theory is considered a classical solution to the problem of universals.

#+end_quote

Sure, nothing says you can't transfigure ink on it to form the exact shapes that were on your original homework, since this falls under manual changes. It's probably going to be somewhat taxing to make a shape as intricate as that, though, so even for someone with an eidetic memory it may or may not be easier to just get a dicta-quill or something.

#+begin_quote
  Wait, now why is Secrets an exception?
#+end_quote

Think of it that way: You could have someone use a generic weapon to kill, and it's obviously something you can make a copy of by transfiguring something else, but you cannot do it by transfiguring into “murder weapon” unless you know what exactly that was. So if you know /what/ something is from the role it fulfilled or something, it still is not transfigurable to you if what exact kind of object it is remains a secret to you. The horcruxes are a special case because they are both unique (both as items and as something that holds a piece of a particular soul) and secret (you don't know what they are ... until a certain point anyway) so they fall under two rules.

As for the photo, photos technically aren't unique objects, you could make a copy of any photo you wished and then there'd be two photos, and you can transfigure something into a photo like those, a copy if you'll call it that, but each individual photo as its own object has a unique history of tear and wear that you cannot replicate with standard transfiguration. Think of it that way: if you have a cup that is chipped in a certain place and you transfigure a copy of the cup, then on its own the transfiguration will give you a whole cup with no chipping because it creates a copy of a generic object (a cup) rather than a copy of a unique object (your cup, with its chipped bit). Likewise, you could transfigure a copy of Slytherin's locket, but it would be a generic locket in its shape (generic object), rather than a locket with the specific enchantments that the locket has and a piece of soul attached (unique object).

That's what I said: instances of Conjuring foodstuffs in the novels are actually the use of Charms. Cedric conjuring the dogs for the first task of the tournament or Draco's Serpentsortia were actual instances of conjuration- the point of my second exception is to point out that those creatures weren't permanent creations.

Further, I feel by committing to the idea that the things created via Charms are not real, you're still extending the Gamp exceptions out of their proper domain. We have no idea what rules govern Charms' conjurations, especially of basic elements like water. When you use Charms to create fire, the fire is real enough. Certainly Harry, after spending an entire year learning about Aguamenti, thinks that it is capable of being drunk and quenching thirst.

More to the point, I have a slightly more refined theory on the issue of rare metals --- I'd say it's just that Transfigured gold, like all Transfigured materials, can be Untransfigured (alhough it won't revert on its own as some people seem to think). Thus, to stabilize the wizarding economy, the Goblins decreed Transfigured gold (or silver, diamond, etc.) has no monetary value and cannot be bought or sold; and at any gold transaction, it is thus required to perform an Untransfiguration spell on the "gold" to check if it's "real". Meanwhile, Alchemical transformations are irreversible, perenially changing the nature of the object, making Alchemical Gold indistinguishable from mined gold. Because Flamel is a reasonable man, he cut a deal with the Goblins and they allow him to spend his gold freely as long as he doesn't create too much of it at a time (and dock the prices when selling to them).

** In my stories, the five exceptions are food, money, clothing, life, and magic. (And in The Arithmancer, Hermione discovers a sixth: radioactivity.)

Food and money are basically given in canon. You can't create food out of nothing, and you need the Philosopher's Stone to create gold, etc. The magic cannot create life from non-life in general seems like a pretty reasonable worldbuilding element (Hermione can conjure birds, but they don't work like real birds, etc.), and an extension of magic not being able to raise the dead. And it's reasonable to think that transfiguration cannot create magical items since they have to be made by other magical processes.

I chose clothing for the fifth exception because it's fairly common in fanon, based on the fact that wizards have to buy clothes rather than transfiguring them (although that applies to just about anything else they buy). I justify it in-world based on the structural complexity of spun and woven cloth.

I added radioactivity based on the need for such a rule to not be world-breaking. If you could transfigure uranium-235, you could not only transfigure a nuke, but do it by accident if you weren't careful.

Not exactly by accident. Unless wizards discovered nuclear fission by accident before muggles did, it'd be pretty hard to learn that U-235 exists without learning what happens if you get a bunch of it in the same place.

And you can probably already enrich uranium with the summoning charm. Maybe they make muggleborns swear an unbreakable vow not to create atomic weapons or something?

** When you actually think about canon magic practically, those Gamp's laws make zero sense. Just look at Aguamenti, the water making charm. You create water out of nothing, water that you can drink. Since water is just molecules, which is really just energy, it is creating something from nothing. And when you have that, you can create gold or any other element ,so long as you put enough of it in one place, (i.e. nuclear fusion).

I think it's best not to be so picky about that nonsense, just go with the flow.
