*"James, Lily, and Harry Potter live at Potter Cottage in Godric's Hollow."*

/Albus Dumbledore read aloud as he examined the Secret Keeper's parchment. Satisfied with the wording of the secret and the stability of the charm, the aging Headmaster made to return the parchment to Sirius, his joints suddenly locking in place as a look of shock came over his face- realization setting in as Albus realized the true implications of the phrasing. The old man's whiskers quivered furiously as he let out a soft laugh/

â€‹

Voldemort rejoiced, the Potter brat lived no more- and his meddlesome parents were gone as well! Now he only had to see to the Longbottoms and he would finally be free from that accursed prophecy. Satisfied that the Potters never truly were a threat to him, the Dark Lord paid no further thought to their possible ramifications for the prophecy.

â€‹

Severus Snape's knees gave way under him, sending the Dark Wizard to his hands and knees. Under any other circumstances he would have taken satisfaction in the total destruction of the Potter bloodline, but now the former Death Eater only had thoughts for Lily- sweet Lily who had died because of his actions.

As far as the Wizarding World was concerned, the Potters /lived/ no more.


** So once Harry goes to Hogwarts and starting /living/ there, the effect will be negated until he goes back to Grodic's. That's my interpretation of the wording.

If the secret is that they live /at Potter Cottage/, then it wouldn't be a secret that Harry lives /at Hogwarts/ during the school term.

*** Harry Potter becomes known as the "Boy who lived" at the age of 11 when he shows up at Hogwarts due to his miraculous return from the dead. This legend grows with each "Resurrection" when he returns to his parents for the summer, since Harry is not the secret keeper he finds himself unable to deny it without lying.

**** Okay, that's a good premise for a fic. Imagine Voldemort/Malfoy/Remus/Umbrage thinking they'd successfully/accidentally(Remus) killed/got rid of(Umbrage) Harry each year.

Voldy after first year: I kind of possessed Potter, now he's dead, success!

Lucius after second year: I knew planting My Lord's artifact on that blood-traitor was a good idea. I've killed the Potter brat for Master!

Remus after third year: I forgot my potion and now Harry's gone! It's all my fault! (Okay, less funny)

Voldy after fourth year: Yes! I must have killed Potter during the duel! Now no one stands before me!

Umbridge after fifth year: Yes! The Potter brat is gone! Served him right for--- w-was that a centaur!?

**** Imagine he is believed dead after each school year, which coincides with a murder/kidnapping attempts by the Death Eaters, who are only too happy to claim credit. When the boy comes back from the dead, Voldemort is confused. Are his troops traitors, or is the brat immortal? It would put an entirely new spin on Dark Lord's equal lol.

***** Voldemort becomes convinced that Harry also created six horcruxes, inspiring an alternate version of the Deathly Hallows in which Voldemort, Bellatrix, and Pettigrew attempt to destroy artifacts of significance to Harry's six years at Hogwarts/six "resurrections".

****** Kreacher, meanwhiile, decides to be more proactive. He lays out clues and takes advantage of lack of communication among Death Eaters - and directs the search teams to Voldemort's horcruxes. After all, they only know how to recoignize a horcrux and that the item would be significant. Voldemort would hardly tell them details of his own attempts...
