** Filters I use:

1. English, because it is the only language I can +barely+ speak

2. Updated within 24 Hours, so it is easier to see if anything interesting has updated recently.

3. Rating: All, because Dad rented The Terminator for me when I was way too young for it to be appropriate.

4. With Harry, because in general, Hary-centric is all I care aboot [sic].

5. Without Draco M. and Severus S. not because I dislike them, but it cuts the most slash out (and I'm not interested in that).

I just wish you could filter by words/chapter.

*** That's almost precisely what I do, except I sort by "updated within the last week", because once a week is the most I'm willing to trudge through the sludge. Ocassionally I also add a genre, though, lamentably, what I usually understand by a particular genre often isn't what most fanfic writers think.

I'm mostly only interested in complete works so I have a filter bookmarked with status complete and sorted by update date, and check it once a week to find newly-completed works.

#+begin_quote
  Without Draco M. and Severus S....
#+end_quote

Exactly the same. The filter really needs two more slots to filter out Tom R. and Voldemort...

*** Yup this is exactly how I have set my filters for the last 7 years or so. Recently I took Draco and Snape off of the without filter as i was running out of things but there was way to much slash there so I did without Harry and Draco and marked as a pairing so is cuts down on some slash.

** Why don't you try DLP's fanfic Scryer?

It's a fanfiction search engine that allows you to search way more comprehensively than you can on the FFnet website itself. It's pretty magical, in all honesty, even if you're not usually a DLP user. It's right here: [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]

For me personally, I never read on FFnet, but if I am looking for something, I definitely don't search on the sites themselves. I'll search online, excluding pages on FFnet or Ao3 themselves, and I'll look for rec lists on certain topics I'm interested by using normal Google Fu.

*** I second this. Scryer is more robust, and there are a lot of search operators to use that makes narrowing your search much easier. FFN search has always been complete garbage.

On topic, usually I find an author and story I like, and check their favorites because they're usually full of similar fics to what they are writing.

**** That used to be how I found fics to read when I started out. I would read a story, then look at the author's favorites and bookmark any that seemed interesting. Then I would pick one to read and repeat that with their favorites. Unfortunately, after a short while I started looping around in circles or hit dead ends. I still have hundreds of bookmarks unfortunately.

** Sort: Update Date Time Range: All (Usually I check it often enough that I don't need a specific time range) Genre A/B: All (Not picky) Rating: All or M (If there was a setting for T+M I would use it) Length: >20,000 (I like to read novel style mostly) Status: All World: All Character A: Harry Potter (I have trouble getting into stories that aren't based on Harry, especially next gen) Character B/C/D: Usually not selected, on occasion I'll select a pairing I'm interested in.

Without Character A: Draco Malfoy Character B: Severus Snape (Both for the previously mentioned reasons, I wish you could just filter out all slash)

That's what I generally go with, so I try to use recommendations on for good one shots or stories with Draco and Snape that aren't slash since I'll never see them otherwise.

** I have given up on using filters to find anything worth reading. Every time I have tried going through top favorites, top reviews or recent or selecting specific characters, I just ended up sorting through a whole bunch of terrible writing with nothing good.

To find stories, I either search this subreddit for topics that I want to read about or go through recommended fanfiction lists. Another method that works for me is to go to authors of my favorite stories, and going through their favorites. I have found that people generally favorite similar stories to what they write about so looking through different authors favorites generally allows me to find good fics. Also looking through reviews and then looking through favorite lists of people who give good constructive criticism also works sometimes.

** I have a set of bookmarks:

- Completed crossover fics of more than 10K words
- Completed fics of more than 10K words
- A set of my favourite pairings each with more than 1K words and
- In-Progress fics of more than 20K words

All used in conjunction with a userscript that fades out my NOTPs and do-not-want crossover fandoms.

Works decently well.

That site is gone unfortunately and I don't know if the script is available somewhere else.

** For a first viewing I choose "Sort by" filters, either by Reviews, Favorites or Follows. Srcoll down a bit to get over the FFN circlejerks (such infamous monstrosities as Harry Crow and Partially Kissed Hero can be found on page 1) and you'll find some decent new-ish fics hanging around.

Then I add pairing filters. Genre is, in my opinion, a filter defeated by the fact that often genres are not correctly applied. Much more indicative of a story is the character cast.

And from there its just summaries and the first few paragraphs.

** - Sort: Favorites or Reviews (sometimes I'll skim the first few pages of newly updated fics to see if there's anything interesting, though)

- Language: English

- Genre: All

- Rating: All

- Length: All

- World: All

- Status: All

Characters, Pairings, and Genre filters change depending on what type of fic I'm looking for.

I also tend to avoid the first few pages since I pretty much have the fics listed there memorized.
