** The best idea for the "Turns out old family wizards are too inbred, they need to shag muggleborn wizards or their kids will have no magic" is to drop the fucking trope.

Drop it. I'm sick of reading fics where authors yap about wizards being inbred. Like seriously, every other fic has to have at least four or five instances of this shit. In canon, we see a grand total of one family that is inbred - just the Gaunts. Nobody else has any problems whatsoever. Don't say Crabbe and Goyle either - being a bit dim is not a sign of being inbred.

Also, insulting a teenager's family is very likely to get you punched in the face. So, if Harry, Hermione, or anyone else starts yapping about "inbred purebloods" where other self-respecting purebloods can hear them, they are likely to get punched in the face.

**** See, a child born out of a marriage between cousins (first or second) won't be inbred - sure, it's not ideal, and there are going to be problems if you keep doing it generation after generation, but not inbred.

Inbreeding happens over generations. Neither Sirius nor Regulus have any deficiencies with their physical or mental capabilities. Quite the opposite in fact.

***** This is true. It's uncommon in the West, but extremely common in the East and not everyone is mentally or physically challenged. I'd argue that it's very rare cases that turn out that way. Both Narcissa and Andromeda are physically and mentally functioning perfectly too. Bellatrix too is of sound body and mind. Her craziness seems to be an inherited trait rather than a genetic insufficiency.

Incest should mean marrying your own brothers or sisters (from the same parent). That is what is frowned upon. But if you keep marrying exclusively within very close families (like first cousins) it can lead to problems that won't manifest until ONLY centuries later.

I'm not sure on the extremely common part. I'm from India, and there used to be a rather strange inheritance law in my area that had a man's wealth and property be inherited by his nephews. This inheritance law did obviously encouraged marriage between first cousins, although I can't remember the last time it was practiced in my family - my great-grandfathers married outside the family, as did everyone who followed.

I also personally know a few people who were born out of unions between first cousins, again due to the old law.

In any case, none of us are inbred.

I just thought Bellatrix was fanatically loyal towards Voldemort. When she's interacting with people who acknowledge his supremacy, she acts more or less normal, like in the first chapter of HBP.

Edited my point to word it better. Yes she is fanatically loyal. That's what I mean too. Fanaticism of pureblood supremacy runs in her family after all (Walburga).

And regarding the other point, maybe you misunderstood. I am agreeing that marrying your first-cousin won't lead to inbreeding. Maybe if it's done continuously for generations, it might have some effect.

********* I just saw the family tree for like ten seconds and one thing stood out to me. Philip IV married his wife and also his wife's daughter from another father (who is also his cousin)(!) That was what resulted in the genetic deficiencies in Charles IV. I assume the others in the family, though inbred, are relatively fine (keyword being 'relatively'). But Charles IV is the exceptional case because of too many loops in his lineage.

**** THIS is the reason for the trope right here. First cousins marrying isn't really bad unless it happens generation after generation after generation, but it is perceived as just as bad as a brother/sister pairing producing a child.

** Linkffn(Wish Carefully by Ten Toes)

This story deals with the entire idea of what would happen if the pure bloods didn't breed with muggleborns and how they would regret it. And it is one of the only stories where it doesn't result in a marriage law being passed. Give it a shot.

** Genetic engineering/homunculus creation/surrogacy programs are put in place by a company.

Basically, sperm or eggs are duplicated, fertilized and implanted into the pureblood wife who then bears the child to term. The child is a blind fertilisation, meaning that no-one but the implanting doctor knows which pureblood parent happens to be the true biological parent. Two children or more would ensure that both parts of the couple are the parents of at least one of the children, who can then be blissfully unaware that they're technically half-bloods.

The muggleborn donating their genetic material are adequately compensated and don't have any contact with or commitment towards the child outside of an emergency. They are free to continue their own lives whilst enjoying the windfall of their participation.

Everyone wins.

...and those old families that engaged in bestiality? Squibs, so weak at magic that they could have been muggles. Families that had spouses from continent had perfectly normal, magical children.

That is why we kill muggleborns rather than have their muggle ideology and strange ideas infect our society.

*** Lol, imagine magic world politics being as shit as modern politics. Slytherin students playing the victim and claiming Griffindor clothes are triggering and fear-spreading and evil. And also saying it's ok to do dark magic because morality is subjective because Voldemort probably thought he was the good guy at one point. Hufflepuff teaching their kids feelings trump facts while Ravenclaw teaches their kids science is repeating what the established books say, repeating it for brownie points, and insulting those who don't believe what the books say.

I can't think of anything funny for the Griffindor students. Maybe they'd be the guys who get called privileged bullies by Slytherins because projection.

** None. If it got so bad to the point where almost all families are related, then absolutely you need new blood into the culture.

It doesn't have to be muggleborns, tho. I'll concede that. Pushing for policies that incentivate for foreigner families to come to the British wizarding world would also be a solution. Plenty of people in European countries aren't entirely opposing to moving to another country since they are so close together.
