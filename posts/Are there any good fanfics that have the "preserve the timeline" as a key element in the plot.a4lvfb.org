So a lot of people generally dislike the "preserve the timeline" kind-of fanfics and I can understand that. However, it would be interesting to see if there are any good fanfictions that do this well.


** I'm not very familiar with different fic types in HP, what do you mean by a "preserve the timeline" fanfic?

*** One popular subgenre in HP fanfiction is Peggy Sue or time travel do over where characters get sent back in time for a second chance of sorts.

The two main approaches to this are a) changing as much as possible to gain the biggest possible advantage and resulting in a completely different storyline, or b) preserving the timeline as much as possible while only making minuscule changes so the future knowledge doesn't become irrelevant.

The problem with the second approach is that it usually leads to a very boring story.

**** The other problem with the second approach is that it often stretches plausibility. Harry is interacting with different people in different ways, but he still catches his first snitch in his mouth immediately after his broom is hexed? Really?

My favorite is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past), where he's /trying/ to make changes, but history often seems determined to repeat itself anyway, and he finds it very disturbing. Despite his best efforts, the Dursleys punish him for Dobby's visit, Ginny gets hold of Tom Riddle's diary, Sirius Black is still a fugitive, and Harry is entered into the Triwizard tournament.

***** To me, the worst aspect of the second approach is usually when characters take it to absolutely ludicrous lengths.

Like, I've seen several fics already where Harry first has Pettigrew arrested to free Sirius, then arranges some absurdly complicated scheme to have him escape again so he can resurrect Voldemort in the graveyard, only to then be completely stumped when things don't work out quite as planned and Voldemort manages to regain a full powerbase.

Even worse when he's willing to actually sacrifice human lives just so this stupid plan can work.

I honestly much prefer stories that don't include the Triwizard resurrection and instead have Voldemort return another way.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** I just don't see the point of preserving the timeline kinds of time travel stories. The reason you go back in time is to change things. Save the people that died, that sort of thing. If you're not going to change anything then it's just retreading Canon and we all know how that turns out.

*** Generally, I agree with you. Though the standard do-over fic gets pretty old, pretty quickly. I feel like there could be a way to do a preserve the timeline storyline well, at least in the hands of a creative author.

There was a great Harry time-travels WIP back around 2011-2012 (forget the title) that had the premise that boggarts (or maybe poltergeists? I forget) were actually time-travelers that got themselves caught in paradoxes because they were trying to change their timelines. It was much better than my description, and I was sad that the author took down his/her account because of the 2012 FF purge.

I've read a few fics that explore the existential dread of a person who knows their future/past is already immutably set. "I must do this because I have always done this" scenarios. The one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726291/1/Eternal_Return][Eternal Return]] does it well.

It's most fun in AU fics where the stations of canon barely enter into it, that way the reader is still in suspense about the plot as it happens. For example, I love the way time travel was handled in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lilly and the Art of Being Sisyphus]].

**** There is basically a "time travel fix it" checklist for the standard story which gets old, but then again most stories retread canon so much with just slight changes (different house, raised differently, etc) so it's a wash. That is one reason I like reading crossover fics. That adds some flavor to the stories.
