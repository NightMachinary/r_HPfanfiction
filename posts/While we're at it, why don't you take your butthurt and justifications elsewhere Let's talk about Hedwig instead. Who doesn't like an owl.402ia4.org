FFS how many posts here are going to devolve into DLP bitching or praising? Can we just not? If you're butthurt, take it up there, not here. This is not DLP-extension forums. This is a place for FF rec's, discussion, etc. Can we keep it on topic? Some of us have no fucks to give and don't want to read through 100s of replies to a post that are in no way on topic to the original post.

And since it's for FF recs, here's a rec for an awesome story with HEDWIG as a main character. Because I fucking love Hedwig. Who else loves Hedwig?

** ....Does Anyone else remember Master Eldryn's Harry/Hedwig fic? For those who don't know, to quote nonjon circa 2006:

Harry Potter and the White Owl

#+begin_quote
  Hedwig miraculously turns into a woman. How or why the fic didn't quite get to, but she kept wanting to protect and have sex with her Harry-wizard. She received identical results on her "OWLS" as Harry (though never took them) and they were going to take the same classes then etc... Her 'hands' were clawish and would scratch people insulting her Harry-wizard or girls lusting for him. Didn't get far enough. Diagon Alley and a wand for her was about it.
