  “I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!” Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater
#+end_quote

Narcissa was the only Malfoy who started to redeem themselves. Draco was a racist coward who realized that he didn't have the stomach for killing and yet didn't have the stomach to actually resist. Even at the end, he was still claiming to be a Death Eater. He tried to use an unforgivable on Harry.

I blame the movies for this. People who never read the books loved the Tom Felton and that bathroom scene.

*** Absolutely, he never changed his views, he just never had the balls to follow through with it.

And let's not forget that despite not being able to go through with killing Dumbledore, his necklace came very close to killing Katie Bell, and his bottle of mead nearly killed Ron. Yet he gets his HEA with Astoria and Scorpius.

I will NEVER understand the obsession the fandom has with both Malfoy and Snape.

**** And the way he attacked Katie alone would be enough to lock him up for several lifetimes.

**** Well Astoria and his father died and his son has a crush on Hermione Granger so I wouldn't exactly say he got his HEA...

But he should have been in Azkaban for sure lol.

*** Don't think this is a good point. You are a 17 yr old child, you are scared out of your wits, threatened by a wizard that's older than you that you know will use lethal force or sadistic spells against you, you might not make it out alive if you duel them...you are not going to make a ''stand'' when you could convince them you are on their side and escape to see another day.

**** Yeah, this person sure sounds like someone to glorify all over social media. The example was chosen to show how cowardly he was, and there is a plethora of other evidence to show how despicable Draco is. Has anyone forgotten how he was a racist despite spending most of the year at a school among other people where blood discrimination is frowned upon?

Why not glorify one of the other children at the battle? Colin Creevey, an underage student, fought at the Battle of Hogwarts while underage. He wasn't supposed to be there. It was stupid of him to stay. Colin is still 10 times the person Draco is. If someone who isn't perfect should actually be glorified, it should be him.

Instead, people are choosing to glorify someone who remained an outspoken bigot after growing up in a society where outspoken bigotry is frowned upon and attending school for the majority of 7 years with other muggleborns. He was also a coward, an attempted murderer, and his mother is ten times the person he is.

***** Did I say he is a good person, or to glorify him? Nope. I just said that that one example you gave is not the best one to give as it can be easily countered as "scared 17 yr old saying whatever he could to come on top of the situation".

** Mixed feelings.

I like that the fandom is getting some new blood in it but

1. What tf is up with them thinking they're ''shifting realities''? It's called daydreaming and Draco would probably hate crime them all
2. I've noticed most of these kids think that the fandom is this, or that, or that they discovered some obscure fandom to be it and they're ''reclaiming it'' from millennials. It's very amusing to me...because this fandom is older than most of them. It's got everything and anything and it's definitely wider and larger than they imagine it is.
3. They often base their tiktoks over...vaguely knowing about the character without watching the movies or reading the books. I'm not going to gatekeep tho, let them have fun.

Overall it's funny watching them go through all of the cringey shit I did when I was their age and into the fandom lol

** Just teenagers being teenagers. There will */+always+/* be a new generation of teens who "take over" the HP fandom - or at least the part of the fandom that gets attention from the media - and make these cringy videos.

Have to remember that the majority are teen girls who can't really see Draco as anything other than "misunderstood cute cinnamon roll" or Snape as "misunderstood hot teacher that lost childhood crush - poor baby! -".

HP is a book series aimed at kids-teens after all. But they usually grow up and either forget about about the series or realize how much racism, bigotry and pettiness these characters have - and realise how embarassing these videos were.
