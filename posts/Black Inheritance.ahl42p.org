This isn't a rant, I'm just trying to understand since I've never seen this addressed in fanfiction in a way that makes sense to me.

Am I the only one who thinks that Sirius being the Black Heir is horseshit? Yes, the Blacks are a fairly traditional family. But the timeline just doesn't work. Orion and Walburga die before Arcturus, so I'm guessing Grimmauld Place was given to Orion in effect, but Arcturus still owned the rest of the Black Estate. Sirius is already serving life in Azkaban well before Arcturus dies and Regulus is dead, but Cygnus is still very much alive, meaning he would effectively be the only available male in the line by the time Arcturus dies. If you have Cygnus and a female child of your own (Lucretia) to leave your estate to, why would you leave it to someone who is in prison? I understand people thinking that after Cygnus died the whole Estate passed back to the last male heir of Black name automatically, but that doesn't make any sense either. Why wouldn't Cygnus simply change all the deeds on Black properties so they go to his only grandchild (that he accepts), Draco? Why wouldn't he take as much gold as possible and put in in a trust or in the magical version of a tax haven so the gold would go to Draco or Narcissa? At the very least, I'm sure Cygnus would have hidden anything valuable to pass on his own grandchild.

I'm not an expert on law, but the idea that Sirius would remain Arcturus's heir when both Cygnus still lives puzzles me. I also can't imagine those three (since Pollux dies just before Arcturus) having a whole decade to think about what they are going to do with their Estate since there are no available male heirs after Cygnus and doing absolutely nothing. They had to have imagined that if Sirius died in Azkaban after them, the Black Estate might end up with whoever was in Sirius's will, and why would they want to risk that, even if they believed Sirius murdered those muggles?

I just don't think that Grimmauld Place is the only property in the Black Estate. Walburga is long dead by the time her father, great-uncle, and brother die. If GP was some kind of prime Black Property, why wouldn't one of them have tried to take possession of it or at least keep it in good estate? You don't let your best property fall in disrepair like that, and if it was part of Black Estate, it would have been Cygnus's for at least a year before reverting back to Sirius. But Cygnus never takes possession of it, which makes me imagine that it's not a property anyone in the family coveted.

Anyone has a good explanation? Or are there good fics where this matter is treated in a logical way?


** an explanation:

a lot of the ideas behind there being a "black estate" and there being this far-flung financial empire of real-estate holdings and wealth and whatnot united under the banner of the "black family" is mostly fanon wank

sirius wasnt the "black heir", just the heir to his father and mother, and his parents happened to own the black ancestral home (and a good bit of money besides). harry wasn't the "black heir", just sirius's

*** That's how I've always understood it as well. Also Sirius hated Grimmauld Place so much that he preferred to live in a cave than to go back there, and when he did return, it was only because Dumbledore needed the house for the headquarters. If Sirius owned any other properties, surely he would use them instead.

*** Yeah, I know, but that also isn't very logical. Despite being Arcturus only son, Orion is sort of a loser. I imagine he didn't just marry his first cousin because of her pureblood. Would Arcturus and Pollux really give Orion the Black Ancestral Home and then not fight to get it back from Walburga once she loses both sons if that's THE Black Ancestral Home? I think that if GP was significant, Walburga's father and uncle would have tried to wrestle the place out of her hands once Regulus dies and Sirius is imprisoned.

***** No, she wouldn't have owned it. Either the house would have never become Orion's legally because his father was still alive when Orion died, or it would have been passed down to Sirius when Orion died, not to his wife. Sirius was in prison, so other males in the line could conceivably sue to have the property. That's why I think it's just a minor property Orion had, not the Black Ancestral House that would have gone to Arcturus's heir.

** I think Rowling had in mind the way the traditional aristocratic system in Britain works (see the Royal Family) and the way titles (and along with those, the ancestral seats) were inherited. By tradition, Arcturus's position would have gone to his eldest son first (Orion) then his eldest son's eldest son (Sirius). It is irrelevant that Orion predeceased Arcturus. It would only have moved to another branch of the family if Orion had had no children (or no sons if primogeniture was practised which seems to be the case).

It is inconsistent though, as it seems Sirius had the autonomy to leave Grimmauld Place to Harry rather than it reverting to another branch of the family. So maybe tradition and blood purity was held to be more important by the Black family. There is no title involved. Fics which include 'Lord Black' really set my teeth on edge.

*** I agree with you on the aristocracy point, but the problem is exactly that inconsistency, because titles can't be left to the person of your choice in a will, and even if there isn't a title (and I don't think there is; I also hate Lordship fics), if their inheritance system followed traditional aristocratic systems, anything that ended up belonging to Sirius would be reverted to Draco, despite of Sirius's will. Mostly, I don't think Orion's death is the most important factor, but Sirius's imprisonment is, because it would have removed him from any traditional line of succession. If Charles died, William would still be the next in line. But if Harry died without children, William was sentenced to life in prison and he didn't have children, and then Charles died, the line of succession would be reconfigured. Sirius is a fugitive when he dies, so I can't imagine he regained any legal power. But he takes possession of his home, a house that I would imagine would have been passed down the line once he was sentenced to life in prison. I really don't see why Arcturus or Cygnus couldn't have sought legal recourse to have anything of value removed from Sirius once it's clear the line will end with him and he's in Azkaban. Put it simply, Sirius could be easily removed from any inheritance line because of his sentence, and if it's an issue of last male in line gets to override any claims via will, last male in line would have been Cygnus due to Sirius's legal status.

***** Also, consider the fact that Sirius was never convicted IN A TRIAL. As far as I understand, since it is illegal to imprison someone without a trial, that person technically isn't a criminal--there never being a trial to confirm such. Also (as I understand law), isn't a court order or a search warrant (often to provide the court with evidence) needed to freeze accounts.

No, I think that--yes, Lord Black, etc., is stupid. But because Sirius never had a trial, legally, he never was "oust" from being a contestant for the title (if it ever existed--which it doesn't); which would have gone from Arcturus => Orion => Sirius.

***** No, you're completely right that it's not. And I agree with you that anything that was in his name would have been inaccessible to him in life, but would go to Harry in death. But yes, I do assume he could have lost the right to inherit when he went to prison, but not automatically. When I talk about legal recourse, I mean his grandfather, who was still living in 1990 and would conceivably own GP, trying to change the first male heir rule that would have had everything automatically go to Sirius, since it's assumed Sirius will die without a blood heir.

It wouldn't be about taking property that is already Sirius's away from him, but from making sure, if the rule really is that first male son gets everything, that Arcturus can leave his inheritance to Cygnus (who he couldn't have known would die a year later). I agree that Arcturus probably wouldn't have been able to sue it out of Sirius if he got it from Orion, I made that sound really stupid, and I'm sorry. My curiosity, I guess, stems from the fact that had Orion possessed the deed of the house and had the ability to leave it to Sirius, he wouldn't have. He disinherits Sirius before he dies in 79. If the house always passed to the last male heir, like Dumbledore tells Harry in HPB, I do wonder if Sirius's legal status wouldn't haven't made him ineligible to inherit anything when his grandfather dies.

And this is really long-winded and perhaps still confusing, and I'm sorry (I guess I love Hermione because we both love logical puzzles).

** I personally haven't seen anywhere it is tried to be explained effectively, most of the time the author has Sirius simply say "Arcturus died after my parents and he liked me and never disinherited me, my mother just burnt my face off the tree".

Some ways that I have seen the inheritance fics done, not only the estate fics but also the lordship fics, is that the Black Family as well as other old families (Longbottom's, Potter's etc.), has its own magic that tries to keep to the direct line and chooses those based on how the magic manifested itself.

For example, the Black Family's motto is the manifestation of its magic, the magic would test Sirius as a successor before then looking at the next possible candidate, and based on what you think Cygnus would do, he wouldn't pass, because Toujours Pur really means always pure of heart and actions, not pureblood. For the record, I don't believe that's what the motto means, it's just how I see it done.

But as others have said in the past, it's basically just a way of making Harry overpowered in all possible facets, magically, financially, politically etc. allowing him to take 10 Lordships and beat Voldemort.

*** Yeah, I've seen it explained that way as well, but Arcturus liking him would be a bit irrelevant if Arcturus thought Sirius would be pissing himself for the rest of his life in prison.

I think the magic thing is interesting, but there are potentially too many plot holes. So Cygnus isn't pure of heart, but Sirius, who nearly killed a kid through a prank, is pure? It's the pure of heart thing basically not being a bigot? Because we know that Sirius isn't always kind. I think an unique, magical system that isn't tied to Sirius legal status would be an interesting explanation, but I can't think of a good, logical system, to be honest.

I agree that Black inheritance is really overused in OP Harry fics, but I see it come up in other fics as well. I read a lot of fic about the Black sisters and I've rarely seen Narcissa inherit anything from Cygnus (unless she divorces Lucius; then miraculously, she is in charge of the Black Estate). I've never seen a fic where Lucius and Narcissa try to bribe the Ministry to declare Sirius legally incapable of inheriting so Draco gets anything of value from the Black Estate, for example, and though Lucius is filthy rich, you'd think he'd want anything of value that he felt his kid was entitled to, no? I just find it really weird that in a family that so obsessed with their tradition and status, no one, not even the greedy ones like Lucius, would put up a fight to get a house that has been in the family for centuries. Either GP was a garbage place no one cared about, or both canon and fanon haven't explained very well how Harry ends up with it.

**** Most fics going Arcturus liked him route seems to have Arcturus aiming to get him out of Azkaban., the ones I have seen at least.

Yeah, you're right, there are too many plotholes, that's why a lot of fics that include it don't explain it well. There is not really a logical situation because magic seems to me to be the only answer, which is inherently difficult to understand in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Perhaps the Ministry of Magic could have laws saying that family estates are determined by the head of the family or family as a whole, the legal status not in question. In your original post, you have literally covered every possible reason why it would make no sense as to why Sirius would be heir.

I think GP became a garbage place no one cared about because they all thought Walburga was crazy. Cygnus for all we know could have been like Alphard, and liked Sirius and wanted him to be the head of the family. Narcissa isn't likely to care as she always appeared to me more Malfoy than Black and also she is the youngest of 3, but I certainly agree that Lucius would like to get his greedy little mitts on the estate, not just GP.

The best way to explain Harry getting it was the fact that the fandom had reason to believe that Harry was the Grandson of Charlus & Dorea Potter nee Black, but Pottermore changed that to Fleamont & Euphemia. Some writers still use the former.

***** Oh, I don't think I've read any of those. I've read a couple where Arcturus is still alive when is cleared, but never Arcturus being the one to do it. That's actually interesting, though it would still be weird for him to pass without a viable heir, at least that makes more sense.

Well, Cygnus disinherited Andromeda and while Sirius still got some money, Andromeda got nothing. I guess that always gave me the impression that he was pretty strict about purity as well. It could be that with Bella in prison, Andie gone, and Narcissa married well, he didn't care much what happened to the Black property or Black legacy, but that would mean he was very different than most people in the family. I think Lucius and Narcissa might not care for any of the Black properties, but if they felt Draco was entitled to it, they would certainly fight for it. Entitlement was a huge part of their personalities. At the very least, I imagine Lucius would want any dark artifacts or rare books that were in the family, but I think they would also deem that anything else was rightfully theirs.

I believed that for a while as well, but I don't think that would make much sense. Dorea was supposed to be Pollux's sister, so she was on Narcissa's side of the line. That would make Draco's claim stronger than Harry's.

I really think that most logical explanation would be for GP not to be all that important in the first place, and Sirius not having inherited anything of importance at all. But that does run counter what Dumbledore tells Harry about Sirius being the last male heir, so ...

** This really depends on if you believe Magical Houses and Lordships are a thing. If they are, there is a Noble and Ancient House of Black, with a title, money, and properties. The properties of this family could be entailed to only pass down to male heirs of the family, which would mean Sirius would slowly inherit everything after the death of his older family members. There may have been inheritance law preventing Cygnus from passing anything down to non-Black grandchildren. This is all conjecture of course.

I don't think Noble Houses and Lordships actually exist in canon. I think Sirius was mocking his family when he referred to it as the "noble and ancient house." It may have made more sense for his parents to own the bulk of the Black properties compared to any of his aunts and uncles since his parents were both Blacks. Whatever Sirius inherited was first owned to some extent by his parents. I don't think GP is the only property in the Estate either, it was just the most viable for him to offer to the Order due to its location. It's possible that the other properties were not owned by his parents and passed down to him, or that they were unsuitable to be Headquarters (ex: too publicly known, charms preventing non pureblood from entering, in disrepair, etc.).

It is also unclear what being disowned/blasted off the tapestry means in the Black family. Some fics have it where Sirius wasn't really disowned because he was the male heir, but that he assumed he was. Sirius could have just been removed from inheriting anything in the family estate, but was able to inherit his parents' property. Walburga may have been insane when she died and had not changed her will that gave anything to surviving children

** In some more Germanic law, you cannot disinherit your child. It could be that the wizarding society's law is based on that. In English law, you can disinherit your child, but it requires a lot of formalities, and if the child is a minor or is an adult who cannot support themselves, they can still lay claim against your inheritance. As Sirius cannot support himself in prison, he would stand to inherit a bit. In both these cases, the best way to make sure that the person you wish to inherit, is given your estate before you die. In Sirius' case, this could for example mean already telling the goblins to transfer his entire estate to Harry in name, and continue using it in his position of being Harry's guardian.

Is there anywhere said that Arcturus actually supports Voldemort? Yes, he obviously supported the pureblood belief, but did he recognize Voldie as his master?\\
Because I don't think so. That being said, he wouldn't be happy with Malfoy submitting himself to Voldie. I like to believe that while he didn't share the same believes as Sirius, he was the only Black he still respected at the end, because he didn't submit himself to another master and was still an independent Black.

*** No, there isn't. Counter question: if it's not a matter of Sirius simply being the default heir but a matter of Arcturus wanting to leave his money to someone he respects, and he doesn't respect anyone involved that believes in purity, why the hell wouldn't he leave it to his daughter, who married a pureblood and was still alive at the time?

It's fine if you think Arcturus hated Cygnus or Lucius for some reason. But I don't see Sirius being the only person he would like or respect, unless you mean the only man in the family he respected. But that's implying Arcturus agreed with Sirius's politics but didn't respect Ignatius Prewett, and we don't know what kind of person Prewett was, but Sirius was openly friends with muggleborns and werewolves. I mean if you want an heir who you respect who will not further the Black name, at least Lucretia and her husband weren't in prison.

Sirius is the heir not because Arcturus likes him personally, but because the family cares about their legacy and the continuation of the Black name (via male heirs). Sirius couldn't continue the Black name from Azkaban, so whether Arcturus liked him was irrelevant.

** Aright so Arcturus is not that closely related to Cygnus Black. They are rather distant cousins with the same surname. Secondly when Arcturus dies, yes Sirius is in Azkaban and cannot use any of the Black fortune or estates but Arcturus doesn't know what will happen! Maybe Sirius will be released on compassionate grounds or is freed after a coup. He did escape and his inherited wealth sheltered him quite well!

The big thing is that Arcturus is a non entity we know nothing about his motivation. Maybe he dislike Cygnus to the point that he wanted to spite him by placing the fortune outside of his reach for another decade. Maybe he just didn't care, all his family are dead or in prison. He is a pure blood without a bloodline.

Now you might be thInking about an estate entail which can occur in some estates where certain property and privileges are attached to a title of a certain process of inheritance. This is now widely illegal as it is seen as controlling beyond the grave.

No title required. Fee tail was just another form of property ownership, like fee simple (aka freehold). Before it was abolished, anyone could pass property on to their heirs as a fee tail, no title or even grand estate required. You could have done it with a 1 bedroom studio apartment if you wanted.

**** Yeah I know my family farm was stuck with it for a while. I was thinking more of the Downton abbey storyline...

*** Well, yes, I know they are not that closely related, but the books stating that Sirius got the property because he was the last male heir makes me think that being male and carrying the Black name especially was very important to the whole family. With Sirius in prison and unable to have an heir and pass the name along, Cygnus would really be only male Black carrying the name living by the time Arcturus dies, and Narcissa is conceivably the only person who could have a male grandchild who could take on the Black name.

Arcturus thinking Sirius would ever leave Azkaban would be crazy. The reason why it was shocking when Sirius did it was because it had never been (publicly) done. And there's no real explanation in the books about how Sirius is able to access his wealth while on the run (not even a 'Goblins don't care that I'm a fugitive'). If Arcturus disliked Cygnus very much, I could imagine him refusing to change the rules making everything of his go to Sirius, but Cygnus would have a decade to try to get the inheritance through legal or very underhanded ways.

**** And yet Sirius did get out and the property served him well. Sirius was the first to “publicly” break out, maybe Arcturus knew of other cases beforehand. He might have been released if there was a regime change. Think about all the people who came out of the gulags and camps in other countries. You don't know what could happen!

If Arcturus does not Cygnus then he is not going to give him everything just because one of his grandchildren might take his name. They would do it for Cygnus's money. Besides of his three daughter at the time of Arcturus's death 1 is also in Azkaban another is a blood traitor with a teenage daughter and the last one has only 1 son and no sign of others. Hardly as promising as you make them out to be.

Yes Cygnus would have all the time in the world to scheme the money but if Arcturus doesn't like him then forcing him to spend time and money on something he could have gotten for free would be very satisfying.

** The idea that pureblood families function as an aristocracy is a purely fanon idea. They may be rich, but that's about all they have going for them. Other magical families (the Weasleys, the Potters, the Diggorys, the Lovegoods) are shown as just normal families in terms of structure and political influence. There is really no mention of anyone having an “heir” in the sense that fanon tends to think of. (Heir of Slytherin is its own thing, and has nothing to do with aristocracy). Fics that talk about 11 years olds being manor lords or whatever are really grating, since the only mention of a “lord” is with Voldemort, and it's just a title he made himself. Lucius is never referred to as “Lord Malfoy,” it's always Mister. With the Black family, I don't think that “the most ancient and noble house” is supposed to be taken as literally as fanon has taken it (“house potter” for example). These aren't houses, they're just families. Considering that Sirius was blasted off the family tree I think it's definitely likely that the wealth of the Black family was passed on to Draco. However, I also think that people overestimate how much money pureblood families have. They're rich, sure, but they don't have trillions of galleons or whatever like in fanfiction. I imagine that the amount Draco hypothetically inherited was comparable to the amount of money a trust fund kid would have in the muggle world.

** I always assumed that after Sirius's arrest, the Black family was overjoyed that he'd finally chosen the right side, and wrote him back into their wills. Sirius was never actually sentenced to life in prison, he was just thrown in prison, so his family may have assumed he'd be getting out later, especially if some new pureblood supremacist administration took over the Ministry and freed the heroic, wrongfully imprisoned Death Eaters.

** I wonder if the fact that Sirius didn't get a trial had anything to do with it all, he was never convicted of a crime, just thrown in jail. Now, of course, everyone thought he was guilty, but I don't know.. though I also wonder why Arcturus Black would sit and do nothing for 10 years if the person he had named heir didn't get a trial.

** I think A Marauder's Plan explained the inheritance well. His grandfather recognized that Sirius's parents are batshit insane and made Sirius his heir instead of his parents. He did support the pureblood mantra but he recognized Voldie for what he is, a psycho who's only out for himself.

Further he realized that Sirius was innocent, but refrained from forcing a trial because of a prophecy. Don't want to spoil more at this point.
