** The Weasleys were likely there from the start, and Hermione's arrival could be anytime in July.

** They were already there. Harry gets letters from them saying they were 'quite busy.' Harry was so irritated by those responses that it says he threw away their birthday presents. He asks them when he gets to Grimmauld Place and they explain they've been cleaning. So, they've been there since before Harry's birthday working on the house.

** I think the Weasleys moved to Grimmauld place as soon as the bedrooms got cleared. They would've been spending their days there even before this though. Not clue when Hermione showed up, we just know at some point Harry got the impression they were together so use your own discretion.

** I honestly don't know the answer to your question. But just a heads-up for post-OOTP fics, please do not include an entire chapter about Harry going to buy muggle clothes and hesding to Diagon Alley for a trunk...

*** I limited that to a single scene, but thanks for the heads up, the Harry in my fic actually inherits very little from his Parents so has to be a bit frugal with the way he spends it. linkffn(Adversity Breeds Excellence) if you're curious.

** Sirius says he's been stuck inside a month at (I believe) the beginning of August so it's likely been that long.
