It wasn't the main focus of the plot, but I remember reading a fic in which someone manages to redeem the part of Voldemort in the diary horcrux- at first with appeals to consequences ("being a Dark Lord is what got you killed before!"), but later with moral arguments.

Also, a Dragon entered into the process somewhere. My memory is sketchy on this.
