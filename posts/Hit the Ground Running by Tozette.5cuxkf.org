** I think she couldn't take having to read and delete a certain brand of comments (blatantly racist, misogynist, pro-fascist) anymore, so she took down the story that was attracting them. Which, yeah, I can understand that. She doesn't seem to mind other people sharing the story among themselves, so we can still enjoy it.
