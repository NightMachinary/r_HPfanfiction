Just finished linkffn(12311860) thank to a recommendation here and I'm looking for more Draco/Harry friendship stories. I find them hard to find, most stories are slash and that's not what I'm looking for. Good Drarry friendship stories where Harry is still in Gryffindor, maybe the Malfoy's disown Draco like in Old Scars. Any pairing is fine, as long as there is no Drarry slash. Can follow canon or not, as long as one of the main plots is the Drarry friendship. And please don't recommend â€˜they shook hands'

Over 80k wording please!


** I thought that term Drarry is used only for slash fics, and people usually just say Harry and Draco friendship, but I might be wrong. Most stories I know are Harry in Slytherin fics: linkffn(8666085), linkffn(6518287), linkffn(9622538), linkffn(3446796), linkffn(12022253) and Out of the Night by Raining Ink

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.

** I enjoyed The Redemption Series by FarenMaddox. I read them out of order, and it really does make a difference! [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3662420/1/Save-Me][Save Me]] is the first one, followed by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3701756/1/Brothers-and-Sons][Brothers and Sons]], and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3801134/1/A-Foreign-Language][A Foreign Language]]. Three shorter fics finish off the series: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3934136/1/A-Few-of-Our-Favorite-Things][A Few of Our Favorite Things]], followed by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3975880/1/I-Am-Gryffindor-s-Daughter][I Am Gryffindor's Daughter]] and finally [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4020080/1/Until-the-End][Until the End]].

I loved the series. The exploration of relationships and what family really means was both heartwrenching and heartwarming at different times, and the storylines really drew me in.
