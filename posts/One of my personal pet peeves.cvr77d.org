Our indy harry realizes how rotten and worthless Britain is and moves the thr heaven on earth which is the united states where people thinks he has a cool accents and people can't believe how retarded Europeans wizards are huehue. It just screams American teenage writer to me and its so annoying whenever I see it being used. For some reason the only "good" place harry can live his life is America for some reason. Oh sorry I forgot that he usually moves there with Sirius where his dogfather gets all the ladies as well


** It gets annoying quickly. Even more unrealistic is the school/country right next door that is super duper better. Right. I kind of like fics where basically every country or place has its own problems or some stuff is better or just different. A good example is 'for love of magic'. Britain sucks but across the pond sucks in a very different way and every other country probably sucks as well. It is on of the things I dislike in 'the Prince of Slytherin' where India is kind of portrayed as being better.

*** In PoS, India or to be specific, Shamballa is portrayed as better about the blood purism thing, and the Parselmouth thing too. The reason British hate Parselmouths was already explained. TSM has also dropped some solid hints on why the blood purism hatred persists.

Shamballa will ofc have its own problems. Healer Bhaskar mentions some Dark Lady who wanted to unleash the zombie plague or something.

** Personally, I always imagined that all the magical countries of the world have their well known ups and their hidden downs.

Obviously, characters will be well aware of their own countries flaws, but only hear about the good things from others. It would be a interesting story for Harry to visit America say, and have the curtain slowly lifted.

I'll admit I'm actually surprised at how little America pops up given the potential numbers of fanfic writers that would come from there. On the other hand, I feel that Australia has appeared much more often than I would have expected (not counting stories involving Hermione retrieving her parents).

What I mean is that even /excluding/ the stories that refer to her picking up her folks in Australia, there's still quite a bit of mentions of Australia in HP fanfics. I don't know if I'd say it appears more often than America (/especially/ not if we include crossovers with the Magical Beasts films), but considering that the Australian HP fanfic community is (presumably) much smaller than the American one, Australia appears to get an outsized number of references in HP fanfiction.

** It's just another expression of what I'd call world bashing.

A good author looks at a world and asks himself: why is something the way it is.

A bad author looks at the same world and says to himself: that's stupid. It should be like this!

** A lot of people may take Magical America as some form of paradise because a lot of people say it is, so therefore they'll overexaggerate the good parts of it, others may simply be to patriotic and say that it is better than it really is. it's quite average and for most fics that paint Magic Britain as horrible find it easier and a bit more believable to put him in America than to put him in, say, Nigeria or Belgrade, or Arabia where they'll most likely have him speak another language, thus making him far more powerful. It's also quite far away from Britain, and a obvious place to run to if you're running from a country. A lo of people imagine Sirius as the person who tries to sleep around as often as possible, so why not keep doing that in a place where most of their music brags about doing that very same thing.

*** I mean. They speak English in Nigeria. And in India. And also, Canada is right there and probably easier to deal with than America logistically speaking, just because still in the Commonwealth...

I want a Harry Potter Goes To Canada fic now.

** I personally would like to see one where instead of running off with his tail between his legs he crushes his opposition and changes the 'rotten and worthless' world of Magical Britain.

But if he has to run off I think it would make more sense to go to Australia or somewhere so far off the grid that nobody would think to look for him there.
