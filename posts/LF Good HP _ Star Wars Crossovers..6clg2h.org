Although, if you've read one star wars crossover, you've read them all. Harry is saved from the Dursleys and raised as a jedi, but has to return to hogwarts at some point because reasons (bonus points for FTL owls) and kills voldemort with a combination of magic, force and lightsaber. That's pretty much how they all go.
