Help, I think I've been punked by fanon. I can't for the life of me remember Bellatrix's canon characterization. I think maybe originally she wasn't particularly insane (i.e. removed from reality), but rather just masochistic, with objectionable ideas like "Death Eaters are great and I want to sleep with my boss." But I've read so many stories where she ranges from completely insane (not in touch with reality at all) to insane with bouts of lucidity, to considered "insane" but she's actually a Seer who talks obliquely and all of the other characters are like "lol can't understand her, she must be crazy."

So here are my questions:

1. How sane/insane is Bellatrix in canon?
2. How flirtatious with Voldemort is Bellatrix in canon (DISREGARDING the CC idea that she had his baby...)
3. What is the basis for the fanon "Black Family Madness" in canon? I don't think anyone calls it that, but are behaviors like chopping off house elf heads framed as bigotry or insanity originally? I think it's the former but fanon often goes with the latter.


** She's really more of an utterly sadistic monster who seems fully aware of what's she's doing and has done. She taunts Neville about his parents and has no qualms over murdering her niece

** She's not legally insane: she fully understands the nature and quality of her actions.

She doesn't come off as mentally ill much, either; gleefully murderous, cheerfully violent, bigoted even by the prevailing standards of bigotry and fanatically devoted to Voldemort. You /might/ make a case for a touch of hypomania when she's got the prospect of a fight in front of her, but that could just be an attempt to /provoke/ her opponent to get a fight going. (The desire to get in a fight could also be suicidal ideation, something like the warrior-culture ideal of seeking a beautiful death. Which makes it /entirely/ appropriate that she gets surprise-ganked by a maternally outraged housewife.)

She's entirely rational, just reasoning from absurd premises to morally objectionable conclusions.

*** Yes!! Thank you, this is the quality answer/analysis I was looking for. Even distinguishing between legal sanity and mental ilness... you've brought a single tear to my eye.

But yeah, agreed. All her cutesy taunts and sneers come across as more calculated to provoke than just someone ranting and raving.

Thanks for the thought-provoking response.

Also I'm realizing, if anything, the Blacks have less "madness" than most if both Sirius and Bellatrix retained mental capacity after over a decade in Azkaban. Hmm

**** Canon don't really show the effects of Azkaban on wizards though. We never really saw "how" the wizards where before Azkaban (except limited scenes like the Lestranges and Crouch trial), so we can't really judge how it changed them.

Yet, all the Wizards we saw that went into Azkaban were at least functional once inside. They look like shit, but they all seem to do the job.

Also Sirius said himself that the knowledge he was innocent helped him cope with the prison, since it was not an happy thought and Dementor couldn't take it away. Make me wonder if the adoration of the Death Eater for Voldemort, and the belief that they are cleaning the world didn't help them.

**** That's not mental illness though, is it? It's a personality disorder. And, bluntly, the level of subordination to Voldemort and the hot-blooded behaviour she displays both /aren't/ psychopath traits. Antisocial Personality Disorder /might/ work, but again, there's that adherence to a goal external to herself. You could make the argument that measured against the culture in which she was raised, she's perfectly mentally healthy with a socially-conforming personality. It's just that that culture is morally obnoxious and a /fine/ argument for heavy-handed cultural imperialism on the William Henry Sleeman model.

(My own headcanon is that she's the one Death Eater who really was enthralled in some way. That personality she displays is /not/ natural, especially coming from a family that produced a refined society lady (and loving, if not healthily nurturing, mother) and a teenage rebel who eloped with her schooldays sweetheart.)

Depending on who you talk to, personality disorders could qualify as a kind of mental illness, but now we're just arguing semantics.

** 1) As other said before, she had a little of issue but "insanity" (as in the legal term) was not among them.

2) I'm not even sure we can call this "flirtatious". You can "sense" her adoration for Voldemort (like in the way she looked at him, or how she was talking in his presence), but yet she always stayed extremely respectfull, calling him "My Lord" and keeping some distance. The only time she fails is after Voldemort kills Harry when she calls to him "/as if he was a lover/". On this point their relation is totally one of Master/ Servant than true lover (even if admitting CC existed).

3) I don't really know where the "black familly madness" comes from (probably Walburga portrait, plus Bellatrix and to a lesser extent Sirius). But the house elf heads was never really comented in Canon, we know Sirius had a profond distate for it (like the rest of the house), that Hermione consider it barbaric, and that Kreature, as the elves serving the Black before him, consider it as the highest honor.

In the end I don't think the Black family was really "mad", extremely bigoted yes, maybe some issues from inbreding (they did seem to die young), but not mad. Most of them (Narcissa, Andromeda or even Regulus) seemed fine, and the only 3 that could be presented as crazy are Bellatrix, Sirius and Walburga. 2 of them have the excuse of years in Azkaban, and Walburga was only one person, and could have been different when she was alive (not to mention the theories about the Horcruxe corrupting the house).

*** I always interpreted her dedication to Voldemort as less lust/romantic desire and more borderline religious fervor.

**** I think it's the same for most of the "loyal" Death Eater that went to Azkaban for him, Barty Crouch also gave a similar vibe. Honnestly, it is just that line of Bellatrix calling to his master "/as if he was a lover"/ the blure the line a little in her case. But even if she had some "feelings" for him, doesn't change that she is a fanatic and him a cult leader.

**** Well, it was strongly suggested in DH and later confirmed by Rowling that it was an "obsessive love" and "sexual attraction" so...

The Black family as a whole was off. One decapitated heads and Sirius mother made a ranting portrait.

** She's not really that insane - that idea emerged mostly after Helena Bonham Carter's exaggerated portrayal in the films. Canon Bellatrix doesn't sing, jump up and down or run on the tables. She knows perfectly well what's going on around her. She's a bit unhinged and has serious anger issues, but besides that, she appears quite sane.

Whatever you like CC or not it is a known canon fact that she has hots for Voldy. It is clearly shown in the Deathly Hallows book, where she "longs for his closeness", "speaks as if to a lover", looks at him with "worshipful fascination", pants whenever he's nearby... Yeah, it's pretty blatant. It's a lot less obvious in the films where for some reason she seems very flirtatious in general - which, may I add, is completely different from book Bellatrix's behaviour.

As for the Blacks, I don't recall them being particularly insane. Not more than other pure-blood families (sans the Weasleys). The Gaunts are much more freaky than the Black family.

** 1. Before or after Azkaban? And what do you mean by insane? Somebody who tortures two other human beings to insanity (and once more Hermione, not to insanity, Dobby stops her, but enough, so that we have no doubts) is plenty insane for me.
2. I don't think there is any clear innuendo or something, but yes she is hitting (in the chapter 1 of DH and then in the end in the Forbidden Forest) on Moldieshort quite hard.
3. Probably none. Both her and Sirius were a bit mad ... but that doesn't have to be a family trait. Twelve or fourteen years in Azkaban does it for you just fine.
