** Here you go: linkffn(8670912). This one's fairly good. It doesn't get to the alchemy right off the bat, but it does become one of Harry's main skills. It's got two sequels and is currently receiving regular updates.

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.
