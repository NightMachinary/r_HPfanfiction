The best written I've seen is

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11914698/chapters/26923794][Renascentia from the ashes]]

My all time favorite for Sirius and Regulus characterizations and interactions too. Amazingly well written it kind of ruins you for other fics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21414103/chapters/51019765][The code by Arduro]]

I really enjoy this one and it's not a common brotp and I always appreciate that

Both of these are also on ff.net

Special mention to [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of a Dark Kingdom]]

I remember really liking it when I read it but it's been a few years and I haven't re read recently .

So what are yours?

Anything goes including slash and femslash!

** linkffn(Green Girl by Colubrina) is I think the best written fic I've read. Certainly it springs immediately to mind as a rec. Hermione is sorted to Slytherin and things don't go as you'd expect. It's about societal expectations, prejudice and malice and it's wonderful. It never loses pacing and the outcomes are narratively satisfying even when they aren't nice.

** I really liked linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens) and next 3 books. Not as cringy as it may sound. Knowledge of wh40k lore not required but it helps.

Like author says in a/n for chapter 4 - "(...) Instead of having a character who could easily hide among the normal population and cause utter mayhem behind the scences, I've got a character who has got to plan very carefully what he does to further his aims.

(...)

My Inquisitor!Harry is most definetly overpowered for the problems the wizarding world is faced with. It's a bit like using a pile-driver to crush a nut. He is going to have to be very careful and restrained in how he uses his strength and knowlege so that he doesn't destroy what he is trying to manipulate. "

** My favorite would have to be linkffn(The Nightmare Man by Tiro). The prequel and the sequel were very well-written as well in my opinion. I've also read many of the stories that Tiro has posted and I enjoyed them.

Another I enjoyed was linkffn(The Guile and Devotion of a Black Heir by StarLight Massacre). It's currently a WIP, but it's still well-written nonetheless.

My taste in fanfiction for HP tends to lean towards character bashing, so that's also a reason I enjoyed these two creators and their stories. I would recommend more, but I'm not sure how much bashing would be welcome, so I only recommended these two.

** I will start with the last one I have finished, it is polished but not perfect, Unsphere the stars, Tomione and the best fic in the genre. linkffn(7728303). The second one is Six pomegranate seeds, which is very well written. Timetravel-fic linkffn(12132374) Both of the above are Hermione centric.

I would say The changeling is my favourite Ginny characterization in all the fandom, is still ongoing but the main story is finished and can be read as a standalone. linkffn(6919395) it is obviously Ginny centric.

So last but not least is a WIP that is very touching and sweet, the story was recently updated so it is alive but tends to update only once a year or so. linkffn(11111990) post hogwarts Harry eats lunch in a muggle coffee shop.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.
