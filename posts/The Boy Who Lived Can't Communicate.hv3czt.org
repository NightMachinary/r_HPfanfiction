A lifetime of bullying can have some serious consequences in regards to a child's social development.

For Harry Potter, it pretty much destroyed his communicative abilities, leaving him cripplingly shy and socially awkward.

Thrust into a world where he's famous and people actually want to be around him Harry's in for a wild ride!

Pretty much, Harry Develops a Komi-Like personality thanks to his upbringing.


** But the real question is, "does he sprung magic cat ears when he's excited?" XD

*** Yes, everyone thinks it's weird accidental magic.

The same thing starts happening with Hermione after the Polyjuice incident, making the Bookish Muggleborn wonder about that excuse.

*** Thanks, it actually spawned off from a "Harry ends up as a creepy child" idea I had a long time ago!

  Harriet Potter finds a trunk in her Aunt and Uncle's attic and finds a book called the Marauders Compendium along with her mother's diary. And from that, she learns way too much about potions...In which, Harriet Potter is the Neville Longbottom in this universe, and she learns how to prank fantastically well. And uh, Neville Longbottom is off saving the world and what-have-you. (We don't really focus on him that much.)

** Oh man, as if Harry didn't have enough problems as is. Piling onto him even more social anxiety than he has canonically might be too much, I think. However, in a comedic setting, this could work very well.

** Maybe linkffn(The life he leads)? He isn't the BWL and neither is he particularly famous, but he does have problems with social interactions.
