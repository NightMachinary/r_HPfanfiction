Apparently I'm in an angsty mood today. Appreciate recommendations for well written, complex, preferably POV Peter Pettigrew. Does it exist?

I've seen sympathetic childhood/young adult Peter. I've seen evil, always conniving Peter who always resented his friends. What I would love to read is anything from his point of view around the time he's turning traitor. He doesn't have to be very likable (in fact: fuck that), but I do want to see complexity behind his many terrible decisions. Not: Sirius made fun of me that one time, so I'll set him up for murder and kill twelve people while at it.

Edit: and because it's likely to be rec'd, I've read Age of Lies. Thanks!


** Age of Lies is amazing! The only other one I can think of that has his point of view and makes him into a complex character is this one: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]])

Unfortunately it has about eight other chracter's points of view as well, is quite long and a (frequently updating) work-in-progress, so it might not be what you're looking for. It follows the first Order of the Phoenx and it has subplots where Peter is really important.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

** Pettigrew's character is complex in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), and while he isn't the main character, he's an important supporting character and narrates on occasion.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** We know from early in the books that Voldemort tried to recruit Lily, so the Death Eaters or Voldemort's other forces were willing to admit valuable muggle-borns, though most of Voldemort's subordinates wanted them purged.

We're never told Peter's blood-status in the books but my head canon is that he was a muggleborn who thought Voldemort was sure to win (they supposedly had the Ministry on the ropes and outnumbered the Order 20:1) and that the only way he would survive in the new order was to be valuable Voldemort. Maybe he'd turn over some potential threats to protect himself and his immediate family. Maybe he thought there was no other choice.

It would also explain why, despite being an instrumental player in Voldemort's revival and a fairly competent wizard (rare animagus, and helped make the Marauder's Map so likely highly skilled in transfiguration and charms) virtually every Death Eater we've seen holds him in utter contempt and he's at the bottom of the totem pole.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
