Hello reddit, I was wondering if anybody knew of any good fic's where Draco and Hermione become good friends/like siblings?\\
I've read plenty of Dramione fics, and would like to branch on to this.\\
I don't mind when it happens, how it happens. I don't mind if its time travel, AU, or anything, just them being really good mates.

Thanks a bundle!


** Try the Dangerverse Series, by whydoyouneedtoknow. :) I'd highly recommend it (it's AU) and four of the 5 books are completed; the 5th is getting there,and updates regularly. :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2109424/1/Living-with-Danger]]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When A Lioness Fights]] by kayly silverstorm has Hermione and Draco as close friends. Eventually Severus/Hermione and Harry/Draco pre-slash.

Summary: /Hermione Granger, master spy, and Severus Snape, spymaster to the Order. An unlikely partnership, forged to defeat the Dark Lord on his own ground. But to do so, they must confront their own darkness within. Spying, torture, angst and love. AU after fifth/
