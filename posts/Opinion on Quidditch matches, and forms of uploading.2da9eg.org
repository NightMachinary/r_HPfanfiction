** I've written two stories that focus entirely on quiddtich, and a third where quidditch is a major plot point. I would highly, highly, highly suggest avoiding writing quidditch at all unless you have an extensive background in sports. And honestly, that background should probably be hockey. And I pick hockey for a reason here. Hockey is played with almost the same amount of players delineated into similar roles but more importantly is an incredibly uptempo game. I suspect there's nearly constant motion involved with quidditch, and that is very hard to convey in writing.

My matches are almost entirely portrayed through dialogue from an announcer. It's intentionally done in a staccato tone and I try to make it hectic, a la Doc Emrick announcing a hockey game. The announcing follows the quaffle, and players react around that, like it would be in an actual game.

Sometimes I cut away and follow a specific players thoughts through a few plays. But it's important to remember then that when you cut back to the game as a whole, the situation is different than when you left it.

But really, if you do not understand sports and how sports are presented to a general audience. You will not be able to write it. You're already hamstrung by the fact that quidditch, as it's presented in the series, is a ridiculously stupid game. The seeker is far too important. This leads directly to why people dislike reading quidditch. Because they feel all that really matters is the last sentence of whomever catches the golden ball. And they're right. I've said in other posts that quidditch would be a much better game if it were played without seekers.

Writing quidditch is a daunting task. It's also very difficult to make one match sound different from another. So, unless you plan on it being a very major plot point, I suggest avoiding it.

As for your last point, if you put it on the internet it's copyable. I recently had to submit a report to have a work of mine that is only available on ff.net deleted on another website as someone posted it as their own. Thankfully everything is timestamped and it's easy to prove who was first. But in four years of writing fanfiction; I've only had my work blatantly plagiarized a couple of times.

As for 'weekly updates' and what not. Just post stuff when its done. I always advise against compiling anything. If your goal is to get feedback on your writing, it serves absolutely no purpose for you to be sitting on it for fear of people 'expecting quick updates'. The ones expecting quick updates are also the ones that don't provide anything useful. Don't worry about them.

TL;DR: Don't write quidditch. Plagiarism happens but it's rare and you have a time stamp on any work. Post things as soon as they're ready so you get feedback that helps with actual writing.

**** I'm certainly more than willing to give my opinion if you do write one. I just caution a lot of writers against it because most have no knowledge of sports and as such, no idea how to make sports interesting to read.

I wouldn't change the point system, purely because then it's not quidditch and that'll irritate most people that read and result in a lot of unnecessary angry comments.

My only other real suggestion is that when writing it try to make so it doesn't quite read in the same tone as the rest of the fic. Quidditch should be fast-paced, hectic, and confusing. Try to convey that.

** I really would like to read a fic where the Seeker is involved in team strategies, blocking, baiting, distracting, just participating more in the game in general. I feel like maybe that could the difference between a Hogwarts seeker and a pro.

I don't believe so, like [[/u/denarii]] said even ff.net is far from secure. By uploading you're taking a certain risk that someone will try to take your work, though it's pretty rare.

** Most fanfics with quidditch in them screw it up. They spend far, far too much time painting a picture that only a fraction of their readers care about. Personally, I mostly skim those parts even in otherwise well-crafted stories. I think the issue is both in the audience and the writer themselves.

Nowadays, readers haven't ever listened to a radio sportscast. That is how something like this is often written, though. It is almost always a poor imitation. Maybe if you read a lot of sports fiction, novels or manga or such, you've got a good idea of how to do this. Most writers don't. Also remember, JKR didn't write out each and every game in /painful/ detail. Like many fanfic writers do. Have a reason to write games.

Unless you can write a quidditch match literally as well as pro announcers in sports can cast, it is my opinion you shouldn't write a match based on that idea. JKR really shouldn't have used that styling ever, in my opinion, but she had plot-important things to do after those parts. And they were moderately short and to the point. Those plot bits weren't hidden in an announcer's spiel, though, they were described in third person from Harry's point of view, or from that of someone in the audience.

So don't make it about the sport or its stupid, inconsistent rules, or about the color commentary and how very witty it surely is. Make it about how Harry feels about playing, or the rush of the situation itself, or something about brooms. Maybe that will be interesting, because quidditch itself isn't.

--------------

Also, FFN isn't "uncopyable" by anyone who understands the basics of how HTML works. Or can download an app that was written by someone who does. Scraping is already against the TOS, and that doesn't stop any sites that do it. So don't be silly about that. No one who cares will be stopped, and no one cares that much. Just post when your stuff is ready wherever you find most convenient, and ignore any complainers.

** I believe JKR mentioned once how tired she was of Quidditch and how happy she was to never have to write another such scene. When I encounter Quidditch in a story, I tend to skim to the end and see who won, who got hurt, whatever plot point was advanced. I'm not interested in the play-by-play at all.

Quidditch very rarely is written well in fanfiction, though there are a few notable exceptions. One that comes to mind is jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]], where the final Quidditch match of his career provides a metaphor for Ron's life and his litany of mistakes.

As for your posting to FFN, I think you're being overly optimistic with regard to the amount of attention your story will get. It's rare (and generally welcomed) for a novice writer to receive an abundance of feedback. /Far/ more common is the opposite--that a writer posts his or her stories and gets only a small handful of readers and even fewer reviewers.

There are no methods of sharing text without it being copyable, period. FFN's measures only stop casual copy and pasting, it's quite easy to circumvent.

** I'm pretty sure that the best way to avoid having your work copied unfairly is to foster a good relationship with the people who read it, rather than acting suspiciously toward them by trying to block their ability to copy/paste (some like to copy passages to share with friends, for one thing). That way, if your work gets copied and put up elsewhere, one of your readers is more likely to let you know if they notice it and you can send a take down request to the site owner.

That just seems more reasonable and productive than to search for ways to block text from being copied.

** The best quidditch centric fic I've read is "A Game of Style and Brutality" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7711029/1/A-Game-of-Style-and-Brutality]]

It's the first time I've cared about a quidditch match since Prisoner of Azkaban.

I love that Harry isn't Mary Sue on a broom. When a high school kid takes the field against veteran pro athletes he gets his ass beat.

** I really don't like quidditch matches... BUT I did write a scene for one in my fic... and then decided to write an injury in so I wouldn't have to write anymore. Some people really like the matches and some don't. You can't please everyone. If you want to write a quidditch match in, go for it. Your readers won't quit reading because one chapter isn't exactly what they wanted.

Keep it short. Follow the action, and if there's no action, there should be no narration. Harry Potter spinning in slow circles on a broom, squinting around to try to spot the Snitch, is boring as hell to watch. It's also 95% of a sensible Seeker's duty. Forget being sensible. Turn it into an adversarial stunt session that ends when someone catches the shiny. Or have the Seekers attempt to help out with the rest of the game when they're not hunting down the gold mosquito.

Maybe just get rid of Seekers. That would be a good start. The bulk of their work is flying around in circles, trying to look everywhere at once, avoiding everything else, whereas everyone else is doing interesting stuff. The total number of goals per game is low enough that it would take a very lopsided match to have one team catch the Snitch without winning, reducing the more spectator-friendly part of the match to an unimportant side show.

FFN is copyable. I have a script that downloads a story from it and converts it to epub format. (And optionally mobi and an all-in-one-page HTML file.) If you want to prevent people from copying your story, don't let them read it. If you want to allow them to read it but not copy it, you could force them to read it on a device that you control. That's not foolproof by any means -- people upload movies to torrent sites that they recorded with a video camera at a theater -- but it's a start.

The only practical option you have for preventing people from copying your story and posting it elsewhere without attributing you is to publish your story as a series of watermarked images, where the watermark contains the attribution information. That would suck, of course -- it's a lot of work for you, and it means it's much more annoying for us to read it.

You could release your work in PDF format, which is annoying to copy and alter but at least can look very attractive. (That is, it's straightforward to copy out the text, but it's a lot more labor-intensive in many cases to keep paragraphs and so forth, and /not/ to have page numbers and headers interleaved with the text.) I use LaTeX when writing, most of the time, and it produces decent stuff by default. It takes some work to make it look awesome, I grant, but you're not going to get anything near as attractive on FFN.

** Unless you enjoy writing them and can make them come alive, and be interesting in their own right, they really need a purpose. Ideally it advances/accomplishes a few things. ex. in canon Quirell/Snape jinx and the ongoing mystery, shows something Harry is naturally good at (and makes him feel more active/alive), gives him something in common with his dad (again a piece of a large puzzle), and arguably shows him tackling obstacles and putting his body and unpracticed skill on the line against greater forces (as he continually has to do throughout the books), and it can set up more interesting leads (being in hospital wing and overhearing something, or being out at an odd time and on an odd floor etc.)

I think a good example of what I mean is if you [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORWPCCzSgu0#t=5m56s][compare the classic Star Wars trilogy vs the prequels]]. While the choreography and 'sword' play is shit the actual battle going on and the deeper meanings of a Vader vs Obi Wan (or Luke vs Vader etc.) battle is miles more captivating (in my opinion) than minutes piled upon minutes of flashy lightsabers slicing through dumb cg robots and aliens (or drawn out the anakin/obi-wan duel for half an hour.) Similarly Quidditch, which is both less loved and iconographic IMO, should be about more than just having a Quidditch match for the mere sake of it or because it's cool.

All this I say in general. If they are a big part of your story then go in peace. In and of themselves they can be interesting and exciting. However a relatively significant portion of readership will just skip to the end (similar to more typical action scenes -which thanks to a Brandon Sanderson lecture series I realized was a thing. My action loving male mind can still hardly believe people do this!)

Also if you want feedback I'd be happy to offer mine (as long as the content isn't overlapping with ideas I have brewing or smut or something).
