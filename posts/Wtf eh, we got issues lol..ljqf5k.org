*** It's a free web serial novel, long and complete, following a young supervillain's career in a dark and gritty superhero setting - a lot of people say it's grimdark but it's not, meaningful changes are made by the protagonists and major figures, and ultimately the end of humanity is averted, albeit at great cost. Well-thought-out setting, realistic and very enjoyable characters, cool fight scenes, some bright spots, some horror, I personally love it.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Here's a link]] if you want to check it out for yourself.

I do find it sort of sad that so much of the fanfiction is nothing like it, though. Some of the authors have never even read Worm which is just.../baffling/, but also probably explains a lot of the flanderization that goes on...

*** A web novel in an alternate take of the superhero genre, centered around the adventures of a teen girl who gains powers in a grimdark alternate reality to ours, where humanity is predicted to die off in the near future due to threats unrelated to superpowered villains, and where things start off bad for the protagonist and never stop getting worse. I make it sound edgy, but it's genuinely really good, and closer to a tragedy than anything else imo.

*** Pretty sure worm is a web serial about superheroes (supervillains? I can't remember anymore). I read a bit years ago. It makes sense that this community would have a lot of the same people cause it's basically the same format and style of literature.

** Reddit used to automatically subscribe people to a bunch of subs when they first created their account. Apps like the one in your OP are creative and interesting, but ultimately doomed to be at least slightly biased because of Reddit's previous decisions.

I'm assuming this is why you don't see more subs like [[/u/minerat27]] suggested.
