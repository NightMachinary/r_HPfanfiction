Greetings.

*Sorry in advance for the wall of text.*

EDIT: Thanks for the quick feedback. I think I'll continue "Stumbled upon Death" since the opinions are mostly positive on this one.

As you can see in the title, I'm in dire need of some opinions. See, I love to write and recently started to write HP fanfics to let loose some stress. Now I'm at a point where I think I could start posting some of it. The problem: I have 5 different stories now, with the shortest being ~5 chapters long. I don't know which one to continue. So, I hope by posting these ideas that some of you pick one for me to continue (or find the idea so rad that they take it and write it themselves. Feel free to do so if anything strikes your fancy.)

*Story1: "Bronze Galleon" Genre: Adventure*

Harry gets kidnapped right after the attack on the Potters in Godrics Hollow. The thief that takes him sells him to a brothel (no child abuse, don't worry) in Bagdad, or as the magical growd knows it, Babylon. He grows up among the prostitutes and finds his best friend among the houseleves of the brothel. They become thieves and commonly known as Bronze and Galleon. Later in their life, with 15, they decide to join the Varangian Guard in Istanbul. Meanwhile the war against Voldemort rages on in Britain, with Neville Longbottom as the boy the prophecy foretold. Dumbledore, due to a lack of options, hires the Varangian Guard and together with the Order they fight the Death Eaters.

*Story2: "Stumbled upon Death" Genre: Horror, Dark!Hermione, OotP*

In Grimmauld Place, after 4th year, the group gets to clean up the place. During their cleaning sessions, they find darkest magic and the books explaining them in the mess that is the Black residence. Even though Molly Weasley hides them well, Hermione manages to find the books and takes a look. Curiosity got the best of her. However, Dark Magic has its ways into ones heart, sooner or later. Hermione tries Summoning and gets tricked into summoning a living Grimoire. A demon that attaches itself to her soul. Its a demon from one of the deepest circles of hell and it teaches Hermione the Art of Necromancy, if she likes it or not.

Normally, Hermione wouldn't use the demons power. She wouldn't even communicate with the dark creature, even though its nature as Grimoire enhances her knowlenge, intelligence and even magic. But Voldemort is reborn and the Order needs every bit of striking power they can get.

*Story3: "Born guilty" Genre: Adventure/Romance, Next-Gen*

Dumbledore always suspected it, but like so many other things, he never mentioned it to his comrades. The old wizard had always suspected that once he and Harry were gone, if Voldemort wins, the dark wizard would need heirs. No sons or daughters, of course. Seconds in command, they would be.

Rowena Bellatrix Riddle knows only the orphanage in Glasgow where she was born. She was different from the other kids in that she never presented herself before adults, prefered reading and outsmarted even older kids easily. However, when the bully she hated most took her teddy, the last thing she got from her original parents, she found that she could do more than just outsmart them.

In an instant, the entirety of the wizards world want this, in their opinion, remaining piece of the cancer they had suffered, removed from the globe. Even within the Order of the Phoenix, people wanted her head on a spike and most of them remained neutral.

Just Hermione Granger believed in the girls chances, adopts her and vows to keep her on the right track. But Voldemort had plans with his offspring and nobody knows if his last malevolent deed could maybe mean the end of wizarding britain.

*Story4: "Helios and Luna" Genre: Adventure/Humor/Romance, Post-Canon / Pre-Epiloge (OC heavy)*

Aurelius Lander, a argentinian upstarting wizard doesn't know what to do with himself after he graduated from Machu Picchu. He gets recruited by the argentinian Ministry as well as many foreign ministries. He gets accepted by Universities and Manufacturers of various magical items. But there are just two letters that peak his interest. Headmistress McGonagall from Hogwarts asks him to teach, and the University of Asgard, legendary even in South America, wants him to continue his projects on Svalbard.

Aurelius decides to do both and finds that he shares this decisions with 4 other people, among them Hermione Granger.

At first sceptical, the british witch accepts his project proposal after a while. A project so unheard of that Hermione Granger just can't decline.

A project to fly to the moon.

*Story5: "The Bloodmoon rises" Dark!Vampire!Hermione, Dark!Vampire!Harry Horror/Romance HBP*

In addition to the Death Eaters, Voldemort also sends vampires into the Battle at the Ministry. Having these additional forces, the Death Eaters easily overpower Dumbledores Army and Hermione and Harry get bitten and die at the hands of the Vampires, just to stand up minutes later, graving blood.

But they get bitten on a dark night, when the moon reflected no light and the sun was weakest. Hermione and Harry consume the blood and flesh of their killers and become, at first sight, feral. Harry can control himself after a relatively short time, but Hermione continues to wreck havoc among the Death Eaters, nearly tearing Bellatrix Lestrange apart in the process.

After the night, Harry lives with the Order and gets forced to keep his sleeping rythm. So he walks the day, clad in black from the toes to the head and tries as hard as he can to hide from the mercyless sun.

Hermione in the meanwhile goes on the hunt and becomes stronger... becomes more. After she consumed 13 people, her call echoes over Europe and wakes the army of an old legend. Vlad the Impaler, also known as Count Dracula, had once commanded them. Battalions of the Undead, Packs of werewolves and the Clans of the Vampires. They all follow the call to the island of Britain, where they would once again serve for a new Count has arisen.

So, yea. I hope the summaries aren't too bad.


** Okay, here's my gut reactions.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  He grows up among the prostitutes
#+end_quote

Bad cliche. Do not want. Skip.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Hermione tries Summoning and gets tricked into summoning a living Grimoire. A demon that attaches itself to her soul.
#+end_quote

Different enough. Not too cliched sounding. Might read this one.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Just Hermione Granger believed in the girls chances, adopts her and vows to keep her on the right track.
#+end_quote

Possibly interesting. Second place so far. Might read, which is more than I can say for most of the usual next-gen, babies-ever-after fics.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  A project to fly to the moon.
#+end_quote

OCs are usually at least -1 point, but this is a relatively original use of one. But...why do we care about or need your OC? Why not just /Hermione Granger and the Trip to the Moon/? This line alone almost saves it, but I'd have to pass because the oddly specific and detailed OC smells like trouble.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  They all follow the call to the island of Britain, where they would once again serve for a new Count has arisen.
#+end_quote

Right, but what's the /conflict/ here? Is Harry not okay with Hermione leading an army of vampires? Are we just Anne Ricing it up, woe is my existence? Might need a second think. Vampires are so overused in general that you really need a strong pitch for why, other than them, one should read the story.

--------------

On review, I think the accidental demon corrupting Hermione is the strongest idea, though the moonshot would be a more original overall story. Maybe take a swing at one of those, then come back and do the Tom's daughter one later.

I also suggest rethinking your use of commas. Some of those sentences were hard to read. Do without whenever possible. They aren't breath marks.

The OC's I use are inspired by aquaintances of mine (Aurelius) in combination with brilliant minds like Nikola Tesla, Marie Curie, Leonardo DaVinci or Alan Turing.

I'm working in science as well and in this story I would try and reflect on and tell about the ridiculousness and stupidity of everyday research, the struggles of pride and the feeling of defeat when your thesis is proven wrong. No self-insert, don't worry ;)

Friend inserts are almost as bad. Then you're building up not merely an idea, but the idea of a friend. You'll add in all those details that /you/ care about and that resonate with you, but they will bore the daylights out of everyone else. And you'll be ticked off no one likes your obviously deep and interesting character you spent so much time on. Other people just won't be in on the jokes or the weirdly specific details, and they'll often be really put off by it.

This is a dangerous almost as great as Mary Sues.

Take inspiration from life, sure, but be careful. Even in original fiction this can lead you down a bad path. Most people seem to read fanfic primarily for the characters they know and love. Mixing any OCs and canon characters is tricky because of this. Even ones based on or inspired by people as iconic as Tesla.

Maybe just write a fic centered on your OC in the Harry Potter universe, and have it be mostly about them. That usually goes over better. People who like those sorts of stories will read them, and those who don't won't try to bare it for the sake of your interesting and original plots.

** For number one, why would a brothel buy a child that's around one years old? Then letting him join a thief group, or do they not know? Also, would Harry know magic and why is there house elves in this brothel? I really like all the premises, and number two, three, and five seem the most interesting to me. Is there any place where I can read them?

Well...

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They know, but don't care. But I should've probably posted the version where he's directly sold to the thieves gang. Now that I read the feedback I kinda got it that the whole prostitute thing is dumb. The brothel is known in Babylon for the variety of prostitutes. From normal women and men, to merpeople and satyr. I wanted him to grow up there and learn the languages and in general teach him to appreciate the other magicals, but then again, why not do that in a gang of thieves? Harry knows about magic but fears for a long time that he isn't gifted with it. He finds out after his first time going out to steal. House Elves in brothels mean clean rooms. Short and simple :D

I haven't posted them yet. Before I post I want to have at least about 20 chapters done (about half of the story). By then I know if I finish them or if I find myself facing a dead end at some point due to, maybe, a plothole I forgot.

** I honestly wouldn't read any of them based off of your descriptions but I encourage you to write them anyways. There have been many a fic I have skipped over because the summary sounded dumb or was something i didn't think would be interesting. After seeing the fics recommended on reddit I went back and read the stories and they were usually good. It's hard to determine how good a fic will be based off the summaries. Just ignore the people that give negative feedback and focus on the constructive feedback.

#+end_quote

What the others said about sex workers, but also, it seems like shoehorning a Harry-in-name-only into the story, even though he has no particular reason to be there; and even if he would be, why would he play an important role, with the grown-ups from the Varangian Guards around?

#+end_quote

By definition, an /heir/ is someone who /inherits/ upon the death of the principal. If Voldemort doesn't plan to die, why would he bother with an heir? Other than that, is he really that desperate for lieutenants that he is willing to wait two decades and expend the effort involved in child-rearing and education to make some?

#+begin_quote

OK, you've really lost me here. No way Voldemort and Bellatrix would give their child a teddy bear. Plush snake or acromantula --- maybe. :P

I like OP!Hermione as much as the next reader, but just dumping an undead army into her lap seems like too much of a good thing. If you want to give her an army, make her /earn/ it, rather than just hand it to her for doing what she needed to do anyway. Also, what, precisely, does she do with that army; what motivations does she have at this point?

#+end_quote

It is difficult to write a story involving sex workers that is respectful and reasonably accurate. It shouldn't be -- don't treat them like victims, objects of contempt, or nymphomaniacs, and just treat them like normal people who work on commission in the service industry. But people have a lot of trouble doing that.

He went to school in Peru. At a well-traveled tourist site. Why did they put their school there? Why doesn't his own country have its own school of magic? Argentina has like 50% more people in it than Great Britain, so it's not a question of population.

Ah, so the protagonist is a genius. That usually doesn't work out well. If you want the protagonist to stomp everyone in sight, or it's more about exploring magic, that's fine, but if there's a person versus person conflict, you'll have to be careful to make them a proper foil.

#+begin_quote

There are three ways to do this. Make Hermione much less intelligent than I think she is; make your OC nearly useless; or have them compete rather than working together.

#+begin_quote
  At first sceptical, the british witch accepts his project proposal after a while.
#+end_quote

You've gone for option #1, I see, and much more thoroughly than I even imagined. A woman who grew up hearing stories of humans going into space, watching videos of people walking on the moon, and she somehow thinks it's infeasible to get to the moon using magic. Pull the other one, it's got bells on it. Replace Hermione with any random pureblood, even an intelligent one, and I could believe it.

Unless the skepticism is regarding the proposed means, the budget, or the expected results rather than the project as such. If I wanted to convince Hermione to join me on the project and told her I'd just use a bubble-head charm and a souped up broom, she might not know whether to laugh or cry before lecturing me about radiation and temperature variation and the limitations of the bubble-head charm and space debris and the special complications involving lunar regolith.

All who are recruited are geniuses. This fic would include a lot of the scientific and philosophical debate I have with my colleagues at the university (Note: I'm far from a genius ;P). Pride, conflicting knowledge, disputes about methodology and the like can become hilariously derailed and I hope to reproduce that in this fic.

They all are geniuses in their own subjects. Aurelius is great at Runes and Arithmancy, but failed miserably in Transfiguration, while Hermione is a outstanding generalist with no deep knowledge on anything.

This whole story is inspired by the stories I hear a lot around me. Of young people starting building their vision and nearly failing due to the shit life throws at them. At this point I'm not even sure if the story would be all that funny or entertaining for others. Especially people who never came in contact with the world of scientific research would probably have problems getting a laugh out of it.
