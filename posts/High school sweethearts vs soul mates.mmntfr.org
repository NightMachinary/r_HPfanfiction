I guess you could also consider this something of a request and discussion piece, but isn't it kinda weird that all fiction seems to be very black and white when it comes to romance? If the main character gets a girlfriend, then boom. That's it. Happy End, they'll be married right out of school with twelve kids before they're 30. And if it's a story where the MC is an adult, they MIGHT have one or two exes in their backstory, but all that is just background padding for the new girl who will inevitably be The One, and once they're together, nothing can break them apart, unless a sequel happens.

Why is that? Why doesn't more fiction include multiple failed attempts at romance in a story before the MC meets a Love Interest that clicks? And are there any HP fics like this that y'all might recommend?


** Yeah that has always grinded my gears, they date one person in thier late teens and thats who they marry for the rest of thier life? I have actually seen this happen in real life and that marriage did not end well.

If I ever actaully get around to writing my own fic, I think harry will date a a few different girls in hogwarts years and maybe one or two after hogwarts before he even considers marrying one of them.

*** The only thing worse than marrying the first person you date, is marrying someone you've been dating for less than a year. A friend of mine did that. He had two epic failures in 8th grade and 9th grade with bad breakups (the girl in 9th grade sent me over 300 emails in less than a week, wildly varying between death threats against him and me [for some reason], to haughty, self-assured diatribes about how he was gonna come crawling back any day now, to outright begging me to help her set up a "kiss and make up" date. She was terrifying, and also my first personal interaction with a restraining order, though as an outside observer), and then once he 22 he's suddenly found "the one" and they get married before the year is out.

What's even crazier than all that is that he ended our friendship because I wouldn't let him or his future wife drive MY car, when I was nice and went out of my way to pick her up when he and I were carpooling. Why did they want to drive? So they could sit next to each other. Which apparently they couldn't do in the back seat. I am perfectly happy to play wingman, but I'm not getting a goddamn ticket or worse just because they didn't care that my insurance didn't cover other drivers.

Even more irksome is the fact that she got off work hours prior and could have easily gotten home long before I got there by WALKING, let alone taking the bus, but no, I got to drive an extra 45 minutes in the dark because reasons.

He went from "just met" to "just married" in barely a year. That, right there, WAS my whole point. Your parents, and a lot of people who are sane like your parents, will begin dating a longtime friend, and decide to marry early because they've already known each other for X number of years, even if they've only dated for one year, where X = 1+N years. I very specifically mean "those who only know each other for a year or less" should probably hold off on marriage for a bit.

*** I do understand that. But you know what else is satisfying? A Slow Burn. Where it takes 80k words for the two main characters to even think to themselves "I think I'm starting to like them." All I want is a story where the slow burn takes all that time longer than your usual romcom, because the main character attempts to woo someone else in the beginning.

I want more Toradora!, dang it! I want more Nisekoi, without it HAVING to be a harem anime! I don't want to be flogged with realism, just smacked with it once or twice as a reminder that it exists, or whatever.

Heck, even Nisekoi suffers from First Girl Syndrome, if you look at it from the audience's POV. So does Harry Potter, since we're introduced to Ginny before Hermione. But that's still part of the problem I feel.

I've actually been fiddling with an idea for a globetrotting romcom, where the MC is looking for Miss Perfect, and doesn't find her until he returns home to the childhood friend who has always been there by his side. It's only now that he's met girls from all walks of life, all over the world, that he finally realizes that his home and heart has always been together, he'd just been blinded by the horizon.

My inability to write romance, let alone a multitude of different flavors of romance, has prevented me from getting very far into this idea, and after devouring a bunch of fanfiction and other media searching for inspiration, I finally was compelled to ask this post's question.

***** Yup, that's the idea. I just can't seem to get much further than that in my own story.

Toradora! is an anime where the two main characters have crushes on one another's best friends. So they make a deal to help one another score dates. Through a few misadventures, dealing with each other at their absolute lowest, and growing as people, they begin falling in love with each other, but pretend otherwise because the other is still hiding their feelings, until it all spills out and they nearly elope, before deciding to finish high school---taking it seriously this time---and seeing if their feelings have changed at all by the time they graduate.

I'm totally comfortable spoiling that, because they make it extremely obvious that the two MCs will end up together in the end, but the journey is what makes it fun.

Nisekoi is similar. The anime hasn't reached anywhere near the ending, but the manga has ended, and it starts with the MC dealing with a massive crush on this cute girl, who also has a crush on him, but they're both too freaking shy to do anything about it. And then a transfer student hops a fence and lands on him, before later their parents force MC and Transfer Girl Into a fake engagement, a "false love" (nise•koi) for convenience's sake. A few other girls show up, and of the 6 girls, 4 all have keys, one of which opens the locket the MC carries around due to his first ever crush, a girl he can't remember from when he was five or so. Only 1 of the key-bearing girls remembers the event, another wrote about it in her diary and then forgot about said diary, the third only knows the key is somehow important, and the fourth keybearer outright says that he key isn't the right one, because she only took a key because that's how the story they based this silly event off of went. Three "knights" to open the barriers so the "princess" can reach her beloved. And that's kinda what happens in Nisekoi. The other girls might all know something about the MC, or they might understand his reactions to certain events, but the girl he chooses at the end surpassed all of them, being able to go beyond mere understanding, to seeing hidden details, things that aren't hinted at as important to the reader at all, until you go back and realize those details have been peppered in since the beginning.

The only two downfalls Nisekoi has are that the "fated childhood meeting" is both given too much importance, and yet not enough, and that it threw in two extra girls just so one can be the designated panty shot, and the other can be the tommest of tomboys.

** Because it's boring.

Any relationship takes time, often a lot of time. Putting everything in a story makes it long and uninteresting. It's quite hard to arrange a dynamic plot through time period that covers several of them.

Also the Magical World is very small. If someone has several past exes, it's well known, he/she has to interact with them quite often and it brings tension into interactions with others. There's a good rule: no exes in the present, and it exists for a reason.

** Because most people don't understand how relationships work and form, and because most writers were indoctrinated from a young age that finding "the one" was inevitable and a magical moment beyond compare. The fact that relationships can be hard, that even during difficult times the strength lies in holding together, inexorable, the fact that sometimes you just want to be alone and many other facts like these are mildly taboo in our society.

Same as the fact that some people just don't want to have kids, or that you're free to not have kids while maintaining a great relationship. Or the fact that some people never get married (and just stay in an unmarried relationship forever), which is also not required. Or that neither partner /has/ to give up their last name.

Real, actual relationships are scary and unknowable - they're based on trust and mutual understanding, not fate and the universe. The only people that can make a relationship happen are the ones that do. The fiction of fate pushing together "soulmates" is incredibly attractive to people paralyzed by this fear.

*** I was discussing this with a friend a while back and they made a good point. There is a subset of the fanfic community who should be kept on watchlists because of their views on romance and consent. However, many of the writers of fanfic are young. How many authors notes have you seen where the author apologises because of delays due to schoolwork, and that can be from people who have been writing for years. Not only have they probably not experienced a full relationship yet, they are still at the point in their lives when they are figuring out how other people work emotionally, so a more 'childlike' view of relationships is to be expected.

Add in the fact that once these tropes became established it is self-fulfilling, as that becomes 'expected' of a fanfiction (arguably the 'pairings' tags on ff sites should take some of the blame) and it becomes normalised for those who read a lot and go on to write their own.

*** That is a wonderfully insightful answer, thank you!

But that again makes me wonder why no one has ever tried to demystify all that messiness.

To use HPFF as an example, I love a good romance, no matter who it involves, so long as there is inter-character chemistry. Harry and Hermione canonically have good chemistry, and the movies exponentially increased it, which is why Harmony is such a widespread ship.

Ginny and Harry's relationship lacks that chemistry (Harry and Luna have better banter, even!), which is why it's lambasted.

I could see Draco/Harry forming after the war, built atop their rivalry and a certain amount of UST.

Harry/[Daphne/Tracey/Padma/whoever] are all usually fun because while there is generally accepted fanon about a lot of the background characters, the way various different authors use them always makes the story interesting, because while the base ingredients are largely the same, the chemical reactions can vary wildly, even if the end result is still a relationship.

All that said, I would love to see a story where Harry dates a number of different girls before finally settling down, because each girl he interacts with would leave a mark on how he acts moving forward.

In other words, I want to see a story that works like a dating sim/Visual Novel, where the Main Character becomes sporty when dating the athlete, or more studious when dating the librarian, or more aware of the greater community/social scene while dating the student president. Except instead of a blank slate protagonist becoming a sportsy himbo OR a valedictorian, he gets a bit of both, becoming a somewhat athletic bookworm who runs 5km before sunrise three times a week, and studies late into the night somewhat often.

I want a well-rounded character, rather than "Mr Perfect at X" or even worse, "Mr Perfect at Everything"

Or maybe in the end they meet someone who's went through the same trials and troubles and they end up together due to a mutual understanding.

** The biggest reason is pretty obvious, I think - because it's being written, and usually the author will have a final pairing in mind. Since that's the case, writing a secondary relationship that is A) satisfying to read, B) plausible, and C) doomed to 'failure' (breakup) is not always an easy task - or one that an author would want to do.

It just so happens that Harry Potter is set during an age where that 'final' relationship would be high school sweetheart equivalents - but you'd still get the same tendency whatever age they were of authors having an endgame relationship and working towards it, with very few bothering to throw in a 'fakeout' one first.

It's also why - if there's going to be another relationship involved - they'll tend to start already established. Eg, a post Hogwarts romance between Harry and a non-Ginny character often start with Harry already in a relationship with Ginny (as per canon), but mostly as an obstacle - and not really bothering to develop that relationship more than to show why they aren't a great fit.

Anyways, while it's certainly more realistic to have flirting and short term relationships at the age they're at, as well as unlikely to have super long lasting ones coming out of secondary school, it's narratively what goes easiest for relationships for authors, so that's why it all ends up so /solid/. Add in that canon also ended up with final pairings at graduation from Hogwarts, and that just adds to it.

Although, to note, it's not completely unrealistic to have those relationships stick coming out of secondary school/high school - in certain areas, it's the norm (I know a good number of family members and classmates who, a few years after graduating, were happily married with their high school sweethearts and having kids). So it isn't unrealistic per se, unless it's the only type of relationship shown.

Which it clearly did, because we have a whole book of Harry getting super jealous whenever he sees her with someone else.

******** Yeah no problem. I think too that there is a lot of media geared towards younger audiences that fall privy to the “marry their first love” trope. I was always deeply dissatisfied with the final pairings in HP (save for Remus/Tonks which I found to be intriguing).

For example, in Avatar: The Last Airbender I found it strange that everyone ended up with who they dated as TEENAGERS (save for Toph). This was somewhat remedied in Legend of Korra with Tenzin and Lin having a complicated past as childhood sweethearts that ended in tragedy (although that made their relationship all the more compelling in my opinion).

However, keep in mind that Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny/etc. went through some deep trauma as teens and therefore formed trauma bonds. It is more common to get married and have kids quickly during wartime, which is briefly addressed.

With that being said, I find it so odd that the books fight for Muggle born rights and the right to Muggle relations, yet not a single character ended up with a Muggle. I could see Ron ending up with a Muggle, to his dad's delight (who I also feel like should've been with a Muggle, but I guess we wouldn't have had the Weasley clan then...).

I too would also love to see more Muggle/Magical marriages. There was a fic that was pretty good where Dudley married a witch, and basically only found out because she reacted when he mentioned Harry's name. It was actually a really good one, where Dudley was scared of becoming a father because of his own upbringing. I can never get the linkfic bot to work but it's "Cousin Harry" on Ao3 iirc

In a similar vein, I don't think James and Lily's marriage would have realistically lasted, and they would have divorced before Harry started at Hogwarts. Harry, as we saw, put them both on a pedestal (especially James) and thus their relationship.

*** While I do understand that from a logical standpoint, I don't understand why a romcom where a guy is overly persistent with one girl is considered a good story, but they're aren't any stories where a guy is just persistent in general, not letting the fact that it didn't work with X number of girls because he's confident he'll meet the right girl so long as he continues to try.

Or, y'know, something similar to your average romcom or romdram, but reverse some common anime tropes? Like instead of a harem anime where one boring guy is surrounded by gorgeous girls, it's a somewhat average guy who tries his luck and while he strikes out with some, and befriends a few others, the story can actually freaking end with one of the girls asking him out (gasp, role reversal), because we don't have to hold onto the stupid status quo that is the lifeblood of a harem anime.

I seriously don't know how to ask the question I WANT to ask, so I'm asking questions I hope will lead to the question I want to ask, if that makes sense.

  I don't understand why a romcom where a guy is overly persistent with one girl is considered a good story, but they're aren't any stories where a guy is just persistent in general, not letting the fact that it didn't work with X number of girls because he's confident he'll meet the right girl so long as he continues to try.

Are you still taking about fanfics? Because in most non-fanfic romcoms, one or both of the leads usually have had a ton of failed relationships before they meet each other.

I think that what you may be missing is that for most shipfics/romcoms/romance stories in general, people are reading/watching the story because they want to see a relationship develop and for the couple to be happy together, so failed relationships don't get much attention.

And a failed relationship could still make for a good story, but people generally aren't interested in those stories for the same reason they're generally not interested in stories where the villain wins in the end: people like happy endings.

I'll also note that stories focusing on teenagers are much less likely to give the characters past relationships, but that's because teenagers are generally too young to have had many previous relationships. I'm pretty sure that most teens graduate high school with no more than two exes, though my quick searching hasn't turned up any actual statistics.

If you want stories about dates and relationships that don't work out, try looking for sitcoms about single adults.

***** I've said it elsewhere, but I'll reiterate here because it's likely in a different comment chain: I understand that RomComs about adults usually have past relationships. That's not what I want. That doesn't do much, as unless said previous love interest shows up, they have no effect on the story other than "Oh, I'm gonna be a bit more awkward and whiny than usual for a minute because Current Happenstance reminded me of Previous Girl™️."

The thing I want is a main character going on a personal journey of self-discovery and romance where we SEE how they ACT before, during, and after each relationship, and get to see the character grow and change. RomComs don't do that, even in flashbacks to previous relationships nothing about the character changes because they have to act in a recognizable manner (usually as part of a joke), or if they act differently, then it's a Big Lipped Alligator Moment, or a Goth Phase. It's always just a joke and never actual growth, even though actual growth can and has been incorporated into jokes in other genres.

I asked this question in the first place because I don't really have an exact idea of what I want, so thank you for bearing with me as I use everyone's comments to build a little puzzle in my head.

** There is some merit to both the countless fics and what you're saying.

On one hand -- yes, everyone finding their One True Love on what basically amounts to their first try at romance is unlikely. Yeah, it does happen in real life, but it's rare. Even canon doesn't do this. Harry's first romantic interest is Cho. Cho's in turn is Cedric, then Harry, then who knows. Ginny had several boyfriends before she ended up with Harry. Hermione was with Krum for a bit. And JKR has implied that for a time Lily actually did have feelings for Severus, even if nothing came out of it before she ultimately ended up with James.

However, while everyone getting together with their "final" love right away is implausible, I do think that the Wizarding World being full of relationships that boil down to highschool sweetheaarts is plausible. When everyone goes to the same school, something like this becomes far more likely. And the only example we have of the opposite in canon is Remus/Nymphadora and Bill/Fleur. And highschool sweetheart examples? Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, James/Lily, Molly/Arthur, to name a few.

*** Yup. And to kinda pick up a point: Ginny=Harry/Harry>Cho/Cho>Cedric still has absolutely no substance to it. Harry doesn't change from before his date with Cho to after. The experience nets him 0xp. Ginny is the only one to get any experience in a relationship, but because it's all in the background, we still don't actually get to see how it affects her. It's just so many missed opportunities for development, but instead we got reiteration and a net zero.
