** Life Room: studying effects of magic on life, particularly transfiguration

Soul Room: studies the ability of wizards and magical creatures to affect the human soul (ex The Dementors Kiss)

Elemental Room: studies the magical distinctions between classical elements (relevant for creatures who are able to control aspects of nature)

Just some ideas. I'm working on DoM fic right now.

** I like to imagine that they have a very hassled librarian/record keeper that has to keep track of the department's experiments and results. She tries not to read too much into it when she gets handed a research paper about the potential applications of trapping a hummingbird in a perpetual time loop.

** One of the new ones after the war was probably the Department of How The Hell Did Harry Potter Win.

** I'd like to imagine that all the cool stuff that people would want to try with magic are researched in the DoM:

- breaking the laws of logic and reason: Casting a spell to wish for unlimited wishes... i.e. a spell that recasts itself 2 times

- Philosopher stones and the likes.

- Free energy / perpetuum mobile

- investigating the fabric of reality and its borders. Wizards might actually be able to reproduce something that is supposed to be a thought experiment and not at all pracitcal (like Heisenberg's cat)
