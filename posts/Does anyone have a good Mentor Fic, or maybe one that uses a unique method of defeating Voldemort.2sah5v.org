I have been looking for a good fic that is in similar vain of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/Stronger-Than-Hope][Stronger Than Hope by Alaunatar]].

I really enjoyed not only the unique way that the conflict was handled but also by the way that the mentoring was done. I was able to believe the interactions and the slow shift into a comfortable duo.


** Have you read Journeyman Potter? I can't link on mobile but it's on Fanficauthors.net under Draco664. I read it a while back, it's old, it has a completed sequel, as well as a third that I'm assuming is abandoned.

*** I love that fic! The first one is titled Apprentice Potter though.

**** Good call, thanks.

Again my excuse is I'm on my phone, I just quickly went to the website to remind myself of the author, saw Master Potter and went Yeah, must be Journeyman first.

*** I actually have, I really like the first one. I wasn't able to get through the second one at the time, but I should probably give it a try again.

*** I think I will check this out again, I remember reading it when it had five chapters or so.

Edit: I might avoid it, the pairing, is it done in a way that doesn't make the skin crawl? Post Hogwarts hopefully when Harry is in his 30's or so? Even then the age gap is a little too much.

**** There are no pairings in this fic (except for R/Hr). Snape, Draco and Harry are in no way romantically or sexually attracted to one another.

***** Mkay, I will give it a read. I was looking through the author page and it mentioned in the sequel's story description he is with Lucius Malfoy. Which was a bit of an age gap for me, but if it isn't in the first story I will give it another try.

****** It's not in the first story, thankfully. No, the sequel I'm not going to read either.

** Good question! Stronger than Hope was a great read and unfortunately I can't think of anything similar. Going to be checking out the rest in this thread.

*** The story just hit me so hard, it was one of the few believable stories that dealt with the mentor-ship. It also was so refreshing to see Harry try and try and fail. Then to have adults actually matter.

**** It was so refreshing to see a story about hard work and not in a movie montage way. I really like them working so well as a team, even when they didn't necessarily like each other. People get carried away and then have to live with their mistakes and it was brilliantly told here.

***** I agree. God, I am so tired of super Harry, all the hard work off screen and superficial set backs.
