Over the past half year or so, as I've kinda grown out of my Harmony phase, my new favorite relationship has become the trio together.

Unfortunately, there are literally only 17 [Harry P., Ron W., Hermione G.] fics on FF.net, and I'm much less fluent in searching other sites.

So, if anyone has any brilliant recommendations, I'd be delighted :)


** "The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167): some readers disagree, but I think if they live together and sleep together, it falls under the definition of 'getting together'. They might not be in a traditional romantic relationship, but I can safely say that their bonds and closeness even exceeded most married couples.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

Some of them look great, others look like shameless porn. I have no particular references, but since AO3 can be confusing at first, I figured I'd help with the filtering.

It looks like some of these stories are archive-locked. If you don't have an AO3 account, there are only 407 stories.

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath. Warning: This fic depicts violence, rape, torture, suicide,etc. Both HET & SLASH. It is intended for a mature audience.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/triofic][Here's]] a link to a collection of Harry/Ron/Hermione fics that were hosted on another archive before moving to AO3.

** Quite cliche (maybe a guilty pleasure, there's so few fics with this ship though) but I quite enjoyed the golden trio, which features an established Harry/Ron/Hermione relationship, and an alternate dimension travelling story though it's incomplete. Linkffn(the golden trio)
