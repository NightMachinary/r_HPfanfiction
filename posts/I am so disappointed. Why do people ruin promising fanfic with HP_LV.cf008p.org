...really? That's the problem you have with this?

AUs are a thing, mate. If the author wants to postulate a universe that mostly looks like the canon one, except Voldemort /can/ feel love, they have free reign to do so if they think it'll make a good story. Of course, it rarely does. But the basic fact of changing this or that secondary canon fact to suit one's plot isn't some terminal sin.

What's more, /present-day/ Voldemort cannot feel love, but Rowling has been rather cagey on whether he was a born psychopath or was screwed up by his upbringing, and, later, all the Horcruxes and assorted soul-damaging Dark Magic.

Most Harry/Riddle pairings are with a younger Tom Riddle, though I'll admit this isn't universal. This Riddle /could/ plausibly not be too far gone to forge a deep emotional connection with someone else, even if 1990's Voldemort was.

And besides, the only Harry/Adult!LV I ever brought myself to read, out of curiosity, featured as a major plot point Voldemort fixing the damage done to his soul and his ability to love by the Horcruxes. So it's not as though even these writers ignore the issue altogether, or at least not all of the do.

Bottom line, there are /many, many things wrong/ with a Harry/Voldemort pairing, but this isn't really one of them.

*** She's said if his mother lived he'd be different. As for a younger TMR, he was most definitely too far gone by the time he was ten and, from what I've read, authors ignore that completely.

Yes, that's what I was referring to. It's still pretty vague, isn't it? 'cause, obviously, not every clinical psychopath grows up into a serial killer. With the right upbringing, you could have gotten a perfectly nice, harmless person who simply didn't feel love, but didn't think murder a valuable use of his time either and would rather collect stamps or something.

I think that's up to one's interpretation and psychological beliefs. He was already /damaged/, sure, but not necessarily irreparably so.

Not my ship, not my deck-apes, but I think that's part of the appeal, mate. He can't feel love... until Harry teaches him with his sweet bussy.

...I assume Harry's the bottom in the relationship between a boy and his parents' murderer.
