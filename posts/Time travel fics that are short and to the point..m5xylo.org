Doesn't need to be all that short, but I'm looking for fics there the time traveler(s) has a plan, act decisively and proactively, and get it done.

A couple of examples of such fics would be Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute by Voice of the Nephilim) and Linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel). Possibly Linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity), but I don't remember it well enough to say for sure.


** My humble entry:

Harry was surprised when he woke up on his 13th birthday for the second time,but that quickly turned to glee as he realized the chance he'd been given.

"Let's do this right this time," he said, walking away from the smoldering wreckage of his aunt and uncle's house.

5 years later, he lay in bed as midmorning sunlight streamed in through the window. "You know," he said, looking into the eyes of your favorite character, "I sure am glad I kicked Voldemort's ass 3 years ago. It gives me more time to do the things I love." With that, he rolled over onto his partner to put his words into action. All was well.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18173600][Dawn]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/wynnebat/pseuds/wynnebat][wynnebat]] is my favorite time travel fic by far. They finish Voldemort before First Year ends.

  At this very moment, Hermione Granger is a tiny muggleborn child who's tried half a dozen spells. No one is scared of her. No one knows to expect her."We're really doing this," Pansy eventually says, breaking the silence. "We must be insane.""We're saving the country." Hermione tears her gaze from the sunrise across the treetops of the Forbidden Forest to find that Pansy is already looking her way, something resolute in her gaze. It's too solemn of an expression for a child, but Hermione's probably isn't better.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak: Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise: "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity.

Hourglass by Cheshire Carrol

Sshg, time traveling unspeakable Hermione, she gets transported to her like 2 year old baby body and uses aging potion to get a bigger body and defeat death eaters. It's surprisingly fun.
