**** That and slash pairings between Voldemort/Tom Riddle Jr (Because they are different characters, apparently)/Severus Snape/Lucius Malfoy/Insert [despicable] adult here and one [or more] of the children makes me wanna cry too.

Draco/Hermione /is/ */not/* /my ship,/ but there are well written ones, with character development leading to the pairing in a logical way.

Nothing justifies writting the other, much less publishing or wanting to read it.

Curse FFN for not having a proper filtering system.

***** My take on Malfoy/Hermione is the, while MAYBE possible from a character development point of view, is still impossible since he belongs to Prison for life. If he remains free Hermione would make it her life's goal to put him and others away, if he is in prison romance is out of the question.

*** [[https://i.imgur.com/f6ijXFs.png][It's already aware of /some/ fanfiction.]] All that's missing is deeper training and maybe a specialised mode to make distinguishing between various versions of the same character easier.

**** I was thinking story focused instead of character focused, so it ask you questions about the story in general and returns a/some title(s).

    Is it a smutfic?
  #+end_quote

  Yes.

  #+begin_quote
    Is it a Harry/Hermione fic?
  #+end_quote

  Yes.

  #+begin_quote
    Does the timeline start at the canon Third Year?

etc, etc.

Though admittedly a more straightforward search engine with the same power that Akinator has would've been better.

***** I remember finding a fic where Hermione magically gets pregnant after the troll incident. IN HER FIRST YEAR. I'm a diehard H/Hr shipper but Jesus, I actually made a face and said the words ‚Äúno no no no!‚Äù Several times out loud when I read the reviews and saw that the story was what the summary made it sound like. Absolutely disgusting.
