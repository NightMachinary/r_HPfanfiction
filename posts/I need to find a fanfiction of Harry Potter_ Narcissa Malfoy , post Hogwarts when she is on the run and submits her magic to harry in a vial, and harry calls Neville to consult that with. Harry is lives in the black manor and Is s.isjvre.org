  It's been seven years now. He knows that not because of his looks -which haven't exactly changed but also haven't stayed the same, he can't explain it very well. It's also not because of the celebrations everywhere or the vigils being held in Hogwarts or Godric's Hollow. He know's it's been seven years because of the paper sitting on his desk declaring the re-opening of some cases that sparked the attention of one Hermione Granger during the archiving of the old trial records at the Ministry of Magic. He wonders why it was him she decided to contact with this issue. He made it perfectly clear that his part in the war ended with the death of Tom Riddle. Still, he owed it to her to read it despite the dread he was feeling.*Tags will be added as the story progresses**Not compliant with the Epilogue*

*** I'm assuming this is correct, but wanted to thank you for the link. It was pretty good if you can ignore the mid-quality writing.

Really enjoyed the concept.
