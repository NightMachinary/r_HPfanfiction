  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic]] is good. It's a harry/luna/tonks/fleur. Indy grey Harry done well. He doesn't have ridiculous titles and his power grows in a believable way. No "Merlin vision now he's god" stuff. Gets dark later but not too

** Couldn't you have made just /one/ post where you ask for either Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff - instead of two identical posts?
