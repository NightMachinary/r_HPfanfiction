Not the best prompt, but more a thing for authors to possibly include in their upcoming work:

I've seen Arthur Weasley maligned in many fan fics, notably in those that lean towards Weasley bashing, for not being able to pronounce electricity correctly, despite being the Ministry's supposed expert on the subject.

The prompt is simple. Electricity is a word that Arthur has simply misread for years, and never actually heard it said out loud.


** Yeah I'll do it. My fic is pro-Arthur anyway, so I can easily include it.

Plus personally, I think Arthur is a borderline genius for actually managing to enchant a car to fly, given that he likely has no formal training or experience with motor vehicles.

On a side note, where exactly is it mentioned that Arthur is the Ministry's supposed expert on muggle stuff?

The only thing canon tells us about Arthur is that despite being a pureblood he was interested in knowing about the mechanics of muggle stuff, and that he worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Department.

*** I'm fairly certain there's a scene where Molly congratulates him for being promoted to department chair. Not exactly “the Ministry's expert on Muggle stuff,” but still a fairly high-ranking figure in a department focused on it.

** My theory is that Arthur Weasley is crazy like a fox and "eckletricity" is part of the act he uses to keep the rest of the Ministry thinking he's an ineffectual boob best left alone. It's how he's kept his position in a department most wizards despise and would eliminate if they could.
