I've been looking for this for an hour and don't know if it was taken down or I'm looking in the wrong place. The story takes place 4th year. The main thing I remember is Victor has a â€˜basically adopted brother' He's his best friend and he lives with his family. Once scene is where the best friend/brother does a spell that outlines the Bulgarian students on the deck of the ship in different colors depending on if they believe harry put his own name in and if they are angry with him. Harry also meets several of Viktor's friends. They have a broom race. The friends not racing are shooting spells as obstacles, the giant squid's tentacles get in the way. Does anyone know the name of this story and/or where I can find it.
