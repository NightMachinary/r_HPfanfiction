Have any of you heard of the video game Hearts of Iron 4? That may seem like an odd question, but let me continue. It is a grand strategy game, taking place during WW2. Its basically a geopolitical simulator, with news events, focus trees to determine national policy and actions, and a very military-oriented gui.

But that's not the point. There is a mod for the game called The New Order: Last Days of Europe, where the Axis win WW2.

This mod is horribly dark. There is a state in france known as Burgundy which, spoiler alert, is worse than the Nazis. It is literally run by the SS. They believe Hitler has become weak in the years since the war, and plot to destroy the world in nuclear fire, so that the 'true aryan race' can repopulate the world. They are effectively, to quote one fan of the mod, 'Orwells oceania on Nazi crack'. Burgundy is hell, in a world full of hellish places. Don't even get me started on the Russian Warlord States, or just how much nightmare fuel there is in Burgundy.

I was thinking of setting a fic in this world. England in this world is barely a shell of its former self. The UK was dissolved at the end of the war, with England becoming occupied by the Germans. In case you are wondering where the Wizarding World is in this timeline, well....IRL Himmler was an occultist. Even if this fact is untrue, and I am unsure on that topic, for the purposes of fiction he is an occultist. Himmler in this timeline discovered Grindelwald's mind control of hitler, via recognizing certain subtle signs given to him by his nazi Wizard contacts. Yes, Nazi wizards. Himmler was able to exploit the anti-semitism in the Wizarding World. How was himmler able to access the WW? His wife in this timeline was a witch. Again, I am still working out the details, but the point is that through these NSDAP-loyalist Wizards, Hitler broke free from Grindelwalds control. In a rage, Grindelwald was executed by Hitler's Magical allies. The rest of the mod then followed, with English wizards getting massacred by German soldiers and Wizards at Cable Street, along with British Socialists.

In the fic, most English wizards are rabidly anti-Nazi. Everyone knows someone who died at Cable Street, and much of the population is loyal to Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. Voldemort in the fic is known as Colonel Riddle, leader of the Wizarding Military Force, the Wizarding branch of HMMLR. The WMF is just as anti-Nazi as the Death Eaters are anti-Muggle. They don't give a damn about Elizabeth II one way or another, only whether the Germans are crucioed to death or not. This is the main moral dillema of the fic. Whenever the transitional goverment wanted to let, say, the Reformist leader within the Collaborationist Government live, Riddle would complain, "Why the hell should they be fed, cared for, and sheltered on the dime of the British people?"

Are the Death Eater's methods moral when used on monsters?

Critiques/comments/concerns?


** You might be able to get ideas from Wolfenstein as well. Unfortunately, the only fic with this crossover is in Spanish.

** I think fic like that would put into unique perspective Grindelwald actions. Say, Dumbledore dueled and killed Gellert far earlier in the war. Some things never happened, others were already put into motion. Ultimately future would end up as this hellish muggle regime. It would turn out Grindelwald was right all along.

** During war time I doubt anyone would call them out on it but after the war the public would lynch them lol. I often get that feeling playing HOI4 when I encircle a 15+ stack and kill a million people in a month thinking that I'd either be a war hero or wanted by the UN for war crimes against all those captured troops. (Moral of story is that the enemy is the bigger evil so who cares what is done to them. Also pm me if ur uk or Europe to play some MP HOI4 at some point.)
