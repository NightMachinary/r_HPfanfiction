I mean: Call me action oriented, but I'd have had people all over the country go to some place, shout "Voldemort" and disapparate (and appear somewhere else and do the same thing - over and over again, in shifts if need be (hell, I might have waited till shortly before the final battle to tie his forces down, but I would have shown them the idiocy of that taboo!))...it would have tied up a lot of Voldemort's forces and would show him that the resistance is not dead!

So why didn't they? I mean they couldn't track apparition all over Britain as far as we know (otherwise Harry and company wouldn't have been able to move their camp all the time!)

Ok: Discuss!


** Why they didn't is quite clear: It would've taken the spotlight off of Harry and Rowling never did anything to take Harry's spotlight. If the Order would've worked a resistance, then Harry's part wouldn't be as "impressive" in comparison.

Hell, she even made a sport that is essentially 2 people actually competing while 12 others play to pass the time between start and snitch-catch, just to make Harry seem more relevant and impactful. My gamedesigner heart bleeds every time I read the actual rules of Quidditch (especially the scoring system).

If we disregard that this is a story and the sidecharacters didn't do much to make the protagonist look better, then I can only think of one thing. Demoralisation. All the Order knew was that their leader was gone, their Chosen One was on a trip somewhere searching something for who knows how long, and their country was so incredibly pathetic and passive that only a handful of people actually took up their everyday use lethal weapon (read wands) and fight. My headcanon here is that with the exception of some like McGonagall and Lupin, most Order members were already ready to pack and flee.

Why? I'm curious because I've often thought the snitch may be worth too much, but if you take into consideration how long games purportedly last in the professional leagues, it isn't really a game-breaking amount of points. If a game lasted days/weeks, the points could be in the thousands, plus (IMO) the rest of the team is more "active" in the game in terms of working constantly towards scoring, whereas the seeker keeps an eye out to end the game (even if behind, a la Krum).

**** Well, Krum arguably ended the game to get it done and over with, seeing as the irish chasers destroyed the Bulgarians.

But that is beside the point.

The hotfix for Quidditch would be to decrease the points the seeker can score and therefore focus his position into a strategic one. 150 points - or 15 scores - is a disgustingly high amount of goals. We know from the 4th book that a seeker catching the snitch but not winning is rare. However, ending the game on the teams term is a nice mechanic. So you let the Seeker get, lets say, 30 points - or 3 scores. The moment this happens, the seeker becomes a strategic position that is no longer just about catching the snitch, but also about prolonging the game.

With that comes the change that the snitch should appear more often in the game, making the overall playtime shorter.

Yes, I know we're talking mostly about our experience of school-league Quidditch and I admit that I've read a few fic where the 150 points work. But given what we know, I come to the conclusion that the seeker positions score impact is the one huge flaw in the game. 15 goals is such a huge amount that if we compare that with real sports, the seekers would turn entire games more often than not, which is not what you want. You want equal teams competing and the better /team/ winning, not the better seeker.

I'm not quite sure what your point is? The goal difference score in a league, or...?

The state of the seeker in the current rules of quidditch is overwriting most of the other player's efforts. It is strategic *but also* game-winning most of the time. It should be *just* strategic, in order to give meaning back to the efforts of the other players.

******** So you /are/ speaking about goal-difference.

I agree with you that goal difference should be a factor in the league. However, this doesn't change anything when it comes to my assesment. The seeker should not score that difference, the chasers should. The seeker should only check if his chasers do well, and if yes, keep the enemy seeker from catching the snitch in order to make the difference bigger. If the chasers loose the seeker should try and catch the snitch (gaining a small amount of goals, maybe 30 points) to either win the game by a small margin or prevent further goals from happening.

**** Either the seeker wins the game on his own or he's completely useless. It completely destroys the effort of everyone else on the team if one player can just turn a 140-0 game around with one move.

If, one the other hand, the chasers are already more than 150 points ahead then the seeker becomes essentially useless because the game is already over and they just have to wait until the snitch is caught.

The game would be more balanced if you either removed the snitch completely, give the game a time limit, and make the seeker a sort of independent disruptive element or you lower the points the snitch gives and make the seeker strategically more important because they will have to actually pay attention to how the game is going instead of just catching it whenever they see it.

**** From what we've seen the game doesn't last days and weeks, however. At least not at Hogwarts, which makes having the snitch at Hogwarts count the exact same is a bad decision.

My brother plays Rec Soccer. When the kids are too small to dribble across a full field (and defend a huge goal), they shrink the field and goal. When kids are too young to hit a basball, they use a tee. You change the rules of the sport to make it better align with peoples' skill level. In my elementary school gym class we even had volleyball where you could catch the ball (this was before they taught us how to set and bump).

Also it's 15x the number of points of a goal is ridiculous. The only instance where the snitch being caught doesn't matter is if one team is 15 goals down (which in pretty much every sport mean you are being killed). In any other situation, the seeker is the one who decides the game. No equally-matched teams will ever be more than 15 goals apart from each other (that's a 30 point swing in basketball). I can't think of a single Hogwarts game where the team that caught the snitch didn't win.

And lastly, for such a crucial role, the snitch is essentially random. Assuming two relatively similar skilled seekers, spotting the snitch and finding it seems to involve a lot of random searching. The snitch randomly chooses where to go and it can easily move towards the opposing seeker, giving them an unearned disadvantage. Normally (in sports like football, where windspeed is random) random factors aren't significant enough to swing games. But in Quiddich, they are.

Honestly, if I played Quidditch, I'd have one of my best fliers harrass the other team's seeker constantly, while my other players search for the snitch. I don't really understand why anyone focuses on the chasers (especially until a 15 goal differential is scored). Like Chasers shouldn't exist; it should be keepers, beaters, seeker, and seeker's helpers

EDIT: And now I spent 15 minutes of my life arguing about an imaginary game instead of reading/writing

It was more like "Hermione and the Deathly Hallows" in the last book (Harry was demolished left and right IMHO...it's why I never finished the last book, I stopped reading when Hermione had everything planned and Harry was stumbling around like some simpleton who couldn't find his own arse without a map!)

I agree that the order wasn't that usefull (hell I would call most of the members useless - only Moody, Tonks, Shacklebolt and selected few others were any good in a fight (I still want to slap Rowling for having Molly kill Bellatrix...sorry, that's as unrealistic as it would be if I went out and killed a trained Delta Force Special Operator (which is highly unrealistic to say the least...someone like that would kill me before I could even point a gun at them :( ))...yeah, the normal people were pathetic, I agree (everybody carries a lethal weapon and they still cower in fear? Come on, band together and FIGHT...no wounder that I'd have left them to Voldemort in Harry's shoes (as long as they don't fight neither would I!))

If they (talking about the order, because come on Dumbledore isn't the be all end all - he's powerful, sure but I bet that say Flitwick, McGonagall and Moody together could at least fight him to a stand-still, if not actually beat him!) really were then "pathetic" and "useless" are both actually too nice adjectives for them (Harry and the others were ready to put their lives on the line and what did they do? Hide away somewhere with their heads in the sand? - Damned, everybody who didn't resist should be charged with collaboration :(

Then again: As I said the Wizward World in canon is really corrupt and yes: pathetic! I mean they let Draco walk (coerced my ass, the guy could have faked his death for example if he was serious in not wanting to fight for Voldemort, but no he endangered all of Hogwarts with his vanishing cabinet, not to mention that he tried to curse Harry in sixth year (ok Harry replied with "Sectum Sempra" but I don't think Draco was casting a tickling charm or a stunner!))...sorry, but with Harry's name and fame I'd have been out for some payback (I'd have called everybody a coward in the Prophet and I would have demanded that every deatheater be killed and sympathisers locked up for life!)

But no, Rowling didn't, really. She just "exaggerated" the characters of all three of the trio. Harry was basically a manic depressive patient for the padded room clinic when they hit rock bottom, while Hermione clinged to her books, hoping beyond hope that she would find anything and Ron ran, seeking his home, his safety, driven by jealousy and hopelessness.

The last book was all previous books in extreme conditions you could say. While Hermione is keeping the ship steady over longer periods of time, Harry delivers the big heroic stuff when it counts.

I am still waiting for a fanfiction were Harry is some kind of muggle-born (he more or less is, because with his upbringing he knows less about the wizard world than other half-bloods) champion who unites all of them to push back against pureblood supremacy (in this case Harry and company might even be counter-supremacists and call - almost - all purebloods stuff like "inbred bigots" etc.) by using non-magical means (cellphones for example...I mean as far as we know two-way mirrors can only link one pair, so you would need a ton of mirrors for a communications-network!) in conjunction with magic (and they work cloak and dagger style - not tipping their hand unless necessary) :)

There's one fiction were something like that is going on...it's one were Voldemort took over, James Potter is dead, Lily is alive and called Lily Evans again (same for Harry because as the son of a traitor and a half-blood he's not allowed to have his father's name and neither is he given access to his father's money - it's something Voldemort later tries to bribe him with!) and muggle-borns are the botton of the social order (and treating them like shit is ok!), half-bloods are treated a little better (not much!) and Dark Arts are taught at Hogwarts...need to look that one up (maybe there are some more chapters now, as it wasn't finished!)

One interesting explanation for it that I read in some fanfic a while back was that this is primarily due to brooms getting better and making the snitch easier to catch. The rationale was that a few decades back, the snitch would have been relatively more difficult to catch, making games last longer and the overall scores higher. With scores in the high hundreds, 150 was a fairly reasonable tiebreaker amount. The reasoning for the snitch still being worth 150 in the present day was that the international quidditch governing body resembled FIFA in its bureaucracy, and could not agree on how to amend the rules, resulting in the present situation of seeker dominance.

****** It's really more of a way to show in the narrative that normal everyday people are against Lord Voldemort. Up until that point the only people who are really show to be against Voldemort are Harry, a "Chosen One", Dumbledore, a wise old, highly powered wizard with too many jobs, and Harry's close friends who are on the peripheral of major events involving Harry and Voldemort, i.e. Sirius, Hermione, Ron. The Order represents more ordinary people, who are opposed to Voldemort for more ordinary reasons: revenge, to protect their way of life, and so on.

Your right though, the first Order was founded right in the middle of war, i.e. there was probably a bigger focus at Hogwarts at the time on defending yourself, seeing as there was an active war. However there has since been 13-14 years of peace, people who could and did fight died in the first war. New members wouldn't be as stringent on their defensive capabilities as they wouldn't have had to fight much for a significant amount of time. The first order was founded in the 70s and fought until the war ended in the early 80s. In other word these people had roughly 10 years to learn to fight and get good at fighting, a fairly large amount of time, especially with their lives on the line. By the end they would have been fairly profecient, but then there is peace for a greater amount of time, they would have gotten out of practice and out of shape and that was the people that survived, Moody likely not out of shape but older, probably slower and possible more injured, Sirius spent 12 or so years in Azkaban, Remus was probably bumming around for however many years until he took the job at Hogwarts, probably not the best conditions to stay in shape, Emmeline Vance, not sure what she did but she seemed to be in okay fighting shape/ability by the second war, McGonagall, who is a teacher, older than during the first war and is more about transfiguration than combat, and finally Elphias Doge who never struck me as particularly talented. Other than Albus, who was probably a little slower by the second war and Aberforth who retired, everyone else had died.

The people who joined up where the Weaselys, Bill and Charlie are quite talented and probably have half an idea what to do in dangerous situations, Molly and Arthur are a hosuewife and basically a government worker respectively, Fred and George, while talented and creative wizards are more focused on pranks and their shop and I'd probably rather a more combat orientated pair at my back. Mundungus Fletcher, need I say more? Tonks, someone actually useful an Auror, same as Kingsley. Fleur, talented but young and inexperienced. Snape had to be careful not to blow his cover. In other words by the time of the second war, the Order has 10 people who would probably be any good at fighting. Bill and Charlie, who are both mostly working overseas, Tonks, Moody and Kingsley who are shown to be useful to the Order, McGonagall, she's older by this point and probably a bit depressed from the first war and all the former students who died, Emmeline Vance, Sirius who was probably a bit out of shape and practice after Azkaban, and Remus, and finally Albus. No great fighting force, everyone else in the Order is more of an information gathering force. In addition the Second war lasted for about 3 years. In that time the people who couldn't fight probably wouldn't have learned a whole heap about how to fight, especially since the first year of the war had pretty much no fighting.

That is why the Order is fairly ineffective in the Second War, lack of actual fighters, and little time in which the non-fighters could learn to fight.

*** we dont have contempt for the author. However Rowling created a world as diverse and as amazing as Middle Earth, yet unlike Tolkien, she refused to shine light on more than one facet. To compare the two, we have an enemy that is steadily gaining in power and taking over the land. We have an old grandfatherly wizard, who mentors the young protagonist. The young protagonist gathers a series of friends and allies, and eventually succeed at battling back the dark while trapezing across their magical world and discovering secrets within it.

Sounds shockingly familiar right? It is the formula for the contemporary fantasy novel. There are few rules in the formula : Antagonist that threatens the entirety of the world Protagonist lives in. Protagonist must have allies. Allies must be fleshed out characters to matter. The one point we have an issue with, is that JK forgot the last rule in the formula. "Make the world matter by exploring its nuances." By the third book, there isnt anything MAGICAL outside of hogwarts. By the seventh book, we dont even understand why Harry keeps fighting. (sure to survive and cuz a prophecy told him to boo hoo). But in every single other fantasy novel of note in the last fifty years, excluding Harry Potter, the world matters. Game of Thrones makes the landscape less about the world and more of the characters, then makes it apparent how the world functions around said characters. The inheritance saga, spent close to a whole book exploring the concept of natural balance in relation to characters. A key aspect of the book is Aleigasia. Twilight saga has the vampires battling against their natures to ensure that there is balance (yes the book is bad but whatever). Shoot even Star Wars follows the expanse of the world it builds and makes it matter. Just watch the Star Wars the Clone Wars series on netflix and you will grow to care about characters other than the MC.

Basically, JK fucked up in the formula. But she wrote the rest so well that we are enamored by the end result. JK didnt make magical britain worth saving, from the beginning. And it showed when she had the characters unable to pick up slack while the Trio attempted to make Voldemort Mortal. personally she should have done what Paoloni did during Eldest, Brisingr and Inheritance. She should have followed the trio, then followed say..Neville in hogwarts, then every few chapters focus on Snape and his involvement with Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Instead we get close to 600 pages of the Trio not knowing how to save a world full of characters we as readers dont give a fuck about.

** Some possible reasons:

- They don't send Death Eaters. They send expendable flunkies like Scabior, and there is no shortage of those.

- Taboo might also impose an anti-disapparation jinx over the area around where it was triggered, precisely to keep whomever triggered it from just fleeing. (It might explain why the Trio didn't just disapparate after Harry triggered the Taboo.)

- It could have been a strategic decision: most Death Eaters thought that they had won and had relaxed, enjoying the fruits of their victory. Violent resistance would have made them more proactive in hunting down Order members and runaway Muggleborns.

- It could have been a moral strategy decision: Potterverse is not morally neutral, and it seems to have an afterlife, and it's the best Watsonian explanation that I know of for the series of highly improbable coincidences --- some of which, like Draco disarming Dumbledore, by definition could not have been planned, or they wouldn't have worked --- to put the Elder Wand loyal to Harry in Voldemort's hand. Keeping the Order's hands clean for the final battle might have been a priority.

That said, I have this mental image of someone in the Order confounding a BBC anchor into saying "Voldemort" several times during a live broadcast, and Tabboo being flooded by millions of Muggles speculating about WTF is a "Voldemort".

*** Through ambushes, the Taboo would be rendered ineffective.

However, I have an idea about how a Taboo could be used after the war:

Place the word 'mudblood' under Taboo. But instead of sending aurors/hitwizards immediately after every use, the DMLE could keep track where and how often it was being muttered. It allowed the law enforcement to keep a statistic on who and where remaining pureblood extremists and Voldemort supporters could be hiding. Follow on investigations, arrests, and Veritaserum interrogations would serve to put them away, without giving up the secret of the Taboo.

I just gave four reasons why that wouldn't necessarily be the case. Even if Taboo doesn't automatically trigger an anti-disapparation magic over the area around it, after the first ambush or two, they would institute countermeasures against ambush, and unless the ambusher can anticipate those, they die. And, there are many more Death Eater flunkies than there are those willing and able to pull off the ambushes, so the exchange favors Voldemort.

I am not saying that Taboo can't be turned around, but it's not as simple, as effective, or as unambiguously a good idea as people make it out to be.

#+begin_quote

Maybe. The Ministry isn't the best at keeping secrets, especially since everybody is somebody's relative, and the fact that "mudblood" is Tabooed will leak very quickly indeed. Actual blood purists will start distracting the investigators by saying "mudblood" in the vicinity of various patsies, and just use "crudblood" or whatever else instead.

#+begin_quote

Like? How could the Ministry have used indiscriminately casting a spell on a location conditional on a word being said? If the remote spell is something nonlethal, it might be Voldemort himself triggering it, and then he gleefully slaughters those they send to the Taboo site; and if it's something lethal, he gleefully sends a Confounded or Imperiused victim to meet someone he wants dead and has him or her trigger the Taboo. With Dumbledore dead, the good guys didn't have that option.

Taboo + Anti-Disapparation is very thematically fitting, actually: the Ministry learns that something has happened, so it auto-issues a "stay where you are" order, while hitwizards apparate in and sort things out.

#+end_quote

Probably less than two seconds between the trigger and the apparation. You better be really confident that you've got your three Ds in place, though perhaps using a portkey that has the Taboo as the trigger word could work.

Speaking of portkeys, even if the Ministry can't remotely interdict disapparation, they can still likely portkey out something to trigger whatever traps have been left behind. If portkeys only work on humans, just use a prisoner under the Imperius to either to hold the portkey or to do the apparation. Are you sure you want to escalate against Voldemort?

It fits the canon facts about as well as the alternatives. Portkeys can be triggered by words, cursed contracts by complex actions, and alarm spells abound. Items can be magically linked so that a change in one propagates to a change in the other. Why not Taboo-triggered apparation/portkey?

For that matter, using magic Hour-Reversal Charm (if you take that bit of Pottermore as canon), one can probably send information about Taboo being triggered, say, 20 seconds into the past without creating a paradox, which is plenty of time for Snatchers to get their act together.

Of course it's better. One is making up the minimum necessary setting elements needed to make an apparent inconsistency in canon make sense, in a way that doesn't contradict our point-of-view character's observations --- and if somebody else has a better in-story explanation, they can say so; the other is coming up with elements that often /do/ contradict the point-of-view character's observations, don't resolve any apparent inconsistencies in canon, and often create their own apparent inconsistencies with themselves and with canon.

I don't want to get into a canon debate over what exactly they were and weren't doing and when --- and the beggars in the Alley do suggest that they weren't going for extermination --- but consider that while Voldemort's horcruxes are around, you can win a few battles but lose the war, because Voldemort can, in the ordinary course of things, beat up everyone on your side put together, or darned near that.

So, you might be better off focusing on horcruxes or anti-Voldemort weapons (like the Hallows), hide as many Muggleborns as you can, let DEs rest on their laurels, and let Voldemort go on his trips, rather than focus his whole ruthless genius on figuring out how to locate and capture or kill you.

In this hypothetical approach, they are sending out hostages --- like Stan Shunpike --- under the Imperius, primed to cast the anti-disapparition jinx, and then they can apparate in troops at a safe distance and at their leisure. (This is just an example. Someone more familiar with wizard combat tactics --- such as a Death Eater --- could probably come up with something more efficient and effective.)

In book 7, the Ministry is Nazi Germany. The only moral choice as a ministry employee is to flee, or actively fight it. Anyone who stays is an acceptable target or acceptable collateral damage. It doesn't matter what they do, they support a genocidal regime.

The argument about focusing on Horcruxes doesn't work - if the Order would actually be killing Death Eaters and collaborators, Voldemort would have to focus on them, freeing the trio up to hunt Horcruxes with less trouble. That's how enemy resources are tied up.

With regards to canon: If they could remote-cast spells like this, they would have used that in various means. And yes, I don't look for other explanations when the scene I'm reading is so stupid that it violates basic human capabilities and logic. Suddenly installing autmated spells never seen anywhere else, just to explain shity railroading (Heroes have to be captured!) is on the same level as some "and then Harry found the magical oath that Wizarding Britain had broken, and suddenly, all of them were squibs".

We simply should agree to disagree - I don't give canon the benefit of the doubt, and I scorn explanations to excuse obvious plot holes or plot railroading when they need far more "fanon" than canon.

Perhaps. Are you sure you want to escalate against Voldemort and the Death Eaters? They are willing to cross lines you can't even imagine to get at you. Are you willing to do the same? (Well, maybe you are, but remember, most of the order are not psychopaths.)

For that matter, the "ground to defend" that you are talking about is the Ministry. Most people in there are just functionaries who are keeping their heads down and going along with whatever regime is in place. Sure, "just following orders" is no excuse, but just because you can morally justify attacking them, doesn't mean that it's a good idea. Suppose that you kill a few of them. Now, the rest aren't just keeping their heads down and going along, they actually want you and yours dead, and even if you manage to take down Voldemort, they won't automatically forgive you.

And killing a few sympathisers who would rather kill children than risk their own life is a small price to pay for stopping a genocide.

In book 7, the Ministry is Nazi Germany, working on the Endlösung. That means that a whole damn lot of collateral damage is justified. If "Divided and Entwined" had reached that point, it wouldn't be murky at all. There wouldn't be any real moral problem. The moral problem in that story stems from the fact that things are not that bad. That the Ministry isn't trying to murder children just for not having magical parents.

But once that line is crossed? Then anyone working for the Ministry is, if not a legitimate target, acceptable collateral damage. Once your employer starts a genocide, you either quit, or you accept that you've just become a target.

and my reply was that taking advantage wouldn't necessarily be ethical or even a good idea.

With the exception of the flunkies sent after Taboo, when attacking Ministry infrastructure and personnel, the difficulty, the risk, and the cost of an attack would typically be inversely related to the target's culpability and harm, especially after the first such attack.

That is, a random floo technician or OWL examiner or cauldron bottom inspector or Obliviator would be an easy target, while Yaxley and Umbridge would be harder, and doubly so if you didn't care /which/ technician or /which/ examiner or /which/ inspector you killed, as long as you killed a Ministry employee: indiscriminate strikes are easier than pin-point strikes.

One can debate the ethics of attacking those functionaries, but there would also be PR consequences, and, ultimately, practicalities, because the Order is made up of people, most of them civilians, often with families and day jobs.

For example, would you ask Arthur Weasley to help in an attack on the Ministry that would have a non-negligible risk of killing his son, Percy, working overtime in the Ministry?

** You need a mentality that says you can fight back. You need a lot of chutzpah. You need to know about the Taboo. You need to be willing to say You Know Who's name. You need someone who thinks of the tactic. That lets you try it once.

You need an untraceable escape route. You need to be faster than the snatchers. This lets you try it a second time.

In other words, it's not so surprising that it didn't happen that way in canon, but it's also not unreasonable to have in a fic.

Some fics have ways to track Apparition, though in canon, Remus Lupin believed it couldn't be tracked.

Edit: You could also argue that it wasn't much of a fighting force pre-escape as well. Of their members, only a handful were combat-ready.

*** Indeed and that makes me question Dumbledore's sanity even more...hell, having intelligence gatherers is nice, but why not say:

Compartmentalize the order (it would fit with Dumbledore's fetish of keeping secrets) into an intelligence and fighting section :) and giving both a leader (in case he dies, it's not like Dumbledore didn't know he was going to die - he orchestrated his own death after all!)

*** If that was true, many things wouldn't work in HP as a whole. Besides, when she has explained the way she created HP, she as a writer is a planner (meaning she plans ahead and then writes, having notes on background, plot elements, and so on). We may disagree on some of her choices, but it has nothing to do with planning IMO.

Most things /don't/ work in HP.

JK might have planned the outline of her story and her characters but there is no way that she planned her world or magic system beyond what happens to be convenient for the plot.

Some examples:

- Quidditch

- The economy

- The number of people in the magical world

- The idea that magic has a techbane aura without the muggles immediately finding them

- Hiding the existence of dragons and smaller magical creatures

- The statute of secrecy in general

- Gamps law of elemental transfiguration
