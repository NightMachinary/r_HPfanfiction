Is anyone else having problems getting stories to load on the fanfiction.net app? I'm on a Samsung 7 if that matters. I can't get any stories to load through the app, but they load on a web browser. Am I alone in this issue?


** TIL there is an app

*** I like the app because it has a built in reader, so I can have my phone read to me while I'm driving or my eyes are otherwise occupied while my mind is not.

** I have that app. If I click on a link in this forum it automatically opens. Then I download it so I can read it later. Try reinstalling the app maybe. I'm on a Samsung 7 Crown.
