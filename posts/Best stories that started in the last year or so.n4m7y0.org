Looking for new shit to read. Anything that started on or later than 1st Jan 2020 is fine, as long as it's good in the typical aspects: characterisation, plot, SPAG, prose, dialogue, etc. No bashing. No preference for the genre.

#+begin_quote
  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

**** I feel like and this will probably come off as broken but I really like how the trauma is explored and how she works herself up RIGHT after the beginning of it is shown I feel like basically(is could be misremembering here BTW haven't read first book in almost a month now) But its like we find out she was sexually abused?? I think we see her in the Snape scene i assume you've seen it right and how Snape has to correct her ok but then I'm pretty sure there was something about the throat and chemicals maybe(my recollection is shit tbh I should reread) and then in ny head I'm like was she raped was she punished by being told to get naked what happened with chemicals,choking idk that made her go mute from what I recall the trauma is a bit unclear which to me makes it weird(could be remembering wrong still) but in my eyes I'm picturing somebody who wanted sexual trauma then decided hey I also want her to be mute due to trauma then fuck it i cant decide what made her mute so ill be vauge it might have been cleared up in the counseling sessions(I love that lady) but that's exactly why its the start of it sorry if I wasn't clear sorry for long post sorry for no fucking grammar bye

***** Thanks for letting me know, I'm actually the author of the fic so I was curious.

It's interesting that it came across that way because it's absolutely not what I intended.

The selective mutism stems from an incident where she was forced to swallow bleach by Petunia.

The sexual abuse is separate and did not cause the selective mutism. The third fic will detail that more clearly, but I didn't realize I was giving the impression that something like that had happened. Thanks for clarifying.

** personally I really love this one. Very recent and with a good update rate, bar a bit of delay lately, but honestly worth giving a try

Summary: The Weasleys fail to rescue Harry the summer after first year. After he misses the train, McGonagall goes to find him. What follows is Harry's journey to breaking free from the Dursleys influence and accepting his true potential. Mentor!McGonagall No bashing.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27049720/chapters/66040888][Bad Education]]

/What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)/

No romance at least none so far Tom Riddle despite being smart can't logic himself through everything and does need help at times so the supporting cast is very relevant later on and are all fleshed out and he works well off them. It has alot of comedy moments with Tom just being a teacher in the first half but gets more serious with a kinda creepy mystery in the second half and handles the tonal shift well.

It started 10/16/2020

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27472741/chapters/67169869][How Fred and George accidentally befriended a wannabe dark lord]]

/Fred opened the book and began to write. He only got a few words down before the diary absorbed them, the ink vanishing without a trace, prompting George to lean in closer to observe. “Maybe this is some elaborate joke on Ginny's part to educate us on proper brotherly behaviour?” George mused, just as new words began to appear on the empty page. Well, that seemed a bit ambitious for a first-year... ‘Hello. May I know who I am conversing with?'/

AU where Fred and George find Tom Riddle's diary instead of Ginny its pretty cracky with some drama and while they do encounter the major plot points its actually not very heavily focused on that and often the situations are altered because it's Fred George and Tom focused. But it's more about what Fred George and Tom do outside of those plot points they often have their own motivations and project and the hp main plot is more a thing they sometimes have to handle.

It started 11/09/2020

Neither are complete but neither currently leave you hanging or on a cliff hanger and so far both authors seem to be updating regularly.

** Harry Potter and the Rotfang Conspiracy by SmuttyPlotWizard

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  During the summer before his sixth year, Harry reflects on the death of his Godfather, Sirius Black, and decides that it's time to fight back. If it's war Voldemort wants, it's war he will get! (Assuming Harry's raging teenage hormones don't distract him, that is.) An occasionally X-rated (NC17-rated in the US) novel-length Honks re-write of Half-Blood Prince that's about 80% plot, 10% humour and 10% smut. The smut doesn't really take off until Chapter 7. Independent!Harry. Proactive!Harry.
#+end_quote

It's on AO3. It's Harry/Tonks. I didn't share a link because story includes smut and Harry is 16.

  Harry Potter's been away from the wizarding world for nearly ten years. So now that he's back, he's ready to get out there and learn to the best of his abilities. Mysterious bank-package? Not interested. All that matters is getting settled into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and perhaps leave the Dursleys for good as well.
