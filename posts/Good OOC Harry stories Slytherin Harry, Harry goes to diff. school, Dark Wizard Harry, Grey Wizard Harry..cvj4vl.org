Similar as they are by the same author, but still different stories with different tropes. I believe one is (eventual) slash and the other is gen.

** Linkffn(12021325) Antithesis is absolutely brilliant. It's my all time favorite fic and I highly recommend it. Try reading at least to the sorting ceremony, and by then you'll know if you like the plot and style of it or not.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

*** The style starts to get more lyrical after around chapter 45. It's divided into 3 parts with minor shifting in tone, but overall it's pretty sad

**** Holy shit dude you're the author. I just want to tell you that Antithesis is literally the most incredible thing that I've ever read. I loved it so much and I wish I could experience reading it for the first time again, because it was such a wild ride. Thank you so much for writing it!!!

***** Hello!!!! Ahhh!!!!! Thank you so so much! It was a true labour of love, one that went on far too long and made my high school teachers angry when I was writing. It's absolutely 100% a chaotic wild ride, lots of plot twists especially that....one....specific one.....heh Thank you so much!! It's so great to see people still enjoy it even after its finale!

****** Bro. Straight up, I binged it in a day and a half. It literally left me a shell of a human being for days by the time I finished, but in the best way! Those plot twists really got me. I recommend this to absolutely everyone :)

******* Aww man! 3 years of work chewed up and chomped down in only a day and a half! Some of those plot twists were ridiculous to swing. Some of my close friends read the story and they pestered me constantly about spoilers- the last twenty chapters were absolute chaos for everyone. Screaming on both sides of the computer! I have never in my life received so many cumulative swears in reviews than after the....forest chapter plot twist. You know the one ðŸ˜… I'm super proud of the ending, especially with how emotional everything got and how I SOMEHOW managed to make it work with an insane time crunch. I think I was making a chapter every 5 days towards the end there!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
