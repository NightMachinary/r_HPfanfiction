I'd like to read a fanfic that depicts her growing up there, kind of like the HP series itself but focused on her. Could you help me find one?

*** Idk, I'd rather read one that ended with Bill-Fleur. I like the canon and I think they make a good couple.

*** There is a Harry/Fleur story I read that was pretty good, but most of it took place at Hogwarts if I remember right.

***** I have a question about the fic. It's rated M, but does that mean sex or just violence? I've skimmed the story and am about to read it but I just wanted to know what the author meant by the M rating

**** It's okay, but it's really just gratuitously wordy, like just ridiculously so, to the point where the author uses twenty words where five will do.

No joke, this fic could be a full two thirds shorter, and it would probably be much better for it.

***** I agree completely. I feel like this is a common issue with fics, either they start rambling with the details or they find it necessary to repeat plot points every time a new character is introduced.

****** Like, the thing that frustrates me the most about this fic is that the author is clearly more technically capable than most fanfiction writers, but despite that, it's still basically unreadable.

******* I made it through when I read it the first time, but this was one of the first fics I ever read so It hadn't occurred to me how much better it could be.
