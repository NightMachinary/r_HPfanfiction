Just something a little different...that isn't the usual fluffy ScoRose or Potter boy/OC romance-drama fic


** Lessons Learned by loveadubdub linkffn(4260581)

It's my favourite fic about next gen. The characterisation is amazing, they're all people and not caricatures. It's not recommended enough in my opinion.

  My shrink says I repress feelings and emotions. She told me once that I have trouble “admitting reality” to myself. Now, I don't know if that's true. After all, I don't have the fancy Psychological Healing degree, do I?

  What they had wasn't right, but in a world full of people who wanted you for all the wrong reasons, it seemed to them that finding love at all mattered a lot more than with whom. -- One-Shot. The third story in the "A Rose for Albus" series and sequel to "In Someday I Believe".

  Colin Longbottom wants nothing more than to impress Lily Luna Potter. Unfortunately he has all the charm of your typical Longbottom male.

** I just started reading the Albus Potter series and I have not been able to put it down. The story and characters are so well written and the plot keeps you guessing. linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation)

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series definitely to be concluded in summer 2016!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

*** I just finished it today as the author updated the final book's last chapters and I must say, it's one of the best series I've ever read. The world building and magic theory is so awesome and it's so rewarding to read.

** Loved [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices]] by Aebbe. It is a time travel fic where Lily Luna travels back to 1980 for a couple days and has a quick romance with Sirius and then makes it back to 2028. But then Sirius comes into 2028 and hijinks and other interesting stuff ensues. Great time travel fic and not a fix-it fic. It follows pre-CC canon where time travel is a causal loop and you can't fix anything. linkffn(5846417)

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)
