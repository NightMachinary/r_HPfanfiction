  Dudley wasn't the one Harry saved during his fifth year. When Dementors attack him, he ends up saving the fiery, eccentric heiress to a hidden country of wizards. She has a private army and would love to repay her rescuer - by helping with his Voldemort problem. Look out, Britain. Captain-General Harry Potter is coming home. Violence, rating may go up

** Well, there is linkao3(1999356), but it is so tropey (Lord Potter, etc.), that it is almost unreadable, and the romantic relationship is (more age appropriate) Sirius / Princess Diana.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen, an event which causes Vernon to die of a heart attack. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry's 9th birthday and several years before Prince Charles and Princess Diana divorced. Warnings may change as the story progresses.

*** Thanks. Personally, I never had as much problem with tropes as others seem to, but maybe that's just because I haven't read one that bad. Or perhaps I've just stopped reading any I have read, and haven't realized that was the reason.
