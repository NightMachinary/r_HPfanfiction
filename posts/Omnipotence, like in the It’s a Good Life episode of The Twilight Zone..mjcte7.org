Are there any fics where a petulant character gains near-absolute magical power, and the fic deals with the reaction to that character?\\
It must be acknowledged that the character is ignorant, and the things they do are wrong.

Major bonus points if the other characters try to manipulate the 'god' into doing their ends, in their roles as 'advisors'.\\
Even more if there is a 'redemption arc' for the character, and they learn to use their power more responsibly.
