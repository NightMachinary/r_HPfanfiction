** Pretty much any fic that plans to go 7 years and starts off with like a 200k+ first year. Most stories like that burn out, unless its OTWTG which had a format intended to get around the fact that no one wants to read about 11 year olds for 200k words.

*** Those are equal parts ambitious and poorly written, imo. Those kinds of fics tend to shove so much plot-irrelevant and poorly written shit down your throat, it stops being interesting before the first school year is over.

Stories like Prince of Slytherin, anything written by White Squirrel. The ideas might be pretty unique, but the stories are so slowly paced it takes away from anything that might make the fic interesting.

The solution to this is literally found in the source material. Rowling was literally still building her world through the fifth book, and in a few ways /continued to do to so even into the last book./ She never actually stopped world building, just letting a little in at a time where it was relevant to the plot while also foreshadowing other elements that would become important later so they didn't feel like the came "out of nowhere."

If you plan on writing a story that spans seven years, an outline is your friend.

** Probably HPMOR.

- It is one of the few fics that tries to teach the reader something. Admittedly, this is hampered by the jargon, the jumbled messaging, the dislikeable and smug prot/antagonist, and by the sheer impermeability of paragraphs of author tracts. But it tries.

- On top of that, there's a mystery to solve! This, I feel, was done better. The ending was undeniably clever and clearly planned from the start.

- You've got to give it credit for tidying up most of seven books worth of plot, in first year. That said, it's still saggy in places.

Upon reflection, HPMOR has a pretty solid concept and outline. It just goes horribly wrong in execution.

*** My problem with what it's trying to teach you is that it does so in a bad way - as you said it goes horribly wrong in execution. Not only that but there are the instances in which what it's teaching is flawed, and/or wrong. That is where the "trying to teach you" falls apart in my view.

In a lot of parts it reads as if someone has read the basics of multiple wikipedia articles, decided what they meant based on the summaries, and then tried to shove them rather hamfistedly into the story for the purpose of showing how smart the characters were. What kills me is that the author is a decently intelligent individual, but they couldn't make up their mind if they wanted their characters to be correct, or if they wanted them to be flawed. This leads to a bigger problem with the Quirrell character that I get into below.

What ultimately sums up the fic for me is this line from the very first chapter and to me informs many of the problems with the story:

#+begin_quote
  "Mum," Harry said. "If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics..."
#+end_quote

What strikes me about that line is what it accomplishes: (1) it's a gigantic example of telling, not showing [which plagues the entire story in general], and (2) relies on other people's ideas, while not actually synthesizing them. This is the big problem I have while reading the story. It's the literary equivalent of when a student turns in a paper that is literally nothing but quotes of people that are learned on the subject. Has the student learned anything? No, they've just turned in a paper showing they can connect ideas together, but can't tell you what any of it /actually means./

Where this gets truly annoying is that when Quirrell/Voldemort/Monroe/whatever is given this mouthpiece, they are /always/ presented as correct, without contrasting view points. For the story to work, in the large part, every character must exist behind a veil of ignorance, or act in Sartrean bad faith /at all times/.

All of THAT being said, it is certainly ambitious and commits itself to its concept and never really wavers from it's own internal logic. That is a concept that is greatly lacking in most fan fiction, and story telling in general.

But the most annoying thing about this story for me is the fact that the author clearly think he's extremely intelligent (just like his self-insert character), yet like you said:

***** If I remember at one point he said that he intentionally got some things wrong because Harry was a self-insert of him when he was of a similar age. So basically it's wish fulfillment, a self-critique, but still wanted the philosophy it was pushing taken seriously.

Which is why it all falls apart. Either Harry is shown why he's wrong/naive, or he's correct and everyone around him is ignorant. You can't have /both./ Hence why I bring up the bad faith argument, as it's the only way that it makes everything mesh. The problem is that you can't be advocating for a method of thinking via bad faith, as it's an intentional misinterpretation.

I feel like that was just a cop out to avoid looking ignorant himself.

"Oh no, I meant for the characters to be wrong at times so they would be more human" is clearly incompatible with "this story tries to teach you about rationality", like you pointed out.

The guy was just trying to be right even when he was proven wrong. Which is, ironically enough, anything but rational, as it's a typical emotional reaction intended to protect his ego.

The story actually works amazingly well if you read it as a critique of rationality. Like how Saxenhouse and Strauss interpret Plato's Republic as arguing /against/ the rationally created city, if MoR was intended to be a critique against the common thinking of rational actions in fiction it works quite well.

That was, however, not the intent. MoR fails for many people for one simple reason: in the end, it's anything but rational.

EDIT: MoR is basically the fanfiction version of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGg8Cddkocw][Abed's scary story from Community.]]

That is an interesting perspective. It certainly would've made for a much better premise for the story.

Had it been the case, and had the author not made the characters quite so OOC, I might have actually enjoyed it. Wasted potential is what it is.

******** Of course it isn't bad writing in itself. But in the case of HPMOR, the basis of the story is that the main character is to be used by the author as a way of teaching the reader about a way of thinking that is supposedly "perfectly rational" and yet said character fails at it repeatedly. At which point it gets pretty paradoxal, because you can't teach people something that is supposed to be "right" by deliberately presenting it wrong to them.

Like [[/u/HP_Birdman]] said, "you can't be advocating for a method of thinking via bad faith, as it's an intentional misinterpretation".

Basically, if your character isn't presented as a genius with an encyclopedic knowledge of science and philosophy, then you should be good.

Thank you for the in-depth reply! :) I haven't read HPMoR, so I'm a bit lost, but I get the gist of it.

He may not be a genius of science and philosophy, he is pretty intelligent, he's just a little bias and believes he's always right when he's wrong. Even when he's wrong, in his eyes, he's right. xD

This can still be fine, you just need to make sure your character is sometimes reminded by the people around him that just because he thinks he's the smartest person in the room, it doesn't mean it's necessarily true. A good way to do that is to have a well-written antagonist that outsmart the protagonist at times.

The problem I have with HPMOR is that Harry isn't challenged by the characters he interacts with when he acts all smug and yet get things wrong.

This gives him Gary Stu status. If you want to avoid that for your character, be sure to include scenes where he is shown he's wrong and/or realizes it himself. Especially if he's 10 years old when your story start. Noone like snotty brats who've never been taught a lesson in respect and humility.

******** (great question btw)

It's bad writing to have a character be a mouth piece of bad, incomplete, and/or false information WHILE presenting said character as being intellectually infallible. In addition, it is also intellectually dishonest to present said viewpoint as superior to an intentionally crippled opposing view point. That is the Sartrean Bad Faith I was referencing before. To not be acting in bad faith, the 'rational' characters would be challenged honestly and not by a construction of the 'unrational' characters. As it is, the characters that aren't rational tend to serve as constructs of what rational thinkers THINK they are, instead of what they ACTUALLY are.

Mmm. It was planned from the start, and many elements - the Philosopher's Stone, Tom Riddle's true characterization - were certainly cleverly defined into consistency. But I also feel that the final conflict/resolution wasn't really that rational or clever at all.

Harry shouldn't have been allowed to keep his wand in the first place, after Voldemort extracted the Unbreakable Vow; and even then, many of the fan-proposed solutions to the confrontation were more clever (and narratively satsifying) than the transfiguration hijinks used in canon HPMOR.

** Other people have answered largely in terms of length, but I feel like there are more important aspects of ambition when it comes to fics. Mainly when I think of ambitious fics I think of fics that have some goal that takes writing skill to achieve. This largely falls into two (almost opposite) categories: stories that contain so many original elements that they are bordering on original fiction (e.g. Enembee's Skitterleap) and those that attempt to expand on the HP world while maintaining a perfect canonical tone (e.g. Newcomb's What You Leave Behind).

I think the way some authors use time travel can be ambitious - willyolioleo's /Temporal Beacon/ Lens of Sanity's /Dark Lord's Equal/. I didn't personally like it, but enembee's /By the Divining Light/ fits the original elements thing that Skitterleap had going...

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** The most ambitious is definitely the Emperor saga. I mean, it covers Harry's journey from a soldier to the emperor of the world (world domination). Not yet finished, yet already has 650,000 words. Political intrigue, battles war etc.

** Wit of the Raven is the most ambitious fic I've read. Alas it only ran until Halloween, year one, before being abandoned.

linkffn(2740505)

Very few people have the determination to write a complete story starting with year one and eleven year olds do not make interesting protagonists nor antagonists unless all pretense of realism is abandoned (WotR falls in this category). I wish more authors would start their stories closer to the real action, instead almost all fics start at the point of divergence. You can have vast divergences starting many years in the past and explain the backstory as you go along.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

** If we're counting crossovers, the only story that really comes to mind is /Child of the Storm./ linkffn(8897431)

This guy crossed in literally the entire Marvel universe, the DC universe, the /Dresden Files/ and who knows how much else at this point, and that's only in the first story. The sequel - linkffn(12046648) - will likely be even more ridiculous.

And it all makes some amount of sense, from what I remember. It may not be the best story ever - the first few chapters, in particular, are meh, if I recall correctly - but it's definitely something.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?chapterid=521158&i=1][Not Fade Away]] is one of the most ambitious fics I'm reading at the moment. The author plans to follow several characters over a number of years.

  She fights for a world she hates as much as it hates her. It never stops; not until the world of magic burns to ashes to be reborn, or destroys Lily Evans and all caught in her wake. From Hogwarts to the defeat of Voldemort, the rise of the bright young friends, allies, and enemies of the Order of the Phoenix - and how each and every one of them fell.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.
