If anybody is familiar with a Naruto fanfic called Seals are Easy people are hard That's what I want Dumbledore being supportive and remorseful other characters finding him weird but ok Him being either really good at one type of magic or just simply being obsessed without being good at it would be a bonus

**** He had only two friends throughout his first four years in Hogwarts, which would have been just one if it weren't for Quirrell ( The Golden Trio came into existence after Harry and Ron saved Hermione from the troll), and furthermore , Harry's conduct in the Yule Ball ( wherein he ditches Pavarti Patil) shows that he is rather socially inhibited.

***** What? He's friendly with all of the boys in his year and a good chunk of the house. Ron and Hermione are the ones who accompany him on his life and death adventures, it's natural that they're much closer. Not to mention, he knows the Quidditch team rather well.

Harry's conduct at the Yule Ball is pretty typical for a 14 year-old who got rejected by his crush, and is forced to attend something he's not very interested in doing. Guys hanging around the edge of the dance floor sipping a drink is practically a 13/14 year-old boy stereotype]

****** The thing is Harry is the most famous teenager in their world. This everyman act might make him more relatable to readers, but for his level of fame and how important he is in the Wizarding world he is kind of stunted.

I'm not saying he should have been some kind of mini-politician making backroom deals and sipping on goblets of win, but had he been raised by James Potter he might have had a much wider social circle that would have been more loyal than how people acted towards him in GoF.

Would it? I'm not so sure. James doesn't have a particularly wide social circle himself. He has 3 confirmed friends in canon. He's popular sure, but not very close to many people. So is Harry. When he joins the Quidditch Team first year, plenty of people come up to interact with him. Three random girls he's never spoken to ask him to the Yule Ball. During the DA 5th year, there are a number of students who clearly look up to him. He even has his own excitable set of followers in the Creevey Brothers.

Most of Harry's social troubles come from the celebrity aspect. Raised in a loving household or not, there's very little control Harry is going to have over the fickleness of his celebrity. He'd undoubtedly have more emotional support for the things he's going through, but short of dosing the population of the school on love potions, there's very little he's going to do regarding their opinion on him.

His celebrity is troublesome for him because he doesn't know or care to use it in his favour. He alienates a powerful "journalist" in GoF and then in OoTP, he takes a whole academic year before he gets an interview published.

I'm not saying Harry has to be true best friends with every single person but had he maybe hired a publicist or given interviews with more sympathetic media he could have changed the narrative in fifth year. Had he a wider social circle who knew him as he actually was instead of as a somewhat reclusive student who only really opened up to two people, there might have been less steam under the "Potter Sucks" banner. Lockhart might have been a liar and an idiot but he probably had very useful advice for Harry in CoS.

You know from real-life examples of celebrities who always seem to survive every scandal that swings their way from cunning use of the media.
