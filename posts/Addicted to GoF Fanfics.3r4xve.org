I've recently gotten really addicted to reading GoF-centric hpffs. Especially after reading "Deprived by the crimson lord" and "the lie ive lived". Can anyone recommend some awesome GoF fanfics?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3462605/1/As-Things-Should-Have-Been-The-Goblet-of-Fire][As Things Should've Been: the Goblet of Fire]]: Resetting the Potterverse after their third year. Harry's life changes for the better with Hermione's help. Unequivocally HHr

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5777316/1/Hedwig-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire][Hedwig and the Goblet of Fire]]: Harry uses Hedwig to test the restrictions on the Goblet of Fire. Obviously, they're not good enough to stop the smartest owl in Britain!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4967871/1/What-If-ooo-Another-Goblet-of-Fire-Alternative][What If? Another Goblet of Fire Alternative]]: Many fanfics speculate about what would have happened if Harry had asked Hermione to the Yule Ball. Or what if he had taken Ginny to the Ball? Here's a twist. What if he had done both? And what else in the story might have changed as a result?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope][A Champion's New Hope]]: Beginning during the Goblet of Fire, Harry looks to different friends for support after both Ron and Hermione refuse to believe that he did not put his name in the Goblet. Including one unexpected friend: Daphne Greengrass.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9960987/1/The-Challenge-of-the-Goblet][The Challenge of the Goblet]]: Harry knew that Fourth Year was going to be a challenge. It was almost like he'd seen it before. Rated for language.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8358572/1/All-with-Accio][All With Accio]]: Can the TriWizard Tournament be completed with just one spell? OneShot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9629497/1/Hermione-and-the-Tournament][Hermione and the Tournament]]: Hermione-centric tale: Harry's entry into the Tri-wizard Tournament goes different from canon as she takes a more active role in guiding him along. Harry also discovers a new power which changes things immensely. 100% Harmony (Harry Hermione) pairing. Rated M for some adult situations and language.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545504/1/Aspirations][Aspirations]]: AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8003129/1/Exclusion][Exclusion]]: During his fourth year, Gryffindor house is not as accepting of Harry's participation in the TriWizard Tournament, and use an old tradition called exclusion to force him into complaisance. Harry finds out who his true friends are and uses cunning to get his own brand of revenge.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]]: Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6531771/1/Triwizard-Champions][Triwizard Champions]]: Fleur Delacour has only known love from her family. But that's all about to change when she arrives at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament. AU. Up for adoption.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6174426/1/Champions][Champions]]: Harry takes a moment to help another Champion during the Second Task, and the unexpected aftermath forever changes his life.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6091629/1/Triwizard-Tournament-Take-Two][Triwizard Tournament: Take Two]]: While chasing the last remnants of the Death Eaters still loyal to Voldemort, Harry is unexpectedly thrown back in time to the start of his fourth year of Hogwarts. This time round, things are going to be a little different. Harry/Fleur pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3225125/1/Open-Your-Eyes-The-Goblet-of-Fire][Open Your Eyes: the Goblet of Fire]]: Harry Potter is tired of running blindly into life and death situations. This series is about Harry thinking before he leaps. It starts off at the summer following the events that transpired in Prisoner of Azkaban.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9891912/1/The-Power-of-Quidditch][The Power of Quidditch]]: The outrage over having the Quidditch season cancelled was muted too quickly in canon. A fourth year Gryffindor witch decides that someone needs to do something to rescue her best friend from impending disaster, and she has just the tool to fix both problems.

*Shameless Self-Plug*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8584266/1/Unexpected-Assistance][Unexpected Assistance]]:AU GoF. Harry is brooding over his involvement in the Tri-Wizard Tournament when he receives an offer of help from a most unexpected source. H/Hr/DG, Ron! and Dumbledore!Bashing, mild language.

*WARNING: ROBST FICS AHEAD. DO NOT READ IF THAT BOTHERS YOU.*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402315/1/Can-t-Have-It-Both-Ways][Can't Have It Both Ways]]: If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7392700/1/Banking-on-Her][Banking On Her]]: Harry reckons his future is bleak if he stays at Hogwarts. The Tri-Wizard tournament offers him a fail-safe way of escaping his perceived destiny, that is until Harry discovered the hidden costs. H/Hr

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]]

This fic is great. The tournament starts around chapter 3 or so iirc and while the first task is the same thing as canon (dragons!), it's handled in a pretty original way. The second task is completely new though.

Edit: 2 more things: The main character is a gun-loving psychopath with a rap sheet that would make Hitler proud and this fic has a ton of stuff so good I consider them headcanon now. Particularly why the purebloods never seem to learn from their mistakes and why nobody seems to get seriously injured at Hogwarts.

linkffn(One Wizard Too Many by KUcrow1997) It's got a similarly psychotic protagonist and what is probably the best Remus I've ever read.

** I've written a different Triwizward Tournament in my AU "Patron". I tried to stay true to the spirit of the tournament (putting three magic schools against each other in a year-long event, to foster international relations and team spirit), without the lunatic parts. So, it's not quite as deadly (without interference from outside sources), far more spectator-friendly, and involves more than just the champions. linkffn(11080542)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
