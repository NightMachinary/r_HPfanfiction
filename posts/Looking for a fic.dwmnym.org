Harry and snaps are dating and they find out that Voldemort is Harry's father. Voldemort pulls Harry and Severus our of the war because they are soulmates. Not sure if this is mpreg or if voldy was with lily.


** Something similar happens in Linkffn(Thinking in little green boxes)

"Tommy, before we begin, there's something I need to tell you," Harry interrupted as the dark wizard was instructing. Voldemort stepped out of his fighting stance with an annoyed huff.

"Nothing you could say matters any longer," the dark wizard hissed at him angrily.

"But it does," Harry said ominously. "You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover your power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the Wizarding world!"

Voldemort looked like he was going to laugh hysterically. "As if I would ever join you! You are at my mercy! There is nothing I could gain! What could you possibly offer me?"

"If only you understood the truth!" Harry said with an odd pose. For some reason, a black cloak appeared off the young wizard's shoulder that fluttered in the breeze. "What did Dumbledore tell you about your father?"

"My father is dead," snarled the dark wizard.

"If only you knew," Harry said with a superior smile that seemed to hold some dark secret. "Dumbledore never told you what truly happened."

"Killed and murdered," sneered the snaky guy, who was clearly getting tired of the interplay.

"No," intoned young Harry James Potter in a darkly serious tone. Harry stood tall, holding out a dramatic hand as lightning struck behind him, silhouetting him amongst the gravestones. "You see Tommy, I am your father!"

/BLINK-BLINK/

That was pretty much the last thing they expected to come out of James Potter's son's mouth. The Death Eaters looked at Harry and then they looked at Voldemort and then they looked at each other. It was pretty much general confusion. Voldemort looked at the boy with an equally incredulous look.

"That's not true," Voldemort said. "That's impossible."

"Ah, but it is true," Harry said, still posing dramatically. "Due to a massive crossover event involving all the X-Books, the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, oh, and a time turner; I was thrust back in time to assist the Invaders in defeating Hitler and the Third Reich. There on shore leave I made sweet, sweet love to your mother before I returned to my time. 'Thrust' is such a cool word. It always sounds dirty, but most of the time it isn't. Funny, huh? Search your feelings, you know this to be true."

  A certain young wizard ends up at 4 Privy Drive instead of 4 Privet Drive. He is raised with loving care by a cuddly Merc with a Mouth. WARNING: now with 19.96% more Death Eaters and a Rodent of Death.
