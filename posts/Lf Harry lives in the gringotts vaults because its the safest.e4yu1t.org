**** Thats a false misleading comment. Ijust tead the whole story and at no point does harry get a ship or swim around naked with girls in piles of gold. He does get raped at some point but its anti climantic

** So I skimmed through the story and it seems Harry is sexually assaulted, objectified, bullied, kidnapped, raped, and tortured. And few other characters even seem to care.\\
Does the author have some kind of degradation fetish? Or is it some terrible attempt at humor? Harry being naked and exposed seems to a running "gag" throughout the entire thing. I didn't laugh.

*** Author was making a point.

And they aren't wrong.

It's 2019, but if you are a man, and you attempt to claim you were sexually assualted, you won't be taken seriously. Not even with video evidence.

There is a horrific double standard, and this fic gives a nod to it, even if it wasn't completely intentional.

*** I think it was humour at first until it took a bit serious to not turn it into a full on crack fic or something.

It isnt a 'bugs bunny always wins' fic, it generally boils down to "Money and Fame" is "Power he knows not". It showed the harassment some celebrity faced since fame is a double edge sword. In a way it showed how things could go so wrong. Unlike most fic, Harry did get consequences for his action but he had support.

It became a dumbledore-teacher bashing that showed how non chalant they are to student harassment Harry suffers. It's the 'hes a celebrity he had it coming', 'im a teacher, im always right' or 'its not rape, he is a boy' mentality.

**** Ironically it still turned out cracky due to how strange and over the top everyone was acting.\\
I mean yes, it could've been a commentary on society's double standards and overall objectifications of celebrities (like Emma Watson's 18th birthday countdown). But based on the writing quality the author doesn't seem to posses the subtlety to pull that off. And the out if nowhere torture just looks like it was added to artificially create an opportunity for Dumbledore bashing.

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.
