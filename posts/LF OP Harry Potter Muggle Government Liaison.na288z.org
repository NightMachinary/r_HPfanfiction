:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a post Hogwarts story where the muggle government finds out what Hermione did to her parents which leads them to mistrust the magicals. They only work with Harry because he offered to give up his wand when dealing with them, and even though he didn't need it and they knew that, they appreciated the respect he was showing to them. He's OP because he doesn't need a wand to do purposeful magic unlike canon. I don't remember anything after that in the story and that is just the beginning.

Edit: I found it. It's called The Only Sound is the Overflow by Cartonsofcartoons. The above part was just a small part of it though. It's a time travel Harry MoD fic where he becomes a Hufflepuff and gets close to Cedric Diggory.


** Oooh sounds interesting
