I feel like cupboard under the stairs harry would let other mother sew buttons into his eyes in exchange for the love.


** Fun fact, while serving in the army, I did a one-month stint in a summer resort for officers. While there I volunteered to procure (pirated) DVDs with movies for the military brats (sweet, sweet leave) - so among others I got the Coraline animated movie, I'd already read the book. And you guessed it, I played it to a room full of 4 to 8 year olds. It was hilarious, like half of them ran out scared shitless when they saw the needles and the sewed eyes. Good times all around.

** It would be so good and dark though. I think what I have in mind doesn't exist yet, I might have to write it myself

** Having only just seen Coraline the other day, I feel as though I'd agree. I'm not sure how a crossover would work, though, as he'd basically disappear from the hp universe into one where nothing is really happening.

  Vernon Dursley's prospects in drills spiral down, he moves his family to a cheap flat at Pink Palace Apartments. The only catch to this place? No kids allowed. It's probably nothing. HPxCoraline (film)
