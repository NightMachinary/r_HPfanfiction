** Unfortunately, i can't recall ever reading a fic like this. The closest thing that comes to mind is linkffn(Backwards with a Purpose by Deadwoodpecker) where the Weasleys (except Ron) oppose Harry hand Ginny's seemingly precocious relationship because they don't know that Ron, Harry and Ginny are time travelers.

** There was one smut fic where Harry used life debts in the most obvious way.. so he get Ginny pregnat. [[/it's%20red%20head%20it%20must%20be%20Ron's%20so%20Ron%20was%20expelled%20from%20Hogwarts%20-%20fanfiction%20logic][The family reaction spoiler]]

Unfortunately, I don't remember the title but it should be on ficwad and the title might have something with life debts in it.

** linkffn(In Every Universe: All in One Piece) is one of my favourite Pregnant!Ginny fic. It's set during DH so Ginny doesn't go to Hogwarts (she has to hide her pregnancy for obvious reasons). It's still good though.
