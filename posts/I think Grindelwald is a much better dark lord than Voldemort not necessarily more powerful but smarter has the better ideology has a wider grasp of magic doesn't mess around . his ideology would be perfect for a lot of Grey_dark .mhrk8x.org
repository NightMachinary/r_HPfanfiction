what do you think about Grindelwald as a character especially when it comes to his fanfiction potential?

story idea below. thoughts ?

story idea

After the events of his first year harry thinks back to his conversation with Dumbledore & Voldemort decides if Dumbledore will keep stuff from him & both the sorting hat and voldemort think he could be great he'll actually start studying ect . Dumbledore is Not manipulative here just misguided and trying to keep a child innocent ( I don't want to use this trope)

He remembered the other wizard he read about Grindelwald so decides to research him coming across his ideals ect he finds this sensible charismatic wizard who only wants whats best for everyone.

He gets sucked in spending 2nd year buckling down glowing closer to Hermione who gets curious & also falls into the ideology after malfoys mudblood comment & researching the bigoted ministry wizanagmont & so on. Ron they both distance from due to the car incident. The chamber is resolved when Dumbledore is summoned back after Ginny is taken into the chamber

3rd year is interesting

point 1 Sirius was a secret believer of Grindelwald (due to his grandfather & seeing what the purblood ideology ended up doing. (still loves Harry fought against Voldemort and so on)

point 2. Sirius escapes but Barry crouch also frees his son months earlier

After meeting with the minister harry realizes maybe with his fame though he still hates it he can use it to his advantage so begins a correspondence with fudge. & finding out about his wizanagmont seat due to the order of merlin he received as a baby for killing voldemort he begins to plan on changing laws through public opinion & appearance at the wizanagmont next year. (No lord potter black ect)

Harry also learns he is a seer like Grindelwald. (hence why the centaurs saved him first year) So expanded divination (I think it could be cool) Harry Hermione & now Ginny actively start recruiting Muggleborns to the cause who are more than sympathetic due to the chamber last year.

this is we're they meet luna. who tells harry about the deathly hallows & shows the story book. Harry easily makes the connection & starts trying to find the other 2 hallows enlisting the help of Trelawney.

At this point Dumbledore starts turning his attention to Neville instead as he sees Neville as far more full of love than harry by this point + his uncle is a unspeakable as well

3rd year continues mostly as in canon. with a battle between Remus Peter & Sirius allowing Peter to escape & lupin becoming a firm Dumbledore supporter . Sirius also escapes & heads to number 12. during this year harry & ginny grow closer due them both being affected by voldemort.

4th year

harry now having left his relatives forever goes to number 12 & begins training learning some of Grindelwalds signature spells & becoming more & more like him.

with voldemort now beginning his return Grindelwald escapes having received a vision of his return & harry fighting him Grindelwald makes contact with harry & Sirius at about the time the death eaters attack the world cup. its at this point harry learns Dumbledore has the elder wand he receives one of gregovichs duplicates (not as powerful but a threstal tail hair definitely works better for harry) training continues

Dumbledore recalls the order of the phenoix at longbottom manor managing to heal frank & Alice through a combination of phenoix tears & the elder wand.

the Triwizard tournament proceeds as in canon though with a far more competent & trained harry + his seer abilities

thats all I have so far. thoughts?


** I'd say the only difference between the two was that Grindelwald believed all wizards were superior (no matter what blood you had) to muggles and therefore wizards should naturally rule over them. Voldemort on the other hand's end goal was to exterminate/enslave all muggles, muggle-borns and squibs and that he himself would be the supreme being in all of society. I'd say that Voldemort is more powerful than Grindelwald at his peak though.

** Voldemort: Disturbance in Britain, didn't even topple a single government (until his revival I guess), dies to a newborn baby. Has no nose.

Grindelwald: International war, Caused WWII(probably), Epic eyes + hair, forced TONS of wizarding governments to unite and create the ICW, Stood up to Voldemort after rotting in a cell for fifty fucking years, only lost to the greatest wizard of all time who was also his friend/lover. Has a nose.

Yeah. Seems pretty clear who was the better Dark Lord. Voldemort failed the Evil Overlord List test.

*** I agree with you but it is also important to keep in mind that Voldemort was actively opposed by Albus Dumbledore since the start of his rise of power. In Grindelwald's case, Albus didn't join the fight against him until quite later. Moreover, Grindelwald was temporarily captured by a magizoologist while Voldemort was temporarily killed by an hitherto unknown power of either a desperate and intelligent mother or a child of prophecy.

** While most people call them magical Hitlers, I prefer to compare them with Lenin and Stalin. Grindelwald is like Lenin, a charismatic revolutionary who wants to enslave Muggles for "their own good". He is a man of the people and is very proactive and basically voices the secret thoughts of most wizards which makes him very popular. Voldemort on the other hand is like Stalin. He is alone at the top and rules with an iron fist. He got his supporters based on an ideology he doesn't really care about and just uses it to gather power. He would also rather be feared than loved.

** The /Fantastic Beasts/ movies have ruined Grindelwald for me. I think that anytime you make the one trying to prevent the Holocaust the bad guy in your story, you've completely fucked up.

*** Well, they weren't very good movies. But this line of reasoning is kind of bad because you're making some assumptions that aren't really in evidence.

First, do we actually know that he was intending to prevent the second world war and holocaust rather than just using them in an attempt to frighten people into supporting him and gain more power? Lots of people gain support by pointing to problems or dangers (often even by inventing them), but have zero intention of actually addressing them.

Second, even if he was not, do we actually know that he could have prevented them? Prophecy in the Harry Potter universe can be self-fulfilling (ex. the prophecy about Harry), so it's entirely possible that merely seeing the future would result in him taking actions that would ensure it would come to pass. I don't think there are any canon examples of this not happening. All the prophecies we know to be real came true. Even time travel could not prevent Trelawney's second prophecy from coming to pass.

Third, even if he did intend to prevent it and it could be done...at what cost would it be? Do recall, what Grindelwald would present as the solution would be the enslavement of all non-magical humans as that was his ideology - magical supremacy. Quite possibly such a state would exist for many generations, if not forever, considering the power imbalance and ease with which any disobedience, rebellion, escape, or even undesired speech could be put down with magic. I would say that the enslavement of all magical humans is not justified to prevent a war, even if millions would otherwise be killed, particularly as I'm quite sure the world's population was not consulted as to whether they would be alright with such a bargain.

Personally, I think that Grindelwald, being a magical supremacist, didn't give a damn about the war or the holocaust. Most who died would have been non-magical people and he did not care for them, he thought them inferior and wanted to enslave them. He probably only brought it up to scare people about how non-magical people were dangerous and need to be controlled, preferably by someone like him.

** I don't think that the Grindelwald of the original books and the one of the movie are actually the same (the movies did what they wanted with the character disregarding many things).

As a whole i must say i'm still more attached to Voldemort as a character, we get some of his POV in the books and it is quite interesting to elaborate and overthink his mentality while we don't have a lot to work with Grindelwald since what we know are the few scenes in the books and some speech in the movies, not much to analyze.

I think that Grindelwald has the potential to surpass Voldemort but as of now i think Voldemort is stullthe more compelling and fearsome DL.
