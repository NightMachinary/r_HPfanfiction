Hello everyone! Just want to know what everyone's opinion was of FBaWtFT was. Especially in relation to the fandom. Are the characters developed enough to keep your interest? Is there enough of a fascination to write about it?

I will not state my opinion here because i want to hear everyone elses not people replying to my opinion.

Thanks in advance!

God, we need a better acronym for it

Newt's got potential. The expansion upon Grindewald certainly does too. I can see the Newt-Tina and Newt-Jacob shippers at war already.

Pretty sure some we'll get more out of it than we did out of Cursed Child, though that's analog to me saying that Jurassic World is the best Jurassic Park sequel. Really not that high of a praise, is it?

** I think the idea of Newt dealing with dragons on the Eastern Front of WW1 deserves a bit of attention.

Something also tells me that him acquiring Frank was it's own fun adventure.

Newt as a magical Indiana Jones who focuses on animals instead of artifacts could also be fun.
