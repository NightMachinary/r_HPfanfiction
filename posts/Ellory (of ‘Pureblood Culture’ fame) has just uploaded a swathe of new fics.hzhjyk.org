Harry Potter meets Jane Austin! It is the very best of its kind, and now there's more! They've been MIA for THREE YEARS! And now they're back, with a host of fics in the same wonderful lines to the same beautiful standards. Seriously, if you're a fan of pureblood politics, and culture and romance, either you should already know of these fics, or you are seriously missing out.

Now go! Get to reading!
