It is somewhat a weird request, but considering all the weird types of weird fanfics people have written, I have not found any good fic which delves somewhat into harry embracing parseltongue well enough.

Harry may be dark/light, I dont mind either, although darker shades of harry are generally more fun to read.

Also just recently found this sub and having been a huge fan of fanfic (at one point it was my only vital support system) I'm really excited to see what it has to offer.


** Linkffn(If looks could kill)

After Arthur almost got killed by Voldemort's snake, Harry decides that a magical snake that follows your orders is a pretty damn good assassination weapon and breeds two dozen basilisks equipped with voice activated gadgets as his secret weapon against Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

** linkffn(Magical Relations)

Harry uses his parseltongue abilities to convince his snake familiar to guard and protect him as well as search for people based on their scent. He also ends up teaching parseltongue to Snape in exchange for dueling training. It's a pretty fun read! Starts out lighthearted, but gets darker as it progresses.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648]])\\
From the second fic in the series, Sarcasm and Slytherin series has Harry using parseltongue to get Hogwarts snakes to do minor services for him and he also gets a snake familliar. It is not the main focus of the story though.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor)

A bit of a crack fic that is Hermione focused, but it does include Harry embracing parseltongue and him and Hermione teaching it to Ron.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

** linkffn(9774121) This qualifies---technically. SPOILER! Later on in the story (like /much/ later on), Harry sets traps for snatchers with snakes. It's a short bit, so nothing major, but nonetheless quite interesting.

** Partially kissed hero, "Harry Potter and the Grangers take on the world" and "Harry Potter and the children of change" are all fics that abuse parseltongue, along with Faery Heroes, Death's Pride and basically any other hhr fixfic with a powerful harry. I didn't list the fics that use parseltongue for sex. The most egregious are by Stargatesg1fan and are weird af. Don't Google those. Also can't forget cloneserpents and the pwp "HP and the Sword of Gryffindor" he created that is so unreadable due to the fact that the porn completely erases the plot on a scale worse than an hp/lv mpreg fic that I enjoy.
