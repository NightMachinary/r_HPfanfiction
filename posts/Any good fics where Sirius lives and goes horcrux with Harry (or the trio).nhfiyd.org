Oops *going horcrux hunting Thank you!!


** linkao3(draw me after you (let us run) by toastranger) the plus side is that it's Sirius and Harry running away together to protect the prophecy and going Horcrux Hunting, the possibly con side is that it's a Tomarry fic which isn't everyone's cup of tea.

#+begin_quote
  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”
