Specifically, it's going to be my first attempt at an OC. It's a sidestory pairing but it will be OC and Fleur. So I'm curious about things to avoid when writing OCs. I'm not overly worried, since my character is based off someone I know very well, but I still wanted to ask you guys for some tips.


** My best suggestion would be going back and rereading the sections of canon where characters are introduced in the last few books (Slughorn, Umbridge, Tonks, etc.). I think one of Rowling's strengths is quickly and efficiently introducing new characters through Harry's initial observations and those first conversations.

*** I'll definitely do that when they actually come across each other, probably in the next chapter of the mainline(Harry Pov). The first one is set in Goblet which I deviated from Canon for the sake of preserving the romcom aspects without overly serious tones, and I've already written the one from Harry's view. This chapter puts Arien in the spotlight, and offers insight into who he is in a organic setting. I did just release a rough composite psych profile on his character ahead of time in order to provide a basic understanding ahead of time so they aren't totally in the dark.

**** Here is a video I remember that walks through how a movie introduces numerous characters quickly and effectively. [[https://youtu.be/-gu8GQOJhdA]]
