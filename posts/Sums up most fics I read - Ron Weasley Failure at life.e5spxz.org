With all the ron bashing and Flag carrying Harmony groups out there it just blows my mind that Ronald Weasley is now basically known for being a angry idiot who can't talk with out food in his mouth.

RIP Ron Weasley: Failure at life


** I love Ron, and hate he's so disliked or underappreciated. I really do blame the movies in this regard, having Hermione be perfect at pretty much everything, and even stealing some lines that Ron said in the books.

I also blame the movies for getting people thinking that Sirius only saw Harry as James, when that was really just the movies that focused on that.

While Molly made a few remarks about it in the books, she did not like Sirius at all, perhaps because she still saw him as a mass murderer, I don't know, but I remember that Sirius and Molly did not get along in the books at all.

But yeah, back at your point, I really do love Ron, anyone who has great characterization of Ron, in stories, let me know.

As I recall, Molly fully accepted Sirius was innocent. She saw him as wildly, dangerously reckless.

She does confront Sirius, from the way he talks about Harry. "He's not an adult either! He's not James, Sirius!...I don't think you do! Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it's like you've got your best friend back!"

It's also worth mentioning that Harry himself doesn't particularly mind Sirius potentially seeing him this way, until he's back at Hogwarts and Sirius is willing to risk detection to see Harry at Hogsmeade.

"You're less like your father than I thought. The risk is what would have made it fun for James."

** Time for me to make some huge generalisations.

This sub is a statistical anomaly, having a slight male majority whereas I think the majority of fan fictions are written by teenage girls.

I think there are a large number of teenage girls who write fanfiction that relate to Hermione.

I think there are a large number of teenagers (and adults too but especially teenagers) who believe that being right is more important than being nice. Someone being wrong isn't a crime, but they can't help but feel like ignorance or an innocent mistake is something that /must/ be fought. I think that these people often come across as self-righteous, obnoxious and struggle in some social situations. A bit like Hermione. Most teenagers lack self-awareness, part of growing up is looking back and saying bloody hell I was a bit thick back then. With age comes nuance. Sometimes its better to be happy than right. Ignorance is bliss and all that. I would say a lot of them fail to see Hermione's flaws as negatives at all, and the movies don't help this either.

If you value being right above all else, perhaps even equate being informed and aware with being a good person, it is easy to see how Hermione could be construed as a great person while Ron, who prefers to be happy is a bad person. Ron revels in his ignorance, he prioritises other things in life. To him knowing things and being right just doesn't matter that much. Once you've established in your mind he's a bad person because of the different goalposts you're playing with, how do you show that? We all know that in good writing you need to show not tell. Well, if he's a bad person it's not out of character for him to do bad things and thus we get love potion/rapist Ron, jealous Death Eater Ron etc, because nuance is beyond them.

You have a situation where Hermione is a good person, brilliant in all things the author values, and then they're told that she should end up with Ron who is terrible at what they value and it offends them. They want better for themselves/Hermione and vent that in their fanfiction.

I like Ron, think he'd make the best friend out of any of them. He's not going to cure cancer, change the world but he'll put a smile on your face at the end of a long hard day and that makes him a great friend.

*** I would add that it's not quite accurate to see Hermione as being completely socially awkward - of the trio, she's often the one to notice iffy subjects that the other two run right into.

For instance, she's the one to notice in book 4 that Neville wasn't comfortable during the lesson on the Unforgivable curses - or, she's much more in tune with the reactions of the women around them than Harry/Ron (of course, they /are/ teenagers, so it's normal that she can see why, for instance, Cho takes some of what Harry does a certain way).

It's a nuance that I see a lot of the discussion on here miss - Ron can be flippant in a way that he misses the effect some of his comments, jokes, and actions have on his friends or others. He definitely is a great friend, and the most normal of the trio - and he's got a great sense of humor, which most fics unfortunately ignore.

***** Well, people are complicated - Hermione /can/ certainly be abrupt and have social issues, but they tend to be (from what I see) as when it's related to another issue that she's invested in. For instance, her response to the pet dying is because it's related to Divination, and she focuses more on her feeling towards Divination instead of how Lavender feels about her pet.

That's certainly a flaw in Hermione - but I was more pointing out that her social interaction flaws aren't a default, she's not always blundering and hurting peoples' feelings/not understanding them. She does so if she gets caught up in something - a cause she cares about, something she feels important about, etc, but she can be very astute in other situations.

Just like how Ron can be very empathetic in some scenes, and in others be very hurtful - social interactions should be fairly varied.

** There was a great thread a few months back asking what Ron was /really/ like in canon :

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c01jqp/tired_of_ron_bashing_lets_discuss_what_ron/][Link]]

I'll repeat what I said then, as Ron is a character who doesn't get nearly enough credit:

- Ron's likes/dislikes

Ron likes being part of a group. He likes the idea of "us." He's always inviting Harry to spend time at the Burrow. He plays chess with Harry and Hermione (and wins!). Even when he's arguing with Harry in /Goblet of Fire,/ he quickly strikes up a rapport with Dean and Seamus. His career ambition is to be an Auror, part of a /team/ of Dark Wizard hunters.

What Ron doesn't like is being /outshone./ He doesn't like it when others make themselves "big." But that doesn't mean he's critical of success. He's quick to praise Hermione as "best in the year," treating such a claim as common knowledge. What he doesn't like is when Hermione plays the role of "know-it-all" (and Hermione is no saint in that regard). He openly notes the accomplishments of his brothers. But he's antagonistic towards Percy the Prefect for being a pompous prat.

Ron likes good food. He likes being taken care of. And he also likes taking care of others--he writes to Mrs. Weasley to say that Harry wasn't expecting much for Christmas. While he certainly didn't expect her to send a sweater, we can reasonably assume he expected some sweets or perhaps some baked goods. He repeatedly invites Harry and Hermione to the Burrow, and welcomes them with open arms. He enlists Fred and George to help him rescue Harry from Privet Drive.

What Ron doesn't like is not being comfortable--he reacts the most harshly to the poor conditions of the Horcrux Hunt. But that's because he's cold, hungry, and slowly healing from a bad injury.

- Ron's Insecurities

The bulk of Ron's insecurities stem from his role in his family. He says as much--everything he does won't be as impressive, because it's already been done by his older brothers.

Bill is a Curse Breaker for Gringotts--which takes a lot of lessons from difficult subjects like Arthimancy.

Charlie is a dragon tamer and was Quidditch Captain.

Percy is very smart and very driven and likely had his nose in a book throughout most of Ron's childhood.

Fred and George are two peas in a pod and are always together and pull pranks and invent things and are on the Quidditch team as beaters. They are two halves as a whole.

Ron watched each brother, one after the next, develop these identities. Each one different, each one sought to stand out from the rest, and each succeeds in his field of choice.

Ron sees all this success and balks. He's got not only the expectations of everyone, but also the fear of "What if I /can't/ do this?" that none of his older brothers would have. Bill and Charlie were the eldest and paved the way with their passions; Percy immersed himself in making connections and amassing prestige; Fred and George stand side-by-side, forever.

How could Ron not be insecure about that? Harry /wants/ to be Just Harry. Ron sees himself as Just Ron.

- Biggest misconceptions

Ron Weasley is not a Death Eater.

Yes, he's rude. Yes, he is a bit of a glutton. Yes, he has some biases.

But he is not a Death Eater.

He is not overly lazy.

He does not hold Harry or Hermione back. If anything, he's the heart of the trio.

- Fears

Having grown up in the Wizarding World, Ron is simultaneously the most prone to superstitions (the Grim, the "powdered dragon root") but also the one who knows just how bad some people can be.

Dolohov killed his uncles, Gideon and Fabian Prewett. Ron would be too young to remember them. Ron knows the cost of war.

Within his personal relationships, Ron fears being left behind. He's seen his eldest brothers succeed and then leave home to bigger, better things.

- Other insights

While Ron is not without his biases, he's also not one to hold grudges. He's quick to try to bury the hatchet--his prolonged fight with Hermione over Scabbers notwithstanding (though it's worth noting that Hermione doesn't actually say she's sorry either).

Ron holds stereotypical views of giants and werewolves and house elves, until he gets to know them on a one-on-one basis. He develops a friendship with Dobby, giving him a pair of socks and a sweater. This is in stark contrast Hermione, who stands on a soapbox and ignores what the house elves actually say.

- Things he values

Ron values family. A lot. And he also values chivalry.

Over and over and over again, we see Ron step up to the plate when someone is in trouble and risks his neck to help.

He stands up to Malfoy from the beginning, putting a target on his back for Malfoy's taunts for six years.

He is instrumental in fighting the troll on Halloween.

He helps Hagrid with feeding Norbert, and gets bitten by the dragon for his trouble.

He follows the spiders, his greatest fear, into the Forbidden Forest and comes face to face with dozens of them.

He confronts Professor Snape's biases against Hermione the Know-it-All /two years/ before Harry shouts at Professor Umbridge.

Upon realizing he has let Hagrid down with Buckbeak, Ron pours over books in the library, taking over from an over-worked, exhausted Hermione.

He stands on a */broken leg/* and stares down "mass-murderer" Sirius Black, boldly declaring his intent to die for his friend.

He helps Harry study for the Second and Third Tasks, sacrificing his own valuable study time.

He joins Dumbledore's Army, despite the very precarious situation his father is in at work.

He fights in the Department of the Battle of Mysteries.

He fights in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.

He /shoots to kill/ during the Battle of Seven Potters, saving Tonks's life.

He dives into a pool of freezing water in the dead of winter to save Harry's life.

He fights throughout the Battle of Hogwarts, and is one of the most outspoken in defying Voldemort himself.

Hermione speaks for justice--but she's got a vicious streak to her that undermines her case, as she is more than willing to abuse others to get her way.

Ron fights for justice and is willing to kill but is not nearly so grey is his methods.

Ron Weasley is a Gryffindor among Gryffindors.

I salute him.

**** I don't ship H/Hr and I never will, but I've written and read some realistic R/Hr breakups, even though R/Hr was probably one of the first pairs I ever shipped.

There's this one Hermione/Cormac fic that has Ron/Hermione breaking up because Hermione was controlling his life and Quidditch career and he needed space. I thought that worked well with Hermione's existing personality traits and could easily see her micromanaging lead to that, especially with post-war trauma. Reading a fic dealing with that, rather than perfect Emma Watson, was interesting and I'd like to see more like it.

I personally wrote a Seamus & Ron friendship fic where Ron realises, through developing a friendship away from the trio, that he and Hermione were drawn together because they both have super low self-esteem and are slightly codependent. He and Hermione become very close friends instead of lovers and she develops a crush on Neville.

Or alternatively, I feel like more fics should have Ron come out of the closet. He was afraid of Molly, wizarding families expect children etc. Have him live his true self with Neville/Draco/Dean/all of the above. Hermione respects him coming out but still has to deal with the aftermath. One of my fics has Hermione leaving Ron because she knows he's into divorced!Harry and will never come out if he has the excuse of not breaking up his family.

TLDR there's a ton of ways to break up couples without bashing. I came up with most of these even though I genuinely like R/Hr.

My version of Ron is basically a poor kid who finds himself roped into Harry's crazy plans to free Sirius (and possibly usurp the Ministry) and really trying to make sure Harry doesn't die because of some random suggestion Ron had when he and Harry were talking.

** Ron Weasley. Comes from a large, well-respected family.\\
Despite tight finances, attended 6 years at the most prestigious magical school in Britain.\\
He became a prefect at said school, joined and (eventually) excelled in his house's sports team, and won a special award after helping to expose the culprit behind a series of violent attacks on the student body.\\
When his government was taken over in a coup by terrorists, and his two best friends became targets, Ron left his 7th year at school to travel with and help protect them, saving their lives and participating in several operations to free captives taken by the terrorists and destroy dangerous weapons created by the terrorist leader.\\
After surviving a battle in which the terrorists' leader and most of his high ranking officers were killed, ending the coup, Ron went on to work in special law enforcement for a couple of years, before retiring to support a business run by one of his older brothers.

**** Ehhh 8 months ago? And Harry thought it was jealousy but it was more like being worried Harry was leaving him behind. I know the situation, but I think abandoning Harry during his pariah period was at least shitty enough to justify actually talking about it with Harry, especially because Harry, and a lot of the fandom, continues to believe Ron is a lot more jealous of Harry's fame than he is.

** */Sorry for the bashing of teenage boys/*

I just can't forgive Ron for abandoning Harry (TWICE!!!) when he needed him the most. It doesn't make him a bad person, but I do think it makes him a terrible friend.

Other than that, all of his flaws are a teenage boy being a teenage boy. Rude, tactless, disgusting (eating with his mouth open) and so on. He's probably also stinky and has a bar-mitzva-stache. My brother has the exact same condition, yet I don't think he's the devil reincarnated (even if it sometimes smells that way).

TL:DR - Ron is a shitty friend. Shitty friend =\= evil nor stupid. Ron's other flaws are very common in teenagers.

*** Do realise that being a good friend is not the same as ignoring all your own needs for that friend. Ron often sets aside his own insecurities for Harry, but the two times he left Harry are the times those insecurities come to a boil (one time naturally, in fourth year, and one time aided by Horcrux). Being a friend is very important but destroying yourself to be one is not helping anyone. Ron has thoughts and feelings and if Harry cannot forgive him for that then it is arguably Harry who is the bad friend.

**** Why do his needs need to correspond with hurting Harry? /Abandoning/ Harry? He could say "I need some space", not "you're a liar and an attention seeker". It's ok to have thoughts and feelings, it's not ok to not care if you hurt the people around you for how you react to these thoughts and feelings. We've seen him being deliberately hurtful in arguments throughout the books, we've never seen him give a proper apology (I'll give you that it's possibly just because JKR didn't waste the words on it). If, as you said, his friendship with Harry is hurting him - he shouldn't be Harry's friend, if he decides to stay anyway - it's only right he'll be a reliable friend. I personally wouldn't be able to trust him, I'll be wondering when is the next time I'll need him and he won't be there.

Idk if the horcrux counts as an excuse or not, we honestly don't have enough information to know it.

Giving y'all more reasons to downvote:

Although, thinking about it, Ron is actually the one of the trio that has the most character. Harry and Hermione are much more bland (this is possibly why we can only have this discussion about Ron).
