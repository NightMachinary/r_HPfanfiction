Just like the title says. I see a lot with Harry going back or his parents going forward, but not with Harry going forward to say after the war. Doesn't even have to be Harry, just someone from his generation.

** linkffn(Browncoat Green Eyes by nonjon) is a good fic in that regard.

Harry puts himself in a magical sleep and isn't woken until later, on a different planet. And there is no sign of the wizarding world.

The worldbuilding of this fic is absolutely great, the rest is above average at least.\\
If you usually like stuff by nonjon, this fic is for you.

(You don't need to have watched Firefly or the movie Serenity to follow the plot)

** That would actually be a cool prompt for Pottermum.

Something along the lines of Harry, on his 18th birthday is somehow tossed 18 years into the future and has to deal with his disappearance and how it affected everyone. Ginny could have spent the time since he disappeared casually dating but focused more on her career than on deep romantic relationships given that she and Harry were very much together when he disappeared and she never got over her tragic love.

18 year old Harry trying to regain some of what he had with now 35 year old Ginny could be a fascinating and all together sappy and fluffy piece, possibly dealing with witches and wizards retaining their youth longer than with their muggle counterparts or the fact that they'd both technically be at their respective sexual peaks in this scenario. I actually like this the more I think about it, though I am no writer myself.

My thought was that as time went on she'd simply throw herself into her career as a chaser and then a columnist, only ever dating casually.

**** The same Ginny who hung around for Harry while he's off saving the world? We're talking about the Ginny who wanted to marry Harry since she could read? Describing her like that makes her sound a tad stalkerish but its more likely that she'd hand around.

***** Every girl in wizarding world fancied the boy-who-lived. We were only given Ginny's perspective. Ginny grew up and dated several person before Harry noticed her. If Harry died or disappeared, she would mourn at first, then moved on. Say if they broke up by 20, Ginny would have moved on more easily than Harry.

*** I could see a premise.

Lucious fumbles the plant of the Diary on Ginny and has Draco do it the next year. He plants it on Hermione instead. Harry gets pulled back in time randomly throughout the year and they eventually figure out it happened whenever Hermione used the time turner while holding the horcrux. They discover that souls are time linked.

Harry does some digging on his own. You can only go back in time an hour but he doesn't see any restrictions on going forward. Later on he decides to fall on his own sword by tossing himself to the future and taking Voldemort with him.

  Heavily AU. Thanks to a cold, humanity never discovers the Prothean ruins on Mars, and barely develops Mass Effect technology. They step out onto the galactic stage after the Reapers have harvested every other species, and find the crumbs left behind by the turians, asari, and salarians. Now they must adapt to fight a foe who won't be seen for far longer than human history.

*** Just want to second Next Lord of Kobol. I'm currently following, and it's a great read.

You don't really need any knowledge of Battlestar Galactica to follow, as only the last couple of chapters have even included anyone recognizable from the series.

Great bit of world building, and so far a really fun ride.
