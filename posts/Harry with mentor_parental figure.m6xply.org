** A Marauder's Plan. I think you'll find it on FanFiction.Net. It's basically covers Sirius staying back in England after breaking out to raise Harry. It's got pretty high reviews, too. 5k+, I think.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1037432/chapters/2069217][*Dead Man Walking*]] (~ 57k) Regulus becomes his mentor of sorts. Though I am fairly sure the work is abandoned same as [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668?view_full_work=true][*C'est La Vie*]] (~ 102k, Bill is mentioned as past mentor, Harry is under apprenticeship of the Ancient Runes teacher. But I don't think she counts as parental figure ...) The author is still active just not in HP.

Otherwise in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15863055/chapters/36953667][*In the Name of the Brave*]] (~ 80k) Harry sees Regulus (a teacher in this) as this sort of person to respect and comes to him in need. But so far (also incomplete /sigh/) he isn't his mentor or anything so perhaps not what you are looking for. If the author continues it one day, I am sure their relationship is gonna evolve in a more personal way.

I know there is this long wbwl story in which Harry is older than his brother and (I think) in Ravenclaw. His mentor/parental figure is an old man and Harry manages to achieve a starter career in Quidditch while still in school. I'm sure I could find it if you're interested.

Lastly, I remember one where Harry is a little transfiguration prodigy and is under McGonagall's apprenticeship. But I dunno where to find it.

At least I think that's the McGonagall one. But I'm not sure if he is apprenticed since I never actually read it completely.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
