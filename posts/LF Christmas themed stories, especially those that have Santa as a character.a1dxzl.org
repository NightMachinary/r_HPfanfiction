** This would be so cute and good yes SANTA why can't he be real in a magical world? :o What if Santa is a wizard who uses levitation charm on sleigh and also reindeers are magic reindeers who are super smart and also he does just use chimney expansion charms to go up and down them! :) What if he also does really live in the North Pole? :o Also he would probably just have to use Time Magic to get around to all the houses in one night! :) And there is time spells besides time turners so it is possible!

Or you could make Santa a unique magical being all on his own! :)
