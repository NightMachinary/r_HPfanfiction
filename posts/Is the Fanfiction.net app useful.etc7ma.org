** I use it fairly regularly. I like that I can see all of my reading history and can download fics to read and bookmark. It's really good at keeping track of where you're at in a fic, particularly longer ones. And it flags updates on the ones you're reading which I like.

*** Well, the reason I found the app kind of annoying is probably I need to save all the fanfiction I previously read from the browser, I should probably start reading from the app now.

**** Yeah I stopped using the browser once I found the app and figured out what it was good for. I can book mark the paragraph I'm on, and check in with all the fics I'm reading without having to subscribe to them. Sometimes the app doesn't work at all and I can't access shit, but I live with spotty internet so being able to download stories is worth it to me. The search feature is horrible, but at the end of fics the app recommends similar things to read and that is nice.

** The app is a big bonus for ff over ao3 in my opinion. I've linked ff.net links directly to the app, if I click one it directly opens in the app, where I download it. Keeps track of updates and where you are. Search is atrocious for searching for new stories as well as looking in your downloads. The big selling point of the official app over alternatives is cloud backup & sync of the list of your story status. This also allows for jumping between devices when reading.

** It's where I read /all/ of my fics. I must have about 800 fics downloaded xD

When I click a fic in the chrome app, it auto opens into the ff app and from there I download it.

** I use it for the built in text to speech button. The monotone voice of British English 2 on Android calms me.

** I use it a lot. You can't really use a web browser to read when you're travelling, as you won't be able to go to the next chapter if you're in the wrong place, and web sites are never as well designed for small screens as apps are.

** I would say it is VERY useful, you can download stories for offline stuff (useful for flights) and it has a night mode (white text on black background) which makes reading at night easier. In addition it has a load of inclusive features if you have difficulty reading (such as changing the font and size). There is also an autoscroll.

** What I do is I find my fics on whatever web browsers and favorite them and now I have the app keeping track of all my stories.

** I find it really good for archiving five for later, and sometimes old fics will update so that's always a pleasant surprise.

** There's plus and minus... For one the searching function is really annoying, for another, I like to be able to download all the stories I might want to read or is currently reading so that I can read them later offline. Especially as it update automatically when we have internet connection.

** It's not great but I like searching on it a lot more than on the website because it allows you to go straight to fandom and search for key words That and offline reading

** On my phone (samsung) when clicking a link in the reddit app, it opens in an odd browser, i just click the menu button, hit the lowest option (open in browser/chrome) then it tries to open in chrome, but gets redirected to the app instead. No hassle to save/find fics when clicking links, just need to tell it to open the fic in a browser that is not reddit-chosen.

** I'm not a fan of the app. The only thing that I can do on the app that I can't do on a laptop is edit document names. If I want to save a fic I can just use Omnibuser.

** It's not the best app, and certainly not better than the website, for 1 the search is a travesty, but it's good to keep track of and download works. I've found myself in AO3 more frequently at the moment, but FF.net is still useful for making sure you've read up to a certain point and tracking what stories you're reading

** Reddit automatically previews links when they are clicked. Then you need to tap on 3 dots in top right corner and select view it in browser. It will then ask you which app, select ff.net app, and it opens the fic directly.

When I get story updates on my e-mail, it asks immediately as I click on the link which app to use (browser or ff.net).

If it doesn't ask for you and always just opens your internet browser, then you most likely have the browser as your default app to open internet links. You need to delete this default app setting, to be able to choose every time. Look up how to do it for your phone.
