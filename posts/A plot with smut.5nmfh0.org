I am looking for good stories with smut. No slash and I prefer no Harry/Hermione but as long as there is no bashing I'll read it. Kinky is fine, slaves are fine, harem is fine as long as there is some actual plot.

  Hermione needs to go back home quickly at the start of 'Order of the Phoenix', and asks Tonks to take her place that day. Tonks tries to fool Harry that she is the real Hermione, and things quickly escalate from there... (Abandoned, sorry.)

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsT1FOTDc4YlBwX0k][Harry Potter and the Secret of the Golden Unicorn]]

The basic premise is Harry inheriting a brothel from his parents. This story is basically crack, although it may not appear as such at first glance. Don't take it too seriously, have a couple of drinks and just enjoy the ride. Some parts are fun, some parts are funny, most are full of action, sexual or otherwise. And it's complete, to boot.

My only gripe with it was the author's obsession with scenes of [[/spoiler][genital torture, usually performed by witches on males - though it mostly happened to death eater scum]]. It was kind of disturbing and I freely admit I skipped almost all of those scenes.

**** It's not mine. It's a drive filled with deleted fanfics.

There's an excel file listing the fics, along with details like characters, length, author, genre and summary.
