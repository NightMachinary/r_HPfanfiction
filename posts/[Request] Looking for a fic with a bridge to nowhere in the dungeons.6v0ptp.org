I can't remember what fic it was at all, and I guess it's to vague to find by searching for it, but I remember it was a fic where Snape took /someone/ into a room in the dungeons that was a bridge to nowhere or something so that they could talk privately without being overheard. I think I remember really enjoying the fic, so it's annoying me that I can't remember which one it was.

Thanks!


** Is it linkffn(The Never-ending Road by laventadorn)?

That happens in ch 59.

**** No worries. It's one of my favourite fics and I've reread it so many times that I sort of know the events of each chapter. :D

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.
