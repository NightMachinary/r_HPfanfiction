I imagined a Scene that have the Mainchar somehow investigates to some crimes and so gets in contact with a Dubious couple or even an Organization. The Wife of the Crime suspect (or his right hand) however gets attracted to the Protagonist and gets closer to him (maybe her "Relationship" with the Husband is unsatisfying for her or she wants to quit or simply having fun, whatever) and in the end, they sleep with each other. Doesnt matter if it happens more than once or its just a one time thing.


** Not exactly what you want but you should probably read linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

#+begin_quote
  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
