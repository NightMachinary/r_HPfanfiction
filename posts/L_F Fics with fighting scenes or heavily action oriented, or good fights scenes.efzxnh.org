So...........ummm........I need some help on how to write a duel with multiple combatants on both sides fighting in a crowded area. I'm thinking maybe reading some action scenes might gimme an idea on how I go about it.


** Just some general advice:

- Tunnel vision is a thing. Inexperienced fighters are unlikely to be able to keep track of the batle as a whole - they'll focus on their immediate opponent. And even those who keep the whole picture in sight won't bother to note details, especially scenery, unless it's relevant. Detailed descriptions of the scenery will often break the flow of the scene and take the reader out of the story.

- Soldiers generally train until responses are instinctive/automatic. They won't usually stop to think something through unless they're not under direct fire - they'll react like they were trained to.

- Fights are hectic and most complicated plans and tactics will fail.

- Cover and concealment are very important. The surroundings play an important role, both in visualising the fight as well as in offering cover/concealment, and alternative ways to attack or defend.

*** The only thing that came to mind was the first lesson: Always keep moving.

And so, Harry moved. Dancing out of the way of one curse here and the other there.

"/This was not how I really imagined my first time would be./" Harry loudly said to his brother in arm as he got in cover.

The Auror in return peeked out of the ice cream stand they'd taken cover behind and fired a killing curse at one of the werewolves.

It missed. Of course it missed. It always missed. Those damn things were too damn swift.

**** "one curse here and the other there." -> "one curse here and another there." Or you could put 'the' before one as well but it wouldn't flow well.

"This was not how I really imagined" -> "This was not how I imagined" I personally find talking during fights annoying, especially whole sentences that aren't 'Look out!' or something.

Should be "brother in arms" and "to cover" unless he's getting inside something.

You used damn twice in the last line.

I don't think there's really enough there to judge the style to be honest.

PM me if you have anything longer you want advice on, I'm not a writer but happy to help.

** Wind Shear linkffn(12511998) has some of the best fight scenes I've read, though it's mainly Harry vs multiple. There is a later scene though that's a platoon of veterans of Grindelwald war vs proto-Death Eaters (the Death Eaters get curbstomped by organized resistance).

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
