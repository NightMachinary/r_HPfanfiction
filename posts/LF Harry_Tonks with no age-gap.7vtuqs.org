** linkffn(Disorder of the Phoenix)

Romance hasn't happened yet, but Harry time travels back to 1995 and the pairing will be Harry/Tonks. I think it's a pretty great fic so far.

*** That's actually what prompted me to post this. I saw it update just now, read the summary, and decided to ask here if there are others. Reading it now :)

** If you dont mind gender bender, linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fates Fool) has Harry go back, wind up as a girl, and get with Tonks. Full disclosure, the pairing is not the main focus of the story. Its there and features in a couple of plot points, but also not the puropse of the story.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** This is only a start (and likely abandoned, at that), which ends just before the sorting, but it's an interesting Harry/Tonks relationship:

** There's the R series, which came out 14 years ago. It has not aged particularly well (many of its original ideas have become overused in the last decade) but has Tonks at Harry's age and they go to Hogwarts together. While certainly not the best Harry/Tonks series out there (that title goes to Grains of Sand IMO), it is nonetheless an interesting read and exactly what you are looking for. The series covers all 7 years (in 7 fics) and the first few few years are kinda close to canon, but it is nonetheless a good read.

** By the end of linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass), time-travel plus the mind and body being each others playthings, thre is very little age gap between the two. (She's spent the whole year in a fifteen/sixteen year old form, and her magic makes her default younger to compensate.)
