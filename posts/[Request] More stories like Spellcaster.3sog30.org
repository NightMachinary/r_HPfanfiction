linkffn(Spellcaster by sgcbearcub)

I absolutely loved the idea behind this story and the way magic was approached. I'm all for world building and the basis of magic.

What I loved: how twisted the plot was

Inter-house cooperation through common goals

The idea of pureblood customs, even if complicated

Fighting against a law imposed by the ministry

Collective cultural knowledge

Blending of Muggle science with magic

Any suggestions? The longer the better, but preferably completed works only. Pairing doesn't matter.

  Hermione Granger was a witch. By the time she was done, the whole damned pureblood world was going to know it. HG/SS. Spoiler HBP

** I haven't read the fic you linked, but by a lot of the descriptions you've given, it really seems like you may enjoy linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]]).

It isn't complete, but it does update regularly.

If you absolutely need a complete fic, there's also these by the same author, but they don't fit your criteria as well as the prior: linkffn(10595005; 11102515)

**** The Star Wars thing annoyed me, too, but the fic was interesting enough for me to try and ignore it as best as I could.

The YoE, on the other hand, I found to be a really interesting aspect of a Wizarding World that has a culture unique from the canon one or the muggle one. It's one of the reasons I rec'd it, since it fit the criterion of "pureblood customs, even if complicated".

***** The problem isn't that they have the year of exploration it's that the author won't shut up about it. It comes up in like every damn conversation and thought process.

****** "Star Wars" was mentioned 14 times in over 300'000 words. Most of that was in one chapter, following its screening. Calling that "filibustering" is a tad weird, in my opinion. Especially since it hasn't been mentioned in the last 15 chapters. I picked Star Wars as the movie to follow up the Disney animations because it's a Science Fiction or Science Fantasy movie with a universal story which wizards can graps as well, and easily. And because it is a very successful and popular movie, and therefore very likely that children will love it. Unlike other movies.

The Year of Exploration comes up a bit more often - or came, until the kids were finally told the truth about it - because many teenagers in puberty are quite focused on sex, and they thought that year was all about sex.

It was looming over their relationship, mainly because lacking wizards parents, and an adult patron who knew what it was about, they didn't know the truth about it. Now that they know that it's not really a year full of orgies, where everyone is sleeping around, and everyone expects everyone to sleep around, but something quite tamer, things are different.

But then again - it has been mentioned, in total, about 40 times in the story of over 300K words. That's 40 times the word, not 40 Scenes it's mentioned in.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
