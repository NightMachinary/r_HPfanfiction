Fluffy, the basilisk, Remus ('93), or Voldemort. Doesn't matter.

He has enough small moments and a few big ones to throw the whole thing off the rails if he's removed from the story. It would be interesting to see how Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Harry adjust.

Also, if you have any reccs send them my way, please.


** Hermione remembered right before casting the spell on Professor Snape's robe an important fact. As the potion professor his robes were spelled flame proof!

It would take a powerful fire spell overcome what was surely really powerful magical enchantments!

She had read about on really powerful fire spell with the warning to be careful as it would go out of control easily.

She only wanted to cast a small fire and knew his robes would help keep the fire under control. Whispering under her breath she whipped her wand forward.

/"Ignus Gehénnam"/

Turning quickly she ran with as much stealth as she could away from the resulting fire. Afterall she did not want to be caught setting a teachers robes on fire!

Fiendfyre is of the esoteric class of magics. Much like the patronus it is influenced by more than just words and a wand.

Intent, and the spell itself greatly influence the spell in a weirdly circular way.

Fiendfyre burns everything it can for as long as the magic used in it's creation last. Everything, including the souls of its victims.

The whispered words of a 1st year student was minimal. Which is why it only burned professors Snape and Quirrel to death.

While that would have been a horrible tragedy making headlines across Wizarding Britain it was the the 3rd victim that drew headlines.

The flaming spectre of Voldemort screaming as he burned up in a flash of Fiendfyre was the star of the show.

Even young Harry passing out and then vomiting nearly twice his mass in a black sticky pile of foulness was barely noted.

It was the spectre of Voldemort screaming in pure terror as he realized the Fiendfyre was burning away the anchors on his soul.

When marked death eaters all fell in agony as their arms putrified it they were all sure. The Dark Lord was finally and surely dead.

Dumbledore was completely flabbergasted when he learned the prophecy was now fulfilled according to the unspeakables.

It took him days until he finally dug up the whole story of what had happened. Only to then cover every single track of it he could, including the distraught young girl's memory of the event.

While they were still celebrating the final victory over Voldemort soon serious questions as to who had cast the Fiendfyre would begin.

He was already setting up a spin story that would keep the girl safe. She had made a mistake in her spell selection trying to protect Harry Potter. She had acted on his behalf, as his hand, as it were. Acted out of /friendship/, something Voldemort would never truly understand.

Either way it was the beginning of the school year and he needed two professors now. He had declared a week of celebration and mourning as a result of the events. Most students hadn't bothered with any mourning at all and were celebrating all three deaths.

While Albus was sad Severus and Quirrel had not been able to redeem themselves their sacrifices had been for the much greater good. Especially as it seemed young Harry was no longer bound with whatever magic had tied him to Voldemort.

He had already returned Nicholas's stone much to the joy of the man and wife.

*** What is the rough translation of that spell? Hell fire?

**** Close enough for Harry Potter spell words.

*Ignus Gehénnam*

Ignus is a fake word-ish thing I smashed together from Ignis the root word for Fire. Then I took Ignium which is the plural possessive of fire. Putting them together translates badly into /"the fires of"/

Gehénna is a waste valley associated with Hell. Using the accusative case of it as Gehénnam means it is something being done by another, an action.

So bad translation time it equals around about to:

*"I am using(calling or summoning in this case) the fires of Hell"*

Seemed like it would fit.

Edit: also I freely admit I liked the sound of Ignus Gehénnam more than Ignium Gehénnam.

** Let's assume he dies killed by Fluffy on the Halloween night which would impact the most significantly the stories. This would lead to an investigation from the Ministry that would lead both making public the fact the philosopher's stone exists and also to the fact that Voldemort is alive. The Ministry would take charge of Voldemort and contain him but that would lead to people finding out that he is still alive which would rally most of the Death Eaters to rescue him or even if not, he does have a knack for seducing people that seek power so he could even find a helper within his guards. However that would make Dumbledore more protective of Harry and ensure that Voldemort never resurrects with Harry's blood (note that he didn't know at the time that Harry was a Horcrux or that Voldemort had any Horcruxes) and he uses Harry as a weapon against Voldemort who still remains just as arrogant as before and cannot accept that someone else but him can defeat Harry. The other alternative is that Dumbledore actually knew what was going on and deliberately planned the encounter between Harry and Voldemort at the end of PS. In this case, Dumbledore would hide Voldemort from the Ministry and the plot would go the same with the sole exception that Dumbledore knew he had to die after putting on the ring and tell Harry everything he needed to know (including his assumption that Voldemort had seven Horcruxes) ASAP. Therefore the Horcrux hunt would start from the sixth year. Alternatively Harry and the gang would get killed at the DoM because there was no one to warn Sirius that Harry flew over there to supposedly rescue him.

*** Specifically RE: the DOM thing, I believe it more likely that none of Harry's friends are injured, as *any* other professor they told wouldn't have waited - what was it - 3? 4? hours before calling in reinforcements.

God Snape was such a giant, greasy shit!

**** I think that's a continuity error on JK's part rather than a thought out omission on Snape's side since Dumbledore later says that Snape went to check on Sirius as soon as he was out of Umbridge's office.

****** He did realize they went to London. He just took forever to realize it.

So, yeah, it's possibly a continuity error, but it makes Snape look like a pos and fits in nicely with his previous actions.
