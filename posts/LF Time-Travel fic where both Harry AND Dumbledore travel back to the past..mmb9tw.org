Title say it all. I'm wondering if there are fics where Harry and Dumbledore travel to the past (either their younger-selves or not) together for whatever reason. It would be a Good!Dumbledore fic.

This definitely matches your request, just keep in mind that it's very AU. It's been a while since I read it but it's pretty good.
