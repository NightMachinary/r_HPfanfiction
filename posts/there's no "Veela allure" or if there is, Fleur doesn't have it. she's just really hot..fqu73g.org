could go Harry/Fleur, although that's not personally my cup of tea. but imagine!

"ugh, i can't resist her Veela allureâ„¢, Hermione. can you research any way to combat it?"

"Harry, it's not possible for part-Veela to possess that power. that was disproven in 1896."

"but then... why do i keep wanting to stare at her like a creeper?"

  Veela are actually harpies
#+end_quote

While there are similarities between the two the Veela are Samovila/ Samodiva from Slavic folklore. Harpies are from Greek folklore and I don't think they have a human form.

***** Fair enough. To be honest I only know of this because I read the books in Bulgarian first (I didn't know English at the time) and there were footnotes explaining the meaning of names.

** I've always liked the idea that their 'allure' is actually their natural magic energy stimulating the natural pheromones that they produce as a "half-breed".

The only difference between a full blooded and half and quarter etc. Is the amount of control and manipulation of said pheromone.

Edit; The so called 'immunity' to said allure that Harry has is actually rather common, albeit to various degrees of resistance to the various types of veela, the difference being simply cosmetic outside of their "monsterous" form, though type can be separated wholy by hair color.

Blonde veela are a different 'type' from brunette and red headed veela.

The resistance or apparent immunity is simply said persons immunity to that type of veela allure. Whether it's their biochemical make up making them immune or their magic cancelling out the allure.

So one person (I.e. Harry and Fleurs father) are resistant to so-called blonde veela though they may not be resistant or immune to redhead or brunette veela.

Food for thought...

** Additionally the supernatural appeal is connected to their dancing:

#+begin_quote
  /The Veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the Veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen .../
#+end_quote

*GOF Chapter 8.*

It's only after the dancing starts that Harry looses himself. This to me implies that the dancing acts much like a ritual or a focus for some type of innate magic.

When Harry first sees Veela, he acknowledges that they are beautiful, but cannot be human. Harry never suggests that Fleur isn't human like he did the full blooded Veela.

Fleur is just smokin' hot and surrounded by teenage males going through puberty.

*** well, duh.

but i've seen so many fics that use "Veela allure" as an attempt at a plot point or a reason to pair Fleur with another character, usually Harry, who is miraculously immune to this allure thanks to occlumency or whatever, which automatically makes her see him as a challenge or whatever. it's lazy writing and i've never actually seen a fic where it straight up doesn't exist. (edit: i've never seen a fic featuring Fleur and discussing her heritage where her "allure" didn't play a minor role in the plot. i have read numerous fics where it didn't exist, but only because those fics didn't involve Fleur very much or at all. it's a dumb trope.)

like, if the Veela at the world cup were actually doing some sort of ritual and that was what caused the effect? that would be so cool to explore.

sigh. maybe i'll just write it myself
