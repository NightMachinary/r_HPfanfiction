She can be a main, minor, side or background character, but used more positively than in canon is what I'm wanting.

Anyone can be the main character, any site, any length, old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Can be during Hogwarts, but bonus if it's after Hogwarts.

Would rather not have Weasley Bashing. No Ginny giving Harry a love potion, no Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with ‚ÄúThe List.‚Äù The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see ‚ÄúThe Last Death Eater‚Äù and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.

She's more of a background in ADP until now, but I'm giving her more "screen time" as the fic goes on. She's main in the other fic though.

Plus, both fics are still set in Hogwarts üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

  When Lavender Brown's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire as the fourth champion, no one quite knows what to make of it. Except for Harry, who firmly believes that it should have been his name coming out of the Goblet and thus vows to help her get through the tournament alive...at all costs.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.
