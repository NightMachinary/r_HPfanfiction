Like, Percy Weasley got all 12 OWLs, didn't he? Rather than using a time turner, what if he just went the simple route of taking an extra year or two to study his additional classes?

What happens if a studious Harry, or some other character, chooses to take an extra year at Hogwarts to do more electives, and ends up in class with Ginny?

Or, if specifically Harry chose to redo his 5th year Potions to get the O that Snape wants for his NEWT classes, in order to become an Auror?

You lost the wizards at "the simple route of". Why take the pedestrian, /muggle/ way of doing things, when you can use your awesome power to bend time and space for everyday conveniences?

Mind you, I /could/ see someone deciding to redo a year /a posteriori/ because they're not happy with their results. But if a trustworthy student wants to take a lot of electives from the beginning, no questions, bam, Time-Turner.

*** And in canon. He was a sixth year in Philosopher's Stone and still around in PoA. JKR acknowledged it as a mistake but created the in-universe explanation that he had to repeat his 7th year after failing all of his NEWTs.
