For June I've picked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]]. They're both a bit short, so we'll read The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks during the first two weeks of the month and The Skitterleap during the remainder. I wanted to pick The Strange Disappearance since it seemed to fit the theme quite well and it had the most votes of any of the recommended fics, but it's not long enough to devote the month to alone.


** Just finished Sally-Anne Perks.

First of all, Paimpont is a very good writer. Accessible and easy to read. The author did a great job of creating rich background details for Hogwarts. All of the ancillary characters like the Fat Lady and the Friar who don't get explained in canon have wonderful backstories that enrich the mystery. Harry and Hermione are very in character with their canon selves and I'm impressed with the lovely Third Year details that serve as a back drop to the main mystery of Sally-Anne Perkins.

Like most mysteries, the search for the answer is more fulfilling the the answer itself. Without spoilers, I found the initial mystery and wonderment more fulfilling than the reveal. It is hard to pull off and I think the lack of clues left me disappointed. The reveal is very much one that would be very hard to reach since there are no great indicators during the hunt for the answers. If there are more clues, someone please correct me, for I searched rather diligently.

But Sally-Anne Perkins is more of a character study instead of a great, spiraling mystery anyway. It works wonderfully in this manner, developing a deep history for Hogwarts as well as keeping the main characters very canon.

The prose is excellent for the most part and I'd recommend it as a pretty quick read, but I wouldn't expect some grand conspiracy. The short mystery is to the point and bittersweet.

*** I agree with pretty much everything you said. [[/spoiler][Up until the last chapter I was thinking that the resurrection stone was involved, the mirror came out of left field.]]

*** Right there with you. When I read it, I would read a certain section, say "what" or "I don't understand this" and come back to it. It did keep me on my toes and was a very good mystery fic. About the rich background of Hogwarts and such, this is almost unparalleled and very original. I enjoyed the whole thing

** I haven't read many mysteries but I would agree with KwanLi. There are too few clues available for the reader to really make solid guesses and the reveals felt like there was no chance I could have guessed them anyway.

*Spoilers*

The first part was when they learn that Sally-Anne Perks looks like Ariana Dumbledore which the reader was completely blindsided by. The second part is how Sally-Anne came out of the mirror. While this one could have potentially been a long shot lucky guess the explanation felt a bit lacking to me. The impression I always got from the Sorcerers Stone was that Dumbledore created an enchantment so that the stone would only be given to those that want it but not to use it and that he used the mirror just to find out a persons desire. This story would instead have me believe that the want it but not use it condition is an inherent part of the mirror and that it works for anything, not just the stone.

*End spoilers*

I still enjoyed it quite a bit as the writing was very solid and the mystery was fairly interesting. Easily the favorite of the three books we've read so far.

Also [[/u/denarii]], are you planning to make a separate post in two weeks to discuss the skitterleap or will we just do it in this post?

** There is no possible way that McGonagall could have been railroaded out of doling out detentions to Harry and Hermione when she discovered them in her office. That said, the absolute derailment of Snape into giving out house points to Hermione was hilarious.

[[/u/KwanLi]] really did say it all.

** From what I can remember about The Skitterleap enembee was planning on making multiple shorter books but eventually lost motivation and combined the first book and the start of the second one into one story for ff.net and added a bit of an ending. That was really my biggest problem with the story, too many things that should have been continued or expanded on in future chapters weren't and as a result the story feels somewhat incomplete despite being completed.

I liked the story well enough but in my opinion it rates on the lower end of the stuff enembee has written.

** I just read The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks. The story itself was a good one, but it missed the main trope of a good mystery: the clues were incomplete, and left a lot of the guesswork to trying to read things into canon. This is a story about a young Harry and Hermione at it's core, and as such, it's rather nice. Unfortunately, for myself this is one of those stories that doesn't leave much in the way of a lasting impression.

The Skitterleap seems like a case of a writer biting off more than they can chew. Too much information and ideas going all over the place, and while the brevity is appreciated, there was so much there that begged to be expanded and expounded upon. Definitely a thought provoking concept that I think we all toyed with at a certain point, and more developed than most, but would have been served well by being 2-3 times as long.
