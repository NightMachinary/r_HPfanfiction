I've noticed a lot of stories that feature disabilities tend to have the character be blind, deaf, or mute. I'd like to see stories in which a disabled character has a disability that isn't commonly seen in fanfiction, i.e. epilepsy, asthma, ulcerative colitis, diabetes, etc.

Any recommendations?

  COMPLETE. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.

  Voldemort and Harry Potter live on, and the 2nd wizarding war continues to rage. When the Dark Lord kidnaps Harry's son, he discovers a boy who looks less a Potter than a Riddle, raising questions about the parentage of the Muggleborn girl Harry married. Harry, reunited with the son he thought was dead, must face the fact that he is no longer the same boy. Like young Tom? Try this.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Two parents need to protect their baby and use Dark Magic. But the ritual has a negative effect and their daughter's deadly touch cannot be broken without her soulmate. When they are killed, they watch over her as she grows. But she can see them and others as well. And when Death comes along, he becomes her uncle. How will Hogwarts handle the young necromancer? Will the dead help?

** Well, there's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1651109/chapters/3501239][Text Talk]], which is a no magic Marauders AU that ships Remus and Sirius. Instead of being a werewolf, Remus has a chronic illness (finding out what it is is an entire plot thread at the start, but if you're curious it's cystic fibrosis). Most of it is told through text messages, but as it goes on there's phone calls and in-person meetings. It's very cute and fluffy throughout.
