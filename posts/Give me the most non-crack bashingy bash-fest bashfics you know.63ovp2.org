I want to be buried under irrational character hate, superman-style jumping to conclusions and characters so out of character they're practically OCs.

Slash, Crossovers and dark!characters are fine. Please no romance/smut-centric plots, mpreg, harems, genderbending or pottercest. Thank you!


** Partially Kissed Hero. Almost everyone the author doesn't seem to like are cartoonishly evil --- Not only is Dumbledore a manipulative old man, he is a child rapist. Read the TVtropes page.

**** Yes. Most of the villains (and I think all gay characters) are child rapists. Dumbledore and Snape have made horcruxes to be immortal and use loyalty potions on students. This is of course shown as a bad thing. Funnily enough, Hermione and Luna also use loyalty potions later on to get Harry a bunch of sex slaves, but that is portrayed as a good thing.

Also. Never really thought about the loyalty potion hypocriticalness before. Wow.

****** Found the link to the appropriate chapter on TVTropes:

#+begin_quote
  "Perhaps I could put it this way: Barring birth control or accident, husbands who are interested in their wives do more than have an heir and stop there. Even the muggle aristocracy have an heir and a spare, and that is using those contraceptives that are terribly illegal among us. No? Well then allow me to spell it out in gory detail: Lucius had an unhealthy interest in little boys, and *belonged to a social club whose motto is: 'Sex by eight, it's too late'.* Rabastan and Rodolphus are senior members."

  Narcissa gave them all a very direct look. "All three of them were far more interested in Draco than they ever were in me or Bellatrix."

  ...

  Luna snorted mirthfully. "Dumbledore may have founded the local chapter."

  Narcissa shrugged, feeling progress by what she'd judged of his expressions. "It's possible. *I know they socialized with him at those events.*"
#+end_quote

It's not outright said but if he's hanging out at a "social club" of this kind, there is at least the implication.

I don't remember that part well I'm afraid. I've probably suppressed those memories lol.

** [[http://www.roughtrade.org/darkly-loyal-chapters-1-5-by-keira-marcos/][Darkly Loyal]]

It's a time-travel fix-it. If by "fixing it" you mean killing /everyone/ who was ever a problem (she has a running body count. I think it's at 35 at the moment). Lots of bashing, of almost everyone, but in a highly entertaining way. And a fairly realistic portrayal of a poly relationship (Harry/Hermione/Draco), references to previous problems and everything. While there are some great sex scenes, it's definitely more than porn-with-plot.

This is a challenge site, so hopefully it'll be finished by the end of April. Looks like you can read without joining, but not comment. It's a writers' community, positive reinforcement only. And I'm pretty sure it's zero-tolerance on that point.

**** It's called Rough Trade because everything is considered a rough draft, unbetaed. It's a challenge site with a deadline, so the writers don't want to be distracted with stuff they will probably catch during an editing run, /after/ the challenge is over. So positive comments are welcome, critique is not. Nothing to distract from getting the story transferred from brain to screen.

So like your mama probably said, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. They, at least, are not begging for reviews.

****** Well it's not an archive, and never has more than a few dozen stories on it, so you're not going to see links often. The stories from this round will be there until June, then they'll be removed.

And do try Darkly Loyal. I think it's hysterical, running body count and all. It's actually from a previous round - this month's challenge is to finish one you weren't able to finish in a previous challenge. The part from before is already over 100K.

******* The stories are completely removed from the site no archive/past story or anything? If so I might make a program to download the stories on it so if the author doesn't post them elsewhere you can still read them later. Since I don't have a project currently.

******** There's a link for Past Projects in the menu, when people post them elsewhere (usually Ao3, or personal blogs) they can provide a link. But no, they aren't archived permanently on that site.

I've saved a few myself using Grabmybooks, just in case they never got reposted anywhere. Though most were.
