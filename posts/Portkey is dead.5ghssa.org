It has finally happened. The entirety of portkey.org is now down. Many stories are lost to the Internet gods.


** Archive.org has many stories backed up. If you are looking for a specific story, you might still find it there.

*** A lot probably has to do with the growing popularity of Fanfiction.net and Ao3. Those sites host fanfiction from all sorts of fandoms, as opposed to one specific one, so you can kill many birds with one stone by being a member of those sites.

***** Fictionpad is another diverse (though still youngish) fan fiction platform. Wattpad supports both original works and fan fiction. Gethermit supports all types of writing in its library but as its name suggests (Get Hermit) does not have attached forums, discussions or host reviews. Deviant Art encompasses all manner of artistic works. :)

***** I haven't actually read it, but from what I gather it's H/Hr with vampires. It's 500k, explicit, and I've been asked for it a lot since Portkey went down so I assume it's pretty good. This is the author summary:

#+begin_quote
  War, werewolves, wizards, death, the undead... Harry has his work cut out for him. And then there's Hermione, who's a different set of vamp-angst altogether. Though war and death has changed so much, Harry knows he could beat the odds of a bitter fate. Now he just has to make her believe it.

*** FloreatCastellum, would you mind awfully giving some clarification to your comment that you were talking to them on Tumblr?. I've been emailing the site admins and not really getting anywhere, apart from one request to send reddit links, and many people have had a similar experience. Forever night is also archived on Whatpad, but sadly some of her other excellent stories are not, Angelica, for example. It is the fact that so many wonderful stories, including those short little one shots, for example, could be potentially gone forever, that is a real tragedy. I was presuming they'd experienced a massive hardware failure, resulting in data loss.
