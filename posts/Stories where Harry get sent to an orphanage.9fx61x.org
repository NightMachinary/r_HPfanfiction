Looking for stories where Harry gets sent to an orphanage after his parents died. Preferably fics where he isn't adopted. Interested to see where someone would take his character.

Restrictions:

No Dark!Harry fics

No Harry/Slytherin (unless that Slytherin is definitely in the side of the light.)

No Slash please


** /side of the light/ he said.

*** Extending the life of orphanages in the UK by two decades seems a lot easier of an issue to get over than believing that waving a stick could levitate a Volvo..

***** I'm mostly basing my knowledge off the shows "Tracy Beaker" and "Tracy Beaker Returns" so I'm not sure if they're accurate.

But aren't there kids who still end up just kinda growing through the system?

****** Hah! The books are actually fairly accurate - a small group of kids, people do try and foster Tracey but it never lasts for long. In the TV show, there are way more kids than you would ever get in a shared home: you would probably get a max of 6.

Yes some kids struggle with foster placements and remain in care homes their entire lives. My dad briefly worked at such an institution - most of the kids were severely disabled.

******** Whatever, it's just not the lines of beds and 30 plus kids imagined by fanfic writers, but smaller groups of kids.

  Harry was proclaimed dead when he was two years old and ended up in an orphanage. But that was only the beginning of his journey. While trying to find his place in the world of magic, he never forgets those whom he views as family.
