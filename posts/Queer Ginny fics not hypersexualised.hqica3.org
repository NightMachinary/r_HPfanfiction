I might have read a few, but I can't remember any. Basically looking for Ginny loving women where the focus isn't sex. I feel like it's a lot harder to find quality fics like these than Hinny or Drarry etc. A little bit of smut is fine but I just want a fic with /story/ pretty badly lol.

Failing that, any similar queer women stories that focus on a character other than Ginny could be cool too, just looking for some female LGBTQ+ love in the hp world!!

​

I've been wanting to write a Ginny/muggle OC fic so bad lately and need that itch scratched since I know someone else can do better, and people must have already and I've just never come across it!

** For some reason, it's extremely hard to find a slash/femslash fanfic that isn't hypersexualised in the HP fandom no matter what the pairing it. With such a rare pairing, I honestly wish you the best of luck because I highly doubt that even exists.

*** Quite a lot of the slash and femslash is on AO3, where you can filter the works by rating. The ratings 'General audiences' and 'Teen and up audiences' would probably correspond with this request.

**** I've noticed that fics are very often misrated and mistagged on AO3. Either that or the search system is broken. I vividly recall the frustration of trying to find a decent mentor!Voldemort fic, setting it to exclude M/M as I'm not very fond of the Harry/Voldemort pairing and it still popping up a shitload of HP/LV fics.

***** That's too bad. There are a lot of fics where either of the characters is a woman, but there's a lot of tags people use for that and not everyone even tags it.

Also, I want to tell you if you hadn't noticed, but nowadays you can also exclude anything while searching, so you can just exclude the HP/LV relationships from your search.

***** For some reason excluding M/M or F/M don't work as well.

I'd recommend excluding the relationship tags directly (Harry/Voldemort) since most people tend to tag those as oppose to the M/M

****** That would do the trick, if there weren't a couple dozen seperate tags for that pairing. FFN might have a horrific lack of tags/search functions but God do I wish AO3 was as good at pairing tags as FFN.

******* Yeah, it's weird because I've seen ao3 combined tags that are similar into one overarching tag in other fandoms

But for the HP fandom they're missing a lot of the similar tags. Why?

A rather annoying workaround I've used in the past:

1) Find the tag that you want to exclude and exclude it

2) Move down from the exclude part to the search part

3) Search for the same tag you've excluded

4) Now go to the exclude portion and you'll see the top 10 tags that fit your search, start excluding those that are similar to the one you excluded

5) Press ‘sort and filter' then keep checking the exclude part until all the tags you dislike are gone

6) Remove the tag from the search portion

7) That should remove a majority of the similar tags

Kinda ridiculous that this is so convoluted. I like ao3 but I really wish they restrict the tags in some way

*** You're absolutely right, of course, I know it's basically a lost cause but there's no harm in asking! It's such a shame, but there's a decent amount of recs in this thread for me to look through anyway!

I suppose it reflects the lack of good wlw in (popular) literature/pop culture, so I shouldn't really be all that surprised.

** I don't know any with Ginny, aside from a couple otherwise crappy fics where her relationships are very much a Tertiary Plot Thing, but my favourite non-smutty femslash (there is some, but it's a single scene near the end and is completely easily skipped) is a canon-compliant, post-war Hermione/Luna fic called Crazy Little Things by Dreiser (Link below). It actually develops a relationship between Hermione and Luna in a way that makes me think it could actually happen (canon compliant too, as I said, though it's Americanised to all hell and in desperate need of a Britpick. Hermione talks about her 'Majors' so, so much. Does have the best Ron-Hermione relationship-ender I've ever read though, because it's the only one I remember that's actually amiable and nice and In Character for Both of them - that never friggin' happens!).

*** Sounds brilliant, I'll give it a go! Right up my street but I can imagine the Americanisation might drive me a bit mad, hopefully it's manageable! Plus I love Ron so it's always good to see a fic of Hermione with someone else that doesn't tear him to shreds in the process lol
