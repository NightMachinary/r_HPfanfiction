Now James Potter wasn't an expert at wandless magic. Hell he wasn't even an amateur at wandless magic. But he didn't need his wand for one thing.

James Potter got on his knees, stared downwards, and begged Voldemort to spare him and his family. As Voldemort approached the kneeling Potter, James smirked. The second Voldemort was close enough, he transformed into Prongs and gored him with his horns.

"Huh." James Potter muttered as he saw the body of Voldemort crumple.

"I didn't really think that would work."

When Lily heard the story she broke down in laughter.

James feared for his wife's sanity.

She paused to explain.

"Dumbledore actually believed in a prophecy that our not yet two year old boy could beat him and no one else could. Goes to show him how useless Divination really is."

Halfway across the country, Minerva McGonagall felt the irresistible urge to cackle.

*** Would actually be fun to see James getting famous and resenting the lack of privacy and constant media feast for a change. Maybe he even takes the family to a random isolated rock in the ocean to get away of it all a la Vernon.

Generally in stories where he (and sometimes Lily too) survive he either ends up not caring too much about Harry's fame (generally when the fame is either downplayed or is ignored) or munching off and enjoying every bit of his son's fame (which could be funny if used in a story that didn't take itself too seriously)

Yes, Dark Lord Voldemort suddenly disappeared, and no one ever knew why.

Some people had hints, but with the help of James Potter and Sirius Black, the attack on the Longbottoms amounted to nothing. And no one ever figured out where Lord Voldemort went.

The first Prophecy, the one that kickstarts the entire series, only came true because Voldemort acted on it - thus making it self-fulfilling.

The second Prophecy, at the time it's given, we're led to believe it's about Sirius Black - but later it becomes clear that Pettigrew is the person it's talking about. No-one who was actually mentioned in the prophecy ever heard part of it, at least to my knowledge.

No, but the people who had to panic and mess up to make it come true all heard it.

Prophecies are the work of powers hostile to humanity, tempting and tricking us to ruin and tragedy.

The only safe response to prophecy is to obliviate everyone who heard it and /shoot the prophet in the head/. Absent these or other similarly stringent safety measures, you run the risk of - to pick one of the more egregious examples from the literature - murdering one of your own parents and married to the other.

** ‘Isn't it the son of James Potter?' ‘/The/ James Potter? Who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? Nah, can't be.' The whispers felt oppressive, filled with words about his dad. He knew his dad hated it too, knew he'd forever be haunted by the mystery... but, he thought firmly, he'd be his own person here.

...yeah, right. On the first day, when they discovered Harry didn't know how his dad killed Voldemort, the Gryffindors accused his dad of being the legendary spy, helping Voldemort fake his death and framing poor Pettigrew, who had been summarily killed (executed, really). Until Halloween, when he saved someone from the troll and was - temporarily - a hero. The Stone was better guarded this time, resulting in Dumbledore fighting Voldemort to a standstill until the latter escaped. Harry never heard the Basilisk and didn't get in trouble, and Snape saved them all from the snake in the dueling club.\\
Fawkes led Dumbledore and the Mr and Mrs. Weasley to the chamber when Ginny fought Voldemort for the last time, showing a tremendous amount of courage. They blew up the doors, but it resulted in a cave-in. When they got in the Chamber, the Basilisk just slithering out, the Weasley's all at once realized what happened and went utterly batshit at the snake, killing it - though with great difficulty -, while Tom Riddle cackled with glee. However, what he failed to realize was that he was solid, now, working with a wand that actively resisted him, and no way out. In the end, they destroyed the diary just in time, and Ginny, though near death, survived... but only just. The whole family was shocked to discover Ginny had been possessed, but they all kept quiet about it, for her sake. Third year never happened, as Sirius never got accused in the first place and with Peter death, Voldemort had no willing servant to help him out. So the story stops there, sadly.

No it wouldn't. It would just be delayed. Barty Crouch Junior still exists and the Quidditch Cup still takes place. Without Peter there to recruit him, Barty Crouch Junior would probably run away - searching for Voldemort. He would eventually find him and try to bring him back.

For Harry it would mean he would just be a spectator at the tournament, Cedric would live, but most likely not win the tournament because without Harry nobody would tell him about the dragon in the first task so he would probably be in last place at the start. If he still makes first place at the second task everything could be open again. Fleur on the other hand would never meet Bill Weasley because he was only there for Harry and would most likely leave England behind after the tournament because nobody saved her sister until the task ended and she would most likely not want to stay in a country that made her think her sister died.

Back to Crouch and Voldemort. If we give them the same timetable that Pettigrew had, they would come back to England around early October (we know that Voldemort and Pettygrew came back to England in the End of July when Peter escaped in early June and the Quidditch World Cup is at the End of August). They would have to find a way to kidnap James. Because there are no brother-wands James would most probably die at the resurrection and nobody would know that Voldemort is back.

Could set of Harry to a path of revenge when Voldemort reveals he is back. There is still the prophecy so Voldemort would probably try to kill Neville and Harry in this version because it never got clear who is the prophesied one. In the end one of them will get marked - because either the prophecy is self fulfilling or they come true either way (never got clear in the books, only that real prophesies come true in some way). So in the end it would lead to either Neville or Harry fighting Voldemort with the help of Dumbledore who still would die because the horcruxes still exist and the Deathly Hollows are still a thing. And while I don't think Dumbledore did everything right I do think he would find a way to make either Neville or Harry win that fight even beyond the grave.

No, they wouldn't. Crouch Jr. broke himself free at the Quidditch World Cup. He did it once, he could do it again. It would take longer without Peter being there and lifting it the second time, but it would still happen. Though October in Harrys fourth year might be to early. Maybe Harry would already be an Auror when Voldemort comes back, depending on how long it takes Barty Crouch Junior to flee.

** Harry grows up in Godric's Hollow with his famous parents. He's adventurous and over-confident, especially on a broom, but he's fundamentally kind and doesn't like a lot of attention.

The week of his 11th birthday his parents take him to Diagon Alley for school supplies. At Olivander's, he still receives the holly and phoenix feather wand which causes a bit of concern when Mr. Olivander announces how curious it is that he be destined for that wand when his father killed it's brother's owner.

In Madame Malkin's, Harry still encounters Draco Malfoy who goes on and on about the same crap. Harry instantly dislikes him because he's reminded of his cousin Dudley who he's only met twice but loathes with a passion. So, he still ends up asking the hat to keep him away from Malfoy and so he still ends up in Gryffindor with basically the same friends. They still end up figuring out the sorcerer's stone and they still go into the dungeon.

The difference is that this time, Harry doesn't have the charm to protect him. His touch doesn't hurt Quirell and so try as he might, an 11 year old can't beat a professor. Hermione runs for help and returns just in time to save Harry's life but not to stop Quirell and Voldemort from escaping with the stone.

Harry is left much sobered. He realizes that the stone would have been safe because Quirell wouldn't have been able to get it out of the mirror. He's not the big hero like his dad was. He's a colossal screwup.

***** "It was the strangest thing; that snake-faced bastard had just blasted off the front door, my wife was running screaming up the stairs, and I was in a full-blown panic, wandless, staring down the madman of the hour like---what I'm sure my wife would say, using one of the Muggle phrases---a deer in headlights. All I could think to do was beg for my family's life in hopes that while he took his time torturing me, my family could slip out of the wards and to safety. Of course, I'd all but forgotten that Lily and I had been in the last stages of the Animagus ritual---Lily's form is of a beautiful snowy owl, she's brilliant---and before I really knew what was happening, I felt instincts kick in and, since Iwas already on my hands and knees with my head down, it was almost ridiculously easy to just push forward and gut the bastard. So, yes, the Dark Lord got Voldie-gored, and now would be a good time for my wife and I to register our Animagus forms, right? Splendid!"

********* I did read it. I just wrote a funny scene that came to my mind. Because this is a discussion party where people are talking about the idea posted by OP. What's with the triple-posted whinging, my guy? Ffs, your idea was neato, or whatever. Here's mine. Is that somehow bad? Can I not comment unless I'm suckling your toes? Because that's gross dude. Get over yourself.
