I'm looking for a good fanfic with nice fluff and good romance, Harry/Bella, Harry/Narcissa or it may be Harry/Daphne, I'm also looking for a good HPxGoT Crossover with Harry as MC

Nor am i against a crackfic as long as i have a good romance.

Just keep in mind that I would like you to recommend me stories outside of fanfiction.net, I think I already read everything good on this website just like in hpfanarchive.


** Linkffn(Stepping back) is a TT harry/bellatrix that is... readable.

Dragonlily by werewolfwarrior has explicit h/lily and h/narcissa but has been abandoned and I think has been reuploaded by someone else.

Linkffn(For love of magic) has some h/narcissa although it's late in the 40 chapter run and not the focus of the fic

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** Eh, I think calling both of the linked fics below readable is being too generous. For Love of Magic is especially terrible. Stepping Back is readable only if you have no other fics to turn to.

**** For Love of Magic is...okay. It's one of those fics in the limbo between "shit", "okay", and "good", depending on which part of the story we are talking about.

***** Eh, I stuck with it too long and I regret it very much. I used to really like Noodlehammer's works but my taste has changed since then. I really can't be charitable about the fic anymore, especially since he shuns any critics of his fic as flamers. He thinks that people are just too prudish, but his lemon scenes legitimately detract from the fic. They are absolutely pointless. His plot sucks. All of the characters are unlikeable.

I think I might be a bit biased though.

****** My tastes in stories are incredibly varied, in both quality and plot. Perhaps my bar is a bit lower.

For Love of Magic isn't a great story, for sure. But it's better than the average Harry Potter story on FFN. The vast majority of stories on FFN are short shitfics written by people who haven't been jaded to all of the fandom cliches like most of [[/r/HPfanfiction]]'s subscribers have. I guess the cliches in For Love of Magic are among the last remaining cliches I can stand.

******* I have to agree with [[/u/neutraldjinn]] , he's kind if a dick to any critics. The first time I thought it was funny when he just did a longer lemon to sass back... and then it kept getting longer and the story stopped being a story and more of a "I have a magic dick that makes women love me and I so other things with my penis that makes the world and governments fall before me!" Kinda fic, and that's not what I'm reading fanfic for
