The fics name is "The Evans Family Heir" its about the evans family being a squibed out magus family. Lily parents raise Harry in the magus tradition.

The Ulr [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11726659/1/The-Evans-Family-Heir]] .

It was published Jan 2016 and I noticed it was removed in the year 2017.

I have looked everywhere I tried the wayback machine and the fanfiction repack archive but neither has a copy.

I am hopping somebody might have a copy or know someone that does.

I have exhausted all other avenues so I hope reddit might give me new ideas.

** Funny enough, I'd rather be a wizard/witch than a magus.
