How would you all feel if I did a crossover with Ghost Rider and change the fact that the Yule Ball takes place after the third task instead of inbtween the first and second task?


** Context?

*** Well my oc will be on school break after the events of Prisoner of Azkaban and will be involved in an accident like Robbie Reyes. I'm still deciding if messing with the year events take for example Philosopher's Stone takes place in 2011 or leaving it the same years as in the books.

**** I think just go with it. What you're suggesting all sounds fine, but a bit of advice: Readers of fanfiction prefer canon characters, even if they're OOC. So you might want to use a blank slate side character for your OC (like Dean, or Blaze, etc.) or just make it Harry. You don't have to try too hard to match personalities either since this is the kind of thing that would really mess someone up.

(I personally would love reading about a Ghost Rider Harry!)

***** So you mean replace my OC or use the names you've suggested as my OC?
