You know what I mean. The fact that a kid named "Remus Lupin" gets bitten by a werewolf. Sirius becomes a canine animagus. Albus grows up to be the champion of the white hats. Perennelle just happens to marry the guy who'll help her to live perennially. Others.

An idea I've been kicking around is that there is a niche in the wizarding world for low-level diviners (not full-on Seers, just petty fortune-tellers) who offer a naming service to expectant parents hoping to get a glimpse of their child's future. It doesn't appear to /cause/ anything to happen, but it does relate somehow to the kid's situation in the future.

(Obviously, the true explanation is that J. K. R. loves her pseudo-Latin wordplay and mythology, and that's fine...I just want an explanation that makes sense within the confines of the fictional universe.)

Thoughts or counter-suggestions?


** I always had a minor headcanon that continuous patterns tie in to a deeper ritual in magic. Like, names are very important and influence the named's life.

And having recurring types of names in a family build on magic ... I picture some Black thousands of years ago began a ritual using the stars to strengthen the family and the family magic, and each subsequent child named a star builds on this ancient ritual. And maybe the Evans accidentally activated this ritual (which doesn't require conscious effort to begin) by naming their progeny after flora, until it culminated in the birth of a magical child in the most recent generation.

On a side note: This is why I'm always really bothered by a fem!Harry or AU!sister that doesn't have some flower name.

*** This makes sense in Alexandra Quick as well, what with all the daughters of Thorn being named after ancient Roman women (and the son being named after a Byzantine emperor), as well as the middle names of the Grimm sisters being the Furies' names. Likewise, the Old Testament biblical names of all the Thorns prior to Abraham's progeny. I think thematic naming is very appropriate.

More to the point, however, is all the Weasleys being named somehow in a "royal" manner. William, Charles, Percival, Frederick, George, Ronald, and Ginevra (variant of Guinevere), as well as Arthur (obvious) and Molly (pet name for Mary).

I will say though, Perenelle and Nicolas Flamel aren't JK Rowling's characters. They were real people who lived in France in the 14th century. Some 200 years after Nicolas' death in the 15th century rumours arose that he had created the Philosopher's Stone.

Also, Rowling loves alliteration: Pansy Parkinson, Padma and Parvati Patil, Peter Pettigrew, Gregory Goyle, Luna Lovegood, William Weasley, Dudley Dursley... The list can and will go on: Gellert Grindlewald, Belletrix Black, Quirinus Quirrell, Cho Chang, and /all/ of the bloody founders! It's nuts!

** Like you, I think that some wizards and witches just have a touch of skill in divination. They might not know it consciously, but some of them, when confronted with such an important decision, do what feels right. And what feels right is in essence creating a mild form of prophecy. It's not the full-on seer stuff, just some thing they can brush off as coincidence.

Divination isn't complete hogwash.

**** Dumbledore didn't have reverence for the subject. His approach to it is described in HBP: he only gives credence to the prophecy because he knows Voldemort will, and then later on because he knows that it's in Harry's character never to rest until Voldemort is defeated.

As for Voldemort, I'm not sure that he has respect for Divination so much as a healthy level of paranoia which results in him trying to stamp out any hint of a vulnerability, no matter what the source.

****** within the universe there /are/ people regarded as 'True seers', though it appears to be an innate ability, like being a metamorphagus, as opposed to wizards' attempts at learned divination. and, of course, centaurs approach that differently

and dumbledore does place some stock in genuine predictions, per pottermore:

'Dumbledore gave her sanctuary at the school, partly to protect her, partly in the hope that more genuine predictions would be forthcoming (he had to wait many years for the next).'

******* I think if only people who were 'true seers' could use divinations, there wouldn't be an entire class dedicated to not just learning /about/ it, but learning /how to use/ it. Maybe true seers are the only ones who can make huge important prophesies, and everyone else can just to really simple name-prediction like stuff. And then there are people like Hermione and McGonagall who can't use it at all and are skeptic of the subject.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but this is all fandom speculation anyway, so your explanation could work just as well in a fic as mine. Who knows what the divination class was like before Trelawney taught it? Maybe they just learned /about/ divination and didn't try to use it. We can keep making up details to fill in the blanks that explain our theories, and that's one of the reasons why I love fanfic, because it leads to so many diverse and different ideas.

  “I did,” said Dumbledore. “On a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog's Head Inn. I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though *it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all*. The applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very famous, very gifted Seer, and I thought it common politeness to meet her. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.”

** Nominative Determinism... Like how the fastest man in the world is Usain /Bolt/, or how there's an editor on this series of The Great British Bakeoff with the surname /Egg/.

But seriously, I think the best way of looking at it is to also take into account the sheer number of names that aren't "too approiate" as well. Harry Potter, any of the Weasleys, Lavender Brown, that Patils, Rubeus Hagrid, Aberforth Dumbledore, Oliver Wood, Neville Longbottom, Peter Pettigrew... The list goes on and on.

We see more of these names that mean something than we might in real life, yes, but how many wizarding characters have boring or unrevealed names?

But to actually provide a theory, I'd like to suggest that some of them (like Sprout, for example) are names that were acquired by reputation. That is to say, Pomona Sprout's ancestors were all great at herbology so they got a plant-based name.

** For the sake of the muggleborn or those who were given uninteresting names, there may also be a tradition of taking an 'adult' name to signal your commitment to your career (or your fate). Perhaps John Lupin renamed himself Remus to acknowledge his condition and Sheila Sinestra took the name Aurora when she became an Astronomy instructor.

There may even be some enhancement to one's spellwork in this way: by choosing to take the name Remus, he was able to gain a small measure of control over his changed state.

** I think the most important reason is indeed that JKR loves mythology.

For the rest: the wizarding society is very old-fashioned and has hints of romanticism (large manors, realistic sculpting (fountain in the MoM atrium), the portraits are realistic as well). So ancient mythology and Roman/Greek history is very popular with witches and wizards, which is why they give their kids such names.

It's the same with names now: football is very popular, so people call their kids after famous football players.

So when forced to choose a last name by the French, most people used sensible names such as professions (Bakker -- Baker, Slager -- Butcher, etc.) or toponyms (Dijkstra - lived near a Dyke) others used joke names like "De Koning (the king)" or "Naaktgeboren (born naked).\\

** It's quite simple in my mind-magic. More exactly, a burst of accidental magic released by the child at the instance of birth. Being slightly atemporal and maddeningly obtuse as the existence of prophecies has shown, the burst of accidental magic released by the newborn at birth influences the parents' decision-making mechanisms when it comes to the child, specifically in the areas of naming conventions.

As a result, the naming provides hints as to their future destinies, attitudes and behaviour-Severus (latin for 'stern') Snape is a particularly apt example of this in both its latin meaning for his general attitude as a professor and head of house as well as for its close relation to the word 'sever', since his actions lead to the severing of ties with lily, severing of his loyalty to Voldemort and, ultimately, the severing of both his and Dumbledore's lives in the final books. He is distinctly unable to either make amends or reconcile his differences with people he has either offended or who ended up offending him despite his extremely well-hidden and quite possibly heavily occluded positive feelings towards said people.

Then there's Lily, whose flower can be symbolic of motherhood, though the red spider lily is commonly associated with, well, [[http://wordpress.tokyotimes.org/the-beauty-of-autumns-red-spider-lily-japans-flower-of-death/][Death with a beautiful capital D]] in Japan-all of which are aspects of her character's actions in canon.
