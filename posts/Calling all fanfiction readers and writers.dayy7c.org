Hello, Harry Potter fanfiction community! I'm a university student conducting an ethnographic study on fanfiction writers and readers. I've written fanfiction for years, which is why I chose to perform an analysis of fanfiction as a discourse community (specifically relating to its patterns of communication and behavior). I'd like to provide an accurate and fair portrait of the fanfiction community as a whole, so I need your help.

I've created a (fairly quick) google survey for fanfiction writers and readers to fill out. I would really appreciate your responses - they'll help to bring a vital perspective to my demographic study, which I hope will illustrate how important fanfiction really is.

In addition to this, I'd like to conduct an email-based interview with someone that has written fanfiction for at least one year and has published at a minimum five stories. Since I want to present a well-rounded picture of the community and its members, I would also like to have a member (or more) of the community read my paper over to make sure that it's doing this. Please reach out to me through PM if you're interested in either of these.

Thank you all in advance!

** If you select that you only read fanfiction on the first page it takes you to a section for "readers and writers" with required questions about writing habits.

If this is supposed to be fandom agnostic, you're also missing some major sites for where people read or publish fanfiction. E.g. in the Worm fandom the vast majority of fic is on the Space Battles / Sufficient Velocy / Questionable Questing forums. There should probably at least be an "other" option.

Our sub's demographic is different than the usual fanfic community.

#+begin_quote
  Which methods do you use to communicate with writers? Check all that apply.
#+end_quote

FFN reviews isn't an option, which I suppose is what the write-in is for. Just struck me as odd that it wasn't included. Or is that on purpose, since it's not two way? Neither are Author's Notes, though. Hm..

*** When writing the survey, I considered reviews on ffn to be PMs (not something distinct), because they're direct to the author of the work and others can't interact. I definitely understand how that could be a source of confusion, which I apologize for.

** It seemed to work out well for me, but I also have been doing this for much longer than your average Redditor. I know more of these terms, so it seems that the only thing to mention is reinforcing the idea that you should make sure that people who don't write it can choose that without problems like VulpineKitsune said. Also, that's a dope name.

*** Mary Sue fanfiction has been a part of fandom and fanworks since its origins in the Star Trek fan community. Beyond that, Mary Sue fanfic is commonly associated with self-insertion and wish fulfillment. While I acknowledge that authors are generally more transparent about self-inserts, I chose to group the two together due to their association.
