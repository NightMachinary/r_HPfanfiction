If I recall correctly, the title was said by Dumbledore at the end of Book 1.

There were 2 options for Dumbledore to take here: fully explain why Potter is being hunted by Voldemort or keep his innocence and let him grow and tell him his destiny later on. He took the latter option, but what was the right and what was the easy option between the two? Was this a moral decision?

I think some fics already used this point for the Want of a Nail trope.

What do you guys think? What was the right and what was the easy option for Dumbledore in that scene? What would you have done in Dumbledore's shoes?


** The "right and easy" quote is from the end of GoF, not PS.

My interpretation of "right vs easy" is essentially the choice between principle and pragmatism. Or if you want to put it in more philosophical terms, the choice between deontological and utilitarian ethics.

Under the former, people have certain moral duties such as the duty not to murder. Accordingly, certain actions are simply right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. Murder is wrong, even if you do it to save someone else, for example. Similarly, raising a child soldier is wrong even if it saves your society from a madman.

Under the latter, actions are judged by their consequences with the correct course of action being the one that maximises utility (i.e. happiness). This is the idea of the "greater good". Under a utilitarian system of ethics, raising a child soldier would be the correct course of action if the good that child soldier did for the world outweighed the loss of that child's freedom.

Seen this way, Dumbledore's "right vs easy" philosophy is effectively an extension of his opposition to the ideas of his youth and the philosophy of Grindelwald.

Ironically, the system of ethics that JKR seems to advocate via the themes in the books and Harry's own moral perspective is neither of the above. Rather the narrative seems to promote an ethical system somewhat akin to "virtue ethics", which is (broadly) the idea that being a moral person consists of possessing certain virtuous character traits. These traits are more than habits and are not shown by individual actions but rather are about having a certain mindset. For example, a person wouldn't be virtuous if they only avoided murder out of fear that they would be caught. Virtue encompasses your reasons for acting. So when we see Harry cast the Cruciatus curse, despite this being torture it does not make Harry immoral, because his character is still essentially a virtuous one.

Well you are correct, but only if you already subscribe to an utilitarian worldview. The way I look at Dumbledore it kinda makes sense that he would be so narrow minded as to see his personal worldview as fundamentally "right". This is IMHO pretty damning, as suddenly this "philosophical" quote is nothing but a self-righteous rationalization.

Even though I pretty much /hate/ Dumbledore I'm going for a more charitable interpretation of his words here: He makes that quote during his speech about Cedric and the resurrection of Voldemort: What he is talking about is personal sacrifice... risking your own life to help your fellow man. Taking the risk of hiding the Muggleborn in your cellar so that the +Gestapo+ Death Eaters won't find them. That kind of thing. He's trying to prepare people for a Civil War. He's asking people not to be cowards in a clever way.

Nothing wrong with your thoughts about Utilitarianism vs Deontological Ethics, but I think this makes more sense considering the context (because both Systems of thought would agree that it is correct to oppose Voldemort, though for different reasons).

  "virtue ethics"
#+end_quote

It's important to remember here that virtue ethics (in the classical sense) is very focused on 'shaping' your character. It is not something you are simply born with. You strive to become a more virtuous person by pursuing actions that enrich you in that regard. So yeah, this makes a lot of sense if you believe in the manipulative/deliberate aspect of Dumbledore: He's putting Harry in Situations (Troll, Quirrelmort, Basilisk, Sirius, Tournament) to shape his character into a "Hero"-type character. What Aristotle had in mind though was conscious action, not brainwashing.

His reasons for acting there was to have Sirius escape death, but in such a manner that he would have to flee from the law and would not be able to have a significant influence on Harry.

His ideology there seems to be a blend of deontological and utilitarian concerns, which explains the lack of apparent rationality. His morality would not allow Sirius to die, but he was utilitarian enough to know that Sirius's presence in Harry's life could degrade his own influence on him.

That feels more fanon than canon. I don't think JKR had any such intent about the plot, and I find poor evidence for this idea inside the books.

The real-world reason for the plot to take that turn was that JKR needed Harry to be the primary center of action of the plot, and wanted to set up the entire time-turner sequence (probably because it /was/ a really great read.) However, if you try to make sense of it within the context of the world of the book, the events make Dumbledore's behavior seem very weird, and certainly inconsistent with any reasonable theory of morality or the whole "do what is right, not what is easy" mantra.

****** That is what we do isn't it? Try to make sense of the books as they are given in context of the universe. Maybe Rowling was smoking a doobie when she wrote the time turner ending to the Book 3 for all we know. And my comment was just a theory. Just one out of hundreds of interpretations that could be made.

** Dumbledore explicitly stated in OOTP that he didn't tell Harry about the prophecy because he- rightly or wrongly- prioritized Harry's childhood over his utility in the war against Voldemort and thought telling Harry would ruin his childhood.

Also, back then Dumbledore didn't know that Harry was a Horcrux, because he was unsure what avenues Riddle had taken to become immortal. All he knew was that Harry's scar was wonky and caused by Dark Magic and that Voldemort was probably still around for an unrelated reason. So actually, Dumbledore had no reason to treat child Harry as a human sacrifice, because he didn't figure out that Harry was a horcrux until book 5 I think.

Dumbledore is not omnipotent in canon, which is the big weakness of the allknowing!manipulative!Dumbledore interpretation.

** I am reminded of this quote from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/980211/enembee][Enembee's ff.net page]]:

#+begin_quote
  "The ultimate problem was that the first few books imply that the overall story would be about a boy growing up to be a hero, and what we ultimately got was the story about a patsy who was manipulated into fulfilling someone else's overly complicated scheme to preserve the status quo of a society that didn't deserve salvation."
#+end_quote

Dumbledore himself doesn't choose what's right over what's easy. Mostly, he's a puppet master pulling Harry's strings, even long after he's dead, and his motivations aren't even what's right or what's easy, but rather what's good for the plot.

I'll give one, just one, example.

Why does Dumbledore's portrait inform Snape that the sword must be acquired in an act of heroism and tell him precisely when to leave it (on the bottom of a freezing pond) instead of just arranging to leave Harry the means by which to destroy the Horcrux? I mean, throughout Deathly Hallows, it is obvious that Dumbledore somehow knew just about /everything/ that was going to happen (though how, we never know). Why the puzzles and heroics?

The answer is obvious. If Dumbledore had just told Harry and co. during Half Blood Prince how to destroy horcruxes and given them some minimal training and equipment to do so, there would have been no reason for Harry, Hermione, and Ron to trudge around endlessly lost, cold, and hungry in the woods. And thus, with no internal reason except for ones that we can endlessly rationalize here (though they ultimately make no sense), the needs of the plot are made more important than the need to have things make sense.

I often say that J.K. Rowling's plots are awful, and the fact that she's an utterly brilliant writer is what saves that. She's terrific, there's a reason we're all entranced by her books in spite of the fact that the plots are awful. She's so good, so very good, at what she does that we never even notice how bizarre the plot is.

So, yah, sometimes, Dumbledore chooses what's expedient over what's right, but worse, I think most of the time he chooses what's expedient at the meta-level for JKR, and not even what's expedient from an in-world viewpoint. His feeding Harry an hour's worth of information over a year in HBP, his generally keeping Harry in the dark about things he /actually needs to know/ (how about a nice 20 minute lesson on all the known ways to destroy horcruxes? how about giving Harry a wee bit of warning and doing a touch of pre-planning given that he knows Harry will have to go on the run?), his lack of concern for Harry's lack of skills (yah, sure, maybe he's not going to be able to defeat Voldemort in a fair fight without decades of training, but would Harry knowing a few useful spells like Fidelius so he could hide or maybe a couple of healing spells hurt?), all of this seems, well, like pretty terrible preparation for a hero. But, if all you're doing is setting up the plot of Deathly Hallows, well, in that context it makes sense...

From a practical perspective, Harry didn't grow anywhere near as much as he could have, in power or in heroic temperament.

If I might suggest an alternate explanation: if Dumbledore had told Harry right then, Harry might have run. He might have put up with his aunt and her family rather than returning to Hogwarts. Dumbledore wanted Harry to become more attached to the wizarding world before he told him.

On the other hand, that would only be enough excuse to delay the explanation and some of the training for a year or two. Instead, there's no training, and the explanation doesn't come until Sirius dies.

I think Dumbledore went for what was easy: he didn't explain things to Harry because he didn't want to have to answer awkward questions or possibly rethink his plans. He was still clinging to his hope and didn't want to plan around the possibility of Harry having to face Death Eaters and Voldemort before graduating. It was easier to pretend that this was a one-off thing, that Voldemort would be gone another decade. And in second year likewise -- it was a shade of Voldemort, reconstituted memories, and Voldemort didn't have tons of those to spare.

** Telling an eleven year old that he is destined to destroy the devil himself, in full seriousness, may have sparked the wrong reaction.

However, actively training him wouldn't have gone amiss. Then when he is old enough tell him "This is why we pushed you so".

**** And it would have been soooo terrible if Harry had been competent enough to do things like cast a reasonable healing spell or understand how to destroy a horcrux.

Generally, the whole "he could never have defeated Voldemort" excuse doesn't explain why it wouldn't have still been better for him to have enough of a basic grounding to be reasonably competent to do the things he needed to do.

*** Barely a devil, just a insurgent leader born to tragic circumstances that caused him to be maladjusted and willing to blindly try idiotic immortality rituals without long term testing.

Voldemort is a man, for all that he tries to deny that.

Even with Horcruxes, he could be repelled, killed again and again, reduced into a soul without a body, a fragment of what once was a man.

He could be defeated, if not outright destroyed, by anybody who got a lucky shot at him.
