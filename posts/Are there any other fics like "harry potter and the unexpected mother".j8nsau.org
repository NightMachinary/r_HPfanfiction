linkao3(24446656) I've just finished this harmony fic and I'm looking for more like it. No male slash please, I just don't get on with it most of the time.

*** I've read most of theirs. It's not so much the opness as it is the "alien" mindset. linkffn(Harry Crow) is another one that has a similar premise.

** I don't quite understand the request: you want an unplanned Hermione pregnancy? linkao3(21280616) has that, though Harry is not the dad. It gets VERY mushy after a while. Whether that's good or bad depends on whether you're looking for that sort of thing, I guess
