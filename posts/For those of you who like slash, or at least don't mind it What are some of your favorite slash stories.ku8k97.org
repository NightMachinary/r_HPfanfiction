Would rather not have Weasley bashing if at all possible. (No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche)


** I noticed that you post a lot of requests for fics; do you read all the ones you request or are your posts to generate conversation? In either case, here are my favorite slash fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is hands-down my favorite fic in the fandom (author also wrote 29 and life skills, which I recommend below). With the reluctant help of Snape, Remus rescues Harry from canon level abuse. That's all I really want to say because the less you know, the better.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057][All Life is Yours to Miss]] is a weirdly touching and sensitive fic about a reclusive Draco being forced to interact with the world after a petty act of revenge has unexpected consequences.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]] is so well-known and loved that it's probably unnecessary to include it, but I love it. Harry gets a glimpse into another life he could have led.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] had to have been inspired by a weird prompt. Harry is a recluse, hiding away in his flat. After his toilet breaks, Hermione makes an appointment for him with a toilet salesman. Guess who shows up on his doorstep to sell him a toilet.

I guess I'm a Saras_Girl girl, because I also love [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599/chapters/1692075][Reparations]]. Harry is in his residency as a Healer and gets assigned to a ward staffed by a familiar face.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20636933/chapters/49004756][Making Do]] is a slow burn all about coming back from trauma and living with survivor's guilt.

I legitimately thought [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea and No Sympathy]] was a one-shot. I think it was because I devoured it so quickly and I like a lot of one-shots by this author (who_la_whoop). Draco fucks around with an experimental time turner and ends up in a groundhog day situation.

Another writer I love who writes a lot of one-shots is Ignatius Trout. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/640449][Here's The Pencil, Make It Work]] is one of those. Draco is living in Muggle London and Harry keeps running into him.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]] is probably one of my top three fics in the fandom. Harry runs away before his Hogwarts letter comes in and grows up on the streets. The bulk of the story starts when he's older and meets a disillusioned Draco. I love how the magic that Harry uses feels very home-spun and more like the old magics than the easy spells in canon.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-nine]] made me fall in love with Percy. Percy is dealing with survivor's guilt from the war and is incredibly isolated. He starts to engage when an old friend is wrongfully accused of murder. This story has murder, mystery, and romance. Can't go wrong.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] is massively popular and for good reason. Harry never goes to Hogwarts, so Voldemort's rise is much less hindered. He gets found by a ragtag group including Hermione, Ron, Neville, Ginny, and Draco (newly disillusioned with Voldemort's cause).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] is an old favorite of mine. It was started in 2004 and completed in 2006. After a climactic battle, Harry gets zapped back into the Marauders time. This is not a happy fic

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2209675/1/And-So-Life-Goes-On][And So Life Goes On]] is another one from 2005. Harry is living a happy enough life volunteering at a children's shelter. He has amnesia but is getting by. Until he runs into someone who claims to have known him from his childhood, a past that he can't remember.

*** I remember reading Saras_girl fics and Tread Softly.. I remember reading Turn so clearly. Shortly afterwards, I saw somebody had posted this XKCD about angular momentum. And I associate that pic with this fic somehow.

How could it have been so many years? Wow. I know it has been so many years, but it is so hard to believe.

Those were the best days of HP fandom. Before the last two books were released, the fandom was so active. I guess I just forget it was so long ago. The last book was released in 2007. That is 13 years. So almost 14-15 years in fandom. Wow.

** These are the ones in my bookmarks in AO3 right now. Hope you like some of them.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22431970][The Bucket List]] Draco will die in six months if he can't get Harry Potter to fall in love with him. Since that's not going to happen, he might as well spend his last days working through his Bucket List.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16036310][Soup-pocalypse and The Great Curry Cataclysm]] Eleven years after the war, Draco Malfoy leads a quiet, boring, and perfectly respectable life, thanks very much. Or, at least he does, until a sudden and very unexpected veela awakening causes him to throw soup all over Harry Potter in the middle of the Ministry cafeteria.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25490311][Needs Must]] After Ginny Potter dies suddenly, Severus Snape is among those called in to help Potter juggle his new reality.\\
As the other helpers fade away, a desperate and penniless Severus agrees to become the regular caregiver to Potter's three young children.\\
But Severus finds that the Potter household is not the sunshine and roses he'd imagined.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26460403][Far From The Tree]] The arrival of Harry Potter's children---snapped back in time, the children themselves guessed, twenty or so years---was the most interesting thing to happen at Hogwarts for years. This has D/s

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19056670][Earning His Forgiveness]] When Snape brushes off James Potter's attempt to make amends, James makes a game out of winning the Slytherin's forgiveness. Instead of giving him some peace of mind, however, the game causes his feelings toward his once rival to spiral out of control in a direction he never anticipated.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9065263][Written on the Heart]] Harry doesn't /mind/ that so many Slytherins from his year have returned to finish their NEWTs, really he doesn't. It's just -- do they have to be so friendly? He's not prejudiced, really he's not. It's just -- they've got to be up to something, right? Unnerved by the attention he's attracting from everyone -- the Slytherins are the least of it, to be fair -- and struggling with a raft of changes to Hogwarts itself, Harry wishes he could be happy that one constant remains: Draco Malfoy really fucking hates him.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][House Proud]] His house liked Draco Malfoy more than him.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21758962][Who we are in the shadows]] What happens when you're forced to become the very thing you despise?

Ex-Auror Harry Potter, tossed out of the Ministry for something he had no control over, has been looking for a way back to his former life. When he comes across Draco Malfoy in the criminal underbelly of Wizarding London and in need of protection, Harry figures bringing him in to face the Ministry's justice is his ticket back to everything he's lost.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8662435][What Real Thing?]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1227880][All Our Secrets Laid Bare]] Over the six years Draco Malfoy has been an Auror, four of his partners have turned up dead. Harry Potter is assigned as his newest partner to investigate just what is going on.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16135016][Against all Odds]] “Oh no, please, no!” Percival interrupted him, obviously knowing what the older man was talking about. “I read about it, it´s irreversible and binding...” His horrified eyes glanced at Newt before he closed them. “Mercy fucking Lewis--”

“/Percival Galahad Graves!/”

“-- /he´s just a child!/” Percival hissed, glaring at his father.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16138103][you've got the antidote for me]] When Harry Potter unintentionally severs their soulbond before it can fully form, Draco Malfoy resigns himself to a slow death and decides not to burden Harry with a soulmate he's made it very clear he doesn't want.

He's never been selfless before, but for Harry, he can try.

They are not my best ever because most of the HP fanfiction I loved, I read through LJ, etc and I dont have links to them anymore.. But I have read a few of these multiple times. Some of these are the OGs which I adored so much and found them again on AO3. Some of them might have D/s or heavy angst- read all the warnings. I think 2 are from the first fantastic beast movie. I really like Angst and novel length fics. Hope you find at least one of them enjoyable.

** as you said you like generating conversations I have to say I love the trope of Harry being a mess as an adult/human and people (tends to be draco) helping him,

I also love the trope of gay cooking enthusiast Harry!

though honestly I'm just here for gay wholesomeness, and now that I wrote that I only just remembered that I'm making a collection on AO3 for stories with slash and femslash that aren't angst and have happy endings, it's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/low_angst_high_atmosphere_and_queer_wholesomeness][gay as in happy]]

So if people have stories that fit that criteria, then feel free to add them!

Some angst is fine because bad things happen but I want it to be a collection of stories of gays having good lives and finding love and not dying <3
