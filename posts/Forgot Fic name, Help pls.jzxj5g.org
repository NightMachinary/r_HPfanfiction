:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Anyway I reposted this cause someone helpfully said I should get more help in [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]. So, please help.

This is more of a Severus Snape centric fic, as Harry doesn't even appear on it. The ship is Severus Snape/Lilly Evens, time-travel, and fairly long from what I remember.

It's a time travel fic where Snape wakes up in his 4th or 5th year before his argument with Lilly anyhow, and proceeds from there. I remember Snape being confused as to which part of the year it was and not remembering small things like what they were doing that week in class, housemates, etc etc cause it's been 20 smth years or whatnot.

And then Snape proceeds to take both his OWLS and NEWTS in advance, and graduates early while Lilly and the rest were still in school. He and Lilly get together at one point, but I don't remember when.

One of the main points of the fic I remember other than Snape graduating early is that Snape got a Potions apprenticeship with this really famous Potions Master at the time. Slughorn or Dumbledor hooked him up, but one thing was that Snape and the Potions master he became the apprentice to didn't get along at all. They were hella cold to each other and stuff, mostly cause they were really alike in personality or smth, and not in a good way.

Anyway as the Apprentice, he had to work in the shop, and very rarely allowed to brew portions in the basement at the beginning, and had a room at the top of the shop to live in, and a small wage or whatever.

And obv, he and Lilly started dating, and one thing I remember is that as soon after they got together, Severus made himself sterile (NOT impotent) through a spell or smth because he didn't want a second Harry Potter to exist. I remember this esp cause it says that the spell was usually used in the older times as a dark spell in order to stop the heirs of prominent families become unable to have children, which could end entire bloodlines and stuff. Basically Snape said this and proceeded to make himself sterile like the cold mf he is.

Other small things I remember is that Lucius Malfoy came to the shop and showed off a bit and turned his nose at Snape or smth, and at one point, Snape and this muggle-born witch (OC) kind of become friends and she was hired to work at the shop cause Snape badly needed an assistant to help cause he was basically running the shop by himself? And I think the muggleborm witch had a muggle bf or husband or smth.

And I don't remember whether this was an ao3 fic or from fanfiction .net so it could be from anywhere honestly.

I don't remember an ending to this fic, so I either didn't finish reading it, or it was yet to be completed.

Anyway that's most of what I remember, so if anyone knows the name of this fic, or a link, please put it down below.

Thanks!


** linkffn(The Apprentice by Deborah Peters)

But it's abandoned. You might like linkffn(No Strings by PaintedRoman) . It's inspired by The Apprentice but it's not Severus/Lily. The author has hinted at Severus/Mary Macdonald. Which is Severus/OC for all intents and purposes.

  In 1998, Severus Snape was given a second chance. In 1976, he has to figure out how to take it.

  Severus Snape waited for death to claim him as Nagini's venom solidified the remaining blood in his veins. Except he woke in a bed...in the Slytherin dorm...at the age of sixteen... Inspired by: The Apprentice by Deborah Peters. Warning: None of the characters you recognize are mine, I only borrowed them without permission. I dont get any money though, so I'm told its okay.
