:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I recently posted an ask looking for fics where Sirius became the secret keeper didn't betray the potters but somehow survived and are Sirius centric. The only ones I'd ever read with this concept was the promises unbroken series. And someone said there was a fic that fit this premise where Remus is headmaster and James is in a wheelchair but they don't remember the name. I've never actually read this fic but I'd like to. Does anyone know what fic this is?


** That is one of the fics in the Promises Unbroken series.

** Ah shit, I've read that one, but for the life of me, I can't remember the title. I read it years ago, and the author first published it before OotP came out. There were author notes apologizing for glaring inconsistencies that weren't apparent inconsistencies at the time the fanfic was written. Arabella Figg wasn't a squib, and the super-duper council of good guys wasn't called the Order of the Phoenix. I remember all kinds of disjointed details, but I don't want to spoil anything for you since you want to read it, so I'm gonna black this sucker out like an SCP report.

IIRC, the plot gets kicked off when Sirius escapes from Azkaban, which the Death Eaters have taken over. It transpires that he is actually the chosen one this time around. He has a few one-on-one confrontations with Voldemort.

The story is pretty dystopic, overall. The Ministry is recruiting anyone they can for the Aurors, and they keep accelerating the training. Charlie became an Auror, and died.

Later in the story, the Ministry falls, lots of people die, a big battle ensues as the Order covers the escape for the low level clerical staff and stuff, Dumbledore dies, James becomes Minister cause there's not too many options left, the remnants of the Ministry hides out in some muggle office buildings, and I think the story was unfinished.

There's also a scene where the Death Eaters try to lure the Potters out of their safe house by posing as muggle firemen, Lily sees through them, and a skirmish ensues.

There's also a part where Bill is snuck into Azkaban for a daring rescue, and he has his wand on him, disguised as a transfigured fingernail. Voldemort himself is interrogating prisoners, and discovers the wand.

Arthur Weasley shines when he takes this magically retrofitted boat out to Azkaban for a daring rescue, and he and his team manage to orchestrate a collosal jailbreak, and even rescue Bill.

Also, Lucius has a sister named Julia. She pops into the story, does some spying for the Order and the Ministry, then she has to leave when someone is suspicious of her.

Dean Thomas's mom goes nuts after his dad dies, and burns all his wizarding stuff. She also refuses to send him back to Hogwarts, cause the world has gone FUBAR, and her son could easily die. Fred and George break him out of his house in the Ford Anglia so he can rejoin the fight.
