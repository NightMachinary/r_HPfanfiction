I am looking for some decent smut with a story. No slash. Preferably set during the Hogwarts years. Things that are not Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna would be appreciated


** Technically both linkffn(2290003) and linkffn(10402749) if you aren't against those pairings. I know they're not everyone's cup of tea.

  Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

  When Harry and Ginny broke up, they thought they were each doing what was right for the other But is it possible for them to be "just friends", especially when it seems like someone keeps trying to kill them? Mature sexual themes.
