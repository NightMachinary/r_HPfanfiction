I was wondering if another student had been with Harry in the Chamber proper fighting the Basilisk or if Harry still had his wand if they could have levitated the sword and fought the Basilisk with it from a relatively safe distance instead of being in melee with the beast. I understand if Harry even with his wand could have gone to fight with the sword in hand like he did to fight Quirrell in PS because he's still not use to having magic, but I can't stop thinking that the stereotypical pure-blood would have gotten their wand out and used the Levitation or even a random animation charm on the sword. I also get that technically the goblins' magic could prevent this, but it could also very well not stop the levitation from taking hold.

What do you think, could Gryffindor's sword be levitated and used to fight the Basilisk this way?


** I dont think it would be very practical. Plus indont believe the sword had a molnijir-esqe rule on it. More like hogwarts gave it to harry when he asked for help had it been a member of another house they would have received something else that would help them in that moment. At least that's how I see it

That's not what he said. Obviously some goblins and I think Snape were able to lift the sword, but it could still be magically protected against magically moving it (like the horcruxes were).

Doubt it, the hat used to be Griffindor's that's probably why it was linked to the sword.
