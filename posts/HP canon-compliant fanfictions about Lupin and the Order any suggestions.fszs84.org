  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  Remus Lupin is a werewolf, and werewolves can't be trusted to fall in love. He's always believed that. As the Second Wizarding War begins to play out around him, he begins to have feelings for a clever, funny and talented Auror. And she has feelings for him too. Follow Remus through the gathering storm of war as he tries to piece together a life for himself despite the dangers around him, the death of his last best friend, and the effects of being in love for the very first time.This is not going to be a traditional romance. It is a story of love and werewolves, of learning to fight like a Muggle and to trust in himself. The story follows Remus from halfway through Order of the Phoenix to the end of Deathly Hallows. It's canon-compliant. I skim over the scenes we see from Remus in the books, but they can all be assumed to happen exactly as written. Major character death is for those already described in the books.

** I recently read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279/][Still Life With Skull]] by TheDivineComedian, and I think it's one of the best canon-compliant interpretations of Lupin's ride in on the Hogwarts Express at the start of Harry's third year.

TheDivineComedian has written many great Lupin-centric fics. I second the recommendation for their fic "Calibration".

  September 1974 and Remus goes a bit loopy, what with the moon, and the teenage wolf, and his friends who are not Animagi yet, and the creepy dead thing that is following him around.Sirius had a horrible summer, too.

  A rather dark coming-of-age story about Remus Lupin, a misguided family, the death of innocence and the renewal of hope during Voldemort's first war. Part I of The Moon-Cursers. Now updated to be DH-compatible.
