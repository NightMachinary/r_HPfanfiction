I can't come up with enough associations to find the story (I think it might be a Tri-Wizard story in which Harry gets independent and assertive), but it has a scene during a meal where Dumbledore is approaching Harry, trailed on either side by Snape and McGonagall. Harry sees them coming, and asks Hermione which shoulder is supposed to have the angel, and which the devil.


** Oh wow. I can see that being pretty decent symbolism or foreshadowing in a story. Sweet.

*** I'm pretty sure it was Harry making fun of them, but it could easily have been symbolic, as well.

** If I remember correctly the devil sits on your left shoulder and the angel sits on you right. Goes back several religions where the archangel michael who is the right hand of god.

So if the symbolism was to work then snape should be on Dumbledore's left side and McGonagall on his right side.

Edit: regrettably I have not read a story with that scene in it.
