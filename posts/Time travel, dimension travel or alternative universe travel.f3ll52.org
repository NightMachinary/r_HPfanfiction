Any fics that features one or multiple of these things with Harry or one of his many alternate self's as the protagonist would be appreciated.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle.

**** Not... Really. It can be read that way, if you like.

​

Basically, Harry and Hermione are super broken over the loss of their loves Ginny and Ron respectively. Thus they lean on each other. It doesn't specify exactly what that entails, nor is it really needed.

​

So no, not really. Even if you read it as them being intimate, it would hardly qualify as 'romance' in fanfiction terms.
