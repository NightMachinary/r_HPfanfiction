No actual Slash, no Harry mindlessly deciding "I will be Draco's Submissive so he can live" or whatever bullshit reasons the Yaoi fangirls use. No Harry ending up with Malfoy (Death Eater revisionism, especially for the sake of slash is just plain wrong). I want to see Malfoy shunned to the point where Umbridge and Harry actually team up to make Malfoy's life hell.

In Veela Draco fics, the Half Breed hating Wizarding Britain bend over backwards to support Malfoy and force Harry with him. I want the exact opposite. I want Veela Draco to be shunned, hated, and seen as a disgusting half breed by Wizarding Britain.


** "I'm your mate! You have to help me," screamed Draco, his supposed allure active, "We have a certificate by the Veela nation!"

"Bullshit. I like girls, and I despise you," Harry said.

"Potter, you arrogant brat, marry Draco!" Snape yelled. "Detention for a month!"

Harry whispers in Umbridge's ears. She smiles and says, "Draco, detention for telling lies. Snape, we'll investigate this behavior. I should have expected such from Half-breeds and death eaters"

Yada Yada Yada...

"So it came out that Snape was convicted of being a death eater, Malfoy is now ostracized in Slytherin, and Umbridge got arrested for sending Dementors after me because she couldn't shut her mouth. Best year ever!"

** "Draco Abraxas Malfoy," Umbridge called from the podium in the Great Hall. He swiftly stood up, looked at Harry, and mouthed the words "You are mine, Potter," after which he gracefully made his way to the Teacher's Table.

"Did you file this petition in the ministry?" Umbridge asked. She was sure it was some sort of misunderstanding, Malfoys were some of the purest blood to be found in the magical world.

"Yes ma'am, I did."

"Are you sure?" Umbridge asked, now shocked.

"Yes of course Madam Umbridge. Why would I waste the precious time of the Ministry on a false petition?"

"I don't think you know what the petition means, Mr Malfoy," Umbridge refused to see the truth staring at her.

Now Malfoy was getting annoyed. "What more should I do to prove it, Madam Umbridge?"

"This paper says, and I quote, 'I, Draco Abraxas Malfoy, of sound mind and body, under no external influence, hereby state that I am a male Veela. As such, I demand that the wizard named Harry James Potter be married to me post haste to ensure my survival through puberty.' Are you /absolutely/ sure this was written by you?"

"Yes," he answered through gritted teeth. The Great Hall was quiet, so quiet in fact that the sounds of elves cleaning the dishes could be heard.

"Very well," she motioned behind her, "Dumbledore, if you would."

"He is but a child Madam..." Dumbledore pleaded for his precious scarface, "Please consider giving him the counsel of his father at the very least."

Father? But James Potter was dead...

"You heard him, Dumbledore," she said sweetly, "do I need to remind you that as per Decree 69, you not adhering to ministry procedure can have you kicked out of Hogwarts?"

Dumbledore hesitated, "Please, madam."

But when her hand went inside her purse, producing a letter and a quill, Dumbledore broke.

Faster than Draco could see, his wand was in his hand and a spell was travelling towards him. "I am sorry, child," Draco heard him say before everything went dark.
