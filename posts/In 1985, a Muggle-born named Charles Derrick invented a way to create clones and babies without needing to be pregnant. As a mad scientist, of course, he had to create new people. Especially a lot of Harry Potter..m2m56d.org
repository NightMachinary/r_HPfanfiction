#+TITLE: In 1985, a Muggle-born named Charles Derrick invented a way to create clones and babies without needing to be pregnant. As a mad scientist, of course, he had to create new people. Especially a lot of Harry Potter.

Being fascinated by Charles, he took the DNA of many Muggle-born, half-blood and purebloods and mixed them together. Nobody expected so many new students at Hogwarts. Especially those with names like THJ-555.


** Three things that strike me right away.

1) New baby magic thing is invented in 85. Let's say at the earliest he has gotten all the DNA he needs from multiple sources later that year. Still it would Iikely be 86 before they are 'born'.

2) All the kids would be 1st year in 97, that year Death Eaters were in charge. Oh boy, it's like magic itself us gifting them tons of mudbloods to torture!

3) Only way to not send the kids straight into a slaughter house is to alter your timeline. Move the invention date backwards a bunch, forwards a few years, or shift the timeline that canon happens in.

**** Still people are gonna be out for blood when they learn someone has been stealing their blood and making kids they didn't ask for. I bet in some eyes it's gonna be akin to blood magic.

***** Only if they figure it out, depending on how widespread (in generations and space) the collecting of the material was it is possible that barely anyone will even figure out that a kid is biologically theirs, not like kids are always a miniature version of one parent or as if anyone who looks somewhat like someone else is always related to that person. Chances that other than magical traits that a family specifically acquired somehow (eg. Parseltongue, metamorphagi) no one would have a way of checking parenthood.

****** Can the Black family tree track down those of Black blood?

******* Not sure? It is not explicitly stated whatever it works by tracking blood or if someone had to add to it. In FBCoG the Lestrange tree was said to do it, but since the name of Leta's brother only disappeared when she told the story I have no idea how reliable it really is. I figure that if it /did/ track down by blood it would have to be far bigger then it is shown, plus there is always the possibility that it just doesn't use the blood of the person to keep track, but the act of giving birth or fathering a child, a bit like the trace actually.

******** There's also those fics where Harry time travels to the past to find his name on the tree despite not being born yet. Could be like that. But couldn't Voldemort technically be of the Black family tree after using Harry's blood for a new body?

********* To clarify, at this point we are petty much discussing fandom, more specifically the more tropey stories with the whole nobility angle.

The way those tree's work on those kind of stories is /really/ inconsistent as hell, assuming that the magic on them is automatic instead of needing someone to manually add each name then it would supposedly be along the lines of the magic tracking each new person who is born from that particular bloodline (won't even try muddling through the whole family Magic's thing cause /that one/ is a contender for the top spot as the most vague plot-device /ever/) in this case it would only include people who are born from a member of the family and include /all/ of them, regardless of carrying or not the name or even considering themselves from another family. Alternatively the enchantment covers the whole planet and updates itself when someone with the blood of the family (?!?!???? Like, how would it even recognize if someone has the blood of the family unless they are birthed by someone of the family? Maybe tracking based on being related to a particular ancestor or another? It /really/ has some /serious/ plot-holes) the second one is pretty much the only way I can see Harry being added to the tree on those kinds of stories.

Regarding Voldemort it really is up to your particular head-cannon, we generally interpret it as him literally building himself a new body, hence the idea of him being technically related to Harry, but alternatively he could be borrowing/stealing the power to re-make his own original body from scratch, the bone of a parent to symbolize where he came from giving him a foundation in which to rebuild who he is, the flesh of a servant to be the tie he still has to the material plane in the form of those who still serve him willingly and also giving the filling of the body and the blood of the enemy as a reason to go back to deal with unfinished business plus being the stolen vitality which re-ignites his life-power. Bottom line is that both takes are among the many possible interpretations the ritual may have, so while Voldemort /could/ become related to Harry he also could /have not/.
