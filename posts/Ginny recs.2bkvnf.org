Can anyone recommend stories with Ginny's POV, particularly her first year? I have an AU idea along the lines of Ginnymort, and reading more about her first year might give me some more ideas. Alternatively, fics in which she dies in the Chamber would be fine too. (Nothing against Ginny, I swear, Harry just belongs with Tom.)
