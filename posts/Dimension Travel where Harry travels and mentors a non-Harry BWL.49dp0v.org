Hi all,

It's been a while since i've read a hp fanfic and just now i thought of an idea i would like to read. The story as you may have guessed is like the one in the title. Idc who the BWL or even GWL is. On second thought, if by chance nothing nice turns up, i would appreciate a harry mentors harry story too.

Thanks in advance, and have a lovely day.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners) is basically a series of one-shots featuring the same Harry traveling to different parallel worlds each time. He mentors some of them, and fights others. It's really good, in my opinion, although sadly it's not that long.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
