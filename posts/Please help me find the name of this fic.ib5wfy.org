:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It isn't much to go off of, but I know for a fact I read this on AO3. Key scene I remember is harry being resorted into Slytherin, and later, daphne greengrass among other Slytherin being disturbed by the fact that after the dursleys are tried by the wizengamot, Harry believes the greengrass family only took him in to use him for political power. Meanwhile most of Slytherin genuinely cares about him and his well being.


** You might mean the "those cunning folk" series by lucy_blue linkao3(13766460). Harry gets adopted by the Greengrass family and most of the Slytherin students are his protectors but there's no resorting.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's first friend is the garter snake that lives in Mrs. Figg's backyard. Harry Potter likes the family from the platform, but the redheaded kid doesn't seem to like his snake too much, and Harry sits with other people. That's all it takes to change things. Harry Potter is Sorted into Slytherin. The world is slightly different.

*** I think you're right, thanks for beating some sense into me about the Re-sorting part. I think I was getting that mixed up with Other People's Choices where he is re-sorted after the Chamber of Secrets.
