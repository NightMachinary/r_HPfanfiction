I am tired of looking at these multi-pairings that make Harry out to be this sex hungry man child. I want a good story where Harry actually Dates around and has friendships with several witches at Hogwarts. I am NOT looking for a Harem, however normal school angst is great.


** Harry has dated a few girls so far in this fic, but has yet to reach the main pairing yet. An AU fic where he's two years older, etc. Very enjoyable imo

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

Takes a while to get to Harry dating, but he has had three girlfriends to date (Cho, a Muggle OC, and Mandy), and the author has confirmed that he will eventually end up with Ginny so that means at least one more.

** The only one I know where Harry dates multiple girls at Hogwarts is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief).

It's Harry and Hermione centric with alternating perspective, with Harry at Hogwarts dating around and learning how to defeat Voldemort while Hermione gets homeschooled, dates a muggle and learns how to ruin purebloods. Eventually the two somewhat seperated plots merge into a post-Hogwarts Harry/Hermione romance where Harry is an auror and Hermione is secretly the thief he's hunting, which makes things somewhat awkward for her.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
