female snape no slash


** So Harry's also the product of rape via love potion? Because canon snape is a greasy, hook nosed, sallow skinned bastard. Or bitch in this case.

**** I think it had more to do with the fact that people expect Harry to have at least one of his parents be the same person when the other is changed to someone else, so having Snape be his /mother/ means he would be a child of Snape and James, and they get along no better than Sirius and Bellatrix.

It would probably be good crack if anyone ever wrote it, though.
