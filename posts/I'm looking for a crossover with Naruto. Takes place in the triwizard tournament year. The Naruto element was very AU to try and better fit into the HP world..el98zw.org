A contingent of ninjas/wizards come to hogwarts for the tournament. Tsunade is there leading them. They don't use chakra, they use magic in a different way. It was said that back where they came from ninjas/wizards were divided into different sub-schools/departments early on, depending on what they show an aptitude for. One may have been direct combat and another may have been healing, I can't remember. Each different department gets a different symbol on their forehead protector. Naruto was in one that trains people for leadership roles, and I think the symbol for that was wands crossed like an X.

They didn't have a flashy entrance prepared like the other schools, so Tsunade told Naruto to make something up on the spot. Pretty sure he magic'd up a giant illusory fox or something.

Also I can't remember whether or not it was actually any good, but I'd like to find it.

  What would happen if there was a fourth school at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Cup. A school that not many know about and those that do are both amazed and terrified of the students, even Dumbledore.
