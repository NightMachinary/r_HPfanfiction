:END:
I can remember the ending where a woman buys Wool's orphanage and she's technically the OFC daughter. The spirit of the OFC and Tom are in the orphanage and the woman sees them in the window and they essentially live in the building happily as ghost children?

They grew up together on the orphanage and the OFC has a strange curse where when she dies she has a daughter? Something along the line of that...
