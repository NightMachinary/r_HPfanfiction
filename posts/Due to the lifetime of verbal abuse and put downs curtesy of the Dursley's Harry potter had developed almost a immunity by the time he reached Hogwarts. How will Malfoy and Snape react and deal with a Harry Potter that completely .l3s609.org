Seriously, though, it's one of my all time favorite fics. I'm not a huge fan of the pairing, but the whole thing was so phenomenal that I loved it anyway. It will always have a special place in my heart.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

I don't remember Harry being miserable although it has been a while since I last read it. More just used to interacting through sarcasm and not caring about things in the same way that others might due to his history with emotional abuse. Its why everyone is convinced that Harry and Snape hate each other like in canon when in reality they are on decent terms. They are a putting on a front to others with insults and sarcasm that has a completely different meaning to them than to everyone else. I find it to be a humorous take on an otherwise depressing situation with multiple characters being somewhat emotionally messed up.

*** Canon Harry isn't stoic at all. Being emotional is a pretty important part of his characterization.

#+begin_quote
  Canon Harry Potter is immune to insult, taunts
#+end_quote

This is simply untrue, especially where his parents are concerned. But Harry doesn't ignore the taunts and insults lobbed at him personally either. He responds with his own jabs and insults.

#+begin_quote
  Even when the whole school turns against him in canon he pretty much shrugs his shoulders and stays business usual.
#+end_quote

He was actually pretty upset when Justin ran from him in the library in CoS. He even speaks with Ron and Hermione about it and tries to talk to Justin. He literally hid in GoF. He argued with Seamus and got mad at Lavender in OotP.
