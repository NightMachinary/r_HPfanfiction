One of which was used right in front of McGonagall. He successfully used the cruciatus curse on the female Carrow(whatever her name is). The other was used in front of Ron and Hermione by using the Imperius curse twice in order to break into Gringotts. In dark Harry fics, the three of them consistently espouse the mantra that "under no circumstances should a wizard use a dark spell."


** Well, Hermione has no issues with morally questionable (eg Umbridge, polyjuice, Marietta). She would not be neutral to a casual use of them, but she has a "the ends justify the means" attitude, even in canon.

And Ron is probably the same. He would not be comfortable with the casual use of such spells, but would/did not object in a do-or-die situation.

*** Totally agree. It just pisses me off how one dimensional they make the two other main characters in the book. Ron hates anything dark, even the colour green and Hermione is the naive do gooder that has an obsession with following the rules and never doubts authority. I can see how they got there but its so one dimensional. Those are the mindsets of early teenagers, not people in their late teens.

****** Lol. It's just weird though. Hermione alone does things in the series that far out does her trapping Skeeter in a glass jar for half a day. Her leading Umbridge into a centaur ambush would, realistically, result in Umbridge being maimed, raped and/or killed, and Hermione would know this (they had already been warned, even). But people on this sub always mention the skeeter thing, so I'm wondering if this is like a trope in Hermione bashing stories or something, lol.

***** It's just that imprisoning journalists triggers my "third world dictator" alarms. Freedom of the press is pretty sacred where I live, even if you decide to make drawings of The Prophet. It's not that Skeeter shouldn't be imprisoned, or that the punishment Hermione gives her isn't deserved. I only feel uneasy because Skeeter is a journalist. An unprofessional, slanderous bitch but a reporter by title!

Not that Skeeter would see her just punishment for her slander in the HP setting. The British magical government is apparently only interested in cauldron bottoms, underage magic users and Sirius Black, which they will pursue with /uncharacteristic ferocity/

Madame Kovarian: The anger of a good man is not a problem. Good men have too many rules.\\
The Doctor: Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why I have so many.

Hermione is all about following the rules, submitting herself to authority. She is a good and proper person because she was raised to be a good and proper person.

**** Hermione follows authority as long as she agrees with their decisions. As soon as authority gets into the way of what she thinks is right, she ignores any and all rules. Teacher sabotaging Harry's broom? Set him on fire. Illegal dragon growing? Smuggle it out of the school and out of the country by breaking both rules and the law. Voldemort breaking into the third floor? Sneak out after curfew, curse the one student who tries to stop you, and break into the vault yourself. Think Draco is a criminal? Steal ingredients to brew a potion, drug and kidnap his friends so you can impersonate them to interrogate Draco. Need more information? Trick a teacher into giving you access to the restricted section.

And that's just the first two years. Hermione's respect for authority is entirely fanon.

***** I forget which fic I saw it in, now, but there's a characterisation of Hermione as a very well brought up, english-middle-class-affluent high-functioning sociopath, who just doesn't get, on an emotional level, that there's a difference between slipping a whoopee cushion under someone and setting their dog on fire. (Intellectually, she can tell the difference, but to her the emotional content of the two acts is the same). So she makes sure to know the Rules so she doesn't do something that scares the normals by accident.

That's why, in situations where the Rules no longer apply, she doesn't bat an eyelid at outright criminality.

** Let's look at that scene with Amycus Carrow:

#+begin_quote
  "It's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's us what's in charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price."

  And he spat in her face.

  Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, "You shouldn't have done that."

  As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, "Crucio!"

  The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. "I see what Bellatrix meant," said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, "you need to really mean it."

  "Potter!" whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. "Potter -- you're here! What--? How--?" She struggled to pull herself together. "Potter, that was foolish!"

  "He spat at you," said Harry.
#+end_quote

I think Harry /was/ going dark, and was basically free falling from the moment he cast the Imperius curse. That confrontation wasn't about being practical with dark magic or about the "ends justify the means". That was Harry torturing a person because he wanted to hurt them as much as he could. In a way, that contributes to the fanon that using unforgivables makes you dark.

These are people who they were fighting a war with and who were going to commit genocide (already actively doing) and at best were going to conscript the ENTIRETY of Englands next generation with a proposal of join (holding ones family hostage) or die (wiping out ones entire family like they did The Prewetts, Potters, Bones, and many others).

Now is the idea that dark curses cause you to become corrupt? Could be? I tend to think it only comes down to often you rely on it to solve your problems for you, just like with any other vice.

** According to canon prior to the seventh book too.

I'm not really sure how anyone can justify using torture techniques prohibited by whatever passes for the magical equivalent of the Geneva Convention and (ordinarily) punishable exclusively by spending the rest of your life with demonic entities who force you to relive your worst memories and the pain that comes with them, in retribution for a minor slight.

Nor can I see how anyone could justify using mind control techniques similarly prohibited by the magical equivalent of the Geneva Convention just a few words later---and worse, /fightable/ mind control techniques---for the purpose of picking up wands, which could be accomplished just as easily by stunning them and summoning the wands.

I don't deny that there are dark!Harry fics which make some characters who are main characters in canon 1-dimensional. Nor am I going to delve into the ethics or morality or lack thereof of the Gringotts escapade, or uses of Unforgivables in other situations. But Harry and McGonagall's actions in the scene with Alecto Carrow are indefensible in my opinion.

I can also kind of understand McGonagall's inaction and general acceptance of Harry's actions. She'd have been forced to do nothing while the two, along with certain students, tortured and and kidnapped her students, so when she got the chance who knows how she'd react. I mean, Mrs Weasley killed Bellatrix when she nearly killed her daughter. McGonagall meanwhile let Harry torture the women that tortured her students. You can't really defend it , but I can understand why they did it.
