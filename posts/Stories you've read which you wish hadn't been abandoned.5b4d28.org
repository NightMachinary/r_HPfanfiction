Over the course of the last few weeks I've been having a read of various HP Fics and came across some which, in all honesty, I wish hadn't been abandoned by their authors.

Two of them that I read was Life Sucks, Then You Die by Radaslab, along with their other story, 30 Minutes 2 (The Gathering Storm).

Another one I was reading was Lily's Next Great Adventure, one by Vance McGill, which I was getting quite into last night before it ended suddenly.

What stories have you read which you wish hadn't been abandoned because you've been enjoying too much/found quite interesting


** Oh and lets not forget linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure), who posts here regularly. Really great story in which Harry receives Albus Dumbledore's memories just at the start of what would be Deathly Hallows. Harrydore is a really interesting character. I wish that it would get finished!

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

*** This looks interesting and I'm going to have to add it to my list of things to read in the future. Forgive me a bit of laziness, but can you tell me whether when you call him "Harrydore" if it is a merging of the two minds into one indistinguishable awareness (which sounds awesome) or if it's just Harry who has the memories the same way someone remembers something that they once read in a book (also kind of awesome, but I like the first one better.)

**** Taure addressed this issue in this subreddit. Iirc he was happy where he left it, that and the fact that the fandom were rabbidly asking for updates.

I would've loved if Taure updated it but I'm also fine where Taure left it. It's like the Valbone fic where Potter was marooned in a forest with the sorting hat. A story where he fulfilled his premise.

** There are like a million of them.

I no longer love the story, but I'd still like to see the ending of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by S'TarKan).

I really enjoyed linkffn(Culture Shock by Ruskbyte) --- it was a crossover that shouldn't have worked and yet it did, and then it got abandoned. (I also like linkffn(Backwards Compatible by Ruskbyte) though it was less unusual. linkffn(Flying Without A Broom by Ruskbyte) was also great crackfic, again, abandoned.)

I was really enjoying linkao3(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) before it vanished. An interesting Peggy Sue fic with an unusual (and highly, highly overpowered) young Hermione in it.

I'm unclear on whether linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li) is gone or not. I'm hoping it isn't. It's an interesting, Ender's Game-ish AU.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero by brainthief) was good fun, a neat story featuring Harry as a very reluctant summoned hero in an AU with a female Harry equivalent, then got abandoned. (No, the author didn't demand money to finish it, that's a persistent myth.)

linkffn(What You Leave Behind by Newcomb) seems to have been left behind, which is a shame, it was well written.

linkffn(The Sun Dog by enembee) got off to a nice start but then got abandoned. Enembee's series that starts with linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) and linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by enembee) was left unfinished --- those two logically led in to a third story that was never written, and the first two parts were really awesome. Enembee is a great writer, but sadly never seems to completely finish anything.

linkffn(The Book of Dobby Reboot: Per Arcana ad Astra by Doghead Thirteen) was some of my favorite crackfic but was very definitively abandoned according to the author.

Oh, and I remember liking the Avengers/HP crossover linkao3(My Name Is Yasha Romanoff by ShunKickShunKers) before that seemed to get abandoned, but it has been too long for me to remember still if it was actually good or not.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter never actually beat Voldemort, but rather fought him to a standstill while Europe burned around them. Finding himself an unwilling part of a dark ritual to send him back in time twenty years, he is surprised to see how Dumbledore reacts to proof of obvious child abuse (Harry's), how eleven-year-old super genius and Witch Queen in training Hermione reacts to actually having a socially competent friend (Harry), and how much easier it is to shrug off the insults of munchkins when you're a grizzled war veteran.But there is one huge problem: being sent back blew out his magic entirely. Just waving his wand knocked him out the first time he tried it. Can Hermione help him though his classes even with his magic almost unusable? Will Harry be able to find the secrets to actually killing the Dark Lord and saving his friends from a horrible future without blowing his cover, or even getting mistaken for the Dark Lord himself? Will Neville Longbottom get better grades than him?

The story is still there, the account is still there, ergo, no ban. There are a lot of ff.net authors with Patreon accounts, btw, though I personally think it's not a great idea.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

** A bittersweet potion series : [[http://www.intertexius.com/_index-harry-potter-fanfiction-and-art.html]] Five books are completed, but Book 6 is a WIP since 2007. It's Snarry and quite dark but masterfully written.

** Two fics top the list for me: linkffn(Ectomancer by RustyRed; Wit of the Raven by japanese-jew)

Ectomancer has some of the best fight scenes in the entire fandom, and Wit of the Raven is a really interesting AU that I want to see developed further.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

** linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) closed off one of the major plot-points but left the fight with Voldey unfinished, which is a real shame. Still 100% worth the read though.
