Does anyone know any well written dark harry storylines? The only one I have read was the DP trilogy by Kurinoone. Also any great ones in general? A community of fics would be great!


** *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167): one of my top favorite fanfics. Unlike most dark Harry fics, this one has him going dark after defeating Voldemort, along with Ron, Hermione, and the DA. Even better, they are mostly in their canon characters, and the story is very believable.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Sacrifice Arc by Lightning on the Wave is a huge EPIC, spanning 7 books, the story features a powerful and determined Harry, who is not afraid to use dark magic and allies with death eaters and dark creatures. The world building is phenomenal, with the best theory of dark and light magic I've encountered, the magnificent battle scenes are not to be missed.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]]

Another one is A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold. Also feature a powerful Harry, in a much darker world setting than cannon. Going by cannon standards, the Harry here is definately a dark wizard, but remember, dark doesn't necessary mean evil. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]] "When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war."
