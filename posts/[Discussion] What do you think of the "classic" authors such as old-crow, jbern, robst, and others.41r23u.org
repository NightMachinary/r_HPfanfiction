I've read all of their stories, and they're somewhat good, but not good enough to be considered "classic". So what does everyone see in those authors' fanfics that makes them so good? (Besides, other than robst, none of the "classical" authors have stories in the top favorited stories on FFN. Most of the top stories are written by authors that are not too "well-known" or "classical".


** They're old. They've been around for so long that everyone's read and in some cases favorited them. It's almost like a rite of passage to read one of their stories.

** You can add another dozen authors to that list. PerfesserN, chem prof, Clell65619, etc ad nauseam.

For most of them, I've never really seen the reason for the love. BUT. I'm going to suggest a different way of looking at it. We're sort of seeing a condensed version of art through the ages. Nobody is going to claim any neolithic cave paintings as brilliant works of art. But they led to the next thing, which led to the next thing, which led to the next thing, which unfortunately led to pickled cows being considered art too.

Of the three authors you specifically mention:

- old-crow - I've never seen why people go on about these stories. The latest one - Dan Granger - was (is? difficult to tell if it's finished or not) a good story, but the rest are frankly just bad. Relies far too much on his own OCs and muggle tech.

- jbern - I really like 'The Lie I've Lived' despite its faults. I can tolerate 'Bungle' but think the sequel is utterly awful.

- robst - he has some of the best ideas anywhere in fanfiction. The trouble is that he uses them all in the first five chapters and then goes on for another 20. Or 100, in the case of that never-ending bore-a-thon, Harry Crow. That story was the biggest let-down in the history of HP-FF for me. It had some really, really good moments and then the climax - as I said in my review - came down to "We fought. I killed him. We thought Hermione was dead but she wasn't" - it really has about that much tension. I still like 'A Different Halloween', which skips over boring stuff to get to the interesting bits. He really needs a team of beta readers who administer electric shocks every time he starts to lose focus.

On the subject of underserved reputations, the most-reviewed HP story on FFN is Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which is the most turgid, unenjoyable piece of crap I've ever encountered.

I don't really have a point here... it was just ramblings about the authors you mentioned. I suppose I'd rather recommend stories instead of authors when it comes to FF.

*** Ugh, yes so much. I read the first couple hundred words of Methods of Rationality, and it was as you said- a turgid bore.

The story dragged on and on with useless filler. I don't know what anyone sees in it.

** I question whether there actually exist meaningful classics in the fandom. Consider that the single most reviewed fic --- HPMOR --- was written by someone who isn't really a part of the fandom and who mainly used it as a didactic vehicle, with many, perhaps most, of his fans having not read a single HP fanfic before or since. Consider, also that, at least going by postings using the bracket notation for 'ships, FF.net has more than twice as many Drarry and Dramione fics (each, not combined) than the canon pairings fics or the Harmony fics. (I've reproduced the search counts I got as of two months ago below.) Now, it might be that Draco fans are just more likely to tag their 'ships than non-Draco fans, but it does make one wonder which subfandom gets to decide what's "classic"; maybe Dramione/Drarry fans do.

Even within, say, Harmony, someone like Robst is only a classic author in the White Knight / Nice Guy school of romance; while Rorschach's Blot (of the Caer Azkaban school) is the classic author in the Harem school, for example.

**** Well, here are the things you get by that metric:

- By favorites: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10]]
- By reviews: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=3&r=10]]

Looks to me like each subfandom is represented to some extent, which is consistent with my sense that there really isn't a consensus of "classics".

** Most of them haven't held up well, though some of them were never good to begin with. Seriously - Harry Crow, it actually boggles the mind that people think that's a good story, though I think most people just don't know better.

** Every single one of them wrote about something that was, at the time, different. We look back now, and we think that their stories are just... well reiterations to the same song and dance we have read before, but we dont realize that these "classical writers" created a fair amount of the cliches we all...feel about. We also forget that alot of these stories are complete, and when they were uploaded were extremely consistent.

To be fair, I don't think Mark Twain was an amazing writer. But I acknowledge that he was a classical author. I dislike robst, but he had a major impact on the Fanfiction world of Harry Potter. Just like all the "classical" authors

**** Not a full comparison. I am saying that Mark Twain created storytelling as we know it. Robst, Jbern, Old-crow, ect all told stories that influenced the creation of the modern HP fanfic. You can hate them all you want, thats the truth. another example is that I dislike the Beatles, yet they are considered one of the best bands to have ever existed. I dislike alot of Jbern... But he still made some of the best fanfictions in the Harry Potter universe, even before the whole series was past fifth year.

** Can't say I've ever heard of old-crow or read any of robst's stories (think he writes purely H/Hr?). Jbern, I still love some of his stories to this day and believe they have held up quite well, notably The Lie I've Lived and Bungle+TML.

Shezza (Denarian series as well as numerous one-shots) has held up well, as has nonjon (helps that he writes mostly humor). Rorschach's Blot has not held up well, imo. And there are far more "classic" authors than the few extra I've listed here.

I think the reason why they are considered classic is that they are old and were doing something "new" at the time. They were also popular early in the HP fanfic era, meaning fewer readers around to favorite/review. Grammar, spelling, and other technical errors were much more common, and the overall quality of writing was lesser back then, but the "classic" authors were consistently free of technical errors as well as actually /completing/ their stories.

Of the top ten most-favorited stories on FFN, two are by "classic" authors: robst and Rorschach's Blot. And #11 is by nonjon, another "classic". But yeah, they don't hold the majority.

tl;dr: They are considered classic because of age and innovation at the time.

Won't happen, but yeah.

Jeconais needs to be mentioned in any mix of classic authors. Yeah, his stuff turned formulaic and tedious by modern standards, but at the time, he was the man. Guy still can write well. He wrote the Harry we all (if we're male, dunno about female) wanted to be.

Some other classics who should be considered in the discussion: Bobmin, S'TarKan/Veridian, Full Pensieve, Master Slytherin, Ruskbyte, Cygnus Crux.

the classic authors like robst or bobmin may not be to some of your taste but a lot of people liked them and like them still. and there is a reason for that.

you can do literary criticism on fanfiction stories but is it that sort of thing?

** From those authors I've only had read robst's Harry Crow (though I plan to read HP Adventure series). It wasn't good. With characters being made into idiots (hi Dumbledore), so Harry can be in right, GOBLINS DID NOTHNG WRONG, weak knowledge of the canon (Durmstrang in Bulgaria) and many other problems it can't be called. But it had good ideas (inferiuses, how Quirell was dealt with) and it read well enough so I enjoyed it. Also, if I remember correctly, author was a teacher. Which makes his idealisation of teenagers' relationships slightly disturbing.
