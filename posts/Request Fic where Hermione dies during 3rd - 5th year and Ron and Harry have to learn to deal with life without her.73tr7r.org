Basically, I'd like a story that has Ron and Harry character development that results from Hermione's untimely death. I do not want Ron bashing (or any bashing). Don't care if it ends up being Harry/Ron slash if its well written.


** This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but I thought I'd link it anyways because it accomplishes sort of what you're searching for.

Basically, Hermione's parents pull her out of School after 2nd year due to the Basilisk attacks and transfer her to an American school. The story picks up after she return to England and takes a teaching position at Hogwarts (where Harry is also working). The whole story is basically about how Ron and Harry made it through without her.

I will warn you it is an HHR piece though if that's not your cup of tea.

**** Eh to each their own, I've had this discussion with a lot of people and I see where you're coming from. Chemprof has a certain style of writing that I've found people either enjoy or absolutely hate with no in between.

Personally, I'm alright with it.

****************** But it's just silly. Why hate an author's diction when they aren't doing what you're saying they're doing? Do you really mean you hate when authors use it at all? Must be tough finding fics that don't have any of those words in it.

Do you download the fics and then search those words on the file to make sure there isn't any before you start reading?

******************* Whatever asshole. That's not what I meant. The first paragraphs made Harry and Hermione seem like pre teens. If you couldn't get that twice I said I was exaggerating the amount of times the words are used you are a god damn idiot. Stop trying to be a pretentious ass that doesn't understand some stuff rubs people the wrong way. Must be fucking nice in your little world where calling someone silly and trying to humiliate them because they don't like a fic is chill.

******************** I dunno where you got the pretentious thing from. Nothing I've said was pretentious. Condescending? Sure, but only because you were flipping out on me. I never called you silly, and I seriously wasn't trying to /humiliate/ you. It's a Reddit forum, and we're deep in a thread. Where exactly is the attempted humiliation happening? You've honestly just confused the hell out of me.

The author uses the words you picked once, yet you claim it was too much. I asked you if using it just once was enough to annoy you. But you said that wasn't the case. So I've really no idea what you're trying to say.

Does using those words once become too much? Because that author only used them once or twice, so that must mean that using them once or twice is already too much for you, meaning there was no need for exaggeration. You could have just said once or twice was enough.

***** I'm actually in-between in regards to Chemprof. When I initially read his stories (namely "Hermione's Plan" and "Notebooks and Letters"), I thought he was the best writer on FF, period. Going back for a second read, I had less of a highly favorable opinion of him, though I still thought his writing wasn't too bad, yet it wasn't other-worldly either.
