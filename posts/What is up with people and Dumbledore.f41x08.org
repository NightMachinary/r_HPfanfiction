I see a lot of fics complaining about how Dumbledore is too compassionate and can't fight a war, because of how late he told Harry the truth about the prophecy. This then somehow extends to Dumbledore being unable to sacrifice people for the greater good, and too compassionate to fight a war. People, he sacrificed Harry for the greater good. He loved Harry! Harry was his favorite child! And yet, he sent him to his death for the good of all Britain, because it was necessary. I think he can make the hard decision.

Then, on the other hand, there are people complaining that Dumbledore is manipulative and heartless. Sometimes, these are somehow complaining that he's incompetent, which doesn't make ANY sense. First of all, he sacrificed his own life for Draco to live. His fault in the fifth book was compassion. He's wracked by self-doubt and guilt throughout the entirety of the series. He's by no means a "manipulative old bastard." The reason he never gets angry is because when you truly understand someone, it's hard to angry at them, instead of just sad. Dumbledore has empathy with the whole world. He's burdened by that knowledge because of the compassion he carries.

Finally, fighting for the greater good doesn't make him heartless at all. It actually demonstrates his love for Britain. When a soldier fights for his country, sacrificing their enemy for the people he loves, we say they are good, because they have the compassion and strength to make the difficult decision. The same is true for Dumbledore. He is compassionate, empathetic, wise, and strong, and doesn't get enough credit. Appreciate him.


** I think the big problem with Dumbledore is that people fundamentally fail to understand the character. They either think that he's a moustache-twirling machiavellian secret villain, or that he's a doddering idealist fool.

The truth is neither. Dumbledore's character *in my opinion* is itself an inherent conflict. He is both an idealist and a pragmatist.

He would /like/ to just be able to quietly run his school in peace. But he also has never been able to bring himself to stay uninvolved, in anything, and in the fifty-odd years between Grindelwald's fall and Voldemort's return, he has the power and reputation to do essentially whatever the fuck pleases him.

So despite the fact that all he wants to do is be Headmaster, he has this feeling of obligation that he /must/ choose to remain Chief Warlock, he /must/ choose to remain Supreme Mugwump, because somebody else could have gotten it wrong.

But in so doing, he stretches himself too thin, which is why he has all these mistakes that people point to as evidence that he's incompetent or malicious. In truth, he just doesn't have enough hours in the day.

Even better, it doesn't preclude moral Dumbledore or manipulative Dumbledore. Either way, he's still getting involved where he really doesn't have the energy to.

I may be wrong, but I think that Dumbledore unwillingness to deal with Draco was not because of his compassion, but rather because sending Draco to Azkaban would have likely either blown Severus cover or killed him because of this vow. Saving Draco's life (and his parent's) was nice, but making sure his spy is in his needed position was probably more important.

***** What Dumbledore directly tells Draco, and Snape in a flashback, is that he wanted to give Draco the chance to not be a murderer and save his soul. That's where the compassion part comes in, and it also nearly caused to become the murderer of multiple people who weren't Dumbledore himself. So by being compassionate, he allowed his students to be attacked and almost killed. There were other reasons to his actions, yes, but that's what the other commentor was addressing. Also:

#+begin_quote
  "And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?"
#+end_quote

This wording shows that there were a lot of ways for Dumbledore to deal with Draco without getting Snape killed. Hell, if Harry had used Sectumsempra on Draco without Myrtle around or when Snape was in another part of the castle then Snape still wouldn't have been killed by the Vow, since it wouldn't have been within his capabilities to save him. Likewise, if he was preoccupied with something and Dumbledore has Draco arrested or something without telling Snape beforehand, Snape would be unable to prevent it, and if he can't reasonably storm Azkaban all by himself, then it wouldn't be within his abilities to rescue Draco. He would have to wait until he had the support of Voldemort before trying with other Death Eaters, which would get Draco out of the way and allow Snape to keep his Vow. Although I doubt Dumbledore would go down that route because he would fear that that would push Draco further away from his side, "condemning" him to Voldemort's side.

As for Snape's position, there's plenty of opportunity for someone to catch Draco without Snape's involvement. Harry had been saying the entire year that Draco was working for Voldemort, so all Dumbledore had to do was look at Draco's arm and use Legillimensy on him and use Harry's testimony as an excuse. Or set someone up to catch him in the act, like having one of the House Elves spy on him during the year, again using Harry's suspicions as an excuse for Voldemort.

Regardless of his actual reasoning he put innocent students' lives at risk, when he could have done something about it without risking Snape's position or Draco's soul (at least, it would have been less at risk without the chance of him accidentally offing one of his classmates).

*** I can see your point about Draco. That wasn't the greatest example on my part for his compassion. On the other hand, if he had interfered, Draco's family dies. From Dumbledore's perspective, Draco was trying to kill him, and if he retaliated, Draco's family dies. Hindsight is 20/20, and I don't see how he could have foreseen Ron and Katie. That brings me to another pet peev: people blaming him for everything. If people get attacked, it's not necessarily his fault. That's like blaming the principal for a terrorist attack on a school, where the principal also has to hold two head international governmental positions because everyone else is so incompetent. Give him a break.

**** 1) Draco's family weren't exactly innocents (unlike Katie and, arguably, Ron).

2) Dumbledore doesn't have a duty of care to the Malfoys, unlike the duty of care that he does have, and ignores, in the case of Katie and Ron, and anyone else attending the school.

3) It can be easily argued that any duty of care that Dumbledore has towards Draco is nullified when Draco starts trying to kill other students.

** Dumbledore heavily suffers from the series (particularly the first half) being for children/young adults - because his actions *have* to result in a situation where Harry & his friends get to solve everything. So they seem to be at odds with his description as a powerful, wise wizard - and instead seem to be either super callous or incompetent. Similarly, some of what happened to Harry (eg, the abuse/mistreatment by the Dursleys) transitions from being played for laughs in the first few books to being treated a bit more seriously - again reflecting poorly on Dumbledore.

That's what leads to him being seen as manipulative/heartless - because his actions (needed for the plot's sake) with all his power are not easily reconcilable /in universe/ with someone super nice - at least, not without some tweaks, unfortunately. I think he's a wonderful character, and most bashing of Dumbledore is laughable - but I can see where it comes from, and a lot of it was basically unavoidable...

** My only issue with Dumbledore is the "ten dark years" confession. Dumbledore knew that Tom grew up in a loveless environment, yet places Harry with the Dursleys. Its kinda down to luck that Harry didn't snap and became Dark Lord 2.0.

I'm also kinda surprised that Dumbledore didn't really do more in preparation of Voldemort's return. The Order was mostly absent in HBP, and in DH they didn't do much aside from escort Harry and be killed.

This is all true. He's also a passive, arrogant enabler. A mostly well rounded and polarizing character. So kudos to JKR on that.

The biggest issue with Dumbledore is the writing. The series is about a child and two children typically figure things out and solve a bunch of problems the greatest living wizard should be able to do. So between having Harry and Hermione solve problems, "ten dark and difficult years", and Harry saying Dumbledore possibly wanted him to meet Voldemort, it's not hard to come to the conclusion that he's either really stupid or very manipulative.

As a fan of the character, I don't really have a problem with the hate for the things he did. His character devolved in the last three books, it's clear Harry needn't have stayed with the Dursleys everyday for ten years, he should have done something about Snape, etc.

I do have a problem with blaming him for Sirius being in Azkaban, saying he believed in the prophecy, and the thinking that Harry didn't need to stay with the Dursleys at all. Also the stealing of Harry's money and marrying him off to Ginny. It's waste of a contract.

** The reason people shit on Dumbledore in any direction, too compassionate and pacifistic or manipulative, is that his Actions are at odds with his Character. The way he is described, the way he is characterized, is in a mostly positive light. A kind man, who made mistakes but did his best.

When faced with the bald truth of his actions though, he fails to meet that standard. Criminal negligence and stupidity are the best interpretations of his canon actions.

There are reasons for this of course, mainly that books one through three are mainly children's fairy tales, with the evil family, the fantastical rescues, and the children saving the day. Dumbledore makes sense in real life as a character. In Universe however, his actions are appalling.

So while many people can recognize the purpose of Dumbledore's actions from a JK Rowling literary level, when we are writing our own stories that examine consequences of actions, Dumbledore does not come out smelling like a tragic rose that did its best.

** I'm not a fan of how Dumbledore has become the ultimate evil in fanon but I disagree wholeheartedly with you in your sugarcoating of him and his actions. He constantly manipulates Harry...he constantly makes poor decisions while distrusting everyone else and their competence...he constantly lies through omission. In many ways Harry and Co. prevail in spite of Dumbledore...not because of him.

That's why the epilogue and Harry naming a child 'Albus Severus' after him rings so false for me. While I don't think he should hate Dumbledore holding him up as the paragon of virtue to be admired after how he was treated by the man is naive and cheap.

** I wouldn't go so far as to say Dumbledore was heartless or manipulative, but he often made decisions that put entire the entire school full of children in danger. Like in the Philosopher's stone when he sent all the children back to their houses when the troll got in. Both Slytherin dorms and Hufflepuff dorms are located in dungeons. He sent children where there was supposedly a troll roaming.

Then telling a school full of children not to go to the third corridor or die a most painful death. Children test boundaries. Telling a school full of them not to go somewhere or they'll die is certain to peak their interest and have them going to investigate. Then his decision to not inform the government and just place Harry with his relatives, while I understand why he might have done that, it was a stupid decision to place any child without some sort of oversight more than a squib who allowed him to continue to be abused.

He had no right to do so and yet he took it upon himself anyways. As well he left a baby who was able to walk on a doorstep overnight in November. He could have walked off and gotten hurt. He could have been kidnapped or an animal could have wandered up and taken a bite out of him. That's not something any logical person would do.

I think he was a slightly arrogant character with the major flaw of being at the very least negligent. He might have been trying to do his best, but his best was absolutely awful. And while I understand the necessity of this to the story I completely understand why so many fanfic writers portray him to be awful, abusive, and manipulative.

Really? Well, imagine someone sacrificing your child and then telling you that he really regrets doing it, but it was for the Greater Good and he would do it again. You would, of course, be not angry at all, you would immediately forgive him and thank him for loving the world so much that he would do something like that, wouldn't you?

"Greater Good" is nothing but an excuse for all the evils you commit for one reason or another, whether it's true or not. If mankind can only be saved at the cost of innocent children who don't get a choice, then mankind is doomed anyway and doesn't even deserve being saved.

By the way: The fact that he says that he regrets this or that doesn't make it a true fact at all. He could simply lie, you know? People do that at times. Manipulative old bastards, if he really is one, even do it all the time. There wasn't a single scene across all seven books that was written from his perspective, was there? How would we know anything about what he was really thinking and feeling?

Why didn't he knock and explain the situation to Petunia? I never really liked Dumbledore and this is just one reason why.

** When it comes to his character - he suffers a lot from the tone of JKR's writing and a focus to tell a compelling story, rather than well rounded character arc. We transition from primarily children's stories to young adult fiction. A series that has phenomenally captured audience of all ages. And thus we have a fandom obsessed with analysing every aspect of the books.

My personal view of Dumbledore is someone who tries to do the right thing. He understands the difference between what one needs and what one might want. For Harry it is need to keep him safe from roaming death eaters, dark creatures and his own fame - all of which could end with him either dead or like Lockhart - drunk on his own fame. As bad as Dursley's were - they never outright abused him. I find it remarkable that he grew up to be confident, head strong, brave enough to snipe and talk back at them.

Unloved yes, but not as severely mistreated as fandom likes to imagine. Additionally legally speaking they WERE the family he was to be placed with. Simply following the law Harry would have very likely ended up with Dursleys regardless.

Also it is worth keeping in mind that logic is not something wizards (including Dumbledore) are good at. And we as readers have all the hindsight in the world. It is much more difficult to make deductions and decisions in the heat of the moment, without knowing all the facts.

**** Unloved and neglected yes. Also realistically Drusleys would be charged with mistreatment, neglect and abuse of a minor.

However having had some experience with abused children - Harry does not exhibit usual signs or symptoms. As I said - Harry is surprisingly well adjusted, brave and does not fear talking back at Dursleys. Which in my opinion means they barked louder than they bit. JKR of course wanted to write a compelling adventure story and did not deal with issues of child psychology and consequences of abuse.

Realistically canon treatment (prolonged periodic solitary confinement, starvation, constant bullying by his cousin & other children, lack of any meaningful social interactions, constant reminder of his lack of worth and being a burden) would have resulted in severe anxiety, inability to trust, extreme social awkwardness, myriad of behavioural ticks (e.g. likely to steal and hoard every bit of food). Among other issues. Not just mental, but also possibly stunted physical development.

Fact is in canon we see none of that. Not to the point that would be expected. Thus it leads me to conclude that Harry in canon was not nearly as abused.

However I am in no way defending Dursleys or their actions.

** A lot of posts here will have captured various aspects of the widespread inability to make a properly realised Dumbledore but to put it crudely, it is also just /exceptionally/ difficult to write an intelligent character, particularly one that is supposed to be more intelligent than you, the writer, are yourself. Unless you are a genius, it will always be an uphill struggle trying to capture the cleverness of a character that is supposed to be one. Figuratively speaking, if you or I or the random redditor on this board has 1 or 2 or 5 plates spinning over any given day, Dumbledore might have 50 one minute and then another 20 the next.
