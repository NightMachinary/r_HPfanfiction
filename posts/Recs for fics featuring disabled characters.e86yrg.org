** Depending on what you consider disabled some of these may not qualify.

*Afflicted with Filth* is told from the perspective of a girl with Selective Mutism and Depersonalisation-Derealisation Disorder. She struggles to be aware of her surroundings at all among other things. linkao3(38609057)

*The Accidental Animagus Verse* is a series in which Harry accidentally becomes an animagus as a young child and is adopted by the Grangers. Although the fic itself does not focus on disabled characters, there is a significant plot line during Year Three which focuses on the discrimination werewolves face due to their condition, and numerous characters who are not in canon bitten by werewolves end up becoming werewolves. linkao3(977214)

*The Arithmancer Verse* is a series focused around a Hermione who is a genius with numbers. Although the fic does not directly focus on characters who have disabilities, Cedric survives his encounter with Voldemort during 4th year, but loses both his wand arm and a leg. linkao3(993900)

*The way around, the way through* is a one-shot crossover between Harry Potter and Firefly in which Remus interacts with River. River is mentally disabled due to the torture and experiments that were inflicted on her. linkao3(230950)

** These are all from the Harry Potter fandom:

Finding Himself linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][4594634)]] is about Cedric Diggory who survives the graveyard encounter, but with a serious injury.

Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][6554218]]) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21004346][21004346]]) follows Harry after he's been blinded by a Death Eater attack. It has a sequel, Harry Potter and the Blind Seer of Durmstrang linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6673903/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blind-Seer-of-Durmstrang][6673903]]).

And my own, Basilisk Eyes by Hegemone | T | [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16269131][AO3]] | [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160266/1/Basilisk-Eyes][FFN]] , is about how Harry adapts after he's blinded in the Chamber of Secrets. Most of the fic takes place at the Perenelle Flamel Adaptation Center where he makes friends with a number of disabled ocs.

** It depends on what you characterise as disabled. I'm fairly certain I've seen a couple of learning difficulties Harries around, along with the usual crop of physical disabilities from Blindness to having difficulties with movement.

Any narrowing down? It might help others find stuff you specifically want.
