All aboard the S.S. Betrayal! I think I've only read 1 fic with this ship so far, I'd like to read more featuring this pairing. Doesn't need to be the main pairing, doesn't need to be complete, but must be decently written and have an interesting story.

Thanks in advance! :)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.
