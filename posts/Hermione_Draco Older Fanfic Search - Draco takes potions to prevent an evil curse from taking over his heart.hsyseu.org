:END:
Looking for a hermione/draco fanfic that I remember reading a long time (~10 years) ago. It starts out as a lighthearted comedy and Hermione, Draco, and Harry all work for the ministry (Draco fought for the light during the war). It becomes dark pretty quickly and you find out that Draco is obsessed with Hermione because they were romantically involved during the war but Draco was slowly becoming consumed by something evil. Hermione had her memory obliviated and Draco takes potions from Snape to stay sane. The fanfic was incomplete at the time so I don't know how it ended but it's driving me crazy trying to find it again.

The only other thing that I can remember is that the first chapter started off with Hermione wanting to take a vacation for the first time in ages but then some interaction with Malfoy ruins it.

Sorry if it's overly specific or not specific enough! I think I remember reading it on adultfanfic.net but it may have also been on the normal fanfiction.net
