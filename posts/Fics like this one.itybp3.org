I've been away from reading fic from this fandom for a bit, and perhaps my favorite work in this fandom is Wind Shear by Chilord. What fics are similar in premise and/or writing style?


** There's one called To Bow With Pride that has similar 'time-traveller Harry meets and gets the respect of the Black Family' only with more deets on how he goes about gaining that respect.

There's Whiskey Time Travel, which has that same 'competent Harry time-travels back, is a bit brusque, and generally kicks arse'.

Catching Lightning in a Firewhiskey Bottle is a bit of a sad version of Wind Shear.

  When a man with startling green eyes who looks strikingly like James comes to tutor the young Black generation, Sirius is sure he'll hate the git. Who is this man who charms the notorious Blacks? And how does he see through Sirius' pranks? [Earlier chapters edited and beta'ed] Mentions of het, slash, femslash. But a gen fic.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.
