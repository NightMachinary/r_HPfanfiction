I came across this story and it's one of the best I've read in recent times. Well written, driven plot, believable characters, scary (and intelligent) Voldemort, not over powered characters, No romantic sup.

  Voldemort realises that Harry is a Horcrux as he is escaping from Privet Drive at the beginning of Deathly Hallows. Voldemort captures Harry and is determined for the Horcrux to be in control. However, Harry will not go down without a fight, he is determined to finish the task Dumbledore has given him. Includes Hogwarts. Very dark version of Deathly Hallows.
