**** If it helps in sociology we separate impairment from disability. For example, impairment is defined as the physical/medical issues of body, whereas disability is defined as the social, political and/or physical barriers that disable people with impairments from being able integrate into society.

In a world of magic where magic can be used to as an enabling/supporting device disability as a social construct or physical barrier is diminished. What impairments are debilitating in a magical world is then called into question. Is blindness really a disability or impairment as a wizard if you can see with more accuracy than a normal eye? Or losing a limb as traumatic/tragic when a prosthetic is equal or superior to the original? Many people in the disability movement feel that if the adequate arrangements were made that supported/were sympathetic to their impairments then they would no longer be disabled. For instance, people in the Deaf (capital D) community do not consider themselves to be disabled and many don't associate being deaf as an impairment as deafness does not negatively impact their lives.

***** Thanks for the elaboration. It's a bit more of a literal answer than I was hoping for --- in that I wonder whether whether if an impairment (to use proper terminology) is a major part of the premise, it is betraying the premise to bring in a compensatory superpower that is "better" than the lost capability in enough ways and to the point where you'd expect people to take on such an "impairment" voluntarily.

(As an odd parallel, there's /Star Trek/: If you use technology superior to biology to compensate for congenital impairment, you are Geordi LaForge; but dare to use technology superior to biology to enhance functionality without a "good reason", and you are Borg.)

****** It would depend on what the author is trying to portray by using impairments. Disability is a continuum, for some people having an impairment compelety deroads their life there's no question about that. For others an impairment can improve or add a uniqueness to their life. There are numerous disabled artists and authors whose life experiences after becoming disabled gave them assess to aspects of the world they previously had no conceptions of. Not exactly a superpower, but it suggests that impairment isn't all negative and that there is a positive side.

I would prefer people to write fics that explore something like: meeting people you'd never usually meet/associate with or encountering whole different aspects of the world. Rather than the daredevil effect, where impairments is the counter weight or vehicle to an awesome superpower.

**** I know what you mean, I myself like to put it in super-disability category, like Daredevil, Doctor Mid-Nite or Echo.

Now that you mention it, I totally forgot linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) has main character with "disability". It gets healed (at least partially, some would argue about whether the other condition is "magical disability" or not) later in the fic or in the sequel.

If you don't mind super-disability, give it a go, if you do, you've been forewarned and can skip the fic.

*** Interesting rec... It's better than the summary suggests and the first chapter makes it sound (as they make it sound like Hermione's only purpose in life is to teach the SlightlyMoreBadassThanCanon!Harry Important Life Lessons while being Someone To Protect --- and while there's some of that, there's relatively little), and yet,

- It's kind of annoying how it shaves off all of Hermione's rough edges. I get that the author wanted to show Hermione's quiet strength but, well, Hermione isn't quiet. I get that her personality might have developed differently, but I'd have liked to see just how; and a few interludes at the end of each chapter are woefully inadequate.
- For a more concrete example, it casually mentions that Hermione can cast nonverbally (and wandlessly, a little bit). I don't know how I feel about [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower][Disability Superpowers]] (but, as a hearing person, who am I to judge?), but that she doesn't ever do it, in order to fit in. (Hermione's tendency to show off at every opportunity was an important part of her personality. Character flaws are important, dammit!)
- I am honestly conflicted by whether it's a good thing that Hermione's life isn't significantly affected by her friendship with Harry. On the one hand, I absolutely /loathe/ fics that postulate that Hermione would be constantly bullied and/or die and/or withdraw from Hogwarts and/or be generally miserable without Harry in her life, with her life quickly improving once UsuallyMoreBadassThanCanon!Harry enters her life and begins Defending her Honor. On the other hand, with Harry gaining a better understanding of magic, becoming a better person, etc., what does Hermione get out of the relationship?
- Apparently, Hermione's low-key actions have had a significant effect on the plot, often without Harry knowing about them, and they continue to have them. That's a deviation from canon, and it'd have been interesting to read about. But, we don't get to see Hermione actually /doing/ them, just hear Harry learning about them after the fact, often from a third character.
- Along similar lines, there are some interesting missed opportunities. Legilimency is mentioned early on as a substitute for hearing. It's unclear how much she does in the fic, but it raises an interesting question that could have been explored: how /would/ the society look from the point of view of someone who effectively hears thoughts instead of sounds?
- What's with the pointless Weasley bashing?

**** In regards to your second point about Disability Superpowers, as an actual disabled person, (cerebral palsy, not deaf) it's a huge issue. It's all a very ableist way of thinking, as if we (disabled people) need to have a benefit to our disabilities to fit in with modern society.

***** Thanks. Yeah, it seems iffy, especially since the Disability Superpower is "packaged" with the disability in a lot of fics, and this one in particular.

And then, there's the distinction between extrinsic "power-ups" and skills developed to function despite the impairment. It's natural for deaf!Hermione to work very hard to learn nonverbal casting as early as possible, and she is likely to be able to do so; and similarly for her to try to master Legilimency, which she very well could. (A possible parallel is that a blind person who masters human echolocation would be better at operating in complete darkness than a sighted person.) Is that different? I don't know.

Of course, that's where the other issue with this fic is: she develops compensatory powers/skills, but she isn't shown actually /using/ them in interesting ways, because the author also stripped away a big chunk of her personality, including many of the parts that make her an interesting character, rather than an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationallyDisadvantaged][Inspirationally Disadvantaged]] person to Harry. (And, yes, there's a TV Trope for that.)

1. The disability is compensated for by a power that effectively negates it, and then some.
2. The power does not negate it but provides benefits to the point where many intelligent, well-adjusted people would have made the trade voluntarily.
3. The disability is a plot device for the disabled character to be protected/rescued and then romanced by the protagonist.
