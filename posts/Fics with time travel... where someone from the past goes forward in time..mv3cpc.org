After reading certain parts in The Second String, I got the itch to read stories where someone from the past gets sent FORWARD in time to the time of the Second Wizarding War. I'm not picky on who or on pairings as long as it's well written. I would prefer complete fics, or at least fics that weren't abandoned in the middle of a cliffhanger.

** linkao3(15294075) is complete, has a completed sequel and third, but the fourth is only partway done. Admittedly, that partway done is closing in on 500k words and was last updated Jan this year, so I'm pretty sure it's not abandoned at all.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.
