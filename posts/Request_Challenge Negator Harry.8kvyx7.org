Basically want a Harry like Atsuma from Enchanted Arms. Not necessary to have a Devil Golem or any of that, but a Right Arm that negates/absorbs Magic. Any spell he touches with his right arm? Cancelled. Survives the Killing Curse because he blocks his forehead with his arm unintentionally, taps his scar and the Horcrux fades. Of course, obvious downsides. If he touches his/any wand with his right arm, it'll become nothiing more than a stick. Could be partially a humour fic, could add a full Crossover if you want (Harry x the Greatest Golem Hunter, Yuki! would work) Harry would of course end up slightly bullied (Atsuma is) It won't ACTUALLY remove people's ability to use Magic, just break their wands if he touches them, but people would be like "Don't touch me Freak, you'd make me into a Squib" sort of thing. It'd practically be a disability fic, as he couldn't do ANYTHING magical with his right arm (outside of Block Spells in a duel, or grasp opponents wands in a fight) Cutting Potion ingredients? Can only use 1 arm. if he touches the ingredients they'll become useless. Trying to send an Owl? Can't touch the owl or it'd go from Post Owl to normal owl. Him either embracing the arm and using it pragmatically as a Utilitarian, or hating it, trying to cut off, Diffindo fails, Uncle's Knife? doesn't break the skin, breaks the knife. It'll be both a strength and a weakness

Pairing: Anything NonSlash, but if you HAVE to write Slash, use reasonable Pairings (like Neville or Ron) because HarryxDracoxSnapexVoldemortxLuciusxGreyback is just creepy and gross


** It won't meet all of your expectations but it certainly matches the nullifying part. Linkffn(Nullifier by Aedalena)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter, the first nullifier since Salazar Slytherin, doesn't feeling like playing the hero. But when he goes back to the time of the Founders to learn from Slytherin himself, he finds himself in the middle of a war, trapped by enemies old and new.

*** I'd read it if it was complete, I read the monologue, and it seems interesting, but it's not complete. Does he get back to the present time, after going back in time in the story yet.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** Disability? Why? Wear a damn glove damned (some leather!)! Problem solved, now can we move on? :) (and the arm still is his trump card in a fight because any dangerous spell? Yeah, it'll shred that glove and viola: Curse nullified!)

*** Atsuma couldn't touch any enchantment with his arm, and he DID wear gloves. I was going off that. Plus, i was trying to avoid it being an all encompassing GG button that just made him left handed.
