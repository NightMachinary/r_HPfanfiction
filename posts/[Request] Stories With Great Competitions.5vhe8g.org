I was looking on the Harry Potter Wiki earlier and saw that the Uagadou School of Magic once had a student who won a Wizarding School Potion Championship. In addition there are a few other small contest such as Gnome racing and we know Flitwick was once a dueling champion. So I thought it would be cool to see what kind of competitions Fandom has created over the years. Does anyone know any stories where Harry (or other characters) participate in anything like that? I know the Firebird Trilogy had a great Quidditch tournament but couldn't think of anything else I've read over the years.

I'm pretty much good with anything except slash.


** In "Patron", I've changed the Tournament tasks from canon, replacing the three with four, all styled after an element. The Air Task is a broom race, for example. In between the four tasks, there are three competitions for those students who were not chosen as champions - Curse-Breaking, Duelling, and Quidditch.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) has a modified Triwizard Tournament, I don't know if that fits your requirement! It's an AU where Sirius doesn't go after Peter after the events of PoA, and he takes over Harry's well-being as Lord Black.

** Thanks, but I was thinking more like a broom racing league or a story where there is a wizarding chess competition.

I might write that. Give Harry something like an advance skill for transfigiration and have Hogwarts choose him to represent them in a competition.
