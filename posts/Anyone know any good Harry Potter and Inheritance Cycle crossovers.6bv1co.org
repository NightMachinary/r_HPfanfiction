** The last time anything HP/IC was mentioned linkffn(To Train a Dragon Rider) was rec'd. I've not personally read it, though, so I can't swear for it's quality.

If you've already searched and found that, my bad.

  Eager for more power, Galbatorix tried to create the first dragon Shade.

Now with a mind to match his rage, the new Shruikan plans to dish out justice while he searches for his new Name. [On indefinite hiatus: Please see Ch28 for details]
