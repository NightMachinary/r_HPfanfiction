:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am uncertain that this is a real story and not some horrific vision my brain cooked up to make me deeply uncomfortable on the internet, but I yet again ask for your help finding a morally questionable fanfiction.

I'm fairly certain the premise of the story is that Harry is rescued from the abusive Dursleys by a Death Eater. At first I thought it was Butterfly by AislingSiobhan but after a very uncomfortable skim through it doesn't seem right. The DE who rescued him is described multiple times in the fanfic as being the boogeyman that "dark family" parents use to scare their children into behaving. He is basically supposed to be a nightmare even other DE were afraid of who can drive his victims insane just by talking to them. I think he spoke almost entirely in riddles. Harry and Voldie end up involved, I think the author debated adding other love interests in the author notes but decided against it by popular vote.

There is definitely a scene where Harry confronts him(DEdad) after meeting one of his past victims and questions him on why he(Harry) was the only one spared the terrible treatment.

I might be mashing up to many "Evan Rosier" death eater fics in my head but who knows, I just can't seem to find it through tags. This seems like a complicated thing to imagine.

Thank yall for helping!


** I dont know how to use the bot but is it "Life of Lies" by NoctemEterna?
