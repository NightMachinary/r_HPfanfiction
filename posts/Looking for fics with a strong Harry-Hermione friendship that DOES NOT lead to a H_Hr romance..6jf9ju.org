Partly because I realized we don't see a lot of a Harry/Hermione friendship where they actually have anything in common in the books and they normally just hang out with Ron there too. I'm not looking for fics with no Ron specifically, just fics with some better Harry-Hermione friendships. Also I don't mind what age they are, whether it's in Hogwarts, post-Hogwarts with them as adults, whatever.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): not only were they pseudo siblings, but they shared many common interests. Harry was also very strong academically (slightly worse than Hermione) and had better intuitions when solving problems/mysteries.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** linkffn(The Problem with Purity) features a strong friendship between the two. This takes place in Hogwarts and due to the main plot, they share a Head Boy/Girl dorm and have special abilities specific to them. They bond over a bunch of things throughout the course of the fic. If the stated pairings of the fic ick you out, you can just read upto the point at which shipping really starts (it's really obvious)

**** As a HGSS shipper, this is one of my guilty pleasures. Some parts of the fic, such as OP Hermione and Harry and [[/spoiler][how they try to avoid being discovered as Pure Adults and the whole Pure concept]] are fun to read for me. OP Hermione was very unrealistic to canon, it was interesting to see how OP the author could make her. I really enjoyed the H/Hr friendship dynamic in the beginning.

With that being said, Snape is very annoying for the most of the fic. One of the weaknesses is that some conflicts in the story arise out of miscommunication between HG and SS. I didn't really see their relationship as abusive, just extremely rocky. Snape definitely wasn't whitewashed in this story as he is in countless others and there are points where he is pretty mean.

*** Both had muggle childhoods (something that they do connect over) and arguably lonely childhoods. Both are attracted to Weasleys.

Personally I would even argue that they are fairly similar people: they're attracted to the same sort of people (Ron and Ginny are different but they do have obvious similarities), both are inclined towards heroism (SPEW, 'saving people thing'), they end up in similar careers, both were almost hat stalls, both admired Dumbledore/Gryffindor, both needed Ron's positivity and humour.
