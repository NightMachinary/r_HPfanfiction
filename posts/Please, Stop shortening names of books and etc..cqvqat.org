For example: Prisoner of Azkaban -> POA Department of Mysteries-> DoM

It's really difficult to find out what you mean. Have to search everything in 7 Harry Potter books to discover what the person actually meant.

Edit: It reached me that I didn't explain why. English isn't first language for MANY people. Acronyms are based in english. So, for example, a person who read the books in spanish or chinese can't decode this that easily. It has nothing to do with being stupid or unfamiliar with base material!


** Sure let's all stop using the nomenclature the whole fanbase is familiar with and has been using for years because one dude decided to jump into fanfic reading and discussion without acquainting themselves properly with the base material, enough to understand a few simple acronyms. Let's.

*** See here you Troll, Not every one has English as first language. Making acronyms out of this things is horribly tough on other people who read the BASE material on other languages.

** But there are only 7 three letter acronyms to remember. It's not difficult.

** It's really not particularly difficult. I understand in the actual fanfictions you don't want speech shortened to say 'DoM' instead of Department of Mysteries, but on here and in author's notes, why on earth would you not use acronyms that shorten what you're writing, and are more often than not really obvious.

*** Not for everyone, not if English isn't your first language. It's unrealistic to expect people who have English as second language be able to decode acronyms from top their head.

** Please, try and keep up with the acronyms. They have been around for so long now that it becomes second nature. I mean, I understand the whole "English is a second language" thing but unless you've been living under a rock or are only /just/ learning the English fandom recently, you shouldn't have an problems with them.

If you get confused, ask. Don't ask us to stop using them because we won't. It's easier to type in a conversation than it is to spell out the entire book name.
