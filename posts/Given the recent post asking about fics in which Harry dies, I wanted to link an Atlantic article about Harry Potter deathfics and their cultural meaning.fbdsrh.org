Sometimes, I am surprised that mainstream news outlets report on our community. Hope you enjoy!


** Interesting article. One aspect related to this subgenre not discussed is the prevalence of fanfiction that plumbs the depths of emotional drama - whumping favorite characters, creating uber-evil antagonists, and really wallowing in misery. And there are many transgressive themes in most fandoms (i.e., those tagged "Dead Dove - Do Not Eat", those with graphic torture and/or sexual abuse, stories with incest, suicide, cutting etc.). These happen way more than mere "death fics". I've seen the overly dramatic stories called "emotional porn." and in many cases that phrase seems to fit. Some read it for cathartic reasons, as mentioned in the article.

** I've never even heard of death fics before, interesting. But I can't see the appeal.
