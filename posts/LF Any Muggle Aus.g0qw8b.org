Well, just no Avengers/DC crossovers and fics that aren't entirely focused on romance. Thanks!


** linkao3(Of Myth and Magic by Wonkington) is one I think of right away. Also linkffn(Blurring Reality by Terrific Lunacy) which is likely abandoned as well as linkao3(Conviction by Dragongoddess13). They're both worth the read even though they aren't complete!

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and The Boy Who Lived]] is a really neat AU where Hogwarts is a school for spies.

  She knew it wasn't good for her, standing here like this, waiting for something that wasn't there to appear. Something spectacular to happen between misnumbered houses. Something to prove that magic was real. Eventual SS/HG. AU with purpose.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

*** Thanks! All these look really interesting especially Hermione Granger and The Boy Who Lived. I've read Blurring Reality before and I'm still very upset that it's probably abandoned :/
