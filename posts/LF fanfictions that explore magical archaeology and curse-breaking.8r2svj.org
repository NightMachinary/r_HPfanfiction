I feel it's an underappreciated aspect of magic and offers many adventures.


** The One He Feared linkffn(The One He Feared) has half a chapter pretty much about curse-breaking (sort of).

jberns works linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure) and its sequel focus heavily on Harry as a curse-breaker.

A Black Comedy linkffn(A Black Comedy) has Harry and Sirius breaking into magical dwelling using similar techniques.

Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) has several chapters (particularly 12-19) dedicated to both of your requests. The highlight is the chapter about Egypt.

Harry Potter and the Magic of Life linkffn(Harry Potter and the Magic of Life) has Harry join Bill as a curse-breaker in Cambodia, which is pretty interesting. The writer has a lot of grammatical mistakes, just so you know.

As a side note, I just realized the last two books are almost like an archaelogist!Harry story. The three spend 90% of the book trying to hunt down long-lost artifacts through investigating the past, all of which have magical properties and are actually cursed.

Deathly Hallows is practically an Indiana Jones movie, they even have their own version of the Nazis looking for powerful artifacts that come back to destroy them eventually.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  End of 3rd year. While Sirius is on trial to prove his innocence, Harry is abandoned by the Dursleys who, after the Marge incident, have enough of him. Luckily Harry's picked up by Bill Weasley. And ends up joining Bill on a Cursbreaking expedition to Cambodia. He gets far more than he asking for! Disturbing news, promises, trouble and danger keep following Harry's every step.

  Ginny thought she was good enough to avoid curses while working as an archaeologist. When cursed, she needed the help of the best curse breaker to get her sight back. Her brother was too upset to do it, so his assistant Draco Malfoy had to step up to do the job.
