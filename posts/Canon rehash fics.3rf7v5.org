I'm looking for long-running stories that start off from Harry's first year. Different upbringings, sortings, points of departure from canon, whatever, as long as it features all the good school drama/adventure stuff.

The best one I've read so far is Grey Maiden, so I'm pining for something as good.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** You set your bar pretty low. That being said, I'm not sure there are that many that start from the very beginning and manage to make it through all the years. A lot of the early stuff can be pretty boring, so most tend to start later, like 5th year.

Anyways, since you somehow managed to read through the GM series, you'll probably like the R-series, starting with linkffn(2008185)

** That's a widely-cast net! You're only asking for long and good, so it'd help if you could narrow it down. What do you consider long? Can you read WIP or abandoned fics or must it be finished? What main character are you looking for? Any relationships specified? And so on.

Note both of the above have unfortunately not been updated in quite some time. Though Mira Mirth confirmed a couple months ago that OTWTG has not abandoned!

And someone already mentioned the Innocent series which I cannot recommend enough!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] Pretty much hits the nail on the head for what you want.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] Also quite good, I didn't finish it because it's ridiculously long, but yeah early Harry stuff.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] Somewhat similar to PotDK, and there is LV/HP Slash but if you don't mind/can ignore slash it is an amazing fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3655940/1/Harry-Potter-Dark-Memories][Harry Potter: Dark Memories]] This was a really enjoyable fic until the end when it started getting way too touchy-feely. Still a good read until it gets sickening.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]] I remember this being great, haven't read it for ages though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]] If you haven't read this series yet, do it. It's a 7 fic monster but damn it's good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra]] I quite enjoyed this too but I don't have much hope for an update. AU-1st yr Harry with a mystery..

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/2/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] This is great. Again first year Harry with plans for more.

Good luck, if you can recommend any other similar fics for me that'd be great too :)

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
