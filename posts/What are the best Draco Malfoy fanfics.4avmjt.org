** I really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055][Exile]]. This is set in the 19 years between DH & the epilogue.

I love how Draco struggles and grows in this fic.

Linkffn (6432055)

Still incomplete though hopefully not abandoned.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet]] writes my favorite Draco--it's hard to find a good pathetic-but-sympathetic Draco. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas in Prison]] is a particular favorite, set during Luna's imprisonment in Malfoy Manor.

  Christmas in Prison

Thanks for the rec; I checked it out and it was good. I like to imagine something like that happened in canon and was part of the reason Draco didn't give up Harry, or completely support LV in the end.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** The term 'best' is pretty subjective, but I'll give you my favourite.

I don't think the bot is working, so [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2750775/1/The-Code][The Code.]]

The premise is an intelligent Draco, but he's still a prejudiced, arrogant twat. The series as a whole is one of my all time favourites. The first three are complete, and the fourth and final one is an ongoing WIP.
