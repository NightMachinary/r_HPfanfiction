Idea, OC is from a darkish family, but his family uses plant magic to offset some of the negative effects of the strongest dark arts. This leads the family to marrying a generation to halfbloods, falling out with some of the more bigoted purebloods. Thus, our OC is focusing on certain plant magics to make money and cleanse some dark corruption from his secret study into the dark arts


** Not what you want but I couldn't just not do it:

  My name is Octans Cetus Black, my friends call me OCB. My family has always been known to utilize, shall we say, the darker shades of grey magic. What isn't commonly known to the broader mass of magical society, is that the Black family long since has been doing its best to counter the unwanted side effects of those shades of magic. Our efforts had, I am afraid to admit, mixed results. We were able to negate the most obvious signs of non-light magic abuse. Missing nose, glowing red eyes, paper like pale skin and so on. Yet, we were never able to deal with the psychological symptoms that our use of magic on the invisible spectrum of light brought. Plant based magic, due to its natural origins, was always a cornerstone in our research. Sadly in recent years no further progress has been made and I am afraid that I am about to go against the Black family creed. This muggle herbologist is my last and only hope to bring the Black family back to its former glory and I hope that future generations will forgive me.

  “You are saying these plants have powerful light magical potential?” He is a muggle but his insistence on the magical properties of his plants lead me to believe that he is at least aware of magic. Magical relatives? Squib?

  “Sure thing bro, very clean, clean high dude. Purple Haze man.”

  Curse those filthy muggles and their lack of proper grammar, and yet this might be our last chance. And ‘purple' /is/ on the visible spectrum of light.

  “How would you suggest I use them to unlock their full potential?” I ask. It is doubtful that this muggle knows anything about the proper use of plants in magic, but at this point I might as well not take any chances.

  “Smoke ‘em?”

  Oh ... oh I will ‘smoke ‘em', and return the Black family to its rightful place. “MUHAHAHA cough cough ... oh fuck yeah that's plant magic alright.”

P.S. OCB is a popular brand of rolling papers over here. Not sure if it's a world wide thing.

P.S.2 Both Octans and Cetus are constellation names.

** theres this character called briar from the circle series by tamora pierce. id recommend looking him up for ideas.

the series itself is largely kind of directionless but the use of magic in more esoteric disciplines is very neat

** I would honestly love a fic with Neville specializing in druid magic, or Harry in elemental (lightning is always fun) magic. The weasley family specializes in fire magics, the Blacks in necromancy/dark magic. Luna is either an illusionist or a mind mage, etc etc. I feel like there's so much potential there.
