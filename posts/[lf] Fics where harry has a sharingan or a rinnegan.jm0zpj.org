#+begin_quote
  Obito was dying he knew that and nothing could change it, he found it a fitting end for a man like him to die alone in an empty forest, lost among the Dimensions. but when a young boy stumbles upon his dying body missing an eye he decided to try for one last act of good and gives the boy his right eye. the boy's name Harry Potter. Sharingan Harry but limited in abilities.
