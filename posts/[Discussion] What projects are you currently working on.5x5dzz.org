First, to the mods: Sorry, I had no idea how to flair this, so yeah, flail me alive if it's improper.

Now, to the heart of the matter, as the title says, it's really an excuse for shameless self-promotion on everyone's part, but I'm also really interested to see what will be posted/published/updated in the next few weeks/months.

What are you all working on? How far are you in? Is it a crossover, do you plan on finishing it? Is it published yet? What do you want to tell potential readers about it?

And since I'm the OP, I also figured I'd start.

- *Title:* On a Twig, Looking up the Sky
- *Type:* Crossover (Tokyo Ghoul x Harry Potter)\\
- *Rating:* M (MA)
- *Warning:* Torture, gore, violence, language, major character death, Cannibalism, PTSD, Dark themes, OC part of the main cast,...\\
- *Genre:* Tragedy\\
- *Status:* Not Published, incomplete
- *Summary:* Survivor of the 24th ward, Akane Watanabe decides to flee japan in haste, right before its lockdown.\\
  Her destination? Britain. Although shackled and willfully ignorant of the world she stepped in, Akane will stop at nothing for her freedom, even if she has to eat everyone along the way, including herself.

- *Title:* Conquest of Paradise\\
- *Rating:* T\\
- *Warning:* Minor warning for violence, language, very minor GW2 crossover (strictly to lore that I did not invent)
- *Genre:* Action / Adventure\\
- *Status:* Not published, Incomplete\\
- *Summary:* The year is 1996, Harry Potter just finished his fifth year. Back in the Muggle world, he still cannot help the strange events happening around him.\\
  This year, however, might prove even more unusual when a strange woman appears in front of him, by-product of a storm that had nothing natural.\\
  Her name is Enwe, and she is an artificial construct of the ley-lines sent to prevent the end of the world.\\
  Harry may just start believing in deities after this.

** Title: Recipe for Disaster

Type: Regular

Rating: T

Warning: OCs because 1940s, slight AU

Genre: Drama & Mystery (I guess?)

Status: Incomplete

Summary: (Copied directly from AO3 because I'm lazy):

In 1945, Albus Dumbledore defeats Gellert Grindelwald. Later in 1945, Dumbledore is weakened, captured, and killed by the remnants of Grindelwald's Magic Army. In 1947, Alexander McElroy, leader of the Magic Army, is caught, apprehended for Dumbledore's murder, and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss. Later in 1947, Headmaster Dippet hires Tom Riddle as professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts.

In the beginning of 1948, Stateira McElroy, upset over the loss of her brother Alexander, lashes out against a fellow student and lands herself in detention with Professor Riddle. It all flies out of control from there.

** - *Title*: Fortuna Favet Callidus

- *Rating*: T (for now)

- *Warning*: minor violence, language.

- *Genre*: Drama/Adventure

- *Status*: In progress

- *Summary*: A Slytherin!James fanfic in which the Potters are a traditionally dark family. The plot follows James and his father, Charlus, (Fleamont is James' grandfather in the story. Screw Pottermore.) through their Hogwarts years and the primary conflicts of their eras. I'm using a more sporadic writing style as an experiment, so chapters may not be in chronological order when the POV is not James. It's my first fanfic, so I doubt it's very good, but if people would take the time to read it and tell me what they think it would be much appreciated, as I've not received much in the way of constructive criticism as of yet.

** I've never finished a fic as I always lose interest or doubt myself. Another problem I have is delusions of Grandeur about writing epic fictions. For instance I started planning and plotting a fic following 3 Generations of a Goblin family through the various Rebellions, Grindelwald, Voldermort and the Goblins long thought out revenge on Wizarding kind. I had plot points, family trees shit loads handwritten in a journal that I wrote whilst on holiday (sad I know). I stopped because it was too much for me at the time so it's shelved.

My current worm has been in my head for 6 months and I actually opened up my laptop today and wrote some scenes. It's an AU of Harry Potter in a more classical fantasy setting, knights, mythical creatures play a huge part and I'm just really inspired with it at the moment with new ideas coming all the time.

Due to the migration of Dragons at certain points throughout the year the United Kingdom is mainly small towns dotted throughout the country. Once the Dragons begin their migration in August muggles flee their towns and travel the country through dangerous terrains to reach their last hope to save their children from certain death. The Kingdom of Hogsmeade opens it's gates and escorts them to Hogwarts Castle where their children will be tested by the Sorting Hat to see if they will be allowed to stay in the Kingdom.

Thats a quick backstory, there's a lot of changes to canon some of which I'm really enjoying writing and brainstorming. Hopefully I'll actually release at least one chapter of this one.

** - *Title:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10926278/1/The-Invisible-Girl][The Invisible Girl]]
- *Rating::* T
- *Genre:* Drama/Friendship
- *Status:* In progress
- *Summary:* "Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him." - Albus Dumbledore. Tom Riddle wasn't always alone. Evelyn Spencer grows up alongside him, first at Wool's Orphanage and then at Hogwarts. Although both children are orphans, they are not the same in any other way: he is entranced by magic; she is wary of it. But somehow they become friends.

*Notes:* I suppose this is my "main project" right now. Right now I'm writing about Tom's fifth year, when the Chamber of Secrets was first opened, but it's all seen from my OC's perspective, which is fun to write from. I've got two more parts to write, covering parts of 1943 to 1945. I'm thinking it'll have 50-60 chapters when it's all finished, which will be my longest fic ever, but I'm loving writing it, especially now that I'm in the meat of the story.
