Fics like Harry Crow were popular in their day, but I think there are some really high-quality fics published in the last few years that deserve to be considered modern classics. What are some fics that you think will become or already are "classics?"


** Harry Crow /is/ modern. Published in 2012 and finished 2014.

(Also it's terrible)

*** Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is (damn that's a long title) is definitely an enjoyable read, but I wouldn't say the writing quality is amazing.

Edit: I just read Blindness. It's pretty great so far.

** I think Forging the Sword is one of the best works being written now, in terms of quality of writing and storytelling. Also my personal favorite fanfic, possibly ever, is The Never-ending Road, which is also currently a WIP.

*** I think we have to consider it a kind of 'required reading' since anyone spending time looking for good fics will inevitably be told that they MUST read it. Basically, you'll have to make a judgment on it eventually, so give it a go.

I'd suggest waiting until you've read fifty other decent stories before starting it, just so that the subtext of criticism for other fanfiction will be noticeable.

Not a HP fanfic, but still --- check out the [[http://www.tthfanfic.net/wholestory.php?no=8476&format=print][Tabula Avatar]], which is a rather well-written Buffy Ã— D&D (e.g. [[http://www.gog.com/game/baldurs_gate_enhanced_edition][Baldur's Gate]]) cross-fic with Giles as the Bard.
