Can anyone recommend good stories that meet these criteria:

- A post-Deathly-Hallows Harry/Ginny fic that depicts their romance and early family life
- A Lupin/Tonks fic that depicts their romance and family life, interwoven brilliantly with canon

I very much prefer fics that keep the characters true to canon and have compelling plots (not contrived plot devices), with minimal typos and well-written dialogue. Authors who infuse a bit of realism into the world of HP are also very much appreciated.

Thanks!

** Seconding [[/u/howtopleaseme]] 's rec. I loved where linkffn(Harry Potter and the Blood Conspiracy) was going, but it never really got off of the ground. Those few chapters are great for what they're worth, though.

  The war is over, the Chosen One has defeated Voldemort. How does the wizarding world recover from such dreadful times? How do Harry and his friends maintain peace? Starting after the Battle of Hogwarts, follows canon as best as possible.

** I like linkffn(Epithalamium by Northumbrian), and wish he would update it ahead of /Friends and Foes/.

linkao3(Compromise: A Love Story) and [[http://pocketfullof.livejournal.com/229285.html][The Grown-Up Driver]] are two excellent oneshots set post DH that explore Harry and Ginny's relationship.

  Canon-compliant. Takes place during the first five years after the Battle of Hogwarts in DH.   She needs to be something other than the hero's girlfriend.

      Many thanks to oxoniensis for the Brit check and suggestions, and fireworkfiasco for the beta\.  And because I think it's fun, I'll tell you what the title of the original Word doc of this story was: “GinnyIsAStubbornBintAndHarryLovesHer\.” :POriginally posted on LJ here\.
