I literally cannot remember anything else about this fic, but it had Hermione use an "apocalypse level" spell while confronting Death Eaters in Diagon Alley. She tore up the street I think. And got in major trouble for using the spell.

I want to say it was NOT on fanfiction.net or Ao3, but I can't really remember. Does this ring a bell for anyone? Google has gotten me nowhere.

*** Yes, yes, that is it. And excuse me, evidently it was a /Doomsday/ spell, not apocalypse. Oops. But, one of a limited number in the class, crater in Diagon Alley, /looks/ from people who recognize the spell - yep, that's what I'm thinking of.

The beginning of Bearings is so low-key I forgot it had any action to it.

** I'm listening.

But if you want a doomsday spell, just transfigure a few hundred kilo of anything into antimatter. That's sufficient to raze the British isles and a large chunk of the European mainland to the ground (except for some areas shadowed by sufficiently large mountains, and far enough that the explosion and firestorm are not that bad).

2500 kilograms (which would be about 1/3 the mass of a cube of steel a meter on each side) is sufficient to reenact the dinosaur-killer asteroid (so potentially civilization-ending).

Considering the mass of a large wooden desk, which Mcgonagall transfigures with ease, the 2500 kilo target is well within the reach of at least the strongest wizards.

If a Dumbledore, or a team of wizards, transfigured the largest transfiguration he could, we could potentially see an end-of-life-on-earth scenario. As in, liquify the crust, all is magma, everything dies.

*** I wonder if one could conjure or transfigure a black hole. It doesn't need to be huge, even. Just a really tiny black hole would go straight through the Earth and then make a U-turn and go again in the other direction, piercing hole after hole through the entire Earth while absorbing matter and growing. This is a planet destruction scenario.

Best thing is it's not a matter of mass so much as density.

*** I actually did the math to figure out the yield equivalents of antimatter.

5,500 kg of antimatter creates an explosion equal to the meteor strike that wiped out the dinosaurs. It's a 47 kiloton bomb /per gram of antimatter./ A single gram would explode with more force than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs /combined/ (An upper estimated yield of 40 kilotons together.)

The ash and molten rock that would rain down from a mere 100 kg antimatter bomb would devastate the entire planet. Nuclear winter, minus the radiation. And then there's the economic and agricultural collapse that would follow.

:)

I was guesstimating off the top of my head from a back-of-the-envelope /theydidthemath I did once estimating the power of the [[/spoiler]["Be Not" spell from the Inheritance Cycle]]

Although my number is the mass of the antimatter alone, with the mass converted to energy being double that (as each unit mass of antimatter combines with an equal mass of matter), just to make the numbers clear.

****** First time you have a precocious muggleborn, who's so into math and science that by 11 they have more math and physics and chem in their head than the average non-STM-major college graduate... (i.e. chibi-me as a muggleborn).

Made even more terrifying because muggleborn-chibi-me would have done exactly that, considering that younger-than-11-me thought these thoughts when reading even book 1 (although, admittedly, mini-me went for the far lesser bang of a massive chunk of pure Uranium-235 at first thought).

And that my dream job at that age was "Mad Scientist who takes over the world" (Bill Nye the Science Guy, The Brain, and Mrs. Frizzle being my role models).

******** I've got to admit, when I read HPMOR, my primary emotion was "Holy **** has this person been spying on me and reading my mind my entire life".

Even the way that HP thinks his thoughts is the way I think my thoughts (as arguments between various sub-simulations of me).

If I /tried/ to write a Mary Sue of myself, I couldn't have done a better job.

It is possibly more accurate to say that that Harry from HPMOR is me.

It makes me wonder if I should try to make friends with the Big Yud, on account of us apparently being the same person (assuming that he wrote his HP as being similarish to himself).

*** I don't think that would work. If Transfiguration isn't instantaneous, then as soon as you make a gram of that shit, it'll react with normal matter and kill you instantly. Also, this would basically be suicide since there's no mention of Transfiguration being possible without wand contact with the target form.

**** Just first use another few spells to suspend the object-to-be-transfigured in a bubble of vacuum.

That requirement does not make sufficient self-constent sense to abide by - either I should be able to progogate through the air, or I should only be able to transfigure the thin layer in contact with my wand. I would conjecture that distance casting might be more difficult.

** The idea of an apocalypse spell is something I have always found interesting with regards to Fan Fiction. I realize its not exactly what you meant, but it still struck a cord with me.

I once started writing a fan fiction (sadly never got far) and the premise behind it was that during the war in a battle with Dumbledore, Voldemort panicked and cast a insanely dark spell that somehow fractured magic and destroyed much of the world.

It followed Harry Potter and Tonks (a comfort/Friends with benefits paring) as they struggle through a broken world full of danger (think magic warped animals, creatures, and world), with only each other known to be alive to find a way to travel back in time. I had only got as far as them reaching the ruined husk of Hogwarts (so like 5 or so chapters in, but was planning on perhaps expanding their time in that world).

After that I had only decided it was eventually going to be a Harry/Hermione/Tonks pairing with Harry being quite powerful due to his magical soul absorbing some of the backlash of magic the disaster caused (while the Voldemort soul fragment absorbed the dark part and broke/dissolved). And that they would defeat Voldemort fairly fast and move into a larger roll of reforming magical Britain.

I may have been overly ambitious with my goals and ideas, but as with much of my stuff, I have a great starting idea and then flake out and struggle to develop it. Maybe one day I will figure it out. ;)

Anyway.....

Point is that I liked the idea of an apocalypse spell or ritual being the reason for a massive change in the magical world in some form or way, or forcing the need for time or dimensional travel or something.

*** Something along those lines happens in linkffn(10807718) - Voldemort's death triggers a magical dead man's switch which destroys most of Britain. The story starts out pretty well, but is unfortunately abandoned.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

Have you considered trying to write a fic using several of those ideas? It could be that your basic idea is not enough to build a story upon.
