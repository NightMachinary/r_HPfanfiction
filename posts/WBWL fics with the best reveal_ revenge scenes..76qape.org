I'm not in these fics for the angst, I'm in them for the scene where Dumbledore/ James/ Lily's perfect world comes crashing down around them.


** I would rather see Voldemort and his ilks than those silly fanon bash targets getting their just dues.

I never understood the need to bash James and Lily.

**** Don't you ever feel the desire to prove everyone wrong? It doesn't matter what they say, you are special. That, at least for me, is the appeal, how your detractors were wrong

***** Exactly, I read it for the moment that Lily Potter gets hit with the idea that she has abandoned and neglected her child, and starts crying.

*** I like to indulge in a WBWL fic or two, and for me it's always been more just as a way to see someone get their come-uppance. Perhaps it's because the person being bashed reminds of someone who I have an axe to grind with, or an ex, or even my family members if I'm in a bad mood. 99% of the fics are got garbage, but for me it's more just to indulge in the fantasy of getting one over on people who have "wrong you".

** Probably the best one I can think of is linkffn(Deprived). Their are one or two others that escape me right now, mostly cause of how uninspired they are.

** I don't tend to like wrong boy who lived fics where everyone thinks it's the brother/sister but it's actually Harry all along, I just don't see James and Lily neglecting their child. I don't understand why these stories are so popular.

*** I can't see it either but we don't really know much about them and I can see people only telling canon Harry what they wanted about them, so who knows how they really where as a person? Anyway, there are good fics out there where the neglect has proper justifications.

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff
