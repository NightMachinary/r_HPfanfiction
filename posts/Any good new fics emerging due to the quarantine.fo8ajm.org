** I've started posting two from the depths of my google drive. One is my take on Pureblood Hermione (Hermione finds out that she's Bellatrix's daughter) linkffn(13524525). The other is very AU; Voldemort is victorious in Godric's Hollow in 1981, and takes over Wizarding Britian. It's got some big Hunger Games vibes. linkffn(13530186).

  Bellatrix Lestrange wasn't always mad. There had been something, in fact one thing in particular, that tipped her over the edge. Fifteen years later, all is not what it appears to be. A Pureblood!Hermione AU.

#+begin_quote
  In 1981, Lord Voldemort was victorious in Godric's Hollow. Fourteen years later, he rules Britain with an ironclad fist. Each year, young witches and wizards compete in Requiem for a place in his inner circle. When Hermione is chosen to represent London, she's forced to use every one of her skills to succeed - or die trying.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
