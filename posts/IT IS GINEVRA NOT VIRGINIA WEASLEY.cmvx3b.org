** Have you been reading older fics? I mean I definitely agree with the rant that messing up a character's name is awful, but I haven't seen that in years.

***** The most famous Virginia I can think of is Virginia Woolf. While I'm sure America would be proud to claim her, and she's certainly required reading in American schools... she was from London.

There's also Virginia Wade, British tennis player. Or Virginia Field and Virginia McKenna, British actresses.

Meanwhile, a search for the most famous real life people named Ginevra will give you Ginevra King, an American socialite. (There aren't many. It's a rare name. Most Gineveras in the world today were probably named after Ginny Weasley!)

You lost this one. Just take your defeat gracefully and forgive fanfic writers from 15 years ago for not reading JKR's mind.

**** Ginevra appeared in canon long before 2012, more like 2003 or something.

Edit: apparently it was only with DH in 2007.

Edit 2: JKR confirmed it was Ginevra in 2004.

** Wasn't confirmed out of canon until 2004 and in canon in 2007. So I give pre-2007 fics a pass. After that it's fair game to roast.

*** For non-native speakers, all longer forms of Ginny sound counterintuitive, so you can't exactly blame them for not noticing that. I mean, when reading, my mind automatically changes both Ginerva and Ginevra to Ginny. Kinda like all "fancy" versions of Harry get reverted back to Harry shortly before I close the tab.

****** I think it may have been in an interview around the time HBP came out or the old website. I read a lot of H/G before HBP and I feel like most of it used Ginerva. Still, your point still stands that for almost 3/4 of the series we didn't know her full name.
