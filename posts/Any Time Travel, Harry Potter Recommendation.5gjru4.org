** Just to clarify: Instead of going way back in time like in a redo fic, you are wanting Harry to be able to pause or reverse time? So short jumps back, like hours or even days is fine, but not years or longer? Would he then be able to change the events because of this slight foreknowledge? Example: He goes back a few hours to stop Cedric from dying and LV from bein ressurected by somehow outting Fake Moody as being Crouch Jr.? Or he pauses time to move Cedric from the way of the Killing Curse, possibly even moving say Pettigrew into the path instead?

I can't say I've read anything quite like that but damn it if that doesn't sound interesting.

** linkffn(The Ambiguous Artifice) which is the third in its series has great time turner usage. This also has main character Harry in Slytherin with Draco as his best friend and arguably HarryxHermione sort of going on as well. I would recommend starting with linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) though.

Then there's [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/6849022][An Old and New World]] which has the best time turner scene in the entire fandom.

And finally there's a fic I remember where Harry slows down time for combat and it nearly kills him running through the death eater lines but I can't recall it.

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

******** It's not as bad as people on here make it out to be. It's probably better than 90% of the fanfiction drivel out there. The biggest problem is that the author is extremely outspoken in his humanist beliefs and makes a case for them in his fic, and the fans of the fic are extremely obnoxious in insisting that every single bit of it is right. But it's definitely worth a read, (if only so you know what people are talking about when they diss it on here) and in particular the first few chapters are very funny. I believe at one point it was either the most favorited or second most favorited fic on ff.net.

********* For the first few chapters, I actually recommend the [[http://daystareld.com/hpmor-remix-1/][alternate beginning]].

If you like to pick apart movies and say, "But there's no way that they would act that way!" or "Why bother when he'll just shoot you anyway?" or "Why are Star Destroyers /aerodynamic/ when they're always in a vacuum?" then you'd probably enjoy it. If you're instead the one telling that person to stop talking and enjoy the story, then you'll probably hate it.

Oh - and the fact that Harry doesn't behave like a normal 11-year-old is /not/ a mistake, nor is it sloppiness. The fact that he's often arrogant and insensitive - well, it does come back to bite him, hard and repeatedly.

******** HPMOR has a very huge cult like following of people who have read it, and not really gotten big into fanfiction yet. It's not so much the fanfiction that brings bad people. Just fans are very akin to biblethumpers.
