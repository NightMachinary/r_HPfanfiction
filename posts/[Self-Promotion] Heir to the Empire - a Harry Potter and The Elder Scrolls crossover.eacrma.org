/"In those days so long ago, Akatosh made a covenant with Alessia. So long as the Blood of the Dragon runs strong in her rulers, the glory of the Empire shall extend in unbroken years. But through treachery of snakes, the covenant was broken and the rightful heirs of Aleshut were forced into transliminal hiding, ruling over a hidden empire until the day of the true return."/

A little project of mine, born after I dumped this story's previous incarnation in the bin. The story's setting is highly AU, and borrows heavily from the "apocrypha" of the Elder Scrolls lore community, and then mutilates and adapts said lore to fit the story's setting. In other words, the Potters are actually direct descendants of a son of Juilek Cyrodiil (the son of Emperor Reman III), who survived by escaping to Nu-Cyrod, a hidden magnengineered province of the empire that was built out of the interplay of Anu and Padomay. More specifically, in the depths of a British forest.

The main protagonist is Harry Potter (anon Reman), and the story follows the events surrounding the return of the Reman dynasty to Tamriel. This story is still a WIP.
