So I'm currently working on my second piece of fanfiction, and time to time when I interact or see how other Harry Potter fans act I just lose all motovation to write more. Even though I know what I want to write it just feels like I'm wasting my time writing it like I dd with my first fanfiction.


** By sinking slowly into oblivion and occasionally jerking awake at night sweating about the stories I'm scared to update because its been so long.

*** I mean, I feel ya, but what's there to be scared of? If you, say, were to /hypothetically/ update /Like a Red-Headed Stepchild/ or some other hypothetical work... in theory... well... I think the reaction from everyone would be more akin to cries of joy than anything to be afraid of.

**** Perhaps they're scared that, if they update after a long haitus, then people will be expecting regular updates after that, and they're worried about getting writer's block and disappointing people who were excited to get regular updates.

***** You're probably right, but, I mean, that's easy to fix. Just put in the Author's Note at the beginning something to the effect of "here's a chapter because a chapter's better than nothing, but I don't know when I'll be able to update again, don't wait up".

**** Yes, Achille is right Full Paragon! You do not have to be scared to update or not update a story! People will understand if you do have writer's block or if you got busy and stuff. :) I haven't updated my Fight For Rights story in a few months now I think, and I don't think Achille is mad at me for it! :) :)

Can you elaborate on this? What is it about these interactions that make you lose motivation? Bad behavior? Envy?

Motivation can be a tricky thing. There are definitely times when I'm just not feeling it and that's okay. You're not on any kind of schedule, you don't have a giant publishing advance you have to justify. You're doing this as a hobby and if you don't feel like doing it right now, then that's fine. Take a step back. I took a step back for twelve years.

Could it also be a possibility that you're overwhelming yourself with something too ambitious? When I started writing in the HP fandom after OOTP came out, I limited myself to self-contained one shots because I had a history of getting too ambitious and abandoning larger works due to poor planning. Give yourself permission to write a smaller story or even a single scene. Some people like to post "drabbles" which are often less than 500 words.

Take your time and don't try and force yourself to write if you don't feel like it. Maybe you'll find it you're more relaxed about it, the motivation will follow!

*** I'm not even sure how to put it into words really. Some of the other fans on here and other sites where not the best. Just so unwelcoming. Most of the fans I have met where obsessive fangirls or really emo guys and they both don't really like it when someone thinks outside of their arbitrary norm. Not to mention It feels like I'm Charlie Weasley trying to hang with Ron and his friends. Sure I'm okay one way or another but it seems like two different worlds.

In short I feel disconnected from the rest of the fanbase.

It's not really something too ambitious, I'm not trying to write seven books worth of content. What I'm writing is pretty straight forward and is focused around an OC. Mainly because I have no ideas of what to do with already established characters.

The thing is that I don't think I really mesh well with the fanbase so the way some fan fic writers casually post and write etc just don't work for me. It's just like someone who's writing an article for a company with a boss who they don't get along with at all.

**** I do somewhat know what you are saying. I don't really regard myself as part of the 'fandom'. I'm too old and cynical and I neither read nor write what the majority wants to see.

But if there's a story chewing its way through your brain, it has to get out somehow, doesn't it? The best thing to do is get on with it and don't use these forums because they'll make you feel rotten.

​

One day I'll take my own advice too,

***** The thing is that I grew up with the series and never thought of wanting to join the fanbase until recently. I guess I missed the window and now I just got to accept that it might not happen.

What drives me is other fans, seeing as I don't have any friends who like Harry Potter. The forums and groups are my only way to interact with other fans.

****** Well, you've lost me. Window? Really? People drop in and out all the time, you can be part of it as much or as little as you want. But honestly depending on other fans to 'drive' you to write sounds like a recipe for failure and an excuse not to bother (writers constantly look for excuses not to write).

The only person who can drive you is you.

******* Let me ask you this, if a bunch of your friends liked something you would be more motivated to get into that thing as well right?

But...at this point I feel kinda dumb for making such a fuss about something so trivial.

​

Well no. Even when I was young enough to care about that sort of thing I never followed the crowd. Do your own thing, not theirs. But I'm failing to see why you think you can't be part of the fandom. The fact is, simply being a fan means you already are.

** Something that works for me is to take a break from whatever story you're struggling with and just write the most absurd crack fic you can think of.

Don't worry about quality or plotting or even if it's funny, just put words on page as soon as they come in your head. I've got a long, rambling Google doc that just pure crack.

Something about seeing yourself write a bunch of words, even if they're crap, helps me get my motivation back to work on the "good" writing.

** It took me12 years to finish off my fic. 55 chapters. Don't write when you don't want to, because it becomes a chore. You want to enjoy it and when that inspiration hits then you write.

** It's really similar to losing your musical muse. There's literally nothing you can do unless you want to brute force it out. Which works for stories/writing, and for certain music genres it works as well.

Honestly, I'd go back to what inspired you to write it in the first place and read that story again. Or go look at a classic, or current classic in the making to get you in that mood again. There's a chance you'll get that certain muse again, but ere's another chance you might be inspired to do something completely different.

There's a reason why some Authors take YEARS to finish a single published book. With Paid Proofreading. And Editing thats paid for. And book groups for Peer Review. And More Editing thats Paid For.

*** That's a really good point. I guess I started writing the fic i am on the end of the wave of rereading the books for a second time this year. The initial wave from when I first got into Harry Potter has passed a long time ago. Mainly because I was the only one I knew who liked it, there was only so much I could do.

So now there's no fuel to write with other sources exhausted. It would help I could find my part of the fandom. So I'd have someone to write for and have my muse again.

** A really good thing to deal with loss of motivation is to get yourself a Beta, and not specifically for the purpose of editing, but just someone to bounce ideas off or talk about your fic. It makes a hell of a difference to writing when you have someone who shares your enthusiasm and getting those ideas out there with someone else will ignite your own enthusiasm too.

**** If you're willing, I'd recommend either on here or the other places for finding beta's to list your preferences and what you're looking for and I'm sure someone who will share your interests will come along. The fanfiction community is huge, and I've had a beta that isn't even in the same fandom help with fics, so I say just go for it. And if not, hey, just hit me up, I'd be totally willing you help you out!

** When inspiration hits, write. This is fanfiction. We're not getting paid and we don't have a deadline to hit. Don't write if you're forcing yourself, it never turns out well.

Also take a break if you need to. Ultimately you're writing this for yourself, not anyone else.
