** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miracle_of_Bern][The Miracle of Bern]], a German movie about the 1954 world cup.

Basically postwar England competes in the 2000 World Cup with Harry and Ginny on the team. Perspective is from a group of magical orphans listening to the games via the wireless while the grim reality of the life after Voldemort is shown. In the final, the English team is behind and it sure looks like a Hungarian win when the game is miraculously turned around. The final scene is the victorious team arriving at Kings Cross 9 3/4 and celebrated by the masses as things start to look better for the British magical community.

*** *The Miracle of Bern*

The Miracle of Bern (German: Das Wunder von Bern) is a 2003 film by Sönke Wortmann, which tells the story of a German family (particularly of a young boy and his depressed ex-POW father) and the unexpected West German miracle victory in the 1954 World Cup Final in Bern, Switzerland.

The film can be regarded as a portrait of post-war Germany. With over 6 million cinema visitors, it is one of Germany's best-selling films. Among those attending the première were Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Peer Steinbrück, Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Otto Schily, Federal Minister of the Interior (a position whose holder is also informally known as Minister for Sports).
