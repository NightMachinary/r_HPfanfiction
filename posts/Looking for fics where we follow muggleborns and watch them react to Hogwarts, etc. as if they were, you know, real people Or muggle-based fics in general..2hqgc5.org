Mostly got the idea from [[http://reichenbatchhero.tumblr.com/post/93507713942][this post]], haha.

They're definitely a common enough kind of fic, but... Well... We all know what an absolute /minefield/ OC-based stories are.

I'm interested in non-humor stories where muggles manage to discover portions of the wizarding world, too, though.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] by Aesop

The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

Rated: Fiction K+ - English - Drama - Amelia B. - Words: 27,424 - Reviews: 96 - Favs: 363 - Follows: 58 - Published: Jun 22, 2011 - Status: Complete - id: 7108864

A truly excellent muggle's-eye-view of how the Wizarding world takes care of its own. Occurs mid-4th book (I think) but only cursorily relates to the events in canon.

** I love muggle fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6519436/1/Criminality][Criminality]] is short. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] will probably make you cry.

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6523209/1/Death-Eaters-and-Benadryl][Death Eaters and Benadryl]] by Crowlows19 is a somewhat surreal fic that postulates a whole Muggleborn subculture.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4770289/1/The-Truth-About-Muggles][The Truth about Muggles]] by the same author, which features a streetwise, if OOC, Hermione and a search for Harry in the Muggle world.
