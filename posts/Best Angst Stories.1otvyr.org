Its Angst week for the bookclub, but the I realized everyone on this sub would benefit from a thread filled with fics of particular genre.

For the bookclub up vote stories with your karma, or suggest a story in the comments. For the bookclub, only complete fics will be selected, but other people not wanting to join the club please feel free to post and share your favorite angst fics here :D

*** Haha, very good. Although, I think order of the phoenix would give it a run for its money.

** The [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dzeytoun][Here be Monsters verse by Dzeytoun]]. There is a plot, but it's mostly a series of character studies. I recommend starting with Daddy's Favorite. Each chapter is a different character's perspective, so the angst gets spread around. Perhaps the best to get a sense of the whole work from is [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/dzeytoun/DF16.html][Mundugus Fletcher]]

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172243/1/Broken][Broken]], super angsty Dramione fic, but a very good one. It's long, though.

*** I agree, this is one of the most angsty fics I've read. It's an emotional rollercoaster. Super long for the bookclub but a good read if any of you have free time!
