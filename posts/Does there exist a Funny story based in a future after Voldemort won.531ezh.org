** I don't know how it could be funny if that murdering psychopath consolidated his power in Britain.

Though I could imagine him overreaching after a few years like Hitler, and the rest of the world coming down hard on him. His Death Eaters and sympathizers would be executed, fed to dementors, or locked up forever in Azkaban, and the rest of the British purebloods would undergo a similar Denazification process like Germany after WW2.

*** Well, I mean, tragedy and comedy are two sides of the same coin. It'd probably have to be very dark humor, but I could see it working.

***** Not that funny, but it shows an ironic punishment of the Death Eaters. And the good guys survived: "Wish Carefully".

*** Have you considered the potential of a bored Voldemort? One who realises that Potter and the order were what made his life exciting? You could see Voldemort leaving Britain in search of new challenges and thrills or the Death Eaters trying to impress their leader who has become apathetic to life in general. Would their be a coliseum like arena where men fight beasts for his amusement, how desperate would some people be to impress him when all he wants is some excitement. Does worship become boring?

I've read one like that. I forget the name, but LV decides that winning the war was his biggest mistake and that actually /ruling/ the magical world... sucks.

He goes back in time to help Harry wrap things up and then... I forget how it resolved him having helped off his younger self.

Given how little I remember, I'm doing a terrible job describing it but I think I remember enjoying it at the time.
