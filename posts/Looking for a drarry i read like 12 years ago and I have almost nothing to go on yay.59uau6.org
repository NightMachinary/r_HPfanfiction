So, yeah, in my early fanfic-days i pretty much only read Drarry fics. Most of them were short and hilarious, and this one is no exception.

So it's Draco POV, and he has a plan to defeat his nemesis (pretty sure this is what he calls Harry, could be Arch-Enemy or something though) and that is to write an epic poem about him. Or them. Not sure. "You're writing him a poem.." "An EPIC poem!" This is said a lot. Pretty sure there's some Illiad-references in there somewhere. Could be an ending scene with Harry in the infirmary, but not sure. There might be cherries. It was pretty short, a few chapters at most, and I'm pretty sure Harry was pretty clueless throughout. Ring any bells? =P

** And when I typed in the title it auto-capitalized every letter and now my title looks like crap because of it. Thanks. =P
