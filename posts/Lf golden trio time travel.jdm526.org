Anyone got any decent fics where harry ron and hermione time travel to fix things? I've read so many lately where it's just harry and sometimes he doesnt have them at all and it just feels weird. Preferably not harmony but if it is I can deal.

  Rose is just born and Al is due. But after finding an ancient mirror, Harry, Ron, Hermione and baby Rose are sent back into their 11-year-old bodies the night before they first met. Trapped in the past and wary of the Wizarding World, they seek to kill Voldemort as soon as possible. Together Harry, Ron and Hermione shall show the past who the Golden Trio really are.

  Time Travel. It's the end of the Battle of Hogwarts but the price has been high. The Golden Trio dearly wished that they could have done more to save lives and fate decides to grant their wish. Follow them as they redo their years at Hogwarts, starting from First year and work to make a difference in the wizarding world. All while trying to keep their true selves a secret.
