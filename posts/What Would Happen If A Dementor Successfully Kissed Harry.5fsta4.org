If Harry is Voldemort's Horcrux, does this change anything about Dementors? Would his soul still be taken away,and the Horcrux takes over?


** I always assumed a dementor would take both Harry's soul and the Horcrux's soul fragment. Nothing in the books implied they were limited to one at a time. The only thing I could imagine that could cause a problem is whether the Horcrux's resistance to destruction would protect it, which would mean only Harry's soul would be sucked out.

*** or maybe the horcrux would be extracted but not consumed, living on in the dementor.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** On a Meta level, that could never happen because of his plot armor.

But a real answer would be that both his and the scar would be sucked up. The scar is still a part of him, at least enough so to give him abilities.
