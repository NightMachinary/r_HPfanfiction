:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a series of Harry Potter reading fics. I read them once and cannot for the life of me find them again. Umbridge finds the books in the Room of Requirement and has the whole school read them. There were 4 stories at the time with books 1-3 being finished and GoF had like 20ish chapters done. Somewhere along the way Daphne decides she wants to get to know Harry and that's all I remember. Thank you.


** Thatâ€˜s the first one. At least I think you mean these.
