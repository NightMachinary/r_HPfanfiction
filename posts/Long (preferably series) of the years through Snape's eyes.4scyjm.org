Hello! Requesting any help from anyone that knows of a long series that explores the years of the books, but through Severus Snape's eyes? Thanks!


** linkffn(7937889)

The best one. Not a series, but encompasses the entire thing.

*** linkffn(11923164) is also pretty good, though it splits between him and Luna. Canon-compliant sidestory kind of thing. EDIT: FYI definitely not a romance.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

linkffn(Four Essays by acomplexgirlwithsimpletastes)

linkffn(Contemplating-Clouds)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1317678/][Here's my ffn account]] , I had at one point made a half hearted attempt to write a mini-guide to my favourites in my bio but I gave up part way through. What's written is still relevant, but it might be easiest to just sort by word count and pick something you've got time for. Most of my list is completed, though recently I've added a few incomplete ones so beware if you hate unfinished stories.

I'm a little curious to which ones you've read before, the stuff I linked I found in some rather obscure posts on this subreddit a while back.
