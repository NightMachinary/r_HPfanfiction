Hermione has only ever loved ballet. She earned her way into Juilliard through sweat and dedication. The Weasley twins are musical prodigies, dropping out to peruse a career as Rockstars. But when Hermione finds a locked out Fred Weasley playing on a ratty fire escape, it starts something she would have never expected. New York City is a place of unpredictable miracles and shattered dreams. Who is to say which one is which?
