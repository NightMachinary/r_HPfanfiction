Before I start delving into history, let me preface this that I am no expert and know most of this because it is a hobby of mine. I will say that I do try my best not to spout incomplete information. Please correct me if I get something wrong.

I know in the past we all see that post asking why do wizards celebrate holidays like Christmas and Easter. Some attribute it to celebrating the more pagan holidays current holidays evolved from or that wizards are amused by the idea of another wizard created a religion.

But as I was reading/watching some historical summaries of the Viking Era I came to the realization that it could be possible that the majority of British Wizarding World follows some form of Christianity. Yes, there was a witch hunt that drove the magical community into hiding. However, that did not occur until around the 1400s CE.

Long before then though was the Christianization of the British Isles. Anyone familiar with the Viking era knows that most historians pin the start of the era by the Viking sack on an English monastery in the 700 CE. This sacking sets the tone for most of the Viking era but that is off point. The point is that Christianity has long existed in the lands, I believe to due Roman conquers. Any Celtic heritage that survived was because they grouped up in the Welsh lands which survive from being conquered by a lot of forces until I believe the Normans.

That being said most of Britain and Ireland were under Christian influences. This is being dated back to before the 700 CE. Hogwarts was established in the 990 CE. Greenland is said to be found around the 900 CE for reference.

So in the muggle world, we see that most people are Christain. Would it not make sense that most wizarding families to blend in with their muggle neighbors by being Christian or simply come to believe in the religion? Consider muggleborns who grew up believing in Christianity before discovering their magic. Even if wizards are 'old fashion' that is multiple generations that have to live with Christian influences before Hogwarts, the safe haven, was created. Remember, this is the medieval ages, families were created young cause that was the societal norm. To not do so would look out of place and put magical folks under too much scrutiny if they are trying to hide.

To further compound this, the Normans that invaded Britain around 1060 CE were the Vikings that converted. It makes sense to me that any magical Normans were those that willing converted.

So would it not make sense that the prominent magical families be Normans or those that converted. (The Normans are known to be very inclusive of other cultures so it is possible that really old families managed to hold on to their identity with no problems so long as they were agreeable).

From here to the modern era, that is a lot of generations underneath the influence of Christianity. And judging by how the book handles everything, */most/* of the wizarding world is Christian which looking at the history of Britain and the surrounding lands.

TL:DR British Isles have been under the influence of Christianity since the Romans invaded. Is it too much of a stretch that over the centuries that most of the Wizarding World is Christain?

** I think the most important thing to consider is that just because later Christians tried to burn witches at the stake, it doesn't preclude magical individuals from being Christians. Religions try to kill their followers surprisingly often, for minor differences in practice. Many witches who actually admitted to practicing witchcraft in the 17th century were Christian.*

They also might be more likely to believe the claims of Christians, as their magic bears many similarities to the magic of the Bible. The idea that a god gave them their abilities probably wouldn't be that odd.

That's all I've got. Everything else you've got seems accurate. But I focus more on modern history, so, I might not be that useful.

*There were practicing witches during the period, they weren't all false accusations. Whether those witches actually used magical abilities is a different story. There was a reason the belief was so widespread. I wish I could name some names, but I don't have any off the top of my head.

The point you make about you the magical world's magic being similar to the magic in the Bible is one that I haven't considered. It certainly would go a long way to convince people that magic comes from god.

I know somewhere it is mentioned the flame freezing charm made the flames feel ticklish instead of hurting. I think there was a point about a witch that continuously kept going to the stake because of liking the feeling of ticklish flames (that might be fandom though so don't quote me).

** I wrote the following some time ago on this subreddit. Fits perfectly for this thread as well:

Many fanfiction writers seem to think that wizardry and Christianity are somehow contradicting one another. Harry Potter canon suggests otherwise. There are at least three examples: 1) wizards celebrate Christian holidays such as Easter, Hallowe'en and Christmas; 2) one of the Hogwarts ghosts was a friar; and 3) the common wizard ethics (that of Dumbledore) seem to be identical with Protestant Christian ethics.

In my story this religion thing is explained as follows. Wizards, especially pure-blood supremacists, considered magic a divine force and believed they were descended from angels or Christ himself. They used magic to convince Muggles of their superiority and ruled over Muggles as kings, priests and aristocrats. The Catholic church was not against wizards at all, because all popes, cardinals and bishops were wizards. (Well, of course they were against some wizard individuals who questioned their right to rule.)

Sometime in the 16th century some wizards began to propagate that Muggles should have the right to rule themselves. By this time most wizards were immensely rich and ruling over Muggles was not of much benefit to them anymore. The isolationist philosophy won, and the wizarding world decided to go into hiding. It caused a stagnation, and every now and then Dark Lords tried to restore the old ways. Napol√©on Bonaparte was one of them.

(If you don't like this history, please explain why wizards wouldn't have used religion for their own benefit. It's easy to fake miracles with magic. It's the rational and obvious thing to do.)

There is, of course, the question of witch-hunts. Some writers use it as the reason why wizards are not Christians. However, I consider it extremely unlikely that many actual witches and wizards would have been killed, and equally unlikely that the rest of the wizarding world would have cared. Since wizards are capable of Disapparating and Confunding and Obliviating Muggles, how would any competent adult wizard get caught and killed by them? And even if they did, why would some pure-blood aristocrats have cared? They seem to care so little about their fellow wizards that they're willing to kill them by themselves. Do you think Lucius Malfoy would have got angry if Muggles had killed Mundungus Fletcher? In conclusion, almost all people killed in witch-hunts were Muggles, and most wizards did never even know Muggles were trying to kill them.

*** The biggest reason you wouldn't fake miracles is that, in a pre-Statute world, people /know/ that magic exists, and even in the post-Statute world it's understood that there's a difference between magic and miracles, among those who believe in both. Heck, the Bible itself discusses this, and includes stories of people who had to distinguish genuine miracles from clever trickery or regular old magic.

Our ancestors were cannier than we often give them credit for. They aren't going to believe that some dingus is a miracle-working saint when Jen Yonderbridge who lives just past the old bridge can do the same thing.

**** But what if most if not all those who educated the Muggle peasants about the miracles of God were the same people who used their magic to heal wounds and cure diseases? In the history of my story wizards themselves believed that their powers came from God. This idea was forgotten during the centuries of isolation when there no longer was any need to repeat any religious justifications to Muggles. Harry Potter books tell very little about the religion of the wizarding world (certainly a good choice from Rowling), but apparently magic gives no clear insight to the deepest mysteries of existence. Since that seems to be the case, why wouldn't medieval and early modern wizards have believed in Christianity, when it generally was the accepted explanation of things? Usually people believe in things people around them believe in, unless they have a reason not to believe.

In wouldn't care much about what the Bible says. In the olden days extremely few people could read, and (even if the Bible in this expanded Harry Potter universe was identical to ours) wizard-priests would surely have skipped the parts that would have undermined their credibility in their sermons.

Also, magic would have to develop just like everything else. Long ago, the miracles of the bible might have been difficult to pull of with magic, like parting the red sea. And there's still the rising from the dead bit that Wizards don't think is commonly possible.

Your point about about magic not answering every existential question is definitely good, since that is part of the reason people believe religion.

**** I feel though that this is rooted in the assumption that to be atheist (or at least agnostic) is the 'default' state. Why would religion just be a pretence? A lot of these replies are quite condescending in that they suggest that religion is merely a way of explaining away what you don't understand and therefore obsolete with magic. Disclaimer: I am agnostic by apathy. Religion isn't just a collection of stories, it is an understanding of the world and your place in it, and I don't see why magicals would change their belief system without similar changes to life and culture that we have gone through over the last hundred or so years.

You are correct in that magical society is derived from ours, both in terms of pre SoS integration and how in canon it is stated how rare it is to have no 'muggle blood' in the family even just a few generations back. The question should not be 'why would wizards be Christian?', but 'what happened that meant they are not visibly Christian any more?'

** One thing I've actually considered is the other way around - Quite a few of the Biblical miracles could have been done by wizardkind readily. Turning water into wine (which a variant of is attempted by an 11-year-old Seamus - he fails not because it's impossible, but because he lacks the actual skill), multiplying food (it can't be created from nothing, but making /more/ from a start is noted as one of the exceptions), healing people without any method Muggles recognize...\\
Then, things start getting a little more muddy with certain "miracles" that might have been natural phenomena, like the Ten Plagues, being attributed to the same "divine" force, and over time the story would most likely get exaggerated and twisted to tell of the wizard in question doing things that magic /can't/ do, or at least not as easily.

If there was always a certain degree of separation, which seems somewhat likely, it's entirely possible that a lot of religions started from Muggles seeing the things a wizard can do, and thinking "that person must be a god or something".\\
At that point, if the "real" story survives among wizardkind (which it probably would), it doesn't make much sense for wizards to actually practice those religions that started that way. It'd be a bit like being in a cargo cult, when you're the person handing out the goods to impoverished civilizations.

Then again, the Fat Friar exists and the Christian holidays are observed (to a degree at least. Christmas trees and gift-giving aren't actually a Christian idea - though contrary to popular belief it didn't start due to any company in particular) - so presumably, /some/ form of the Abrahamic religion exists among magical folk.\\
It probably wouldn't be one-on-one with Christianity, or at least not follow the same exact lore (maybe it's a "this is where magic came from", or a celebration of a few virtuous historical wizards minus the "god" part), but it'd bear enough similarities that for example holidays are easily transposed.

The only part I can't quite reconcile purely within canon is that this would /undoubtedly/ come up in History of Magic or Muggle Studies - but it's never stated. I could, from the outside, justify that as J.K. Rowling not wanting to alienate a significant portion of potential readers any more than she already was doing (or just forgetting to elaborate, as she has on multiple occasions).

***** Yeah the people doing the witch burnings were Christians, but then so was everybody (barring a few tiny minorities), I don't think the actions of a handful would cause them to reject their beliefs. The thing is that as far as I can tell witch burnings were pretty much historically irrelevant. I can see wizards seizing on it several hundred years later as an easy explanation for actions, hence Harry writing an essay about it.

According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_trials_in_the_early_modern_period#14th_century][Wikipedia]] about 40-60k people were executed for witchcraft in Europe over a period of several hundred years. Of these the vast majority were probably muggles who were heretics, strangers, disliked or just unlucky. Even if a witch or wizard was caught, we are explicitly told that it was treated more as a joke than anything else.

This is in contrast to the hundreds of millions who died in the same area over the same period from waves of plagues, famines and constant wars, many religiously driven. It makes far more sense to me that this was the driving factor in why witches and wizards hid themselves away.

I can perfectly imagine them wanting to reject religion, or at least the way they had been previously following it, as a rejection of the 'muggle' way of life, especially given the staggering amount of conflict and genocides it was being used to justify in Europe at the time, but I feel this needs to be explained, not just assumed.

Christianity has been around for a very long time. We have a half-decent education system in the western world which focuses on the sciences, and we still have a christian majority in the population. Hogwarts teaches magic, which you said could replicate miracles. That means that the more important piece of defeating the dogma would be disproving god and the Jesus stories, rather than disproving things like miracles being possible.

The fact that they had the sort of reach to create the ICW is understandable, as wizarding transport and communication were miles faster than muggles. It's not really evidence either way towards Christian wizards. Muggles at the time had already started developing colonies around the world.

Mainstream Christianity hating them is important. If we're starting from Jewish communities up through the origins of Christianity, there was an already present anti-magic thing going on. But especially in Jewish sects, this tended to be go against God sort of magic. Magic was present in Jewish religions, from the start, with Moses and the Egyptians. It was magic that didn't come from God that was the issue. Consorting with the devil for power sort of stuff. Mostly focusing on necromancy, because that's for God only. It doesn't entirely preclude any magic, just nonsanctioned magic.

It's just as likely that wizards followed the religion, believing God to be the source of their magical abilities, and muggles started to fear black magic. By the time the catholic church rolled around, they recognized white magic as not that harmful. Black magic was what you got from consorting with the devil.

** O don't know much about history, but christianity considers magic sinful, and associates it strictly with devil's actions. Bible quite explictly states that witchcraft is forbidden.

Judging by the book, wizarding world isn't christian at all, they just celebrate christian holidays, but as cultural holiday.

*** I don't know the details, but I'm pretty sure that the specifics of what the Bible actually means when it says some of that stuff is a matter of debate.

But regardless if what the Bible actually means, the more important point is that it was written in a world without magic. In our world, anyone claiming to do witchcraft is either delusional, trying to con you, or possibly consorting with devils. Either way, it makes sense for the Bible to tell people to avoid them.

But in the Harry Potter world, where magic is real, it makes sense for the Bible to be different. It's hard to say exactly how it would be different, but my guess is that references to magic being evil would probably say that dark magic is evil instead.

Also, remember that the Fat Friar exists, so clearly magic and Christianity did get along at some point.

**** I believe the reason why magic was considered sinful was people would try to shape the world as a god or appear as a god, both of which are pretty offensive. Think of the Tower of Babel. Also, if one got powers, where the hell are the powers from? If God "gave powers", it's not witchcraft.

Most debate about the Bible revolves around a) literal or figurative, b) contextual or absolute, and c) translation. You're right that there is debate about point a. I believe it was quite literal in the forbidding of witchcraft.

Imo, Rowling did not consider the ramifications of having a Friar as a ghost. üíÄ It's fiction, so religions may be different. It's probably best to just think of Christianity in the HP world as different from Christianity in ours.

*** /Some denominations of/ Christianity consider magic to be sinful. Others, like some forms of Judaism, consider magic to just be a thing that exists, like anything else. Prohibitions against witchcraft often define witchcraft as malevolent magic, or particular kinds of magic (eg divination, or even divination specifically by speaking to the dead), or as any kind of illusion that does not actually effect the change it appears to make (for example, many scholars took pains to explain how werewolves didn't actually change shape, but rather suffered a delusion in which they /believed/ they changed shape, because only God can actually change the flesh).

Hilariously, the Catholic Church spent most of the witch hunt era arguing that witches didn't exist and anybody who tried to burn one was just a murderer (explicit laws against witch-hunting go back to at least AD 643).

** I agree that Christianity had and has a massive influence on European wizards (and witches). However, I do not think the wizards would be Christian.

Denominations, branches, sects, etc. debate whether or not other groups are heretic enough to not be valid fellow adherents to religion. For example, many Protestant denominations (and, if iirc, the Catholic church) do not recognize Mormons as Christians. They see them as worshipping a different god. A more drastic example is Christianity and Islam. I've heard a few Muslims say that Christianity was kinda "continued" or "upgraded" by Islam. Whether or not that's the case for Islam doctrine, from a Christian's view, the Christian god and the Muslim god are different.

While some wizards certainly can believe that Jesus is the son of the only god, that Jesus died for our sins, and that those who believe that Jesus is such will enter heaven, they will have to edit quite a bit, possibly to the point of having a different religion.

Now, it is certainly fun to think about. Personally, I loved the Harry Dresden fics because of the world expansion.

I wonder:

How do they worship? What other religions are prominent? What about the Protestant Reformation?

The most interesting part is how would religion play a role in blood purity. I read about this poet who is often seen as a feminist writer. She definitely pushed for women's right in a major way. However, she did not go to the fullest extent (from what I could tell), and she supported slavery. She was raised Roman Catholic, so I'm pretty sure she believed that "all men (as in humans) are spiritually equal" and "worldly rank doesn't mean shit." There probably was a great deal of racism and ignorance, but it is still intriguing. Would blood purists have championed their doctrine through justification in their holy text? Would Voldemort have crafted his image as the return of the Messiah? Would they have appeased people with the "We're all equal. It's just your physical body (aka. blood)."?

***** Food is an inconsistency. You can't transfigure food, but you can transfigure stuff into animals and duplicating something is also possible (so cast that spell on a can of food for example).

Also, the summoning charm is a thing. So worst case, all you need to perform that miracle is a bit of criminal energy.

Lazarus is the oddity, I'll give you that. But Easter, ghosts are certainly known and poltergeists are able to interact with the world, so that's definitely not miraculous for someone who knows magic. Nevermind Horcruxes and the Ritual Voldemort used at the graveyard. Certainly an impressive feat og magic, but not divine.

** Of course, all Europeans almost without an exceptions were Christians well into the 19th century. It was traditionally unacceptable (or perhaps only unfashionable) not to be Christian in Europe well into the early 20th century, and in US until recently. (Let's put aside in this generalization the issue of Jews, Muslims, and followers of other religions, this is mostly about Christianity v. nones). Wicca really started in public sometime after the Second World War.

Even if we are most favourable towards nones, we can imagine that after the witch-hunts most wizards and witches truly rejected their faith (which is hard to imagine, people don't do that ... see for comparison most Communists who kept their faith even during the Stalinist purges, often even those were unjustly persecuted themselves).

However, it is necessary to understand that even if the magical world was completely unbelieving, it was still functioning in the middle of mostly religious Muggle world (see the recapitulation above). Not only magicals could turn back to the faith from Muggle sources, but also all people coming to the magical world from the Muggle one (muggleborns and spouses of magical partners) were as matter of course Christians and they were bringing their faith back to the magical world. I could imagine that at least some of them managed to convert their families to the faith.

So, my head-canon of the religion in the magical world is combination of mostly agnostic apathetic majority (what we see in JKR books, where the religion is never even mentioned), but there are some families which are strongly Christian (the similar fighting spirit we can see in Christians who are living for long time in the hostile environment, e.g., Catholics in France). It is something very similar to what's the current situation in UK: people are perhaps nominally CoE, but there are just few of take it seriously.

*** Are we talking the modern Neo-Pagan movement or the old school polytheistic pantheons? Or are you referencing the druids? The differences are fairly stark after all.

Neo-Paganism didn't really start until the mid 20th century, though it has its roots in 19th century romanticism, and so tends to focus on the more idealized aspects and ignore the unpleasant (like the frequent, regularly scheduled human sacrifice.) It, as a movement, tends to bear little resemblance to the ancient, now-extinct religions that it seeks to revive. It is a catch-all term for a massive amount of vastly different subsects, some based on ancient Graeco-Roman, Norse, or Egyptian beliefs, others more shamanistic or tribal, etc. Paganism, etymologically speaking, was originally a pejorative term used by early Roman Christians to describe /all/ polytheistic religions, such as the Hellenistic, Nordic, and Hindu pantheons. Thus there was no uniform pagan religion even then.

Now if you are referencing the druids, who somehow have wonderful press among neo-pagans, they made the Death Eaters look like the kindest, most charitable people to ever live. The druids practiced human sacrifice, cannibalism, and bestiality, among other things. They were absolutely brutal savages, so that was just a regular Tuesday for them. (Side note: The name "Tuesday" is derived from the Germanic war god, Tiu, so while the Romans called it "dies Martis" in honor of Mars, the anglicized version substitutes the Germanic name. Similarly, Wednesday was derived from Woden, the Germanic equivalent of the Norse Odin.) For some reason, people today love to whitewash them as these peaceful tribes in tune with nature, etc etc etc. The historical records show otherwise. Once again, I suspect 19th century romanticism is to blame.

My point in all this rambling, beyond simply the fact I love history more than I loved my ex-wife (obviously), is that I don't think pagan beliefs fit the Wizarding World as a whole, though I'm sure there are individuals and groups that hold various faiths. I suspect most of the more pagan-minded individuals are likely muggleborns raised in families with "alternative" views who saw having a young witch or wizard in the family as proof and justification of their beliefs.

**** There is a significant amount of debate among Christian circles as to the exact translation of that line. Many believe it is a mistranslation of "poisoner", thus "Thou shalt not suffer a poisoner to live." Which is quite in line with the issues of that time period. Then there are others who believe it refers not to practitioners of magic in general, but specifically those who wield it against other people in malicious ways.

Magic itself is not forbidden by the Bible (in older translations that is), and there were Jewish magicians referenced in the Old Testament. What /was/ forbidden were magics that tried to play God. Divination by outside sources, Summoning, and Necromancy being the primary three.

To elaborate further on the Divination aspect, knowledge of the future should only come from God, so attempting to seek it via outside sources is both blasphemous and dangerous, as you cannot be certain that the omens and signs perceived are not sent by malevolent entities.

Summoning is fairly obvious I should think. Demons are inherently malevolent, evil entities in Christian teachings. They are the legion of Fallen Angels who followed Lucifer in making war against God and the armies of Heaven. Demons are also the only beings that would be willing to answer the call of a summoner.

Necromancy is generally seen as the worst of the bunch, though it has nothing to do with reanimation, undead hordes, or skeletal overlords. It is communing with the spirits of the dead, calling to them in the underworld and summoning them forth to answer questions. This contravention of the natural order is both horrifyingly obscene, and incredibly dangerous for the same reason that summoning is. You're not really going to call up your dead loved one. You're going to call up a demon who looks like them, or even the Devil himself, who will at best try to lead you to your own death (sound familiar?), and at worst attempt to possess you.

Now, as far as the Wizarding World goes, we know they both believe in, and can /prove/ the existence of the human soul. As far as Divination goes, they can use the age old trick of justifying it by saying they only use safe and holy methods. Maybe their crystal balls are blessed and washed in holy water? Summoning? We never see demons or even anything that can truly be described /as/ summoning in the books, only conjured or transfigured creatures, both of which are simply magical constructs. The only example of traditional Necromancy we see is the Resurrection Stone, which always seems to end in suicide for the users.

For the record, I do headcanon most of the Western Wizarding World as being predominantly Christian, though probably not particularly devout. They believe in God and treat their religious views as a fairly private part of their life. I expect a smattering of other religions, namely the major ones like Judaism, Islam, and variants of Buddhism and Hinduism. Hogwarts definitely has at least one chapel somewhere, probably several, but likely no official services for /any/ religion. Voldemort is definitely atheist, but more along the lines of Laveyan Satanism, where he believes (more literally than most) in becoming a god unto himself. The more fanatical Death Eaters are cut from the same cloth as the Manson family, where they believe that he is the second coming of the Messiah.
