Made me snort out loud several times. Daphne reminded me of a friend I used to have, anyone have a recommendation for great awkward characters? It's refreshing after reading so many super characters. I also really like the Harry/OC where Harry is a widower with the coffee/Piano muggle OC


** Is this what, an agreement to marry both eachothers' benefit? Or am I completely wrong?

And sorry, I'm new to reddit, but what's 'you are doing that too much. try again in 5 minutes.'???

** There's a James Sirius/OC that's pretty good. The OC is definitely awkward in a non-Marysue, second hand embarrassment kind of way. The author does a great job with all her OCs, in my opinion.

  A tale of natural enemies and unlikely events. If there was one thing I could change about my life, it would definitely be my name. It has never done me any good, besides carrying a lot of expectations, of which I probably meet a whooping one and a half. Of course, the great James Sirius Potter couldn't care less. And - whatever he might say - I absolutely do NOT fancy him! Prat.

** pretty big fan, but it's followed that ff trend where an author posts a ton of updates at the start and then loses steam and never comes back :(

here's to more chapters

*** Actually the author is just a slow writer. The first chapter was written over a year ago and then there was nothing for a year until it got updated fairly recently with several chapters.

I wouldn't count on it being dead. Reluctant Champion got finished and Scattered War gets at least semi regular updates so it should be fine; just don't expect an update every week.
