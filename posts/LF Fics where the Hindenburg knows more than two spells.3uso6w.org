Avada Kandleabra and the Cruciatius are all well and good, but seriously, the guy was a genius on a level that makes Hermione look like a headless chicken (intellectual equals my ass comparing them is like comparing Revan to that pansy Anakin). The is the motherfucker who not only survived seven years of pureblooded bullshit at Hogwarts, discovered the Chamber of Secrets /without/ it's location staring him in the face, created three Horcruxes /minimum/ right under Dumbledore's nose, /literally/ got a trophy for getting away with murder all while maintaining Hermione level grades in his classes, convincing his teachers that he could do no wrong, AND putting up with summers that make the Dursleys look like coddly mothefuckers (lets not forget he did all this with jack-diddly in cash to his name) so where the fuck is his badass spell repertoire?!.

I'm looking for stuff like the Denarian series's Hindenburg, because that fucker had the kind of shit I'd expect from a Dark Lord so powerful people faint when they hear his name.

Edit: On an unrelated note, has anyone found a good Fate crossover with Star Wars? Because I sure as hell haven't.

Edit 2: I just realized I actually typed out "the Hindenburg" in my title instead of Lord Voldemort. I've had a word replacer for it since I read Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus for most of the terms in there. I guess I've just gotten used to seeing them. (Draco --->mini-pimp, Crabb ---> Robotic Minion #1, Goyle --->Robotic Minion #2, Death----> Uncle Death, Figg----> Crazy Cat Lady, Voldemort --->Hindenburg, suicide ---->visiting Uncle and so on.)

**** The worst part is that I can't help but feel Voldemort could have been a better person had he been giving some positive influence, maybe a proper guardian. I don't know what it is about the canon character that J.K. Rowling wrote, but if he had had parents I think Tom Riddle in that universe would have been one of the greatest wizards of that time.

***** I..... I...... Dude. That's the POINT, THAT'S THE STORY.

Orphan, without anyone who cares, grows up into an evil man.

This evil man makes another small boy an orphan.

It almost goes bad again.

But in the end, this time people step up, and the potential protégé instead becomes his own variety of Master.

*** Where else would it have been? He could have made friends and stayed with them over breaks (a la Harry's time at the Burrow), but without the books mentioning anything it's really only safe to assume he went back to the orphanage.

  "You understand, I'm sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?" said Dumbledore. "He will have to return here, at the very least, every summer."

Presumably he would have the option of staying with friends. However, I can much more easily imagine him telling the orphanage he's spending time with friends and then doing things on his own. It's hard to imagine him sleeping on the camp bed at Mulciber's parents' house.

**** Actually the second book does mention it a bit. When Harry enters the diary memory it starts out with Riddle talking to the then headmaster, trying to stay at Hogwarts over summer. The headmaster turns him down due to the chamber being opened, and mentions that the school might not even open up again.

I think most people took away that he framed Hagrid to save himself and keep Hogwarts open, but his initial intention was to stay at Hogwarts instead of go back to an orphanage. Can't imagine he'd stay at Hogwarts if he had friends(minions) that'd be willing to house him over the summer. That would have been the summer between his 5th and 6th year, so presumably he had spent the previous summers at the orphanage as well.

** I'm not entirely sure Tom was a genius. He was very charismatic and highly intelligent. If he was the genius that OP claims him to be, then he would have waited on making the horcrux, not to mention not killing where he lives. He made rookie mistakes in his arrogance. For such a genius, he was a complete moron.

Hermione is a highly intelligent, but she isn't exactly Riddle's league. Albus and Severus are in that league, but not Hermione.

Also, I think with each Horcrux created, Riddle lost his sanity, which didn't help him any.

*** The argument that he is not a genius, just highly intelligent, is fine. However, that still asks the question, why does a highly intelligent person basically only use 2 spells? As for his arrogance, just because you are smart, does not make you wise. His fatal flaw I would argue (or one of them), was hubris, because he thought he was above all and probably thought he was so powerful the horcruxes wouldn't make him lose his sanity. Look at Hermione in canon, not even on the same spectrum of his intelligence, and she does dumb shit by the dozens.

***** I hope this doesn't sound like bragging, but it probably still will. When I was in school, everyone would call me a "genius", and while I wasn't really in terms of IQ, I was fairly intelligent and graduated valedictorian. However, I am a complete moron. Low on common sense, say the dumbest shit, rude, etc. etc., so I think people who are perceived to be intelligent in one thing, such as school, may be so, but overall, they have huge weaknesses to drawback on their intelligence.

In the censored edition? You shouldn't expect head-blasting curses in children's books, because certain amounts of gore just doesn't pass the censorship for such audiences. The AK and Cruciatus are "clean" spells, despite their horrible effect. It also gives Harry a chance to be tortured and murdered and then just rise up and walk out like it's nothing. Wouldn't have worked with more directly damaging spells.

That, or Voldemort is just a pansy who can't stand the sight of gore.
