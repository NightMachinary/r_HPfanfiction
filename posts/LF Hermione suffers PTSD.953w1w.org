I've been reading a lot of post-war fanfictions and I've noticed that except for sadness because of all the deaths and a bit of automatic wand-waving at the beginning of the stories there are never any consequences for the characters. Job offers are thrown after them, everyone wants to get into their panties because they are war heroes, the only thing they don't like are the papparazzo. I'd like to read something where Hermione seriously suffers PTSD and maybe has problems re-integrating into the wizarding community. I don't care if it's gen or romamce, as long as she doesn't end up with Ron. Maybe you guys can help me out here.

*** First of all, this fic is R/Hr, which the OP doesn't want.

Second, this fic makes no sense on too many levels, and it was thoroughly dissected [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/8vwftm/book_club_the_world_i_leave_behind_by_nes85/e1qwqzk/][in this thread]].

  Harry went into the forbidden forest to let Voldemort kill him, but was taken prisoner, instead. He is believed to be dead, and Ginny, Ron, and Hermione struggle to find a way forward. Canon is followed up to Chapter 34 of Deathly Hallows. Please R&R.

** likeao3(Unforgiven Pride by Laziza) is the first one that comes to mind. It's a WIP SS/HG slowburn that has a lot of focus on Hermione recovering from the war.
