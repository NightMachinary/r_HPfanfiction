Mostly I don't think it would change much, but I'd like to hear other opinions.


** They'd still hate him, probably rub the extra-special treatment of Dudley and their "precious baby girl" in Harry's face even more so then canon.

However the girl might be more sympathetic to Harry for two reasons.

1) Harry may be forced to take care of her because The Dursleys just loved to load chores onto little Harry.

2) Dudley may try bullying her and if so then Harry would definitely defend her. He hated bullies and wasn't scared of Dudley.

So in the long run, it may have been good for Harry, having a member of the Dursley's who cared about him as he grew up. Of course it could have gone the complete opposite way and the girl could have been just Petunia 2.0 but I'm an optimist XD

*** I like to think she wasn't Petunia 2.0, but I also doubt Dudley would have bullied her more than once. I can't see Petunia letting him get away with it more than once; picking on Harry is one thing, but his little sister is a different matter.

**** Maybe, but Dudley knew how to manipulate his parents. He could just bully her at school or whenever his parents weren't looking.

But I agree completely that Petunia wouldn't let even Dudley get away with it if she saw it. But Dudley was also huge and able to intimate many children, he could easily frighten his little sister into silence.

** I've read a really dark version of a story like this where Harry has a younger sister. At the start Petunia has some version of PPD so leaves the raising of her almost entirely to Harry but then takes her away when she realises the sister actually likes Harry. The sister forgets Harry cared for her when she was a baby and grows up a bully like Dudley. It's a sad story.

** I don't see Vernon and Petunia tolerating anyone mistreating her baby, even Dudley. But, toddlers have trouble with new siblings and Dudley being spoiled would have even more trouble than most. It could play out a lot of ways but I like the notion of Dudley being demoted from Golden child and coming to an understanding with Harry sooner.

** Petunia would have spoiled the girl rotten like she did with Dudley while Harry would still gotten second hand clothes and sleep in the cupboard until he got the Hogwarts Letter. I don't see any change for Harry, except he would probably not get Dudleys second bedroom (because there the girl would sleep) but the guestroom.

Girls can be just as mean as boys - they just be mean in different ways. So while Dudley used his fists to torture Harry his female cousin would most likely used lies and gossip. Children imitate what they see from their parents and continue with bad behavior if encouraged. With a mother like Petunia who already spread gossip about Harry, the girl would probably make his situation even worse.

** I would love to read a story where this little sister grew up idolizing Harry, much to her family's horror. You can imagine that Dudley would not react kindly to no longer being the only focus of his mother's attention, and this along with the girl's empathy would only strengthen her bond with Harry. Petunia would try and turn her into "her little Princess," but she would only want to help Harry with his chores and share her toys, throwing tantrums if they planned an outing or vacation and didn't bring Harry.

Part of me thinks it would be great if she turned out to have magic and Harry was there to help her navigate through it, but admittedly this might be too cliche in a sea of cliches.

*** Four bedrooms, actually - Vernon and Petunia, Dudley, Harry, and the guest room Aunt Marge stays in when she visits. It's an issue I've actually been trying to figure out - who sleeps where when she visits in the summer of PoA, because there's no way they'd force Harry and Dudley to room together even for a week, so I'm torn between setting up a camp bed in Vernon&Petunia's room for the daughter to sleep in while Marge takes her room, or shoving Harry into a cheap tent pitched in the back garden and letting Marge have his room.

As for looks, personally I was going with face similiar in structure to Petunia, generally tall for her age but never gets fat like Vernon and Dudley, pale eyes and brown hair.

Totally going for her being a witch though, but all childhood accidental magic will get blamed on Harry so no one knows until she gets her letter.

**** Definitely putting Harry out, rather then the daughter. Camp bed in Dudley's room, maybe?

When I was a teen and my grandma visited, my mom kicked me out of my double-sized bed into my little brother's twin-sized bed and put him in a sleeping bag. (Sucked for him but I wouldn't fit on the floor.) So I could see a domino effect - Marge gets the daughter's bed, daughter gets Harry's, Harry gets the floor.

**** They would probably never actually come out and say that, perhaps, but if they were willing to lie to a child about his parents (why drunk driving car accident, when just they were murdered by a loon would have sufficed?), were willing to imply that the child was a juvenile delinquent, then pretending in public to be in fear of the child, implying that the child was a budding sexual predator, and that they feared the reprisal from the child to their daughter isn't out of the realm of possibility.

Edit: rephrasing this better

This would give an added degree of protection to Dudley if and when he would become really, really violent (just protecting his sister), and was caught. If he was violent towards others, then poor boy was under stress.

Additionally, this would result in someone reacting to Harry and the Dursleys further blackmailing him into submission.

All the while the daughter is raised to hate and fear that freak under the stairs like a monster under her bed, but never quite understanding why.

Leaves behind a very horribly beaten Harry who trusts nobody at all and never actually makes friends anywhere.

As I said, pretty dark outcome.

Also, Voldemort wins, and Harry doesn't give a flying 621311

*** Why stop at rumours? Treat any kindness between her and Harry as Harry making a move on her, and punish him accordingly. Of course, if he behaves /unkindly/ towards her, he needs to be punished for that too. "How dare you ignore your cousin!" - more punishment.

They'd trap him in a lose-lose-lose situation where no matter what he does he's always at risk of getting at least yelled at and possibly more.

Even worse, what if Vernon got it into his head that Harry actually was a threat to his little princess's virtue? The abuse we see in canon would ratchet up a /lot/, possibly to the point of accidental or even deliberate homicide.
