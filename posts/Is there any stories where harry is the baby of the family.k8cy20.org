Can anyone help me find a Harry Potter fanfic where Harry is the youngest and is the baby of the family where everyone is protective of him and I would prefer if he had brothers rather than sister also if it's possible if Harry is innocent


** I can't recall the name right now but I read a fic where Harry and others (Ron possibly Hermione and more) traveled to another dimension where I think the Potters were dead but Sirius raised him. Sirius and everyone treated him like a kid, babying him never letting him find out anything about the war. I am pretty sure he was a Huffelpuff. Dimension hopping Harry was this hardens solider and Huffelpuff Harry was this shy kid.
