It is said that the Potters are rich (or at least somewhat wealthy) because Fleamont Potter invented Sleekeazy's Hair Potion.

Consider this: Lily and James named their son Harry.


** The rhyme of ‘Hairy' and ‘Harry' doesn't work in British English.

The same source also says that Harry was named after James' Grandfather, Henry (Harry) Potter, who campaigned for wizard involvement in the Great War, ‘to help the muggles'.

  ‘Hairy' and ‘Harry' doesn't work

Doesn't work with a lot of US accents either. Took me forever to get the "joke."

** You realise Rowling is a British author and doesn't have the Mary/marry/merry merger, right...?

*** Neither does the way many Americans speak. “Marry” and “merry” are utterly distinct in my dialect.

** Not too far a stretch considering the vast number of "you're a hairy wizard" jokes out there
