I'm looking for a fic that makes you bust up laughing in multiple parts. A funny pairing would be great, I do love a bit of a love story. I am mostly looking for something that has hilarity throughout and is longer than 10 chapters. I'm not interested in anything Cursed Child related. I just cannot for the life of me get into that story. What is the funniest fic that you have read, that also has depth, great character building, and is longer than a few pages? What fic made you laugh the most? I'm desperately in need of a laugh at the moment.


** In this one the communist manifesto and gets passed around Hogwarts during fifth year. Chaos ensues. There's also a sick boggart in the Forbidden Forest that the Marauders befriended. its super AU though.

Snape does his career day interviews

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7079665]]

ONE OF MY FAVORITE FICS OF ALL TIME. Harry is super cheeky in this one. He loves potions but Snape is still a dick. Also makes the horcrux connection a thousand times creepier than it is in canon. I mean made me cringe creepy. There are hidden nuggets in some of Snape's words. Like he says that when he thinks of Trewlawney he wants to kill her so he doesn't think about her, and Harry takes it as Snape being an asshole, but we know as readers what really happened that night with the prophecy. It's just a really good fic.

Some quotes:

“Goyle

Draco wanted Potter to be his minion. Greg was already Draco's minion. Potter would take Draco over Greg's dead body.

(Greg was not a very complicated thinker.)”

----------------

““An explanation, Mister Potter.”

“...I was thinking about pink elephants.”

Professor Snape gave him look number 5, ‘children are the worst.'

“Because I thought if you could read minds, you'd hear the elephants and not what I was thinking about,” Harry explained hurriedly.”

------------------

“It seems unlikely. Humans are not his primary diet, and when not provoked into violence, hippogriffs are rather gentle.”

“They're giant murderbirds, professor,” Draco informed him.

-------------------

Quote from Draco's adventures as a cat animagus:

“Draco sniffed it again, on the off chance it would come back to life and entertain him. The vole remained stubbornly dead.

He batted at it with a paw, causing it to roll interestingly.

It wasn't as if he was going to eat it, he had his standards, but....

He batted at it with the other paw, and the chase was on.”

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  Objectively speaking, Hermione Granger knows Britain has a monarchy, just as she knows Prince Draco (the grandson of the King of England) is probably off somewhere living his royal life in total unrelation to hers. Seeing as she isn't delusional, she doesn't really expect to be his friend. She doesn't expect anything that comes after, either. Dramione, modern royalty AU. COMPLETE.

If there is a rule requiring the use of the bot, I'll comply, but it's honestly irritating to get a notification that someone has responded to a fic recommendation comment because they find it less time-consuming to summon the bot than spend the second clicking on the link.

I'd understand if there were a lot of recommendations or even the link to the ff2ebook archive as you provided, it was very altruistic on your part to leave the link. But you keep doing this to all of my fic recs with only one or two fics.

  Harry wanted to be outraged on behalf of the castle that he still considered to be his home. Hogwarts didn't deserve to have a piece of Tom Riddle lodged inside it like a particularly vicious splinter. But there was something he was annoyed about even more than the fact that he was once again alive at the same time as a once and future dark lord. For the first time in his life, he sympathized with Voldemort, and knew that in this one instance, Voldemort might sympathize with him. Harry looked at Tom head-on, and said, "Albus Dumbledore is a bastard."*Both turned down for the position of Hogwarts DADA professor, Tom and Harry have a few things to say to each other.
