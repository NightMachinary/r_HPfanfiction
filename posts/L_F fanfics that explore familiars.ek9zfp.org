I'm looking for fanfics that explore familiar bonds or where they are more present. Even just companions that aren't human. For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12327444/1/Sand-and-Iron][Sand-and-Iron]] by MrMaurader98 is great, although short, with a Pokemon familiar and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354748/1/The-Nature-of-the-Thing][The-Nature-of-the-Thing]] by LadyNyxRavus with a d√¶mon familiar.

Anything like that with a closer connection to some sort of creature. Even Hedwig or Fawkes as long as it explores the bond. I know there are a bunch with a snake familiar where the bond helps Harry heal people like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change][To-Shape-and-Change]] by BlueOwl or protects Harry's mind in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving-Connor]] by Lightning on the Wave. Anything similar is fine too.

Anything you can think of where the familiar bond just does /more./ Thanks!
