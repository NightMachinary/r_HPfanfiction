Quidditch is very illogical and most of the players are pointless. How to make wizards see it?

I was thinking maybe heaving one super seeker that gets the snitch in first 20-30 seconds of the game, each game. But then they might just fanboy over him and don't think about the fact that the game lasted less time than walking up to tribunes.


** We have very little evidence of what Pro level matches are like in canon. The one pro match we see the chasers are the ones that win the match. I still think the impact of being hit by iron wrapped in leather mean pro level beaters might be hugely influential. Sure at Hogwarts its seeker centric but Ron talks about a match that lasted a week. If in a week they couldn't create a 15 goal lead then neither team deserved to win.

** I suppose thats cultural thing. I`ve seen an idea somewhere: wizard world has "cult of power" or smth like that. "There is Chosen One, and he is the only one who can do anything against Grand Villain, and all others are just pawns, dust and rubbish".

So trying to make them see is, uh, not a good idea. You are basically saying "your culture is shit". Try to enter church and do an equivalent speech there. Even if you are logical and right, you will not be recieved well.

** I remember one fic where the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw teams made a deal to rack up the points and lock slitherin out of the cup. The beaters played catch with the bludgers while the chasers scored points over and over uncontested. I think Harry was giving seeker types to the other seeker. This was a setting where the cup was determined mostly by total overall score. I think each team ended with a couple thousand.

** The pitch is 200 yards at most, booms can go 150 mph and they don't get tired. Chasers ought to be able to score at least once a minute, even accounting for the Keeper (50% blocks) and the opposite team (giving you 15 seconds per attack).

The seeker is a tie-breaker, he will win the game if the chasers are about equal. If the skill disparity is too large, he can do nothing (like Krum at the World cup). If one Chaser squad is better than the other, they will quickly drive up the score so that around 30 minutes in, the score difference will exceed 150 points.

** The Wizarding World is in love with the sport, so doing so is going to be nigh impossible. Have you ever tried to talk to someone about how their preferred sport is bad? Won't work.

Even if they acknowledge its flaws, they won't care, they enjoy it the way it is.

But.. well.. Hmm. I remember in linkffn(5782108), someone [[/spoiler][basically steals the snitch to try to show how stupid it is. The game is unending. It continues for hours on hours on hours, the chasers scoring endlessly and pointlessly, but I don't think we saw what came of it.]].

It could be possible that the snitch /can't/ be caught so quickly - or at least that it would be basically a miracle to do so.

The snitch may be precisely magicked so that it's just too fast or whatnot that early in the game. Maybe the snitch gets slower/more predictable as the game continues.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

**** And in sports today...

Chairman Hassan Mostafa wrapped up the third day of pre-season hearings by the International Association of Quidditch for consideration of rule changes in the Wizarding World's most popular sport.

Much of the controversy in this year's hearings came from the office of the British Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, or rather from the spokeswitch of that Department, Hermione Weasley. Mrs. Weasley's exhaustive rule set and arithmantic proof of 'enhanced entertainment value' for her proposed Millennium Quidditch was reported to count at 1043 feet of scroll.

Thankfully, in anticipation of the proposal's review, Mrs. Weasley has provided us a highlight of the most significant rule changes:

- The three goal hoops are to vary in size and point value. The center hoop is to be made half as large, to be worth 20 points. The left hoop would be enlarged to twice size but worth only 5 points and the right hoop is left at standard size and point value.

- The snitch is to be worth 42 points, making a tie game impossible. It isn't released onto the pitch until ten minutes after quaffle play has commenced. A Protean charm on the snitch closes the hoops of both teams the moment the snitch considers itself caught.

- Brooms are to be shared- that is, everyone brings a broom for the pile, but the team captains pick from those brooms available to equip their players; by doing so, there would be little chance of disparity in the performance of the equipment. Choosing starts with a coin toss, and the captains will be challenged to stay familiar with the capabilities of all official brooms.

Chairman Mostafa today declared that the proposal will require serious consideration, but that Mrs. Weasley's lack of brevity has consigned any decision on its merits to be delayed until next year's pre-season hearing.

Mr. Ragmar Dorkins' proposal to change the value of the snitch to 250 points has once again been heard and denied. Mr. Dorkins, as many readers know, is the Manager for the Chudley Cannons. His analysis that such a change would result in the Cannons being more competetive was met with some sympathy. He was given a plate of cannoli.

** You can't. :) I hate Quidditch -- mostly because I find it boring as fuck. But even in the real world sports fans are not going to be swayed by something like "logic." There's no way a sport that has been popular with wizards for centuries is ever going to be changed by arguments such as that.

If you try to take a wizard and explain the flaws in Quidditch, he'll just insist you're missing the point.
