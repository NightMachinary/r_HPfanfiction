I have read Worthy of Magic (if you haven't I suggest you check it out), and I was just wondering if there are any other well written fics where Harry is fairly crazy, and kills the Dursleys


** The Denarian Trilogy? I wouldn't call Harry crazy in it, but how sane can someone really be when there's a fallen angel living in your head?

** The Harveste Addams series by Kyaru features a Harry that slaughters the Dursleys and then is adopted by the Addams family. It's incomplete - only gets two chapters into Half Blood Prince - but it's a trip and a half, and if you're a fan of the Addams Family at all I highly recommend it.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

  Due to a severe head injury, Harry experiences a rather extreme change in personality - namely, a sudden tendency to kill people he doesn't like. Awesome!Psycho!Harry, Harry/Luna main pairing, Ãœbermanipulative!Dumbles, major Weasley-bashing
