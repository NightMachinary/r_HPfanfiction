They decide to go for a romantic dinner in London and since homunculus Voldemort starts belittling Wormtail, Fleur drops him in a trash can.

Next day she receives an Auror investigating allegations that she performed dark magic on her baby and then threw him away. The baby is safe at St Mungo but keeps claiming he is actually You-Know-Who and that a French bitch stole his wormtail.
