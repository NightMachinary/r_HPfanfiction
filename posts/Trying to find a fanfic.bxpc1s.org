I'm trying to find a HP fanfic. The main thing I remember is that it centers around Harry and Sirius, and Harry has this magical power/uses his magic to manifest disembodied hands, that float around him invisibly helping him duel. If anybody has any clue what calit's called, I'd be forever greatful!
