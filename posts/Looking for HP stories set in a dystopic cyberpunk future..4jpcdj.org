Not soecifically looking for crossover stuff though if there is, go ahead and lemme know. Mostly looking for [cyborg?] Harry growing up in an arcology then finding out he's a wizard or something along those lines.


** Seconded. Would love to see something like Harry Potter in William Gibson's Neuromancer universe.

** I think something more like Shadowrun would work better - it already has magic built into the setting. I could see the "Awakening" being replaced with the Statute of Secrecy being broken. Might even write a story one of those days, but I've not been running Shadowrun games for a few years now, so I'd need more planning.

*** One could have a lot of Wizarding Britain in Shadowrun, an entire magical tradition.

Or one could adapt it a bit more to Shadowrun's lore. Instead of Hogwarts, there's an Arcology where wizards are trained. Voldemort could be a rival exec of Dumbledore, both using runners in their shadow war.
