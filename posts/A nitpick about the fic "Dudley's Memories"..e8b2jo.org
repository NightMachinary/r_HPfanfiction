Alright, so this fic is great. It's post-hogwarts, about Dudley having a magical child, and Harry comes with to deliver the letter. It's eventually revealed that Dudley wanted to get in contact with Harry for a while and as such has become a police officer specializing in strange cases - anything to get him in contact with the wizarding world.

Harry meets him again, possibly in the sequel, when he's at the site of a magical accident. Hermione shows up, and Dudley says something off-handedly about wizards.

At this point, ol' Herminone whips out her wand and goes "Obliv-", only for Harry to stop her.

What the fuck is this scene? Do random wizards seriously obliviate random muggles when they off-handedly say something with "magic" or "wizard" in it? She doesn't even know who he is, what the hell was she even planning to remove? All memories of magic, probably. In that case, Dudley suddenly has massive brain damage and memory loss because he has many memories relating to magic. Harry is removed. His entire reasoning for his job is removed. Large parts of his childhood are removed.

What the fuck? Do they not even check context, or maybe /if the muggle is in on the secret?/ Seriously, his daughter is a witch, what would have happened there? Do they randomly obliviate the parents of muggleborns? No checks or balances?

This seriously irked me off.


** That sounds more like poor writing than anything else. That being said, never forget about the muggle who ran the campstite in GoF. They memory wiped him so much it damaged him.

*** That's actually a good point. I wonder why they didn't just let him in to the secret, and make him sign a NDA, perhaps enforced through a little bit of magic? Or why they didn't make an anonymous donation to his family to take a few months of vacation somewhere?

**** Because magicals either see muggles as cattle or the kind of 'adorable boii' we use to refer to our pets? Why would they waste money or magical paper on what they deem as barely above an animal - whether that animal be a lolcat or a tiger, it's still a waste to that mindset. Between that and the fact that magical medicine can apparently heal most injuries, they've no real reason to care. Why obliviate him? To Rowling-Magicals, the real question is 'why not obliviate him?'.

** I really like the story, but this part was exactly sloppily written and Hermione behaved quite out of character (even out of the character in the particular story). Ignoring this stupidity, I really liked the rest of the story. And just a nitpick: he wasn't a police officer, but working in the British equivalent of CPS.

** To be fair, for Dudley to say it in front of two wizards when Hermione'd known him for ages and he never revealed his knowledge was weird. In high stress situations, you think on your feet.

I love that fic.

*** It still doesn't make sense, because Harry mentioned "The Dursleys" and "my cousin Dudley" and "in Surrey" and Herminone seriously didn't put 2+2 together and think that the "Dudley Dursley" who lives in Surrey working with her may be this person?

For that matter, why didn't she, you know, /ask him what he meant before whipping out the neuralyzer/?

**** He went by a different name at the time and had also completely changed his appearance.

Look, I agree with you, they're too trigger happy, but since Hermione did reverse her parents' obliviation according to JKR, maybe she figured she'd have reversed that one too.

In any case, since you can just take away that plot point and literally nothing in the story changes... Eh.
