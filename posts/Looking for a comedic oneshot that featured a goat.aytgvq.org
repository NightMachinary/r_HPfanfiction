I can't quite remember the specific circumstances of the fic, other than it was rather short, there were a lot of goblins involved and at one point I think a goat ended up in a position of power within what was either Hogwarts or the Ministry. Definitely either crack, humour or parody. Main character was /probably/ Harry, given my track record, but that's not by any means a guarantee.

Does anyone have an idea as to the name of this fic? I'm the absolute worst at finding things, and it popped up in my mind earlier while I was skimming past another mention of Aberforth and his goats---though I don't think this fic actually featured him, surprisingly enough.

  New legislation mandates all individuals campaigning for the post of Minister of Magic, must be a Pureblood of at least three (3) generations. Tom Riddle is a genius, and originally he was planning on just murdering his way into this, but now?Well.Tom Riddle was a very very petty man,and nobody discriminates against him.OrTom Riddle decides to fuck with the Ministry of Magic, becomes Lawful Evil, and somehow, accidentally, gets a literal goat in office.

** The story was a crack-treated-seriously but still humour. It was a gift-fic!
