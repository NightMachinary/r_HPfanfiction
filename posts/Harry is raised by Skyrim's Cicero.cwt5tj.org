** I don't think there are any good TES and HP crossovers. The concept would be interesting.

I once wrote out a 10K chapter with three way crossover including the Dresden Files that had Harry get involved with Mora playing the role of an outsider.

  A certain young wizard ends up at 4 Privy Drive instead of 4 Privet Drive. He is raised with loving care by a cuddly Merc with a Mouth. WARNING: now with 19.96% more Death Eaters and a Rodent of Death.
