preferably female, I know they are unpopular but SI/OC's are like my guilty pleasure lol


** SpaceBattles forums has two that I like very much:

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff?]]: an SI OC who, as the title suggests, gets sorted into Hufflepuff. She is +prevented by the reincarnation magic from telling anyone what she knows about canon+ *paranoid*, so she has to fix things herself. Updates slowly but regularly.
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][Perks of Survival]]: SI reincarnates into Sally-Anne Perks, the girl who in canon is named at the sorting but never showed up for the OWLs---and we have no idea why. The SI sets out to /not die/, and, with this sort of attitude, gets sent straight to Slytherin. Last updated in 2015, so probably abandoned.

**** Thank you for the correction; I must have mixed it up with another fic, perhaps /Perks of Survival/.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship.

  Tumblr Prompt from accio shitpost: "i wanna see a muggle who goes stealth among wizards purely by having a ridiculous aesthetic" A muggle moves to Ottery St Catchpole a few months after the Battle of Hogwarts, and there's a slight misunderstanding.
