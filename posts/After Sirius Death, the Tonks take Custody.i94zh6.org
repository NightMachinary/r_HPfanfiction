:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific fanfic where after Sirius' death, the Tonks get custody of Harry. It also involves a bunch of people taking summer courses. Harry ends up doing really well, and Hermione isn't doing so great. And she ends up going a bit crazy trying to keep up and everything.

There's also a portion where at the beginning of the story, they are taking a test to determine what summer courses they need to take.

If this sounds remotely familiar to you, and you know what its called, I would greatly appreciate it if you could link it below. Its been driving me crazy trying to find it.


** I believe that is linkffn(Summer Lessons by HarnGin).

  AU: Sirius's will gives the Tonkses custody of Harry. Meanwhile, the ministry is forcing non-wizard-raised students to spend their summer taking "wizarding culture" classes from early morning until late at night. How does this affect Harry?
