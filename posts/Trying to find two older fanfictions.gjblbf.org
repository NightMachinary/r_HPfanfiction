From what I recall, Harry had a vampire inheritance but had to live through several lifetimes before catching back up to the present. One of which was when he attended school with Riddle. Eventually made aware of multiple types of clans of which Neville and Sirius eventually joined.

The other was where he was a disregarded son of the Malfoys. Became a Seer from Zabinis mother with a mark on his face.

I am trying to find old stories I read probably a decade or more ago and just cannot seem to find these two. Does anyone else even recognize these? Sorry for the sparse details.
