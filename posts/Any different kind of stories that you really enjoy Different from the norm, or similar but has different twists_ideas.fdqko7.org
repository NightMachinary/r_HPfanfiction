Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash, though not looking for pairings. Don't want incest. Am fine with other warnings in the story.

Anyone can be the main character, it can be on any site.

Would rather not have character bashing in it. Characters disliking or even hating each other is fine, an author going out of the way to bash a character is usually a no go. Very little bashing if it has any, but would prefer none.

No Lord or Harem Harry if possible?

It can be drabbles/oneshots/multichapter.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Survival is a talent by ShanaStoryteller, it's a soulmate Drarry story, and it has my favorite characterizations of basically everyone.

** Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) is always a good recommendation for something different - it's a traditional hero's journey story (as opposed to canon which eventually turns into a Christ allegory) and was written between GoF and OotP, so it takes the HP culture, world, and system of magic in a very different direction from canon. Unfinished, but it has a very strong Act 2 ending in the last couple chapters.

Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) and sequels do a TON of world-building beyond canon, especially in regards to the magic system. I knew nothing about the Alanna the Lioness universe prior to reading it, so don't let that be a deterrent.

** linkao3(19381933) for a Tom obsessed Ginny, it has got a lot of Weasleycide. Pity that it got over.

linkao3(21309898) After the Battle of Department of Mysteries, Ginny ends up in the Wool's Orphanage as a 6 year old. Ginny and Tom fluff.

linkao3(12360399) Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy have to deal with a teenaged Lord Voldemort that came out of the Diary. It's quite humorous.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix
