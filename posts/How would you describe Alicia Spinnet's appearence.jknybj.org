** If there's no description in the books, you can just make up whatever you want

*** Seconded this. Perhaps the first question to ask in this context is if there's any feature you want to put narrative focus on (eg eye, hair or skin colour) because you have plans to use that (eg a running gag about Harry having the prettier shade of green eyes). Then think about what else makes the character stand out (eg a Punk style for Tonks). Lastly, fill the blanks of what else you need to describe a character.

** I personally see her as a young Tessa Thompson (I'm not a fan of the movies so I just make shit up)

** Angelina's eyes are likely quite dark. Not that all black people have dark eyes, but law of averages and all.

Katie Bell I see clearly as light brown hair and light brown eyes. I think the movies go along with this as well.

Poor Alicia is basically just a name in canon. So, super quick, without overthinking, what do YOU see when you picture Angelina, Katie, and Alicia laughing together as they climb onto their brooms? That's what Alicia should look like in your fic.

** When we don't have a description in the books I try to go by the actors in the movies
