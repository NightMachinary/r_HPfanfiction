Is a "magical guardian" an actual thing in the books?


** Not in the least. Based on Professor McGonagall's denial for Harry to go to Hogsmeade in book 3, even the legal concept of the school administration operating in loco parentis is dubious. That said, McG had reasons to deny Harry's request that year even if she did effectively have the authority, so all you can say is "there's no explicit designation like that". Complicating it slightly, Sirius signs Harry's permission slip for the next two years, so it may be a thing as far as godparents being more than a ceremonial designation.

*** The Hogsmeade permission slip I feel was more a formality, there just needed to be an adult's signiture on there. Given how all the arguments for banning him would have been equally valid even if the Dursleys had signed it, and how cheerfully McGonagall ignores school rules when she wants to, Harry would have been banned that year regardless.

I feel the more compelling argument for it is how there never seems to be any notification of non-magical parents of their children's problems. I know that the petrification was viewed as entirely harmless and reversible, but it still seems weird that as far as we know Hermione's parents were never told. Also when Harry was summoned to court in book 5 (although there were a whole bunch of irregularities) he was represented by Dumbledore, and the Dursleys as far as we know were never informed. That suggests that muggles are not viewed as responsible for their magical children when it comes to purely magical matters.

So overall I feel it is never explicitly stated, but it is a valid intepretation of what we see of canon. Although given how little of the actual legal system we see, that doesn't necessarily mean much.
