Are there any stories of Harry winding up in school with the two older Weasleys or Tonks and being the same age as them

Most seem to either have him go back to marauder time or his own start, but what about to a period where he can't effect the first war, but will find himself outside Hogwarts when those shenanigans start.

If there aren't stories in this period what would you like to see from it?


** This seems is a really interesting time period for a story to take place, hope we get some recommendations because I am also interested.

** I'm writing a story of Fred and George as wee ickle firsties recruiting their brother Charlie and his girlfriend Tonks to help with some pranks, but there's no time travel.

I just started writing a story in which George steals a time-turner to travel back to save Fred, then they both travel back to the First Wizarding War to team up with the young Marauders, but there's not much Harry.

  Axel Brandt is a highly intelligent but overall normal guy. He lives a normal life, has a normal engineering job, has normal friends, so on and so forth. But then he died... or not. Displaced and still very much alive, now he's found himself in a distinctly abnormal situation. Ninja are not something he wants to deal with.
