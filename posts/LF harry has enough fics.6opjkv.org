I recently wanted to read some good fics where harry:

snaps at/bashes the order for keeping him in dark, forcing him back at the dursleys etc. And just starts treating everybody like they deserves.

Figures out you cant win throwing stunners, and takes the fight to the DE's, killing the whole lot.

Figures out he is beeing manipulated, and screws with everyone

Says screw it to britain and leaves them to rot.

And fics where harry generally just has enough and screws and bashes everyone for their stupidity (4'th year anyone?)

So what can you guys recommend?

No slash please

EDIT: Bonus for well done snape and draco killings!

EDIT2: Any fics where Harry drives everyone mad without knowing? Where he generally just unknowingly creates mayhem whereever he goes? :P


** You should like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463), then. It has almost everything you are asking, except for killing Snape who is one of the few 'good guys' in this story. Dumbledore, Weasleys, and the Order were bashed extraordinarily, and Hermione was thoroughly trashed for appearing only 7 times.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

*** God, I've just finished the first chapter. It is /super/ cheesy.

- Harrison 'Harry' James Potter

- Dumb-dumb-door

- Magic oaths (e: and cores ðŸ¤¢)

- Canon rehash to point out how /stupid/ all the adults are.

I'm going to keep going for a bit but I'm pretty sceptical at the moment. Hopefully some of the cliches get turned on their heads.

E: Three /loong/ chapters in. This story is trash. Even for a bashing story it's not good. It feels like it's a fic out of time. Like it should have been written about ten years ago, and it was published /this month!/. I'm going to start skimming and skipping, but at this point I have no real hope of change.

***** Oh definitely not, but even for bashing fics it's a garbage fire. I expected nothing and was still disappointed.

I mean, it's the same author as Angry Harry and the Seven - which is also an unadulterated pile of trash - so I really should have expected less than nothing.

While Sinyk's stories are absolutely brutal when it comes to Dumbledore, I still liked them either way.

** Linkffn(courage by potions by janara) doesn't cover LV/DE confrontations, but it does feature a Harry pushed to his breaking point and pushing back. So, points 3, 4, and 5. Bonus Ginny-bashing. Actually, almost everyone-bashing -- except Snape, oddly enough. And Pomfrey. Pretty lighthearted for a "Harry's had enough" fic, and amusing.

  AU, sixth year story; do not follow the last two books! Sick and tired of the way everyone is trying to force him to become Ginny's boyfriend, our hero is seeking for a way to tell everyone what he thinks of them. Alas, things do not turn out the way he thought they would. No pairings.

But seriously, are you looking for something in a canon-ish setting where Harry goes off the deep end and started doing these things (that make sense to him, but are a result of a delusion), or an AU where such behavior would be justified?

For the first one, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10351547/1/The-Perils-of-Independence]]) took a crack at that, though others have probably done a better job. For the second one, others can probably provide better recs than me.
