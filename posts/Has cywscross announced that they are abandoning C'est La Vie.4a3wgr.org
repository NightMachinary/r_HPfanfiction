There have been no updates since 2013 on fanfiction.net. But the story was put up on AOS3 last month by cywscross.


** As a rule of thumb, Cywscross neither finishes any stories (aside from one-shots) nor announces them abandoned. With this author, you pretty much have to accept that any story will be dropped once it gets sufficiently interesting.

** They have said that non of their works will ever be abandoned. They have been focusing on Teen Wolf ffs for a while now, though. I wouldn't give up hope but there probably won't be any updates anytime soon.

**** I've re-read it three times by this point. And not immediately, either. First read was early 2015.
