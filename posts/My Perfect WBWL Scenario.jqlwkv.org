*/All of the Potter's survived Voldemort's attack, but the family was forever changed.../*

Charles was proclaimed the Boy Who Lived and James put both boys under strict regimens to prepare them for the outside world. Lily was bedridden for most of her sons childhoods, as a result of the dangerous magic she unwittingly invoked to protect her children. Lily growing weaker by the day until she slipped into a coma shortly before her children attended Hogwarts.

Harry ended up the more mature of the Potter children, adoring talking magic for hours on end with his mother and almost thriving under his father stern but loving teachings.

However, there was a slight wedge that was driven between them...

James very quickly learned that Charles did not take the threat of free Death Eaters and a potentially returning Dark Lord anywhere near as seriously as his brother. Mostly because he and Lily agreed to only inform the boys of the former. As such, to get Charles to train he was bribed with sweets, treats and days out. Initially this includes Harry, but when they stopped interesting the older twin he became somewhat excluded and forgotten. His obedience, diligence and prodigious skill (in some areas) taken for granted by his father, who focussed more on his slightly lagging other son.

However, things truly came to a head in an event Harry was sworn to secrecy over. An event that left young Harry furious at his father for the betrayal....

The day James entered into an affair with Sirius Black, his dearest friend.

Uncle Padfoot had been a staple of the Potter household ever since their mothers health took a turn for the worst. With Lily bedridden, Sirius all but moved in to Godric's Hollow to support James and became an emotional support beam for all members of the household.

But when Harry recieved his Hogwarts letter in the early hours of his eleventh birthday, he rushed to his fathers room to find the two men rather amourously entwined. Mere weeks after his mother fell into her coma.

Outraged, he screamed and raged at his two father figures. Leading to an incredibly sour send off and even tenser correspondence and visits home. 

At school, Harry found many would only speak with him to get to Charles. And though certain teachers, such as Professor McGonagall, did offer him praise for his astounding work; he was forever overshadowed by his brother even though he (like in his childhood) was doing better.

After their third year, one of many arguments between Harry, Sirius and James (the pair having kept their relationship private to avoid reprisals from Charles and the public) convinces Harry to finally run away from home. Promising to keep in touch with his dear brother as he moves on into the greater, magical world.

Harry refused to return home until the following:

*□ James and Sirius publically revealing their relationship, and how James had been cheating on his mother as she was sick.*

*□ The world recognised him as a seperate entity from his brother and respected him for his own skills and merits.*

and,

*□ He had a cure for his mothers illness, so she can go on and actually live her life.*


** This is solidly believable, unfortunately esp the affair and sick wife scenario. It happens all too often.

The big weak point over the other stories is their lack of believe-ability and I think this is quite natural sounding.

*** Haven't seen the 'sick wife' scenario too often, and never done like this. Unfortunately, I think many readers would automatically see that trope and think linkffn(11585823), so it might be stale for them already - even if they differ overall, the last note about finding a cure stuck with me.

I don't think the matter of James having an /affair/ in itself is unbelievable, but with Sirius? Meh. It doesn't click with me. I think he'd be more likely to find someone else - Sirius just seems 'too easy' an excuse, you know?

** I would like to find a WBWL fic that didn't completely oastrasize Harry from his family. I want him to be treated equally in every way. Just as loved, just as doted on, and just as respected as his brother. I so far haven't found a fic that doesn't throw Harry away or push him to the side because of his brother. I was really into the idea of this when the explanation first started out, I could even understand the James focusing more on Harry's brother because he wasn't applying himself. However, I would have liked Harry to be aware of this fact and, as the more mature twin, to understand that he is still as important to his parents.

I would also love to see a fic where Harry might not be fawned over at Hogwarts but he does develop his own true friendships. Maybe with Hermione and Neville. Hermione would be just as studious as he, and Neville would be shy and need a friend that could boost his confidence and bring out his inner badass.

*** I completely understand this but I took this path because I wanted Harry to still be a child at the end of the day. No matter how mature he is, he still doesn't know everything and often misinterprets stuff or makes the wrong call.

The idea was for Harry to focus more on the negatives than the positives (over-inflating the small/few instances regarding his brother Charles) with a lot of his past grievances bubbling to the surface after he found out about James and Sirius, but pushing them down because he thinks he's being immature.

I really want Harry running away to be this huge culmination of years and years of hiding how he really felt about things. Not having anyone to talk to about his mum, feeling like he didn't matter to his dad, feeling that no matter what he accomplishes he'll never compare to surviving a Killing Curse (especially if he does fantastic things that people actually praise him for, but his self-esteem is so low that he doesn't realise it). I really want to write a WBWL Harry whose situation is bad but it isn't as bad as he thinks, thus he is just spiralling because everyone either assumes he's okay or they don't/can't get through to him.

** Up until you revealed teh gay, it was okay. The massive AU of a gay James and Sirius would definitly warrant a warning before people fell into your trap. But whatever. If that's your thing, that's your thing.

But a lot of things makes no sense, really. Harry in this scenario has been in magic for years with his family. There's no suspense or surprise about him "finding out" that he has magic. They've all known for years that he has magic. So that method of him "discovering infidelity" is bunk, imo. You would have to have a different scenario for me to believe it.

Everyone knows harry has magic. The only reason that canon had him learning about magic at midnight on his birthday was because of the actions of Vernon denying him his letter and dragging them to the island and Hagrid visiting them there. So having him all excited about his letter at midnight so that he finds out his father's infidelity is dumb and stretching things to fit canon.

In canon the letter arrived a week or so before his birthday. So Harry and his twin would have woken up in the morning on that day a week before their birthday to find their Hogwarts invite. No drama, sorry.

I do like the idea of an ailing and coma ridden Lily who sacrificed herself for her sons. It's very noble and fits my idea of Harry's parents. It's just that in this fic, James didn't die when trying to divert Voldymorty. So life happens in the time after the event. That totally makes sense.

The idea of a James finding comfort in someone else's arms isn't bad, especially if Lily forced him to promise to do so if something happened to her. The resulting misunderstanding between Harry and his Father when he finds out about the tryst is a good drama point. That would definitely cause conflict between father and son.

Obviously Harry would feel that James is cheating on their mother. And that misunderstanding could last for as long as you want.

As long as you're not making James actually cheat on Lily, I wouldn't care if he was going for a gay relationship. I find gay relationships much less objectionable than cheating on your spouse. Go figure.

I do have to question the idea that Harry wants to punish his family by revealing their "skeletons in the closet" to the public. They've been raised with the knowledge of the dark families wanting them dead. So having Harry throw a hissy fit so that his dad "admits wrongdoing publicly" will basically turn his whole family into chum for the piranhas to feast on. Is Harry an idiot? And does he want his family to be attacked for the public airing of laundry?

Remember, this is a Harry that has been raised in the Wizarding world with his father, the Head of the Potter Family, and Sirius Black, the Head of the Black Family. There's no way he doesn't know about politics. Trying to shoehorn in the canon Harry Potter's behavior and reactions into this version of Wizarding!Harry Potter is just...I dunno....I just can't get behind it. It's...lacking.

I think it would be much more effective if Harry leaves because he doesn't see any progress from his father in searching for a healing for his mother. Harry thinks its cause his father already has a replacement for his mother, so he isn't trying too hard. And Harry thinks that if he's away from that environment, he can focus on researching a cure for his mother above all.

So there's plenty of room there for his twin to fall into Dumbledore's traps, er... obstacle courses! That Harry needs to save him from. And all that while Harry is estranged from the family and seeking a cure for his beloved mother.

*** Harry, in canon, is quite vindictive. So I think it's perfectly in character that (as a 13 - 14 y/o boy) he would want to publically destroy his father and godfather, consequences be damned. Which is why I had Harry sworn to secrecy so HE couldn't do it. Additionally, Harry wanting to cure his mother (and not feeling like his dad is doing enough) is an add-on to his reasoning to leave.

I really like your idea on Lily sanctioning it but there being a misunderstanding between father and son that leads to the anger. And with emotions running high they never really get to talk about it.

Also, Harry doesn't 'discover magic' when he gets his Hogwarts letter, he's just excited that he got it. Of course he already knew he was going, but he's an excited 11 y/o. And it's fanfiction, I'm already savaging canon here with this AU, making the letter come a week later is hardly world breaking.

And now that I've actively engaged with your points, putting "teh gay" in a story isn't a trap and doesn't require a warning. If you're too weak to accept two men being together, just don't read it, it's not hurting you. Got some mad homophobe vibes off of your entire comment and it's mad that you'd be that comfortable saying shit like that on here.

Yeah, you're totally right about teenagers being irrational, so I can totally see Harry spreading his family issues around in his chuunyubou phase. I'm just saying that you need to come up with a believable reason that Harry would do that kind of thing after being raised in the wizarding world.

Hey if you want to portray Harry as excitable and wanting to show off his Hogwarts letter, then you need to write it that way. My original comment was just pointing out the problems with equating your story with canon. There are a lot of differences there. So if you want to have Harry rushing with his letter to his father to show it off, there's no reason you cant' do that.

Like, I get that you don't like me raining on your parade. I knew it wouldn't be popular to criticize your ideas.

So...I hope your fic gains traction. I hope you have fun writing it.

More than anything, I know that motivation drives writing. So I'm sorry if I ruined your motivation with my comments. I hope you continue to write bigger and better things! Good luck!

****** Oh Really? It was my mistake?

They imagined a world where Harry never went to the Dursleys and lived with his father, brother, and uncle padfoot. And yet they still hit the same plot points as the canon version where he lived with the Dursleys. So I was pointing out how wrong it was to graft canon events onto their reimagined world.

If you want to reimagine a world where things go different, like Fanfiction, then you need to adjust how the timeline goes. If you're just going to make it the same as canon despite all the differences, then...

Fuck it. I'm not going to pedantically explain it. If you're so bothered to misunderstand my points, then you're obviously going to misunderstand any explanation I give. Whatever. Piss off.

***** I'm not implying that, but if that is how you interpret it I do apologise. I am bi myself.

I was drawing from a stereotype/trope of healthy spouses cheating on their ill/disabled other halves. I only picked Sirius because he is:

A: the closest to James after Lily.

And,

B: it would come with potential drama/fallout in 1990's magical Britain where (in this story at least) even Albus Dumbledore cannot be open about his sexuality.

In the planning of this fic, I wanted to explore Harry, Charles and James as three distinct narrators. Although the main focus is on Harry, there would be Charles (in the middle of a family conflict as well as the Voldemort storyline) and James (coming to terms with his sexuality and the guilt and fear he feels for going through with it in such a hateful society).

I also am undecided on whether I want to use the idea of Lily encouraging James's relationship with Sirius, but I am leaning towards it (just need to rework some things in the plans of the story in regards to Harry and James). I don't ever like playing tropes straight, so it works as I don't want James to ACTUALLY cheat on Lily as I don't believe he ever would.

I want there to be a more than meets the eye bit to the story afterall.

As long as Charles don't end up too insufferable I would love to see his side of a story and how he receives his brother and father conflict. Same to Harry being too angsty and stupid or James being the Worst Father of the Year.

They all are human and realistic description would go a long way for any story. To have their character flaws while being likeable. It would be interesting to read story like that when you cannot clearly choose a side Cuz the dillemas of characters are shown in a way that makes you unable to make judgment without being totally hypocritical about it :D
