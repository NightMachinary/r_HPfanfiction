:END:
Hi!

I am desperately searching for a fic. I only remember one chapter where Lupin and Severus seem to be fighting over Wolfsbane, Sirius intervenes and an accident happens. It turns out they fought because Lupin did not want to take money from Snape. Afterwards Snape is afraid he will transform into a werewolf and orders Sirius to shackle him in the dungeon. Sirius is also keeping his wand. I think he also asks him for tea and cigarettes (???).

I think it is a HG/SS story and it should be quite old.


** I also remember that Hermione is away at that time. When it turns out that Severus is fine, most Order member are celebrating with Lupin since he was feeling guilty about potentially having turned Snape in a werewolf. Snape is bitter about nobody caring about him

** After searching all of the saved bookmarks, I finally found it. My description was far from helpful...

The fic is called Falling Further In
