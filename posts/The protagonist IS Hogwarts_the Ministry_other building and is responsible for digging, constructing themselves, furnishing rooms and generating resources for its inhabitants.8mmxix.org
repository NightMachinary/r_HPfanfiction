So yeah, a few days ago I inexplicably found a genre of 'dungeon fics', where some character or other is incarnated as a dungeon and sets about building themselves for adventurers. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/threadmarks?category_id=1][Like this one]], and [[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10881/dungeon-heart][like this one]].

So I'm wondering, has anyone done a fic like this for Harry Potter? A canon character or crossover character finds that they're now Hogwarts the building, and have to manage rooms, install secret entrances, set up their statuary and paintings to detect and apprehend invading dark wizards, with the help of their loyal army of minions, the house-elves?

*** Hee-hee. Technically it /is/ intelligent Hogwarts, so it's halfway there.

Not the weirdest pairing I've ever seen, either. There was this time with Koreanhamster666 and ksense2016...
