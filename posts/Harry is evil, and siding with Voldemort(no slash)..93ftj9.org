Has anyone got any stories where Harry is a death eater, or equal to Voldemort. No slash please, and I would rather it if Harry is relatively powerful, and maybe knows wandless magic(it is not a requirement though). Also I want a story that is complete, as in no further plans, or sequels. It can be a part of a series, but the series has to be complete.

I've read enough "complete" stories only to be dissapointed when they are only part of a series, and it was not mentioned until the end, and has been abandoned for months to years. I'm not trying to bash on writers, but the least they could do is put at the beginning that it's only the first, or second part of a series. It really does a disservice to their fans, and if your not posting on fanfic so others can enjoy it, then why are you posting it at all.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** Hm...is it really evil if you side with the BGs to end a war sooner (less casualties, I mean who do you really need to take out to win the war for Voldemort? Dumbledore, Moody, Sirius and maybe Kingsley - Ron, Hermione and the Weasleys might not even fight if those are dead and Harry declares to be on the other side! But with those people gone the good side doesn't have any leaders left (Hermione and Ron can't run the DA for example because they are quite unpopular and aren't celebrities like Harry! No DA, no final battle (the adults would fail miserably without the DA backing them up!))...hell, Harry giving an interview to the Prophet detailing how the wiz-world in general and Dumbledore especially screwed him over? You bet many people would lay down their arms (well: Stop fighting, I bet they would not turn in their wands!))
