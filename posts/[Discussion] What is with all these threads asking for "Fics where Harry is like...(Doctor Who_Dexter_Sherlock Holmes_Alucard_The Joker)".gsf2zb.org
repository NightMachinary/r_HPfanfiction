I see them all the time and I mean I just have got to say like it makes me wonder...Why don't you just write a story with that actual character as the main character in the Harry Potter universe?! It seems like you REALLY just want to actually do that! Or SHOULD do that! I don't know! Instead of just trying to OC insert the hell out of Harry... :( Like trying to cram a hexagon into a circle or something.


** Because reading a HP fic where Harry isn't the main character feels dirty, pretty much.

*** Someone put it into words omg

That's exactly it. I have wondered the same thing OP asked many times, and i noticed that even stories where harry's only relation to canon!harry is their shared name, its easier for me to read those than say the exact same story but with original characters. It's really weird but it is what it is I guess
