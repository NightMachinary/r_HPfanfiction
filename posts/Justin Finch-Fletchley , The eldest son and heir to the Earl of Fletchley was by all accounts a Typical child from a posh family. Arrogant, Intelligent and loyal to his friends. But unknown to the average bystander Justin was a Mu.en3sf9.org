He was a young Muggleborn aristocrat about to enter a world of Magic and pompous purebloods that wouldn't know a true aristocrat if they walked up and bit them on the ass .

As Viscount Finchmont , Heir to the Earl of Fletchley , Justin makes it his personal mission to troll the hell out of Draco Malfoy and the bigots at Hogwarts.

The purebloods don't know what to make of the posh Muggleborn with a Signet ring ,a family crest, and blood so blue it makes The Queen look like a common blacksmith.

Justin Finch-Fletchley together with Harry Potter , Hermione Granger and the other Muggleborns troll the hell out of the purebloods and drive the bigots up the wall by being more aristocratic then Malfoy could ever hope to be. ( they wear boaters to cross the black lake ).

( Before you downvote me into Oblivion this is Crack with and extra side of Trolling in the extreme , pinky fingers out people, Its time to out Aristocrat the purebloods to the point of the ridiculous)

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][The Perils of Innocence]] (last updated: 2017) has a bit like this. The Finch-Fletchleys are usually pretty personable, but they get /very/ posh when the Malfoys start posturing.

#+begin_quote
  The boy glanced at them, taking in their street clothes, and looked up at his father to comment loudly, "Father, what kind of person would purchase an owl and not have a place for it to roost?"

  The father answered in a drawl, swinging his cane carelessly. "That would be a Muggleborn, Draco."

  The boy looked over at them, a sneer on his face. But even as Harry, Dean, and Terry straightened and scowled, Justin spoke up in his most aristocratic tone, "And just who are you?"

  --------------

  Hermione had been taken aback by the fair-haired man and boy delivering their cutting remarks, remembering similar derision in school from the popular girls. She was even more surprised at Justin's response. The amiable boy they had begun to know in the last week was acting every inch to the manor born. The look on his face suggested that he had discovered something disagreeable on the sole of his shoe.

  His expression was mirrored by the man, who tightened his grip on his cane. The boy stared, open-mouthed, for a moment, before shooting back, "How dare you!"

  Justin snorted. "How dare I? I wasn't the one making ignorant remarks in the hearing of those I intended to insult."

  "Ignorant? You're one to talk, you mu---"

  The man gripped the boy's shoulder to stop him, then looked the entire group over before fastening onto Justin's father. With condescension dripping from his voice, he said, "To answer your son's rather rude question, I am Lucius Malfoy. This is my son, Draco. And yourselves, gentlemen?"

  Mr Finch-Fletchley pushed his glasses up his nose after looking them over. "Malfoy? That's an unfamiliar surname. How long have you lived in Britain?"

  Hermione exchanged a wide-eyed glance with Harry, sensing the tension building between the adults.

  "Our family has been part of wizarding society since the fifteenth century."

  "Ah, that explains it twice." Mr. Finch-Fletchley looked down at Justin and laid one hand on his shoulder.

  "Twice?"

  "Yes. First, of course, you're newcomers. Most of the truly notable blood can be traced back to at least the Anarchy, if not before the Norman invasion. And second, you're only important in here." He waved vaguely at the street. "Not where it matters."

***** The civil war that followed the death of Henry I. He only had a daughter to succeed him, and the Norman aristocracy weren't having that so a lot of them sided with his nephew. The resulting mayhem dragged in the whole of England and the Duchy of Normandy, lasted eighteen years, and ended with Henry I's nephew Stephen on the throne but with his grandson by his daughter as designated successor. He went on to be Henry II, the chap responsible for the Common Law being a thing.

This is the simplified-for-reddit-comment version, of course. Going into detail is best done at textbook length, it was the kind of unholy slaughter and frenzy of duplicitous politics that makes George R R Martin look like Enid Blyton.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

"Those filthy mudbloods, look at him using a soup spoon for his cereal, peasants."

The idea of the fic is to out posh the posh, it is linked to tge racism because the poshness exists in the first place to seperate high society from the lower class and the muggleborns are going to become the higher society by being more posh than the posh purebloods.

This is a popular piece of fanon that is pretty much contrary to the canon. Pureblood supremacy isn't directly linked to poshness. Purebloods aren't the high society, they come from different classes. The Gaunts are basically trailer trash with zero manners, but they firmly believe in their superiority, that all Muggles are vermin. They see wealthy and posh Riddles every day, and it does exactly nothing to change their mind. The only 'old money' pureblood families we see are the Blacks and maaaybe the Malfoys, but the latter act too much like nouveau riche.

In canon, the Potters are the actual noveau riche ones considering that Harry's grandfather, Fleamont Potter, made his wealth through Sleekeazy's Hair Potion. I've always wanted to see a fic using that canon backstory instead of heir to all noble houses Potter. James as heir to a cosmetics company would be a lot more fun.

** As much as I usually dislike the whole 'good aristocracy' thing (Weber likes to use it in his books to highlight the perils of a democratic bread and circus state), it would be neat to have Draco respond to someone saying 'you shouldn't associate with him, he is from the wrong type of family'.

After all, to old blue bloods, what is less appealing than new money? It is the thing poor nobles marry into when they mismanage their family fortune, selling off their bloodline to some up and coming merchant/tycoon that wants nobility tied to their name.

​

"But" says Malfoy, "Why would you associate with them?"

​

But you see, they are the right sorts. A war hero? That is entirely proper to rub elbows with. After all, anyone who is a war hero got there by fighting to preserve the system they are rightly on top of. Most likely under a noble officer.

Or Dentists. It is good to associate with Men of science and healing. Usually by being on the board of hospitals and institutions. After all, they keep the population healthy, which is what every good ruling aristocrat wants. And there is a certain prestige of having better and smarter men of science than the other aristocrats.
