I'd prefer them to be about Hermione, but I'd also prefer them not to be a vehicle for romance with either Draco or Blaise, which is what most pureblood!Hermione fics consist of (including most of the ones in old threads on this subject. Yes, I searched first).

I suppose this is really a combination of my desire for fic that deals with pureblood politics and etiquette and the fact that Hermione is the character I find most enjoyable to read.

Complete preferred but not necessary.


** While I kind of like the premise, it feels like it demeans the muggleborn / pureblood issue.

*** It doesn't have to demean it, it can just be a way to explore it and give it more depth, making it less black and white.

** I suppose you've read Contemplations of Birth?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1206067/1/Contemplations-of-Birth]]

If so, are there any you can recommend? I too really enjoy reading about pureblood politics and etiquette.

*** I read a fic recently that has a lot of the pureblood etiquette and politics and such in it. It was a SSHG with a muggleborn Hermione, so if that's not your cup of tea, you should probably pass on this one. Do you want other recs on fics with pureblood etiquette/traditions, or do you prefer them to have a secretly-a-pureblood!Hermione? The fics that I'm thinking of don't have Hermione as a pureblood.

*** I tried this, and I just couldn't push through the terrible Snape characterisation. That, combined with the 'we have to consummate the marriage because /magic/' and the sudden 'gosh i never knew what i was missing by not having sex!!' put me off.

Also, the dialogue is severely lacking in commas.

(It has a lot of potential, though.)

** Check out /In Bad Faith/

linkffn(In Bad Faith by Slayer Anderson)

AU. It follows Draco's younger sister. Good portrayal of how pureblood families would interact and what the politics would look like. It humanizes them fairly well. Elaborates slightly on the HP system of magic, but not to much, which makes it fresh without being obnoxious (like those fics where Harry pics up unheard of spell casting or rune magic from Asia that is waaayyy better then using a wand).

  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]

** She isn't exactly a pureblood, as she was still born muggleborn, but she was spelled to be a pureblood. There's plenty of pureblood politics/etiquette, but the fic is a WIP. It was last updated in November and what is there is rather short, but it was an excellent read. Linkffn(Desperate Measures by MaryRoyale)

/Edit/: At this point in the story, there is no set pairing, but I don't think it will be Draco or Blaise.

  Cassiopeia Black wasn't the sort who was willing to just sit idly by while her House fell down around her. When Cassiopeia is given a Muggleborn witch orphaned by Death Eaters, she uses magical adoption to make the baby a true Black. Pureblood!Hermione. Slytherin!Hermione.
