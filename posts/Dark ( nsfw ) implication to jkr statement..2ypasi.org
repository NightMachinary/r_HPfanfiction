JK Rowling has stated in many interviews that magic is a dominant genetic trait. For many people it doesn't make much sense and for a while i pretty much agreed , how do you explain muggleborns and squibs? If it would be dominant you wouldn't have muggleborns but if it were recessive you would have a LOT more squibs (since 2 half bloods would have 1 in 4 chance to have non magical offspring).

And then a sort of dark epiphany struck me : most of the muggleborns aren't muggleborns , they are the product of a non-consensual sex. It's horrible and i agree but it makes sense , with all the wizzarding superiority crap lurking in the background of wizzarding society and a spell that can /edit memories/ rape is not hard at all.

tl;dr *muggleborns might be the outcome of wizzard on muggle rape*

Now you ask , what about squibs? Well the answer might be easly a snp (single nucleotide polymorphism) that makes the gene unable to do work. They are rare indeed that's why squibs are not so common and it explain why they can see magical places but they cannot do magic , not the whole gene is void but just the "magic enabler" part , the "receiver" part might still be active.

I know it's a dark idea , but in a real world context it make sense , muggles are not protected by aurors and the pre-hp era was not kind times. It might explain also the social stigma of *mud*bloods because purebloods truly know their origin but they do not speak of it.


** I'm pretty sure rape isn't required to explain the muggleborn stigma.

The idea isn't without merit (and surely many muggleborns are the result of such unions), but it doesn't entirely explain the existence of true 'muggleborns' (i.e. genetic children of muggle parents) who must also exist.

For instance, I think someone might have noticed all muggleborns were conceived this way. Imagine a black haired man rapes a blonde woman, whose husband is similarly colored? They might become suspicious, and /check/, and that single confirmation would be all that is required to reveal this 'conspiracy'.

It's much simpler to simply say that magic is a recessive trait, or else triggered by some magical effect that follows rules we do not know, and that Joan Rowling hasn't thought much about genetics. Which is characteristic of her, considering how she has previously stated that Hogwarts has 1000 students.

Memories can not only be erased but also modified. The rapist could leave the victim thinking they'd had sex with some imaginary other person. Personally I find it extremely disturbing how casually memory charms are treated in canon. I think they're as deserving of the term Unforgiveable as the killing curse.

We don't know what happened with Sirius. We do know that Snape stalked the Marauders trying to get them into trouble and the fact he wasn't expelled hints at there being more too it like an offhand comment or insult.

As for Harry, Draco was trying to cruciate him and he didn't know what the spell did.

***** Probably best explanation I ever saw of the Sirius/Snape/Werewolf bit, that explains why Sirius ISN'T a horrible person was:

Snape was pretending to know more then he did, in an attempt to learn more. Sirius fell for it, and believed Snape already knew Remus was a werewolf. Sirius then dared him to follow him into the shrieking shack, in much the same way you might dare someone to jump off a cliff. It's not meant to be taken seriously.

If someone dares you to jump off a cliff, and you are stupid enough to do so, you can't defend your actions with "He dared me to do it!".

Of course, Snape DIDN'T know, and there was no way in hell Sirius was going to admit to his friends that he fell for Snapes lies. Dumbeldore found out what happened via legilimency and made the problem go away.

House elves seem like they're enslaved [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_(folklore)][brownies]]. In which case it would be normal for them to help out in a household, but in the folklore they're completely independent creatures and rarely interact with humans, certainly aren't owned by humans.

****** I see Occlumency as the equivalent of a "how to beat a lie detector with magic" thing - if you can resist Legilimency, then in all likelihood you are able to resist Veritaserum and the Imperius. Whatever cannot be verified independently cannot be trusted as long as Occlumency exists short of using unbreakable vows to swear in witnesses. With the Wizengamot obviously a political organization, that makes impartial judgment effectively impossible. The jury system is far superior to a bunch of politicians in control of both law and judgment without a way to get to the truth (/cough/Lucius Malfoy/cough/). Also, to learn it you need to be exposed to Legilimency, so there is that.

With the magical legal system as shabby as it is, then an Occlumens has a free pass to do whatever he wants as long as there are no witnesses (left alive) to see it.

*** I think that the ammount of paranoia of an average person isn't high enought to justify random parental testing. Obviously it would happen if a woman became pregnant without recollection of any intercourse but if someone is on a normal relationship and they become pregnant and the relationship is average and stable i doubt people would go out of their way making paternity tests for even slighly major differences. It would be justified in some way like " oh yeah my granfader's aunt had the same cheekbone it must have skipped generation" , the human brain is paranoid but /not so much/ .

It would be simpler but Her Highness says otherwise. Honestly , i like trying to uncover as much canon worldbuilidng as i can , my evidence is jkr and the only thing i have is inference and deduction.

It's not a "conspiracy" , it's an horrible behaviour of some twisted immoral wizzard. If you think about it you need just arround 4-5 people to account for the ammount of muggleborns in every given year. And given the fact that there was a bloody civil war going on it doesn't ease the suspicions.

From a purely genetical point of view the likelyhood of a trait spontaneously manifesting itself and being the same of another isolated subset of popolation is ridiculously unlikely.

Imho given the numbers it's also unlikely that the gene is recessive. If it were the wizzarding population would have tons more muggleborns than it has : think about the explosion in population of the 20th century it would have spread the recessive gene like wildfire. The purebloods wouldn't be the canon 15% but way less.

** I believe JKR suggested that magic was a 'dominant trait' in a literary sense, not genetic. In JKR-speak, that means kids of a wizard or witch mated with anything else they can make a baby from are wizards/witches, unless they're both pureblood in which case inbreeding gives a chance for squibs. Squibs are sent off to be muggles, but enough squib-grandkids marry other squib-grandkids and they'll sometimes make a wizard.

Magic is the recessive gene, muggle is the dominant which would explain muggleborns because both parents would have to be a carrier of the magic gene. E.g Lily and Petunia, there was only a 25% chance that they'd be magical. Purebloods will have a 100% chance of having magical babies because both parents genes would be only recessive. Squibs are squibs due to a genetic mutation.

**** Yes , pretty interesting read and it could explain many things. Still i think the same reasoning of the issues the wizzarding world would have with the rapid population growth of the 20th century would stay.

From the 1800 to the 1980s the population quintuples , which means that on average even the number of muggleborn should quintuple. The influx on the wizzarding population would be /massive/ since it's implied that it's a rather stable population (families like our red headed friends are exeptionally rare and big)

So yes , from a geneticaly standpoint it makes sense but from the population one it doesn't. Hogwarts should have a lot more muggleborns it has for that theory to be true.

** Dominant trait does not necessarily mean that a person is guaranteed to be a wizard if a parent is. I wonder if you're thinking of high school bio genetics, where the most complex study of genomics is a 4x4 Punnet square. I have always assumed that magic operates in multiple genes- you have to "turn on" a certain number of genes in the set in order to get magic- and its dominance ensures that kids with one magical parent are usually magical. If a squib shows up, it's because the parents have a sufficient number of recessive, non magical alleles that allow for the rare occurrence of a non-magical phenotype. Muggleborns operate similarly- the muggle parents have a small number of dominant alleles that will on occasion result in a magical child, but are not enough to cause a magical phenotype in either parent.

Of course, this would mean that the pureblood are right to a small extent- you have to have a certain amount of magical heritage in your bloodline in order to keep producing magical heirs. But going all consanguineous with your marriages like the Black family will also eventually cause normal, human inbreeding problems over generations.

*** I thought about it too , but a non-mendelian origin of magic doesn't make much sense. The reason is simple : evolution. A gene evolves and sticks to a population if it gives a benefit otherwise it's "washed out" and it's not refined by natural selections. This means that for magic to be non-mendelian the magical gene while non active needs to give some kind of benefit , which form the few information we have from canon it seems it's not the case. A multi-gene approach fails from an evolutionary prospective , it's way more unlikely than a single gene approach.

Obviously we could pull stuff out of our asses and claim it might be an envoirmental factor (like "magic radiation") , or just claim it's *magic* , but from a scientific prospective those are not satisfactory explanations because they are not backed by any evidence.
