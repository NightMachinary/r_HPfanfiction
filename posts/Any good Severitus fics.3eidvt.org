Saw a thread about it, got interested again. I've read a lot of them, but it's been a while. Any suggestions?

Severitus -- Snape is or becomes Harry's father


** If you've already read a bunch of them then you've probably read these, but just in case:

linkAo3(A Year Like None Other)\\
linkffn(Resonance)\\
linkffn(Blood Magic)

These are really the only "good" ones I've been able to find, I also would love some more links if anyone has them.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  #+begin_example
      When starting this, please keep in mind that A Year Like None Other was started long before HBP came out\. It was always my intention to write an alternate 6th year and when the canon Year 6 was published, it meant that my own little saga seriously diverged from canon\. So reading this, imagine that Years 1\-5 did occur, but nothing we discover from HBP and DH is necessarily true this time around\.The most important divergences are these: In this universe, Snape \*is\* a pureblood and his father's name was Hostilian \(which tells you a lot all by itself\)\. Dumbledore never died \-\- and certainly not at Snape's hand\!   This story is completely finished and is about 760,000 words long\. It took me a while to get it all posted here at AO3, but I am very happy to report that the whole thing is now online for your \(hopefully\) intense enjoyment\!And now, on with the show, which begins with A Year Like None Other \(completed\), continues on into A Summer Like None Other \(also completed\) and wraps up with A Family Like None Other, a Year 7 novel that I am still writing\.

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]
