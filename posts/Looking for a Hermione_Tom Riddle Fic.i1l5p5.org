:END:
I'm looking all through AO3 and I cannot seem to find what I'm looking for.

What I remember about the fanfiction was that immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione was forced to be bound to Voldemort to imprison him, and because Hermione was a virgin, she was the only one who could be bound this way. As the story goes on, Voldemort gets a potion to turn him back into a human person and he slowly becomes a "decent" person due to sharing his soul with Hermione. And Hermione hates the ministry now because of what they did to her.

Any one know where I can find this?
