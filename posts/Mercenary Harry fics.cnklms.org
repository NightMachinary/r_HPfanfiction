I have just re-read Deprived and really want some more mercenary Harry action. Anyone know any?


** Does linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure) count? Thats pretty much where the story ends up later on and in sequel.

***** Mhh, probably a victim of time, as most other old fanfics, as people don't realize that the fic is not using some trope, those fics created those tropes and used them for the first time.

But in 2006 it was a huge hit with most everybody. Was recced so often on the fictionalley "Help! I'm looking for..." forum that a thread without it was hard to find. That's why I tried to get into it.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

Probably one of my favourite fanfics, it's incomplete as of yet but i still hold out some hope.

*** Sorry to say this, but MB is unlikely to get finished. I'm at a point in my life where free time is pretty limited and I'm more interested in trying my hand at writing original fiction. Since the genre I want to go into is proper swords and staves fantasy, any fanfiction I devote time to will reflect that, a la the witcher crossover I'm writing and a dark fantasy MOD!Harry fic I've been writing on and off for the past few months. Maybe one day I'll get the bitten by the bug to finish MB and The King of Limbs, so I won't say never, but at the moment it's fairly unlikely.

***** Yeah, some of my favourite memories come from writing MB, mostly because I could write about anything I fancied at the time? Devoting an entire chapter to the punchline of Ron and Hermione filming a porno over Schindler's List? Why not. Harry and Hermione getting drunk and Birmingham and yelling at each other until they were friends again? Sure. Writing a long, meandering conversation about how Harry's a hipster? Fantastic. And, to be honest, I sort of miss writing in first person POV, because it allowed me to get away with way more in prose than I could in The Lesser Kindness, for instance.

Also, MB happens to be the recipient for quite possibly the loveliest review I've ever received, so there's always a special place in my heart for it. Unfortunately, reality gets in the way. So, at the moment, all I'm looking to continue updating is TLK. And if you're interested, a fic called The Ashen Crown will be coming out some time in the next few months, which is heavily inspired by everything from Elric to Dark Souls, so be on the lookout for that if it appeals to you.

  What was the deal with Tracey?
#+end_quote

Nothing much in particular. She was an alternate take on how Daphne and Tracey are included in fics. Instead of Daphne being the important one, Tracey is, and they both hate each other's guts rather than being best friends. There was also some sort of commentary in there about how Tracey essentially usurps Ron's role in Harry's professional life and how that was supposed to mirror adulthood getting in the way of our childhood friendships, but I never really got far enough to explore it with any depth.

I won't name names per se, but it's on the first page of reviews for the fic.

******* MB would have largely been about the conflict with the group Hannah works for spiraling out of control. Since James Bond was a huge inspiration for the fic, you could think of them being something along the lines of SPECTRE. All of this would be set against the backdrop of Harry maturing and finding some semblance of inner peace in being a father and "husband" with regards to the unconventional family unit he develops with Hermione and Lauren. His friendship with Ron would be further explored in the context of constant redefinition because it is a story inherently about growing up and the difficulty that poses between two childhood best friends. I don't think I've ever settled on a definitive ending for the story because it was really a long way off, but I imagine it would be a happy one.

Idol God was more of an experiment rather than a fully-fleshed idea, were I writing it now, there would be several changes I'd make even to the first two chapters. It was essentially supposed to be an alternate take on the War taking place when the trio were adults. The real draw was writing the characters as they would be without each other's influence on each other, which is largely the reason why Hermione is kind of a bitch, because it was supposed to be a take on her not having Ron and Harry around to be her friends and help her develop social skills. Harry and Ron also were planned to have issues related to their own stunted growth, but again I never got far enough to flesh it out. As for the story itself, it would be the conflict with Voldemort, but dealing with older, more ruthless characters and a much heavier urban fantasy tone with sprinklings of weird fiction here and there.
