Except, he's not just one Weasley. He's ALL the Weasleys. See, each time you travel back, you create another iteration of yourself. And when you travel back in time a lot, you get a lot of selves.


** He has some Bill, Percy and twins to him... But not as much Ginny.

*** What is Ginnys character though? In my opinion Ginny did not get enough screentime in neither the book or the movies. All i remember from Ginnys character arc are:

1-)Posessed by Riddles Diary

2-)Has a Crush on Harry

3-)Temperemental like Ron

4-)Batbogey Hex

5-)Quidditch

**** Ginny is confident, blunt and with small patience for overcomplications. Dumbledore is confident, yet not the other two.
