Basically goes through the veil to the past like 200 to 300 years back. He's a sheriff or something like that something I specifically remember he can talk to dead people and bring them to the world of living for short periods of time.i also remember him not being on good terms with his mother. He's called a spirit walker or something like that.


** I found it the instant I finished this. It's the fanfic called West of Here

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
