Most fics that I've read stop after Hogwarts, but I would like to observe the normal life of a Hogwarts graduate.

Their work, their relationships, how they visit their family for Christmas, etc. And of course the daily magical life.

Thanks!


** linkffn(Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19) linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian)

 

both are top notch writers, could be called slice of life fics, but there is mystery and tiny bit of action as part of the plot in Drakeshaugh. It is post war, canon compliant trying to show the years before the epilogue. Grow young is similar but followong what happens of a central character dies

 

Edit: frequently recommend oneshot linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair)

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** linkffn(6573490)

If you don't mind slash (and age difference), this is a really cute story that's basically just that, normal everyday not-plot-heavy post-Hogwarts life for Harry. Has a sequel too if you enjoy it.

  A senile shop visitor sets Harry up with her reclusive son as a shop competition between Harry and the Weasleys rages, and love blossoms around. Postwar, ignores HP7, SSHP. Inspired by too many Love Actually viewings.
