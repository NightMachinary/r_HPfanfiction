  [[http://meninblack.wikia.com/wiki/The_Head_Trip_Syndrome][One episode]] of the MiB dealt with a crazed alien enthusiast finding a way to time-travel and going back to send the founding members of the eponymous organization to a dimensional limbo. A photo displaying the meeting between the founders and a group of aliens has each human disappearing one by one, and everyone instantly forgets them except Jay, who's gained Ripple Effect-Proof Memory via some Alien Phlebotinum which is also slowly killing him. Additionally, all the founders' contributions disappear as well, such as all the medical devices invented by Agent D. By the time only K is left, MiB is reduced to a tiny organization operating out of the back of a store.

  In the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext][/Thursday Next series,/]] starting in /Lost In A Good Book/, Thursday's husband Landen Parke-Laine gets erased from history through time travel, despite attempts to stop this. The Chronoguard then hold his existence hostage unless Thursday does a task for them.

  #+begin_quote
    This has already happened to Thursday's father, although because he's an experienced Chronoguard himself, this doesn't prevent him popping up on occasion to give Thursday advice. They've wiped him from history, but they haven't actually stopped him existing yet (although he now has no first name). Don't think about this too hard, and especially don't wonder how Thursday can exist.

    At one point, there is a support group for people with family members who have been Ret Goned. Then some of the Ret Goned are retroactively de-Ret Goned. The former support group members go to the remaining support group to thank them for their support during the Ret Gone period, but because the de-RetGoning was retroactive, the support group don't recognize them and think they're being mocked.

A number of the official comics set during the first four seasons have Dawn as a character, with notes attached saying, in effect, "Yeah, she didn't exist back then, but everyone remembers her being there, so..."

I remember it had a super-dramatic tone and it was heavy on the Harry/Hermione dialogue, both of them harping on why they were so good together, how the Weasleys were the scum of the earth and how hurt they had been by various people/situations. Still despite all that, it was pretty well written.
