*** Do you plan to update it regularly? I have had far too many heartbreaks with abandoned fics, even though I really want to check this one out.

  Six year old Harry Potter's dream comes true: he's taken away from his abusive relatives, and into the care of a young woman, Asha Lorr. He gets his own room, toys, a seat at the dinner table - a whole wonderful new life. And a wonderful new mom too. But what is the reality of this new life when it's not being looked out upon from inside the starry eyes of the child?
