I just started reading this. I really liked the first chapter. It was cool watching Harry learn and use fairly interesting new magic and I always like a good mentor Dumbledore. However then I kept reading and I've disliked everything since.

I'm not a big fan of Harry ditching Ron and Hermione as friends. I don't like annoying etiquette and politics being super central to the Wizarding world even for fourteen years olds. Just those would probably be fine, but I especially hated the Yule Ball chapter. Suddenly Harry is both super suave and a raging pervert, wtf.

So my question is this, if that's what I liked and disliked should I give up and stop reading now or continue with it? I did like the authors Naruto fic, even though it did make the Naruto world more grimdark than I prefer IIRC(it's been a while so I don't quite remember it super clearly), and I still haven't gotten around to reading the sequels.


** I loved that fic. But if these things aren't your cup of tea maybe it's better to abandon the fic. It's not going to change as you progress further.

** If I remember correctly, I've abandoned the story after some nameless Death Eater defeated Harry after basically an entire arc of training and preparing. It may sound silly but that was the final straw for me. I started liking the story less and less after the fourth year though.
