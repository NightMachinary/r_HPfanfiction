Like the title says, any fic (preferably on FFN or AO3) that /invented/ a trope. No slash or smut. Thanks :)

And Happy New Year!


** Thats tricky to answer. See, the thing is that most tropes in HP fanfiction are in-and-of-themselves not unique to the fandom. Things like harems, time-travel, and magical cores are honestly endemic in most fandoms, as people arrive at those near universally in fics due to fanfiction ultimately being born from wish-fulfillment interests. That makes saying this or that fic /invented/ a trope a lot more in a gray area. Additionally, most of the fics that you are actually looking for are in fact not on FFN or ao3. If you don't know the history and breadth of the fandom, go look up Portkey.org for instance.

That said, here are a few specific fics I can think of that are the most prominent for establishing certain HP-specific tropes:

- linkffn(Delenda Est): this was not the first fic depicting an Harry/Bellatrix pairing, but it was the fic that popularized the idea beyond pure smut.
- linkffn(Help of a Seer): speculation over Luna being a seer pre-dates this fic, but this one firmly embraced and arguably popularized the idea of her being able to 'see things.'
- linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure): I would argue this fic popularized several things in the HP fandom, but most popularly the idea of Ancient Runes being used in magical protections, spell-chaining, Harry as a panther animagus, and possibly throwing blasting curses around like confetti.
- The various fics by James Spookie are probably what made the Harry/Daphne pairing really take off about a decade ago (along with the whole forced marraige trope too). To be fair, these existed beforehand, but there was a surge in popularity following the author's fairly generic romance fics.
- linkffn(A Shattered Prophecy): this is the fic that allegedly the much more famous 'The Darkness Within' (not going to link it) ripped off that set the trend for Harry being abducted and raised by Voldemort. Dark Harry always existed, but again this fic changed how stories were written afterwards in that genre.
- linkffn(The Seventh Horcrux by melindaleo): this fic has an interesting history, but it was a pre-Deathly Hallows fic that basically predicted most of the major plot points of Deathly Hallows. You could (jokingly) make the case that this fic actually preempted JKR's conclusion and actually did it better, maybe even giving her some of her ideas. At the time, some people actually thought it might have been a leaked copy of the 7th book considering how canon-like most of it was written.

- the first fic to have "magical core" as something that a wizard possesses;
- the first fic to use "I swear on my (life and) magic";
- the first fic to use "so mote it be"; and
- the first fic to name Hermione's parents "Daniel" and "Emma.

Any idea what those might be?

One of the big fics from the early days. Like [[/u/XeshTrill]] said, there is no fic which invented a trope, but this one made quite a few concepts popular (unspeakables as SWAT/Navy SEALs, summer of love, training montages, OP Harry, the complexities of combat magic, Gringotts as the gate to freedom).

Like most older fics, it has not aged well, but if you skim rather than read every word, it is still enjoyable.

*** This is what I was going to recommend. This is the granddaddy Honks fic and kickstarted so many of the tropes that show up again and again in them. Tonks enlarging Harry's bed to sleep with him on practically the first day. Opening Petunia's eyes to exactly what Harry has done. “Base form” Tonks and her falling over herself once Harry says he prefers that version of her. So many fics can probably trace their lineage to this one.
