I'm pretty new to HP fan fiction and I had this idea for a character. Perhaps it could work just by changing cannon to have Bellatrix be pregnant when she tortures the Longbottoms. Oo, and maybe even the child is born in Azkaban? No matter where you go from there, the character would be interesting. The kid could be sent to either the Malfoy or Tonks families, and the interaction with Neville would be priceless.

I'm tempted to start writing this out, but I'd like to know of any stories with a similar character in it. Now that I'm thinking of it, it's probably stupid thinking there wouldn't. Anyone read some?

*** My poor Rodolphus, always being cheated on in every story with Bellatrix.

** I've read a couple with Bellatrix as the mum, it's kind of a cop-out sometimes in a sense since they are always involved in the happening of Harry and his gang. It's usually associated with some more poorly written fanfic.

I tell this to myself and anyone writing an OC for any fanfic ever, any character can be a good character no matter their circumstances (cue all powerful/knowing) . As long as they have REAL attributes, flaws, goals, and motivation then he/she can be a fleshed out character. A character that has no dynamic and remains static and flat with no progression or inner depth will always suck no matter if it's a mary-sue or anti-sue or whatever.

Here are a couple I've read, I'll leave it up to you to form an opinion on them.

Hope this helps!

** I read one with Hermione being the Lestranges child that was born in Azkaban and adopted by her muggle parents, not knowing her real heritage. Can't find the story so I guess I didn't find it all that good. It was a bit circumvoluted and boringly clich√©d and I probably gave up on reading it to the end.

** I dont wanna be a dick but dont write this. Its massively clinched, and the child is never any good. I was the same way when I just started. Dont worry you'll grow out of it. Hopefully.
