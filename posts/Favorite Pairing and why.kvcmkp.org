I wanna know why you think these pairings work. Talk about them as much as you want, I want this post to be a chance for people to discover new pairings they might not have thought of.


** Tomarry.. something about two sides of the same coin really appeals to me and I'm a sucker for time travel

** basically I love all sorts of pairings. Honks can be good. dogstar, is good. hell I love almost all the pairing. luna is cute with hermione and I am I luna harry or harry hermoine fan

I mostly find the main canon pairings need improvement when written.

I hate drarry snarry snamoine and dramoine myself.

most of those just based on the movies lol.

I basically love most pairings if age appropriate but just the above four often not my fav

*** I have a love/hate relationship with Honks. Love because when I find I good fic, I jump for joy. Hate because there never really is any good Honks fics.

**** Honks can be good or bad i agree. some of the best Characterizations of Tonks also are in pwp or just plain smut. She's a hard character to get right. Hermione, ginny, and a few characters can easily go a few ways as long as you hit certain tones

Hermione- smart, worried about harry, alittle egotical about knowlegde and passionate about something, boom hermione. lol

ginny - free spirited, good with bat booegys, and apple of some weasleys eyes as she has temper? boom ginny

Tonks, Luna and otherS? not as easy to get a decent one.

  Ronarry.

They clearly love each other a lot despite the ups and downs and if they added romance, would make a great couple imo

#+begin_quote
  Colin/Luna
#+end_quote

Bruh. Imagine how adorable Luna would be when she gets her first crush. And imagine the fluffiness of their first Hogsmeade trip together. I will sail this ship solo til the day I die

*** I like the idea of Ronarry if you have recommended fics please provide them.

As much as I love Luna, I never enjoyed Colin much. I think he has the same problem as Ginny, that being he was originally underdeveloped and I haven't read anything that makes him a more developed character. So personally I ship Luna with Hermione, it'd be cute to see Luna expanding Hermione's world view and helping her destress.

** well, really for me, I won't necessarily say I have a favourite pairing, though I do tend to gravitate towards Harry/Hermione.

for the most part, the main thing I keep in mind, is that a huge majority of the canon characters, we have little more than their name and perhaps 1 or 2 little facts about them (I mean come on, Lavender and Parvati are Hermione's dorm mates and share all the core classes with the trio, but we know next to nothing about them other than their names, and that they generally fit the "girly girl" archetype that cares at least as much about fashion and boys than anything else), so most pairings can work quite well if they're well-written.

pairings that I tend to favor generally are just well-written with plenty of character development.... Harry/Hermione and Harry/Tonks are probably the 2 I read the most, but there's been plenty of fics with Susan, Daphne, or one of the various other essentially OC females that were fantastic, gives an excuse to develop a bunch of characters outside of the core group in canon, and lets the story be "different" than just a canon re-hash.

but in general I try to keep an open mind about pairings, just about any pairing can work well if it's written well, but I tend to prefer the ones that have a good spot in canon to launch it from, whether it's Harry and Hermione when they spend all the time together without Ron training for the TWT, Tonks spending time with him at Grimmauld or talking to him while she's on "guard" duty at Privet drive or whatever.

** Pretty much any Harry centric ship, with the exception of Harry/Hermione or any m/m slash. I couldn't tell you exactly why I don't like harmony, maybe its because I identify too much with both characters that it feels weird, maybe i just like the platonic dynamic they have in canon. I think for the most part its reactionary to Harmony zealots, e.g. the number of times I've read ‘Harry had always been in love with Hermione' coming out of left field in a non harmony story is frankly weird.

I like Harry/OC ships best because you can be really creative with the characters you make, though good ones are really few and far between. Favourites include Daphne Greengrass, for all intents and purposes an OC, Kalliandra Kaylens in ‘Eclipse of the Sky' and Abigail in ‘Grow Young with Me'

Not a ship per se, but I found the ‘romance' subplot in ‘Inspected by No. 13' to be kind of cute and charming in its own way, I've kind of waned more of it ever since

** Harry/Hermione all the way. I just think if JK hadn't dumbed Harry down a bit to make Hermione seem smarter, the two of them could have been a great couple.

Hermione is fiercely loyal to Harry, and even that one time she went behind his back, she did it out of concern for her best friend.

Harry/Tonks is another of my favourites. The way she's usually written in the fandom, as a bubbly, happy go lucky girl with a free spirit, is a perfect foil to Harry's more brooding nature.

Harry/Fleur is yet another. I think they might relate very well to one another, and things might pick up from there.
