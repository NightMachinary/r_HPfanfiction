** I'm of the opinion to try and get permission first but if you can't get a hold of the author then just note that it is not an authorized continuation of the story.

It's not as if people will be making money off of the stories either way so as long as credit is given to the original author (and JKR of course) I really don't see an issue, but then again my morals are more flexible than some.

*** This is how I feel as well. I see this as no different than some of the earlier fanfics that I read that attempted to complete the series ahead of Rowling by picking up at the end of one of the books.

I do think it is important to provide the author's name and story though in order to provide credit.

But it is a gray area

**** Here is how I see it. Rowling gets paid in money for her writing, and us writing fanfiction doesn't take away from her pay. That's why its okay in my eyes.

Fanfiction writers however are paid in reviews and favourites and follows. That is their 'currency'. Their 'pay'. Posting fanfiction of fanfiction or attempting to complete an incomplete works takes away from that 'pay' and that's why I don't think its okay to write them without permission.

***** That's a very good point! This is quite the gray area that teeters on the line of "acceptable writer practice."

I do think that every effort should be made to contact the original author before even thinking about publishing a continuation.

** It's a bit hypocritical for a fanfiction author to be opposed to fanfiction. That said, it's their prerogative, and if said author specifically states that they'd rather there be no continuations, honoring it would be best. It's the internet, though, so good luck enforcing /that/.

**** I see where you're coming from, even if I don't agree. The fanfiction community thrives on content. As long as credit is given where credit is due, I don't necessarily see the issue - especially since a link in the continuation's AN would bring more hits and 'revenue', so to speak, to the original author.

It's different if someone reposts a fic onto another site without consulting the author at all. That's blatant copying, and definitely in bad taste.

As an author myself, if someone decided to expound upon my own writing, I'd /love/ it. It's a high form of flattery. To reiterate, if an author doesn't want this, it only takes a few words to explicitly say so.

** Given the amount of abandoned stories that I'd love to read to an end, I'm actually somewhat disappointed people don't just go ahead and continue a story more.

I'm strictly against stealing someone's work. However, I'm not against continuing work in someone else's stead. Its a small difference, but important in this discussion.

** It's a bit rude to do it without permission, but if their account/story is full on abandoned and you can't get a response for permission, go for it. As far as I'm concerned, we're already reading unauthorized works of writing in someone else's world. Taking a fanfiction authors world for use is the same as taking a normal authors world. Variance in fame doesn't make a difference.

If the original author doesn't give permission, I would take the side of the original author, but I wouldn't petition to get the continuation taken down or anything. And if they reuploaded all that was written by the previous author instead of linking, it'd be a a bit different of a situation.

** I don't like it. "But it's just fanfiction. You're doing the same in regards to canon. You're being hypocritical." I'm sure we've all participated in discussions like these before and this argument was brought up. Hell, it's the top comment itt.

The fandom is a community with specific characteristics and there's an etiquette that I think should be followed, just like in any community. The same applies to fanfiction writers. This is just one thing to do in the interest of not being more of a dick than necessary on the Internet.

But you do you. I certainly can't tell you what to do.

** As a new author that is contemplating doing something similar for a fanfic, I would like to put in my two cents.

For the fic in question, it is because the author has seemingly abandoned the series/idea in general. Plus, that author (lucifael) has a particular style that leads to ridiculousness pretty quickly (a lot of his stories are God level Harry stories). I like the premise, but I feel that it needs to be tempered with a dose of (Harry Potter) realism.

Technically I am planning a rewrites, or more accurately, a fic inspired by the basic idea. I do plan on heavily crediting the original author, as that is the right thing to do.

Yes, they do. They don't have any rights to the character or universe, but the specific wording and specific storyline belongs to them. Basically everything they originally do is theirs, and theirs alone. Any OC they come up? Theirs. Any great idea? Theirs.

Even Rowling couldn't just go ahead and publish (for example) nonjon's stories without his explicit permission. And FFN only takes the right to publish your stories on their website:

#+begin_quote
  For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Submissions. However, by submitting User Submissions to FanFiction.Net, you hereby grant FanFiction.Net a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, display, and perform the User Submissions in connection with the FanFiction.Net Website.
#+end_quote

So, basically: Your story belongs to you! Sure, you could never actually /sell/ it without a licence by Rowling, but the same is true for her.

** There is a distinction, I believe, between a fanfiction of a fanfiction and a continuation.

A fanfic of a fanfic is a derivative work based on a fanfiction. It uses some elements of the original but is essentially a new work written in its author's own words.

A continuation does not do that. Rather, a continuation purports to continue the original story, not tell an alternative one. It supplants the original author's right to tell their story as they wanted to tell it.

For that reason I am completely opposed to continuations without explicit permission.

On top of that, I feel that there are two differences between fanfiction of a fanfiction and fanfiction of an original work.

Firstly, the author of an original work has innate protection that their work is the authoritative version, the canon. No matter how many fanfics people write of it, the original author will always be the true owner of those ideas. In fanfiction this holds less. A fanfiction of a fanfiction has much the same status as the original fanfiction. The first author's authority over their universe can be supplanted by the second. This is exactly what happened with Project Dark Overlord's Shattered Prophecy and Kurinoone's The Darkness Within.

Secondly, as fanfiction writers we are all part of the same community bound together by ties of mutual interest and solidarity. As members of the same community we should seek to treat each other with a level of respect that goes above and beyond the bare minimum that is required. Thinking of it in terms of rights is I believe misplaced in any case. Even if you have the right to write a fanfic of a fanfic without permission, doing so would still be a dick move.

For those two reasons I am hesitant to endorse fanfic of a fanfic without permission, and even where I think it is acceptable I think it must be handled with great respect towards the original author's vision for their work.

*** Out of curiosity, what do you think of fanfictions that "continued" the Harry Potter story, back before all 7 books were released? There were, for instance, quite a few fics that started in ~2003 and continued Rowling's story post-OoTP the way the fanfic writer wished it to go.

These of course, are still fanfiction like any other, and are similar to some written today. But, instead of writing a different story, they seeked to finish the story before it was finished by the original author.

** Harry Potter fanfiction is a little bit special in that JK Rowling has said publicly she doesn't mind FF authors using her world and characters, almost all the other fanfiction in the world however is unauthorized and could arguably be copyright infringement. It seems unreasonable then to find more harm done by derivative metafic writers than ordinary FF writers. So long as original authors are credited I don't really care how many levels of derivation there are or if they're authorized.

** I think they should make reasonable attempts to contact the original fic author and ask- if they say no, honor that.

If they can't get a hold of them, include that it's not an authorized continuation, and properly credit the previous author.

Just as important though, be willing to take it down if the previous author resurfaces and finally gets back to you.
