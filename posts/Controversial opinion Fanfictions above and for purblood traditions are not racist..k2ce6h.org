** First of all, I doubt that thinking that "All the Muggleborns are descendant of wizards, often by a Squibb line" is not a controversial opinion on this sub. I think it's even the most popular opinion concerning the existence of Muggleborn (and pretty much the only "logical one" that does not go full mystical).

As for the existence of a "Pureblood culture and traditions". I do not think the problem lies with the idea itself (which is pretty fine, and maybe even logical), but rather how it is treated in Fanfictions. Pretty much all the fanfics I have read that talked about "Pureblood culture" ended up "whitewashing" the Death Eaters.

- "Oh Draco was mean to Harry but only because he refused to shake his hand and it's a very bad insult in /Pureblood Culture/."
- "The Malfoy are not mean to the Weasleys because they are poor and unbigoted, but because they don't respect /Pureblood Culture/ and were very disrespectfull to them first. The Weasleys are the bad guys there".
- "Oh the Death Eater are not that bad, they are just afraid to see Pureblood Culture disappear after years of forced change brought by the Old Goat Dumbledore to help his pet Mudbloods. They just decided to rise to protect themselves so they are the good guys (/even though their answer is a genocide/).
- Pureblood don't celebrate *Muggle* celebration like Christmas, they follow the Pagan Gods and celebrate All Hallows Eve, Yull or Beltane, which make them so connected with their Magic and better than others (ignore the fact that People like Draco are present during the Halloween feast of Hogwarts, that Wizards separated from Muggle during the XVIIIth century, a good Millenium after the "death" of Pagan gods, or that Pagan religions are pretty much as Muggle as Christianism)".

We are talking about fanfictions, so the fact that this is not Canon Compliant is not a problem at all, but I often find a little racism undertone is this kind of story which make me dislike them and be wary of the idea in general. I also want to add than Canon *has* a Pureblood Culture, or rather a Magical one. Wizards have their own food, their own art, their own sports . . . The fact that the Magical Culture is pretty close to the Muggle one doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Country like France and Belgium (or USA/ Canada) have a pretty similar culture, but they still have their difference and nobody would say they have the same.

I just want to add that it's basically impossible for this not to be the case, just from a genetic/historical point of view. Muggles and magicals were living together for thousands of years before the Statute of Secrecy. You only have to go back a few hundred years for pretty much everyone with European ancestry to be related. Even if the magicals mostly kept to themselves, there would still be enough crossover for everyone to have /some/ magic in their ancestry.

*** To be fair, Draco basically used the culture argument in Madame Malkins when he first met Harry:

#+begin_quote
  "I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? *They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways.* Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, I imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families."
#+end_quote

The implication is that muggle-borns shouldn't be let into Hogwarts because they---at least to the Malfoys---don't understand wizarding culture. Rowling obviously forgot this decent argument and went straight for the easy yet braindead Nazi metaphor to strip the pure-blood supremacists of any credibility, but it says a lot that an eleven year old Draco made a much more solid argument for not liking muggle-borns than any character in the HP series until Fantastic Beasts explored Grindelwald's ideals deeper. Grindelwald was a good villain because while his argument is credible, its the mass slaughter and desired enslavement of Muggles what truly make him evil. If Grindelwald's ideals were just completely wrong like the Death Eaters or Umbridge, it would make him a less threatening villain in-universe since his ideals could be effortlessly debunked.

Yes, Draco was present during the Halloween feast, but I find it hard to believe that no cultural distinction between normal pure-bloods and the blood traitors. Are we as the readers expected to believe the Weasley family is representative of normal wizards, let alone pure-blood? They're looked down by basically every pure-blood family for being Muggle lovers, not just merely tolerating Muggles---the Weasleys' view on Muggles is the complete opposite of the Malfoy family, but no less extreme.

Contrary to popular belief, the Weasleys would not be teaching Harry all about pure-blood culture---nor would Dumbledore for that matter. Why? Because they are blood traitors who reject the notion of blood purity, whereas the average wizards would have more in common with Fudge. People like Dumbledore and Arthur are radicals, whereas Fudge and Slughorn reflect a far more accurate portrayal of the average wizards---they greatly value blood purity, magical heritage and the "old ways", but also oppose discrimination against muggle-borns.

Even Hagrid says that Harry would be a powerful wizard since his mum and dad were powerful, something that couldn't be said about muggle-borns. Its an argument that would have been portrayed negatively if someone like Draco, or Lucius, or Umbridge had implied wizards with powerful magical ancestry were better at magic than those without... yet that idea is what wizarding culture runs off of.

*TL;DR: Draco made the wizarding culture argument in PS. Harry wouldn't learn pure-blood culture from anyone affiliated with Dumbledore or his ideals. The Weasleys are nowhere close to normal pure-bloods. Fudge and Slughorn are the best examples of what normal wizards---those unaffiliated with Dumbledore or Voldemort's extreme ideals--- truly believe about the wizarding world, magical heritage, or Muggles.*

#+end_quote

I give it to you, that it is a widespread opinion, but to be honest, most time's I have seen it brought up in this Sub, it was certainly followed by comments, who criticize that it is wrong to think so, because you supports the death eater opinion that magic cannot come from muggle. Which is right and wrong at the same time, since yes, that's my opinion, but the death eaters believe muggleborns steal magic.

#+begin_quote
  Pretty much all the fanfics I have read that talked about "Pureblood culture" ended up "whitewashing" the Death Eaters.
#+end_quote

Here I have to give you another point, as this really affects a large part of fanfiction, but I find that if it is, it is set up correctly, and not just in 'whitewashing' ends, one can use purblood culture to give the 'bad guys' more depth than "they're bad". Since we didn't get any real insight into the purblood culture in the books, or into society in general, outside of Hogwarts, it is up to you to create this yourself.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh Draco was mean to Harry but only because he refused to shake his hand and it's a very bad insult in Pureblood Culture."
#+end_quote

To be honest, if we assume that Draco thought Harry would know about traditions, customs, and rules; "Which would be understandable, since Harry is a public figure after all and should therefore have received some tips if you want to avoid this happening." it wouldn't be wrong for him to react like that, especially since himself likely was raised with these, and he is 11; "With 11 I could be angry with my best friend, cause he didn't remember our secret handshake, what naturally only could happen, because he wasn't as interested as I in our friendship." and you aren't exactly known for your understanding or the capability to think things through with 11. And to be honest even without purblood society, it's not hard to understand young Draco, and it's not exactly as if he alone was at fault, but all that doesn't mean, that I can't also totally say, that he was a spoiled brat, who let this children conflict deteriorate, and was an asshole to Harry and Hermione, Ron is different, because unlike young Harry and Hermione, he also antagonized Malfoy, mind you it was certainly not half as bad, as what Malfoy did, but still more than the other two. So it is not really whitewashing, even if it is often use as jumping board into mindlessly whitewashing.

"The Malfoy are not mean to the Weasleys because they are poor and unbigoted, but because they don't respect Pureblood Culture...

So far it would be logical, and above all no whitewashing, it's just one reason why they behave like that, and even with the rest of the example;

#+begin_quote
  ...and were very disrespectfull to them first.
#+end_quote

It's still no whitewashing, as even if the Malfoys behave, like they do, because of the stated reasons, it would still be wrong. So it kinda is the same like the first example, it is no whitewashing, but as your next sentence shows it is easily, and often, misused for such.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh the Death Eater are not that bad, they are just afraid to see Pureblood Culture disappear after years of forced change brought by the Old Goat Dumbledore to help his pet Mudbloods. They just decided to rise to protect themselves so they are the good guys (even though their answer is a genocide).
#+end_quote

Ok here I can't argue much, it is straight whitewashing.

#+begin_quote
  Pureblood don't celebrate Muggle celebration like Christmas, they follow the Pagan Gods and celebrate All Hallows Eve, Yull or Beltane, which make them so connected with their Magic and better than others (ignore the fact that People like Draco are present during the Halloween feast of Hogwarts, that Wizards separated from Muggle during the XVIIIth century, a good Millenium after the "death" of Pagan gods, or that Pagan religions are pretty much as Muggle as Christianism)".
#+end_quote

Ok here I can argue, that it maybe only a recent thing, that it is Halloween or Christmas, instead of Samhein (All Hallows Eve is the Christian thing as it it means the Evening before All Saint's Day) or Yule, because these two, like most christian holidays are on the same date as these pagan holidays. And that it is simply a cosmetic change; "Like saying happy holidays, instead of merry christmas, in the western world." to ease muggleborns into the new culture. As outside of Hogwarts, the only holiday we see is celebrated by the Weasleys, it's not as if we know, if more traditional families celebrate Yule.

Also to be honest, even if the Wizards separated from the Muggles in 1689, that was, if we take the year of norman conquest, plus some 50 to 100 years for the last remnants, 500 to 600 years after pagan religions ceased to exist for muggles, but for wizards? I mean if you are Wizard of Witch from a purblood family, would you switch to a religion which says, that you should kill all witches(Ex 22,17)?

But as interesting as these discussion about religion would be, the thing I wanted to state to this example is, that it simply isn't an example of whitewashing. It is a specific worldbuild you don't like.

#+begin_quote

Yeah your right, but firstly there are a tad bit greater discrepancies, even if we let the implications of magic out of the quotation. As an example house elves, most common use trope for slavery besides they are happy, is they need it to life, but why? Easy, because for us the owning of a sentient being is only possible with a explonation, for the magical it's a part of life, same with freedom of the press, the prophet as most read newspaper, shouldn't have to bow before the minister. There are many such points, and let's not forget the contempt or at least disregard, most magicals shows towards muggles. Understandable considering the past, human nature (we would not react positive if we find out) and the fact, that for a magical who lives with magic, it simply isn't possible to imagine living without, like for us with electricity.

What? Christianity didn't arrive in Britain with the Norman Conquest! Christianity was brought to Britain by the Romans, and made "official" by Emperor Augustus in around 600 AD. By the 800's, Christianity was absolutely the dominant religion in Britain.

Christianity was the official religion of Britain 400 years before the Normans arrived, and for around 1100 years before the Statute of Secrecy was brought in. There was a specific brand of "Celtic Christianity" in both GB and Ireland that merged Christian practices with the existing ones, such as dating Easter from the Spring Equinox rather than using the Hebrew calendar, monks cutting their hair in the same way as the Celtic priests had to distinguish themselves from the monks tied to the church in Rome, and indeed the monastic practice itself which was at odds with the bishop led practices in the wider Christian world and providing a link with the land and nature that was similar to what we would now call Druidic practice. Up until the Reformation, the Church in England remained a distant satellite of Rome and was often left to its own devices meaning very specific local practices sprung up. Christianity in Britain by the time of the Statute had been there for a thousand years and was strongly influenced by local character, practices, and history.

Witchcraft was not made a specific crime in the UK until the late 1500s, and the witch-hunts here lasted for around five years begining circa 1645 - this leading to the development of the Statute of Secrecy in the late 1600s in Potterverse history. There is absolutely no logical reason that, until the persecution of witches began (around 900-1000 years after the introduction of Christianity), magical people in Britain and Ireland would have had any need to live separately or worship differently to the wider populous. And due to that, it makes absolute sense that magical people in modern Britain would actually double down on following Christian practices - they belong to their history as much as ours and how dare the muggles bastardise it and take it from them with violence?

Oh, and by the way, Exodus 22:17 doesn't say "kill all witches." It says /"If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins."/ It's Exodus 22:18 that states /"it is not permissable for a sorceress to live,"/ and that is translated from old Greek now thought to mean potioneer or herbalist - advice that was hugely overlooked and ignored in Britain up until the Reformation, as many communities relied on their local "wise woman" for basic medical care and her knowledge of medicinal herbs.

Its what you think, for me abandonment of any existing ties with christianity is more plausible, especially, when you remember, that it's written in the guidebook to not be magical in like these few parts: "Old testament 2 Mose 22:18; 3 Mose 19:31; 5 Mose 18:9-12; 3 Mose 20:27; 3 Mose 20:6; 5 Mose 18:10; Gal 5:20-21; Jes 8:19; Gal 5:19-21; 1 Sam 15:23; 2 Kin 21:6; 1 Chr 10:13-14; 2 Chr 33:6 New testament Rev 21:8; Rev 22:15; Acts 19:19"

All locations of this parts are from the Luther Bible.

Christianity was the dominant force by 800 AD, and any paganism (paganism being taken to mean any non Christian monotheistic belief system) that existed from the 5th century onwards was, as you've said, either Anglo-Saxon or Norse, not Celtic - and it's neopaganism with its faux-celtic roots that most fics have the purebloods doing. There are still massive remnants of Norse and Anglo Saxon paganism in modern Britain and the way we approach our culture, including how the Church operates. Celtic paganism was lost to history by about 500AD, whatever modern practitioners of Wicca would have you believe. This is a common mistake made by people when developing a "pureblood culture" for their fic.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't know if this is true as I've never read the German Bible, but the discussion /you started/ is about pureblood wizarding culture etc in wizarding Britain, so it's the UK stuff that's relevant and in all English translation of the Bible, it's 22;18.

The Old Testament was also translated into Greek for export elsewhere. The Septuagint, the original translation out of Hebrew for use by the Catholic Church, was into Old Greek from Hebrew, in order to bring it in line with the New Testament which was mainly originally scribed in Greek. So the majority of translation of the Old Testament into European languages does indeed come from the Greek, as for years the only version made accessible by the Catholic Church was the Septuagint and translations thereof.

#+begin_quote
  But cases existet and the first period of Witch trials was in the 1400s, and the law was the bible and the Malleus Maleficarum.
#+end_quote

The Maleficarum had much less influence in England than mainland Europe. The "law" in the UK was not just the Bible, Common Law in England began in 1066, and the upholders of the law at that time were barons and the king. It is a legal system that is robust, based on precedent and case law, and by 1154 was codified across the nation removing local peculiarities and influences, including to an extent that of the church. In the mid 1550s, Elizabeth I was queen and she had a court wizard, John Dee. Herbalism and so on was broadly accepted practice by all but the most devoted Christians. There was no capital law against witchcraft in the UK until the 1560s and tbh the witch trials here were minor compared to other European countries - we only really had a couple of years of "witch fever" and less than 150 people were put to death under the laws. Many of our most restrictive witchcraft laws were repealed in the 1730s, when it was actually made a crime to /accuse/ someone of witchcraft, and the last "official" execution of a "witch" was in 1685.

So why mention it then? It really annoys me when people do this, they say something that isn't correct and then try to shut down discussion. Any theoretical or hypothetical discussion of "wizarding culture" and how it would have developed if real has to take into account religion, because religion, in most countries across the planet, is the main driving force of culture and the shape of society.

******** Thing is, in the context of discussing societal development, even a hypothetical one such as this, religion isn't a personal matter due to its historical influence on society. It certainly wasn't a personal matter at the time we are discussing, as the influence it had on public policy shows. The whole point in canon of the Statute was to protect magicals from persecution, and it was religious people across Europe who persecuted witches. The point of people bringing religion up in this discussion is nothing to do with an individual's religious or spiritual preference, but how religion has shaped society through history and how, hypothetically, this would have affected magical customs compared with Muggle ones.

I'm an atheist too, but I've read the Bible as a historical document. Not just in terms of what it can tell us about the time it was written, but also the rewrites and translations that change meaning as time passes, often deliberately to suit the religious prejudices and practices of the time. The development of the church as a form of social control is almost separate to the study of the Bible, as much of the Bible has been twisted to reflect what the church wanted to achieve, rather than the church shaping itself around the original word of the Bible. I think that's particularly pertinent in terms of witchcraft and the persecution of (predominantly) women.

Using your example of Saudi Arabia, they should be called out on their disgusting treatment of women, their arrests of nonviolent activists, their cruel punishments, their frequent use of torture, the fact that they're a hotspot for human trafficking victims (a lot of women are kidnapped and forced into marriages or sexual slavery with Saudi men), their lack of freedom of religion, their blatant anti-semitism in their media, their lack of basic human rights, their punishment of those accused of magic or witchcraft, their lack of freedom of press, their criminalization of homosexuality, and much more.

**** OP was the one who compared it to Saudi Arabia in the first place. Also, I do think they can be compared. The treatment of magical creatures is horrendous. They basically have no rights whatsoever. The wizarding world has overly harsh punishments (even petty criminals end up in Azkaban), and their judicial system is corrupt. They seem to only have one major newspaper, and all of the information there is controlled by the Ministry. There is a total lack of separation of powers, since Umbridge is a judge, a lawmaker, an undersecretary, and a headmistress at the same time.

Even the seemingly harmless traditions such as the pagan holidays and family magic are pretty horrible. Fanfics usually have pureblood whining about how their rituals and spells are labeled as dark magic, when the reason is probably because of the destructive potential. It's unsafe for an eleven year old to learn a spell that blows up a whole street or a ritual that can be extremely dangerous when performed incorrectly. It's the same reason there are gun control laws.

Usually the family magic and pagan rituals are very dangerous. As said before, if a pureblood messes up the ritual or spell, it's extremely dangerous. Since the spells and rituals are usually very hidden from the general public unlike regular magic, they probably can't be easily healed and would be extremely hard to defend against. With regular magic, the danger is greatly reduced since it's widely known, and the truly dangerous magic can only be performed after years of study.

  In most fanfics it is not about 11 olds learning it, but grown ups, and as you can see in the USA people understandable don't like it, when the government takes power away, and it's even more understandable, when this power maybe inventions of ancestors (family spells).

In most of the fanfics I've seen, it's about a school-aged Harry learning it. But, in the end, I don't think the age really matters. Unknown and lethal magic should be heavily controlled. Maybe it shouldn't be banned, but the Ministry can't let random people perform rituals nobody knows about. What if they or someone else got hurt? The Healers wouldn't be able to help them. For example, when Hermione invented the SNEAK spell and used it on Marietta, those pimples never fully healed for the rest of Marietta's life, and no one could help her since it was an unknown spell. Of course, I understand many people don't like the government policing what they can do, but I think the Ministry is right in not allowing everyone to cast random magic.

******* where do we put the limit on what family developed magic the ministry gains access too, would that include potions to fix your hair, perfumes or something alike that.

The ministry we saw in canon in no way should have more power than they already has, the minister has the capaicty execute pepole without due process, bury said execution and go on to influence the national news paper to run a smear campaign against a traumatized 14-15 year old. It was filled with terrorists or bigots that would go on to abuse said power.

******** There's a difference between perfume and extremely dangerous dark magic. That's like saying that because there are gun control laws, there will be laws controlling everything in your life.

I do agree that the Ministry is way too authoritarian and corrupt, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to heavily control dangerous and unknown magic. If they didn't, the wizarding world would be pure chaos. Imagine if Draco was able to learn a spell from his parents that scarred Hermione permanently. The Ministry may be corrupt, but even a broken clock is right twice a day.
