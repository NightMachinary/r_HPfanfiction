For example, Charlie, Fred and George got Howlers from Molly congratulating them for making the Gryffindor Quidditch team.

Bill and Percy got them regularly cuz of their grades. They felt like 5 year olds being cheered by their parents.

McGonagall keeps sending Molly updates coz she finds the Howlers hilarious and the twins prank her in revenge.

Crack or humor, obviously.

*** The twins thought they where smart but also doing poorly in class and doing well in pranks

only molly still howlers them congratulating them on pulling off a great prank

Ron realised this and decided that to never get one of them dreaded howlers he would underachieve and draw no attention to himself

but then he had to go and sit next to harry potter like an idiot on the train

**** /I WAS HAVING TEA WITH AUGUSTA AND SHE SAID THAT NEVILLE TOLD HER THAT YOU AND HARRY POTTER ARE BEST FRIENDS. MY DEAR RONNY, BESTIES WITH THE BOY WHO LIVED! BE SURE TO LET HIM KNOW HE'S WELCOME ROUND FOR THE HOLIDAYS/.

Harry was sure there was something magical to the shade of red Ron's face had reached. Down the table the twins were shaking with silent laughter, a tear rolling down Fred's face. "Our own mum," said George, though haltingly, "funnier than any of us."

Across the hall, Draco Malfoy was having such a fit of giggles that he fell off the Slytherin bench.

** What Ron misses is that Molly has toned it down a lot, when Bill made head boy she made a 10x6 meter banner and hung it over the entrance gates to Hogwarts that said "BILLY FOR HEAD BOY I'M SO PROUD OF YOU ps: wash behind your ears, dear" The post script was automatically updating and the banner was charmed to not move for the whole school year.

Now I'm imagining a really mischievous teacher who trades pranks back and forth with Fred and George like a gang war, all in good spirits, of course.
