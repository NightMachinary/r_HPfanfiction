  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** But, the thing is, wizards /are/ backwards. Sorta. Their culture is divergent from muggle culture and the points on convergence are a minimum of decades out of date, centuries for most things, simply because wizards live longer. It takes longer for the last generation to die out and stop being a negating influence on the next generation. So even if a muggleborn /does/ become influential, they can't really influence society until decades after they left the muggle world.

But at the same time, wizard culture is /different./ It's similar enough that it all looks backwards to the newly arrived muggles, but it's mostly going to be just different.

It's the classic "barbarian" problem. Everyone thinks everyone outside of their own culture is a barbarian. Only in this case, the culture is similar enough that they're viewed as merely backwards, rather than as uncultured swine.

--------------

Similarly, witches and wizards /aren't/ logical. Logic has very little to do with their world. They live in a world where 11 year olds learn how to turn matches into needles. They live in a world where your average high school student is expected to be able to reshape reality to their whims. How does logic play into that?

I'm presuming that Luna is probably good at classes like Potions, Charms, and Divination (the latter of which Hermione hates, as you'll recall) - the kinds of subjects in which success tends to be based off of improvisation and insight, rather than just precision and repetition.

*** This rather misses the point of the magical world as an allegory of the Muggle one. Every problem JK Rowling gives to magical society is an analogy of a problem she considers Muggle society to have.

They have different problems, but analogous ones. Discrimination - magical world has no gender discrimination, but does have its own forms of discrimination. Corruption - magical government is at times corrupt, at times incompetent, at times bureaucratic, like the Muggle one. Justice - magical society allows injustices to happen, as Muggle society does. Etc.

Ultimately I think most of the sense of backwardness largely comes from the fact that they wear robes. But even that isn't really backwards - at no point in Muggle history were robes the common dress of the people.

Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** My own Dawn of Darkness will deal with different magical cultures in Europe and I don't intend to depict them as backwards. There will be certain aspects which the reader might consider so (use of torture for interrogation for example), but there won't be any in story moments where someone says that the magical world is a shithole because they still do that kind of stuff. There is however the canon typical corruption where you can bribe your way out of Azkaban and Tonks quits her job because of it.

And what's the problem with that per se? If someone wants to "explore magical culture in depth", they have to resolve these inconsistencies.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

It's something else. Sometimes it feels like its written from a pit of depression the author can't escape, but the quality is alright. Magic is pretty good, and the Muggle theme is explored at times. I seem to remember a very good debate in this, somewhere near the end.

The sequel steps on a very thin line, and I think the author was drunk when he wrote in a foreign girlfriend for a side-character, she working with trying to fuse technology and magic. We also get some weird butchery of Japanese superstition, but it passes quickly. In the most recent chapter Harry and another character is talking about Earth's carrying capacity and what to do about it. Let's just say the suggestions are definitely not muggle-wanky and it promises an interesting moral debate and conflict in the coming chapters.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** linkffn(6671596) - This tackles the issue you're describing, and expounds on the pureblood's/magical's side on the argument. Harry is on the side of the purebloods, but is also friends with muggleborn Hermione. He's not discriminating against muggles/muggleborns, he's just of the opinion that the 2 worlds are just inherently different and has merits on both sides. The wizarding world is more discriminatory against muggles/muggleborns.

When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

** Can be done different? Yes, and it can also work just as well but not if currency doesn't even make sense! Why 17 silver sickles to a galleon? Why 29 knuts to a sickle?

Yes, the wizard world is backward (so I fully understand people who've been raised by muggles complaining about that!) - but they can get away with it (magic lets you do that), sure stuff doesn't have to make sense, but if you grew up with stuff (like 100 pence make 1 pound or 100 cents make 1 dollar!) then you'd consider wizard money very very very strange (because to you it doesn't make sense at all!)

Still, I can understand why you wouldn't constantly want to read that muggles are so much better (they aren't, sure stuff makes more sense in the muggle world, but muggles also depend on technology to do things that wizards do with the wave of a wand, some concentration/visualisation and a few muttered words (or without, if they silent-cast))

** The thing is, the wizarding world ~is~ backwards. They have electricity issues, and everything awesome about our lives in modern society hinges on electricity. I'm going to be honest here, if I have a choice of having magic, or having constant access to the internet, I'll need some time to make up my mind. Now if I could have both, no brainer. But if just having my surface pro around me all the time causes it to die? And I can't get a wifi signal?

Dude.

Today the only thing that really matters is how we entertain ourselves. We don't fight for our lives, or even survival. We just exist, going to work, eating, sleeping and #(&L;ing. It's all bout filling those hours outside those activities with that which makes us happy. For me, it's motorcycling and reading. Given the computerization of my bikes, I don't think magic use would make them happy. And all my reading is electronic.

I would choose magic, and I would probably try to find some method besides the Elixir Of Life and horcruxes to become immortal. And then I'd start placing uninhabited islands and other remote locations under very powerful wards so that only I know of their location. I'd create my own society with an emphasis on education.

Yeah, I'd take magic over modern electronics any day.

Generally, in most cases, witch-hunters didn't manage to successfully catch wizards.

#+begin_quote
  Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognising it. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic Flame-Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being burnt so much that she allowed herself to be caught no fewer than forty-seven times in various disguises

#+begin_quote
  It is true, of course, that genuine witches and wizards were reasonably adept at escaping the stake, block and noose (see my comments about Lisette de Lapin in the commentary on “Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump”). However, a number of deaths did occur: Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington (a wizard at the royal court in his lifetime, and in his death-time, ghost of Gryffindor Tower) was stripped of his wand before being locked in a dungeon, and was unable to magic himself out of his execution; and wizarding families were particularly prone to losing younger members, whose inability to control their own magic made them noticeable, and vulnerable, to Muggle witch-hunters.
#+end_quote

It was to the degree that the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was created at the end of seventeenth century, despite witch-hunts starting around three hundred years earlier.

It says something that among reasons given for enactment ISOS we see "increasing numbers of Muggles being burned in mistake for witches". Worth noting is also the "failure of (...) delegation to muggle King and Queen (William and Mary) begging for protection under muggle law" (both from W.O.M.B.A.T.).

Wizards tried to play ball with Muggles, but as those refused, and largely were hurting themselves in the process, wizards decided to withdrawn from society. Of course not everybody was fine with such "nice" solution and there were those who proposed outright war (Pottermore: Pure-Blood). And it's a war they would clearly win.

I won't get into the specific abilities. It's simple if you are in the position to almost perfectly hide your society from the bigger society to the degree that in the future its whole existence is thought to be false, then you are in the position to screw over that bigger society.
