When reading fanfiction, I often find that the most enjoyable parts are the classes and new types of "magics" that the authors have developed. Some have created amazing content and have expanded the wizarding world in some way or another. Some writers have expanded upon already known classes (i.e. Potions, Herbology, Theory of Magic) while others have created new subjects that are simply fascinating.

A brilliant example are the ideas of transformation, wand-lore and the devoctrix ideas of NoahPhantom's Albus series.

What do you believe are some of the best ideas, classes and/or subjects that have been developed by fanfiction authors?


** I'd say the idea of Muggle Studies being similar to a science than a novelty. With dissecting appliances, and theorising on their uses. Doesn't fit in a lot of fics though.

*** I read a romance where they took a field trip and had to pretend to be muggle high schoolers on a school camping trip. It was a cool concept. Maybe have a class go shopping for dinner in a supermarket and prepare it without magic? Instead of a cheesy smut plot ðŸ˜‚

**** Things like that are good for non-magical crossovers too.

** Hmm - one magical concept that I found pretty interesting is from a Harry Potter/Dresden Files crossover, with using the concept of wand magic (Harry Potter magic) being heavily based on language (basically, needing a large enough population using the same language/meaning to words would start to create a 'resonance', and that's what allowed spells to work verbally). That then opened up advanced magic based on ancient, fallen languages/people - by thinking in /just/ the right way, and saying the word properly, it allowed for very different magic to be used, such as that which they might have used.

#+begin_quote
  "That's only the beginning, Harry," Dumbledore said passionately. "There are Words of the Drakon, for they have language. There are Words of the Fae, for they too have language. There are Words of demons, of angels, from a multitude of beings- most that human eyes have never glanced upon before. These Words are old, their resonance ancient and, for some unknown reason, strangely potent in our particular world. I will teach you how to use these words. I will teach you how to reproduce sounds that our throats cannot physically create, that our ears cannot physically hear. I will teach you how to utilise these Words in combat, from Words that turn matter into oblivion to Words that can summon entire oceans upon our enemies. In the end, Harry, you will have a power that the Dark Lord knows not. You will have the Words of the Worlds, and you will crush your enemies with them."

It's not something that is workable in every setting, obviously - but I think it was an interesting concept.

Otherwise, I find that linkffn(Blood Crest) does a great job of canon-adjacent (and fleshing out of) magical mechanics, particularly for enchantments and dark magic. If you haven't read it yet, you might find it interesting!

  Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

** Necromancy! And divination, though there aren't many fics with it.

I've read one fic where Harry speaks to Voldemort through a corpse to creep him out.

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19296382/chapters/45894217][this fic]], Harry and his mentors channel their necromancy through music to calm inferi.

In Certain Dark Things, Elara has to wear gloves during Herbology and Potions because she accidentally withers all of the plants. Also, Nicolas Flamel teaches Harriet how to reanimate a raven's corpse to work as a post owl.

Blood Crest combines necromancy with soul magic and divination. Harry is kidnapped and enslaved by a necromancer in that fic.

In one I'm writing, my OC is kidnapped by Death Eaters during the first war and creates a variation of the inferi ritual to escape. The corpses aren't as fierce as inferi, just more like stumbling idiots that provide a distraction more than an actual soldier like Voldemort's were.
