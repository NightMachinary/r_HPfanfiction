Like they end up in another world (crossover), the kids end up having to tag along with Harry on a mission, maybe they go back in time and meet younger Harry?

If you know of any fics like this, please rec.

I live for badass dad Harry ðŸ˜Œ, I feel this has potential.


** I wrote one a while ago where Harry and Hermione from a parallel universe took it on themselves to find and fix Harrys from other universes who got crapped on and made mistakes that endangered their timelines. Your idea actually dovetails nicely with that, like Harry and the kids accidentally travel and meet a different Harry for the first time and that's how they come across Harrys who need help in the first place.

Plot bunny added to the list. Can't promise anything, and definitely not soon, but it's on the list now. :)

** Dig through some of Northumbrian's stories. He has a few stories centered around James, Albus, Lily and the neighboring muggle kids, often with Harry chaperoning.
