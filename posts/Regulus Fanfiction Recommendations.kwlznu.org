I just finished All The Young Dudes and I'm looking for a regulus fanfic to fill the blanks there. I've seen loads of posts with good recommendations but I don't want any AUs where he survives etc, so I'm looking for one that follows the general canon storyline or the atyd storyline preferably! Any recommendations? Thanks in advance!


** This is about him as a ghost, but it does sort of follow Canon until his death [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23417602/chapters/56124778]]

*** Ah, that's my fic! Thank you for the rec <3

OP, I have a few Regulus fics but they're mostly AU/post-death - I'm currently working on my own canon-compliant one as I couldn't find one that I liked, and will hopefully have it finished soon! There are a few snippets on [[https://unspeakable3.tumblr.com/tagged/lionheart][my tumblr]] if you wanted to take a look in the meantime!

**** Are you planning on writing a sequel at some point? Really liked the current one, but curious about what will happen next.

***** Of ghost!Regulus? Yes, absolutely, the plan is to do all seven books! But I'm not starting work on it until I've finished my canon-compliant Regulus fic, so it'll be another couple of months or so at least :)

  Regulus has the knowledge of what will happen in every moment of his life. This fixes nothing and is not without consequences....In other words, Regulus can see all of his past, present, and future, but doesn't know which is which.

  Regulus Black has always known how he will die. He drowns regardless.
