I get that he ended up being a hero and I love Snape, but the whole HP series you are thinking Slytherin is the house where the bad witches or wizards get sorted. I'm looking to read about Slytherin students who aren't racist or assholes. Because I am not but I was sorted into Slytherin on Pottermore so there has to be more to being a Slytherin than HP series depicts. Thanks for any recommendations anyone can give me. I am new to fan fictions.


** For you, I highly recommend linkffn(The Changeling)

** linkffn(Latet anguis in herba)

It's a more slice of life sort of story, featuring OCs, with little connection to the main series' events. I don't know if that's your jam but I really liked it, it's written very well.

** I'm writing one at the moment. It has 15(?) chapters (if you can call them chapters) up on A03, and I still haven't got to the troll arc in book 1, but it's outlined past the events of book 7. There's quite a few major Slytherin characters who are decent people in the story, and only a couple are outright terrible people.

It's one of those female Harry fics. I'm in the process of editing to remove a few surface-level mistakes and possibly add in a new scene in one of the earlier chapters, so maybe wait a week or so if you want to check it out. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14624781]]

The protagonist's preoccupation with survival naturally gets Sally sorted into Slytherin. It's quite hilarious though, unfortunately, probably abandoned.
