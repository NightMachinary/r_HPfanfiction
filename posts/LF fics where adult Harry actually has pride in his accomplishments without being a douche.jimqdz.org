I just want to read some fics where Harry doesn't just deliberately downplay his abilities and skills literally every 2 sentences. Even in canon, Harry's humility is one of his most annoying traits. I understand the need for humility and that without it, you can become an arrogant jerk, but damnit man, have some freaking pride. He killed a servant of the Dark Lord at 11, a basilik at 12, and drove off tons of dementors at 13! And that's all before witnessing the rebirth of a Dark Lord and escaping shortly, thereafter.

Harry in canon is magically powerful (regardless of the fact that the idiot knows and uses about 3 spells pretty much his entire schooling career) and he has accomplished some great feats. I'd just like to read a fic where he's an adult and doesn't shy away from the fact that he's a badass. Without being a jackass! Because it's like I can only find the 2 extremes: he's so humble and timid that he just doesn't believe anyone when they say he's powerful or he's so powerful and arrogant that he runs around mouthing off to everyone in listening range.

Fics with him being somewhat in the middle are rare it seems like. Any help with prideful Harry without jerk-tendencies would be lovely.


** It's annoying. The angsty harry fics are abundant and overplayed.

*** I like it! Thanks! Left a review too because I thought it very clever with the twist at the end.
