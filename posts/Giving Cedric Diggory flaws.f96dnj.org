I'm currently writing an OC Weasley story with romantic subplot. While I can easily give my OC traits and flaws that will help and hinder her throughout the story, I'm having trouble finding flaws for her love interest: Cedric Diggory. I know for certain he had at least one: he occasionally demonstrates a certain lack of ingenuity, initiative, and drive, he lacks a competitive edge. I tried looking at MBTI personality posts of him for more flaws, but too many people have him listed as one thing or the other. If JK Rowling went into more depth with Cedric Diggory what do you think his flaws (Cursed Child put aside) would be?


** Honourable/idealist to a fault. He's an intelligent lad, but he's also the kind of stupid that Harry is when it come to pragmatism.

He's certainly got drive, he was a sixth year more capable than all the seventh years.

*** But Harry's expectations have also been tempered by his experiences. Cedric should manifest his idealism by being trusting/naive to a fault, willing to believe the best in people even when he shouldn't; which contrasts Harry, who often is very suspicious or dismissal of people outside his tight social group.

** Harry has lived through a lot of shit. Murdered parents, evil Dursleys, three headed dogs, teachers playing host to your arch nemesis. A ruddy great snake with death ray eyes, hundreds of dementors and a werewolf by the time we get to fourth year. Cedric was in the castle when some of this happened but wasn't really in danger.

Then comes the Triwizard tournament. Seems like a laugh, bit of glory for Hufflepuff and you know what he even makes it as a champion. Fuck yeah, but now he has to deal with the expectations of the school. Only holy fucking shit they want him to fight a dragon. The kid years younger than him doesn't even blink. They want him to fight a dragon. A bloody great dragon.

Cedric knows he only beat Harry in quidditch because Harry was attacked by Dementors. It only counts as a win because I don't think dementor attacks were included as a valid reason to stop the game. somehow this one win and now being champion means he's expected to win the whole Triwizard thing.

Cedric is a normal hardworking Hufflepuff with a loving family. He's not cut out for all this life and death stuff and it should worry him. He should regret entering. He should swing between the shame of being beaten by a 14 year old and rationalising it to himself that the 14 year old is Harry Potter.

** His desire to prove himself, similar to how people show Barty jr except he does gain that positive response from his parents. He wants to show his dad how good he is and when he is embarrassed in front of his father in cursed child it hurts him bad. So I would say that he would have a little bit of confidence issues if someone played a but if mind games in him.

** If you look at Canon, I really think that Diggory is "perfect". Rowling made a caracter without any flaw (except maybe his lack of iniative while put in a dangerous situation but I think it's more about Harry being way too much used to it while Cedric is more at the "normal" level) so his death would make everyone safe.

I even disagree with you about his lack of competitive edge, rather than that, I think it's more about his other qualities that kinda counteract it :

- Cedric wanted to win the Quidditch match and focused on the Snitch. It's just that he later found out that he only won because Dementors entered on the field, and decided his victory was dishonorable, hence why he proposed a rematch. And even when he father pointed out that "Harry felt while you stayed on your broom", he probably understood that the Dementors had more effect on Harry, and could easily understand why.
- Cedric wanted to win the Triwizard Tournament, and did his best. But unlike his Housemate, he was kind enough to not start bullying a younger roomate even if he was dissapointed that a Gryffindor stole the attention Hufflepuff finally got. He was so honourable that he felt obliged to help Harry understand the clues for the 2nd time after he revealed the 1st Task to him, even when he was a competitor. And in front of the Cup, he knew that he only managed to reach this point because Harry had saved him twice (from Krum and the Acromantula). So he was ready to step down.

Cedric had plenty of competitive spirit, but unlike someone like say Draco Malfoy, how he won mattered as much to him that the victory.\\
Anyways, I don't think Cedric had any "true" character flaw like other members of the cast. So at this point you can ever just invent one (any could work as long as he is not a complete asshole and it's pretty discrete. Maybe he was a bit jealous and insecure while in relation. Harry being rejected by Cho was one thing, but maybe he would be truly bothered if he had later started to be close to Cho "as a friend"). Or maybe you could push one of his qualities to the point of annoyance, say someone so caring he will not let a friend who seem bothered in peace, even if said friend really don't want to talk about his problems.

** I'm not sure what all the trusting/naive/idealist comments are all about - in canon he didn't believe Harry about not putting his name in the goblet. He wasn't actively mean to Harry, but he also didn't try very hard (or seemingly at all) to stop his house from bullying Harry or to publicly reach out to Harry. Cedric is not a hero or paragon of virtue, he's just not an arsehole.

His negative traits are:

- Passive - too willing to accept things at face value, will go along to get along rather than standing up for others, etc.
- Lacks depth - I think the Goblet is the first time he's faced an actual challenge. He's like James Potter in that as the handsome, popular only child of a loving financially stable couple, he hasn't had many obstacles in his life. He hasn't been in a situation where he'd suffered or had to make a significant sacrifice to reach his goals. He comes off as immature or naive in that way.
- Maybe a little conceited? Not a lot, just someone who doesn't get rejected socially and is not used to it and so may not know how to handle it.

** Maybe he's a noble idiot

He will literally sacrifice himself to do the right thing aka “setting himself on fire to keep someone else warm”

I've known people like this - it's very frustrating

** You can only give him character flaws, really. The ones you listed don't really work, because to be chosen for the tournament you have to be the best of them all.
