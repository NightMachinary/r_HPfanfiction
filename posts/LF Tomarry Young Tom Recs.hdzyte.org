Hello! I'm actually pretty new to Tomarry shipping. I read through [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13059681][A Dangerous Game]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7189349][Wear Me Like a Locket Around Your Throat]] in less then 48 hours, and I'm craving more of the same thing. I don't know where to start with the ship, so if you guys have any suggestions, I would be happy to have them. I will also be posting this on the HPSlashFic page.

I don't want to read anything with really large age gaps, however. Like in the fics I read, I'm looking for young Tom Riddle. The longer the better!

Any recommendations? Thank you so much!

#+begin_quote
  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

#+begin_quote
  A mysterious object in Bellatrix's vault sends Harry, Ron and Hermione spinning into the past and to a Hogwarts like none they know. Posing as students, Harry catches the eye of the Head Boy, Tom Riddle, who is nothing like the Voldemort of the future. He's charming and sly and manipulative; both brillant and deadly. It isn't long before they're tangled in a game more intricate than anything before. A game of heightened stakes, of tension, and the odds are stacked against Harry. With the threads of the future unravelling, can Harry make it out intact? And what is the cost, of truly getting close to Tom?

  COMPLETE. When Harry and Hermione inadvertently tumble half a century into the past, they find themselves in the same year as the notorious Head Boy, Tom Riddle. Both Harry and Hermione's courage will be tested when they are confronted by chances of romance from the most unexpected of places, and unlikely enemies hiding in the tallgrass.Lost in the past, they may well forget the way home.Not DH compliant.

  “Riddle,” he greets carefully. His gaze flicks over to the Slytherin table, but none of them are paying any attention. Which is... worrying, actually. He looks back to Riddle, who's still looming over him. “What can I do for you?”“Potter,” Riddle says, and he actually sounds... nice. This is growing more suspicious by the second. “May I escort you to class?” Ron snorts, not even attempting to disguise the sound. “You're joking, right?” he asks, leaning forward to glare up at the other boy, “Fuck off, Riddle. Harry doesn't need an escort from you.”Harry watches Riddle's face carefully. His expression sours, but only for a moment before it's smooth again. He smiles, and if Harry didn't know better, he might call it charming.Well. Okay. He really does know better.But it's still charming.  Featuring attempted manipulation, Tom Riddle experiencing positive emotions for quite possibly the first time ever, and absolutely no angst whatsoever

  BOOK ONE of 'Not a Good Man, but a Great One'. An infant Harry is thrown across time and delivered to 1927. When, at age nine, he meets a young Tom Riddle at Wool's Orphanage, he is immediately pulled into Tom's orbit. As both young boys navigate their entry into the Wizarding World, they soon learn that Harry's past is not as simple as it seems, and that their strange connection runs deeper than they'd imagined. [As of 1/2/2020, this book is fully complete.]

  “I'm Harry,” she finally offers when the silence in the cupboard feels like it's going to overwhelm her. “Harry Potter.” There's a warm sense of satisfaction resting in her stomach, not her own, and Harry doesn't know why Tom seems so smug. It's wonderful to meet you, Harry he practically purrs, sounding like he's whispering directly into her ear. Harry twitches, a small smile starting to grow on her face. “Are you going to help me, Tom?” If you'll let me. I'll take very good care of you, Harry. Tom Riddle starts talking to Harry when she's six.
