** The HP Lexicon has been around for a long time - well before the wikia and it has always tried to adhere to book canon, separating that from what was changed for the movies or added by video games.

It appears that they've gone through a site redesign, and one that evokes a little of the current Pottermore style, if in a better way. More graphics, better link-backs and the option for each article to have its own comment section.

Of particular interest to me was this commentary for the article on Sybill Trelawney:

#+begin_quote
  Rowling's version was Sybill. In ancient times a Sibyl was a prophetess who, in a state of ecstasy and under influence of Apollo, prophesied without being consulted. So Rowling intentionally decided NOT to follow the spelling of the ancient seer because her character is more of a “wanna-be” seer. The US editors changed it, though, presumably because they wanted the name to fit the spelling of the ancient prophetesses.

  So does that strike anyone else as oddly as it does me? Why were the US editors allowed to change something like that? This was a specific, intentional artistic choice by Rowling. This is the kind of thing which makes Rowling's writing as rich and interesting as it is. But she let them change things. It's either that the US editors were too pushy or that Rowling was too easily pushed. While it's probably a combination of both, I think this is a clear example of how Rowling works with other creatives. And it's an important concept for fans to understand.

  Rowling does not look at canon the way we do. She doesn't come at things with the idea that she has the last word or that everything has to be the way she conceived it. She has no problem with changes to her world instigated by others. Not just any “others, of course, just certain ones, like the book editors and the film makers. This explains why she didn't step in and correct so many things in the films, such as the pronunciation of the name “Voldemort.” She's more than happy to be a team player and just go with it. Let them do their creative thing. Unfortunately, the literature, the depth, the richness is sacrificed.

Well said, but the Lexicon mostly does a good job of separating their editorial stances from the bare facts of the series. Authors for HP fanfic really don't have many online resources to help check facts and keep their characters consistent.

The largest - and perhaps most frequently used - resource is probably the HP Wiki. Despite providing no sources whatsoever, their [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Draco_Malfoy][article for Draco Malfoy]] furthers the Felton Fans' agenda who insist that Draco must be 'clever:'

#+begin_quote
  Draco was quite intelligent and quick-witted, capable of deducing things and coming up with clever plans based on a small amount of information;
#+end_quote

This is absurd.

The [[https://legacy.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/draco.html][Lexicon's article]] limits itself to /sourced/ data for both their extensive biographical section and brief profile.

While I don't think the Lexicon can publish biased essays like the one wordhammer mentions and claim to be a neutral authority, for the moment they're still the best resource.

***** Oh believe me, I can't stand the HP Wiki. It says absolute nonsense probably 50% of the time.

But I guess I don't see why that editorial stance has to be there at all. Especially as it's making quite a large assumption from a small editorial aspect.

As do I. I'm certainly willing to give them a probationary thumbs up so long as their opinions don't intrude into the bare bones encyclopaedia. I couldn't find the section wordhammer linked on Sybill's article page.

The Lexicon has always had essays on shipping (many of them shockingly stupid), but they were never anywhere near the articles for the characters themselves. So long as that remains the case I don't really see how this iteration is different than the last.

Since it's listed in the 'Canon Discussion' section... somehow... I suppose we can give them a pass on the editorializing.

Not sure about the new site (haven't explored it yet), but the Lexicon seemed to me the /least/ snobbish out of all the sites before. I always trusted it fully and I've never trusted the wikia.

** I literally said "Holy shit" aloud at seeing this. I thought the site was dead as far as updates were concerned and it's looked the same for as long as I've been using it. Definitely a shock to see it so different.

I like the design, but I'm not thrilled about the new pages. Main example: the characters page. Before, you could pick a letter and see all characters of that letter, whereas now there's just 44 pages and a guess at where any one letter begins--awkward when you're looking for a certain character. There were also options to see all the members of a group (death eaters, students, teachers, etc) and that doesn't seem to be a possibility anymore, except by finding the page about that specific group. You also need to go back to the home page to see the main explore menus again (the dropdown in the topbar doesn't include them), which is annoying. ([[http://i.imgur.com/CTm3juO.jpg][Old Character Page]] vs. [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/][New Character Page]])

Opinion might change as I get used to it, but for now I'm on the fence about this makeover.

*Edit:* Also, I just found [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/event/amarillo-lestoat-dies/][this]] and I'm thinking JKR is not an Anne Rice fan:

** I noticed this a day or two ago. I use this site pretty much every day as it has the best compilation of information, but I'm struggling to use the new site. Like, on the old one when searching characters, you could just go to the characters main page and click on an letter and it would list all the people with that first letter in their name. But, you can't do that on a new one, instead, it just lists them all with 40+ pages, or you have to use the search bar for example "Shacklebolt" , but the results it shows are not intuitive.

** I have always preferred to use the Lexicon over the wikia, and this update makes it better! I always liked how HPL preferred book canon, disregarding much of movie changes and video game additions.

The character page could be formatted better. Instead of "pages 1-44" the pages should be separated by alphabet
