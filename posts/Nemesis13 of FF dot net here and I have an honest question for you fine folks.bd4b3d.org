** Well, I honestly don't know anything about you or your work, so...

I'm going to recommend that you write a 500k word epic, tragic romance fice between Snape and the Giant Squid. Obviously it should start off with Snape thinking that the Squid is a dunderhead because it doesn't know what the ingredients for the Draught of Living Death are, but in the end, the Squid teaches him that the magic was inside him all along. And then they die from syphilis.

** Fem!Harry is fine though I can't say that I have been too interested in your depictions of her for the stories that I've read from you so far.

As for what you should write...something that does more showing than telling. Like that Arya reborn I Rob Harry Potter fanfic...you are just speeding the hell along and just telling us what happens. Slow the fuck down and expand the scenes. Show Arya forcing her house mates into compliance instead of making a comment about it. And not just one scene because that is absurd. Have it be multiple scenes of Arya attempting to do this before fully succeeding. Heck, have it take several years before gets strong enough to do this. Have antagonists be competent characters and so on.

** I'll admit that I wish you would finish what you started, but I would much rather read something someone writes because they want to and have a passion for rather than feel obligated to finish something out. So basically write whatever moves you at the moment because that is usually the most enjoyable to read and if it is something you've already started all the better. Also thanks for all you've written even though it's not finished they're still enjoyable.
