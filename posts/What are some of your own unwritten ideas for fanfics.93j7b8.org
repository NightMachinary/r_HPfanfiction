The one I always had a general liking for but never could really fit is a sort of AU based somewhat off of Mr. Robot with Harry as the main character and Voldemort playing that sort of role. I want delve to deep in case there's anyone who hasn't watched the show (highly recommend it), but the idea sort of floats around and I can only ever seem to come up with small little snapshots of scenes for it.


** Voldemort and his people win the 1st war. With the resources of government fully in their control they perform an epic ritual to eliminate all muggles.

The ritual works in a way. Every muggle on the planet gains magic and all future children have magic. There are no more muggles or squibs.

** Years ago I seriously considered writing a fic about a son of Voldemort: his name would have been Mortimer Mortison, he would have identified as a goth, and basically had the personality of Eyore from Winnie the Pooh. Voldemort would have pretty much just kept him around in case he needed a replacement liver or something.

He would have been two or three years older than Harry, and when they'd meet somehow, Harry would have thought Mortimer was really cool.

This is what I considered the height of comedy when I was 13...

Who am I kidding? I still can't think about it without cracking up. ;b

** I've noticed there are a lack of a couple things in the fandom: Voldemort Won AU's and marriage contracts/expectations gone awry. I wanted to write something to do them justice and this came to me.

This has been my project for the past few months and it has driven me spare. I've got a pretty decent outline and here's the basic premise.

#+begin_quote
  /Second Choice/

  Brief Summary: AU: Voldemort wins, Harry is not the child of prophecy and his parents are killed in the war. He is raised by Regulus as his brother's dying wish. Hogwarts only takes those of pureblood from good families, the rest are sent to trade schools. Ginny Weasley manages to get into Hogwarts due to something something power level something haven't figured out. While at Hogwarts Harry/Ginny become close, even though Harry knows she is below his station. Lots of stuff happens and bam its 4th year. Harry takes Daphne to the ball as the Greengrasses have been courting him, as the Potter name is old, even if disgraced slightly by James's treason. Daphne and Harry don't really like each other, but Daphne goes along with it as it is her family's wishes and Harry does as he is already in a precarious position (Voldemort won't forget the son of one of his enemies); this marriage would be a chance to cement his good standing.

  So basically what I want to happen is Harry has to choose between Ginny who he loves, or Daphne who would grant him political immunity, wealth, and status. I plan on having three endings.

  One with Ginny: In short they have a loving relationship until Voldemort kills him.

  One with Daphne: He is miserable and lonely trapped in a loveless relationship.

  The last where Harry unleashes Fiendfyre in the Wizengamot killing himself but taking the government with him.

  My goal is to not only write a decent romance, but have the reader really think about the choices that are presented to them. Which ending would you choose would be what I want them to walk away from the story asking themselves.
#+end_quote

My biggest obstacle with this is my technical skill of writing is not at the level to do this idea justice so I have been brainstorming this story while working on other little things to bring my skill up to par. I really want to write/finish this someday as I do believe it has a lot of potential and would be something that hasn't been done before.

*** Your third outcome is the best. But before he died, Harry gave the secrets of Voldemort's immortality to Ginny and Daphne, who then teamed up and spent years trying to find a counter. Eventually, they found their answer in an ancient in Egypt, the birthplace of Horcruxes.

They needed several more years preparing the ritual and trying to find one Horcrux, the required component. But when they finally initiated the ritual from deep beneath the woods of Dartmoor, Voldemort's very soul was being slowly shredded over the next 7 days.

On the first day. the Lestranges vigilantly guarded him and tried to comfort him. But rational Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy decided it was time to seize the power for themselves. They captured the Lestranges, and put Voldemort out of his misery. Voldemort's pain however didn't end with the destruction of his body, and continued until his soul was completely destroyed over the next 6 days.

Lucius blamed much of the regime's excesses on the Lestranges and their allies, and had them all publicly executed in extremely gruesome fashions. To broaden his support, Malfoy elevated several formerly â€˜disgraced' pureblood families back among the ranks of the â€˜good' ones.

Throughout the years, Ginny and Daphne fell in love with each other, and had spent most of their times in the Muggle America. Although most of their effort were directed at finding the ritual to destroy Voldemort, they still built up a sizable company in the Muggle world, using memory charms as their key competitive advantage. One of the subsidiaries is a private security contractor made up primarily of Muggleborns and Squibs, well paid but bound to them through magical contracts. With Voldemort finally out of its way and Magical Britain in turmoil, they saw the time of their revenge had finally arrived.

**** That's certainly one way you could take it.

Part of the struggle for me is building a believable Voldemort won AU and its implications. Horcruxes would never be discovered as Dumbledore does not exist, and the events of the Chamber do not occur.

Furthermore the thought of resisting/fighting against Voldemort would be alien to harry, as during 1982-1991 no one has done so(and if they did they were publically executed); the thought just wouldn't seem at all feasible. I want Voldemort to be larger than life.

In fact the only way that Harry would even dare to oppose society and in turn Voldemort is when his happiness (marriage choices) is threatened. His attack on the Wizengamot is not against Voldemort but rather him lashing out at society for the place he has been put in.

*In short the real struggle is not about fighting Voldemort but rather lashing out in the corrupt society that would come as a result of his victory.*

I really like your idea with Lucius I totally could see him being pragmatic as such, that's probably why I enjoyed the premise of the Dark Lord Never Died so much; it felt true to character but did something completely new.

** We all know there are a lot of Christian motifs in Harry Potter, with the crowning moment being Harry's messiah-like sacrificing death and subsequent resurrection. I thought it would be funny to have a Christian student in Harry's year, like a super-hysterical catholic. Let's call her Mary. I wanted to use those Christian motifs and themes, and make Mary think that Harry is actually the new messiah, returned to Earth to announce the start of Armageddon. But no one else agrees with her, and everyone thinks she's really annoying. I don't know what the actual story would be, though.

** I have a ton of ideas sitting in my google drive. Some I've written up to 6k words on, but haven't dedicated much time to due to my current massive project.

- Post GoT. AU. The Dark Lord has returned. Dolores Jane Umbridge, Hogwarts High Inquisitor, will do anything in her power to stop him and the threat he poses to her Ministry ambitions. Essentially an Ender's Game inspired AU.

- A Pureblood!Hermione AU in which Hermione is the daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange. Towards end of the first Voldemort war, a group of Aurors led by Frank and Alice Longbottom raid the Lestranges' house. Bellatrix wants revenge, and forces Snape to protect her daughter since he's the least bad out of the Death Eaters. When the war starts to turn sour, Snape hides Bellatrix's daughter with muggles. The truth comes out during sixth year, and the main part of the AU would take place during seventh year and focus on the war efforts.

- A genderswapped Lily Evans and Severus Snape story.

- An AU set right after the defeat of Voldemort, and with Dumbledore still alive. The basic premise is that part of Harry died along with the Horcrux, and he starts to turn into another Dark Lord. Dumbledore is in custody at the beginning, and doesn't really understand what happened to Harry. Through a series of interviews and flashbacks, the rise and fall of Grindelwald and Voldemort are explored. I haven't planned much beyond this, but it'd eventually catch up to the fic's present-day and the plan to defeat Harry.

- A Snape raises Hermione AU. No idea where I'd go with that plot-wise, since I don't want to rehash canon, but it'd be an interesting mentor dynamic.

- A Voldemort kills the Potters AU inspired by the Hunger Games. October, 1981: Voldemort vanquishes Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow. His followers have completely infiltrated the Ministry at this point, and the death of Harry Potter further cements his place in the Wizarding World. November, 1981: Voldemort and his followers round up remaining Dumbledore sympathizers. Those who are caught are placed in Azkaban. The remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix go underground. January, 1982: Voldemort has completely overthrown the Ministry and taken over the country. Magical Britain and Ireland are separated into districts, each controlled by one of the families loyal to Voldemort. Voldemort takes Hogwarts as his own seat, and oversees it as headmaster. Smaller Wizarding schools are established for each district. January, 1983: The Muggleborn reclamation program goes into effect. The official statement is that Muggleborns are placed with foster families that will help them grow. The reality is that Muggleborns end up living in ghetto-like conditions with minimal access to schooling. Wizarding population is much greater than in canon, with about 40k wizards living in Britain. Each year, on October 31, one male and one female wizard is chosen from each wizarding settlement in what is known as Requiem -- a remembrance for the day the Dark Lord's true rule began and a way to keep the masses reminded of his vast power. Wizards aged 14-17 are eligible to compete in Requiem for a position of power at the Dark Lord's side. While wizards from Dark Lord-supporting families often chose to compete in Requiem, wizards of muggle or mixed descent are often forced into the games. There is a 50% death rate for non-purebloods, and a 5% death rate for purebloods, although this is never advertised. Requiem has a combination of duels and political maneuvering. Requiem is broadcast to the entirety of Wizarding Britain using a new system of mirror technology that allows moving images to be transmitted directly to each household. This would be a Hermione-centric fic, as she would be one of the Requiem candidates.

Witches would be utterly pissed at her, but wizards would love the idea since they could now pick the 'best' Muggle women to fill their harems. The situation would result in Molly, Ginny, Luna, Fleur and co coming after her, while Arthur, Harry, Ron, Neville, and co protecting her.

A Wizarding Detective Agency that operates independently of the Ministry and the Auror Office. Basically, a witch/wizard is a detective for the wizarding community and muggles and they have to solve a series of anti-muggle murders around London during the timeline of GoF. I wrote around 3 chapters but gave up eventually because I can't seem to write mystery well, but I initially had plans for the wizard detective to join the Order in OotP. I think I might continue someday, though, since I'm reading In Cold Blood by Truman Capote right now and am feeling inspired.

** Harry ran down the pavement, his heart pounding as he gasped for breath. He knew he couldn't run much longer, and even if Dudley was a slow fatty, Piers wasn't and he was always part of "Harry Hunting."

Harry glanced wildly from side to side as he ran, desperately looking for a place to hide, when he suddenly registered a presence in front of him, and ran square into what could be generously be referred to as a wall of paisley.

Physics being what they were, in that Harry was six years old, and weighed on bottom end of fifty pounds, and his obstacle was forty-nine year old Carol Mayers, who would never have admitted it, but topped the scales at a shade over two hundred pounds, Harry bounced off her ample hip, and landed flat on his back, his impact causing no damage beyond the fumbling of a small stack of books.

"Well I never!" Exclaimed Mrs. Mayer as Harry looked up at her stunned, her expression a mixture of stern and exasperated. "You ought to watch where you are running young man."

Harry shook his head to clear it, and scrambled up. He knew Mrs. Mayer, Aunt Petunia talked to her all the time. Hoping to avoid further scolding, and wishing desperately that she wouldn't mention this to his Aunt, Harry quickly scooped up the books and held out the stack to her.

Mrs. Mayer sniffed and pointed imperiously up the walk and said "You can just carry those to the Library for me, at a reasonable pace.".

Harry nodded, and walked slowly beside the large woman who directed him to a brick building that he had always thought was another house, but could now read the small sign next to the door that said "Little Whinging Library". As he walked into the building carry Mrs. Mayers books, he couldn't help but wonder if maybe this wouldn't be a good place to hide from Dudley and his gang.

~~~~~ HP-BR ~~~~~

The next day (having successfully evaded his tormentors), Harry was quick to apply himself to his chores, and escape to his potential refuge before Dudley rounded up his friends, and became bored.

Harry arrived at the Library and ducked inside. The librarian sat at the desk, absorbed with a crossword puzzle and a telephone call simultaneously. Taking advantage of her distraction, and his small stature, Harry ducked around the corner of her desk, and hurried down the stacks, eventually finding himself in the furthermost corner of the library.

Taking a seat on hard wooden chair, he glanced about. This seemed to be a perfect place to hide out. It was cool, quiet, and hopefully not too popular. Swinging his feet, he perched on the chair, congratulating himself on his discovery. And even better, he was surrounded by books! Harry liked to read, or at least he did now that he had glasses. Harry cast about for something to read, and was dismayed to see that this part of the library seemed to be dedicated to old magazines, and such. He shrugged his thin shoulders and hopped off the chair, as he began to paw through what he could reach, looking for something interesting. He paused as he pulled what was actually a magazine sized book, but brightly coloured, with robots and lasers on the cover! He pulled it off the shelf, cradling it in his arms as he sat down. Taking a good look at the cover, he read the title haltingly "Warhammer, Rogue 40,000 Trader". He blinked, then opened the cover and began to read.

~~~+HP-BR+~~~

Harry jerked, his head shooting up from the book, as a loud voice rattled through the library announcing "The Library is closing in ten minutes". He shook his head and blinked, suddenly worried. He had gotten lost in the book, the wonderful book, and he had no idea what time it was. He reluctantly slid the book back on the shelf, and crept through the stacks. Not seeing the librarian at her desk, he scurried out of the Library and out into the bright summer sun.

As he walked home, Harry's mind raced as he thought about the book. He'd never read anything like it. It was like a story and a history book, all rolled up together! And what a story! During his walk home, his thoughts coalesced into a single idea, one he'd never even contemplated before. Harry knew that when he grew up, he would be Space Marine, a brave protector of the Glorious Imperium of Man.

~~~+HP-BA+~~~

Harry spent the rest of his summer hiding in the library, much to the frustration of Dudley, who quite enjoyed Harry Hunting, but wasn't too pleased with how elusive his prey had become.

Harry's reading comprehension skyrocketed, as did his vocabulary, although only in regards to his beloved Warhammer. He had located a dictionary with the help of a kindly young woman who seemed amused when he shyly approached her in the stacks and asked her what the words "mutation" and "xenomorph" meant.

As his comprehension grew, he came to a startling realization - all the odd things that happened to him: The shrinking sweater, the buzzcut, the teachers wig, and the inexplicable appearance on the school roof all pointed to only one thing. Harry was a Psyker.

Harry had read the books. He knew what that meant. His connection to the Warp was a danger, no doubt there was already a daemon out there trying to track him down and possess him. The only chance he had was to dedicate himself to the God-Emperor and focus all his thoughts on Him should his Psykery accidently manifest. He would also have to practice it, while praying to the God-Emporer, in order to learn control.

~~~+HP-BR+~~~

The sun cast long shadows as Harry knelt behind the shed, his eyes closed and his brow furrowed as he concentrated fiercely, while praying in a low voice - "Love the Emperor, for He is the salvation of mankind." He breathed deeply his voice steady, "Obey His words, for He will lead you into the light of the future" He focused, desperately "Heed His wisdom, for He will protect you from evil" Harry finished exhaling, exhorting "Whisper His prayers with devotion, for they will save your soul" He felt something deep in his chest expand out through his outstretched hands as he continued "Honour His servants, for they speak in His voice" Opening his eyes, his heart raced as he saw a ball of fire, tiny tendrils lashing out and receding back in, and he forced himself to maintain his concentration on both the fire and his prayer, as he completed "Tremble before His majesty, for we all walk in His immortal shadow"

As his prayer completed Harry lost his focus and the fire flashed larger and brighter as his will ceased to constrain it, before flashing out existence.

Harry hissed and shook his finger tips, which had been blasted by the heat of the fire and were red and smarting. But the pain didn't deter his rejoicing.

He had done it! Harry was a Psyker, gifted with power by the God-Emporer!

** WELL in my ideas folder I do have a story file with NOTES on a story that will be about Harry and a twin sister, and they were both marked (given scars and soul shards), so they're connected to each other as well as Voldemort (based off of Harry being able to connect with Nagini in canon because she was one too), and they grow up together and sort of really don't like each other, and they always try to fight and deny their own connection as much as they can. And it ends up that the prophecy's "power he knows not" actually refers to both of them stopping with hating each other and working together to fight Voldemort and fulfill their destiny. :)

** just a vague idea of a crossover with the Yakuza series. i like fics where postwar Harry shows up in the other universe. so it'd be 20ish year old Harry in kamurocho, probably a nice little Harry/Haruka side romance.

Harry would find himself wrapped up in the kind of convoluted gangland plot that's typical of the yakuza series. the success of the story would depend on a good enough idea for the background machinations, and a good surprise reveal about how the magical side of society was involved the whole time

** A fic where Harry plays a charity Quidditch game, maybe the Auror department against the Magical Law Enforcement?

Or a charity game of more or less famous witches and wizards against a professional team and Harry just crushes it, being his usual brilliant Seeker self.

** So, ideas I've had, huh:

1) The summer after Fourth Year, while Harry is grieving for Cedric, the Dursleys force Harry to go to a church they joined while he was away. What he didn't expect was for it to be an anti-magic cult, his wand stolen, and him locked up and shipped away. A fic where that summer Ron and Hermione band together with the Order and Weasley children to find Harry...before the Ministry, press, or Death Eaters do.

2) An AU where Voldemort basically says fuck it and goes full force, attacking New York City with over a thousand Dementors sucking out the souls of the innocent, a giant among giants fighting an animated Statue of Liberty, and a dragon burning people while Harry and the DA hold back the Dementors and Charlie with his fellow wranglers trying to get the dragon under control.

3) Harry, Ron, and Hermione secretly recruit Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, and Theodore Nott into Dumbledore's Army as spies who put are able to stop Marrietta and remove Smith before either become liabilities and help turn Dumbledore's Army into a real third faction.

4) Dudley Dursley is a wizard.

5) Because of their involvement with Harry, after first year, Dumbledore pushes Ron and Hermione to stay at Privet Drive. The Dursleys recognize that Harry's friends need them far more than the Dursleys need the magical world. Thus they treat them like they treat Harry; how does Ron and Hermione cope?

6) The summer before sixth year Hermione goes to a family reunion where she's only remembered as the stuck up 10 year old with no friends. Thus treated badly by her cousins. Which makes things more complicated when her nine year old cousin is a witch.

** Repost, with fixed formatting. I have far too many plot bunnies, most about Hermione. I've tried to assemble them here, with links to the snippets, if any:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3eulrj/whats_a_story_you_would_really_like_to_read/ctit1ya/][Hermione Granger, Mad Biologist]]: Hermione idolises Norman Borlaug, which results in an obsessive interest in agriculture and life sciences.

- /HP/Girl Genius/ crossover: Basically, Unspeakables had a charity project to "uplift" Muggles via a prenatal intervention to imbue some with preternatural technical and leadership abilities. The goal was produce Muggles who could both come up with big technological advances and implement them; some of the big names in technology may be products of these experiments. Of course, they were strictly prohibited from experimenting on wizards and witches, but Hermione Granger had no known magical ancestry. It turns out that you apply the technoleadership treatment to a witch, you get a Spark. I've written [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8z4jo6/hogwarts_getting_an_upgrade/e2g36k7][a snippet]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8z4jo6/hogwarts_getting_an_upgrade/e2g8863][a more detailed background]].

- Around HBP, Hermione thinks back to how convenient it was to have more than one of her to get things done back when she had a Time-Turner, so she [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8yhm3u/lf_granger_twins_attend_alternate_years_at/e2d3w0z][steals part of Voldemort's GoF ritual to produce clones of herself]].

- End of OotP goes horribly wrong: Harry and Hermione go back in time, but can't avoid causing a temporal paradox, and in the resulting mess, Sirius is Kissed, Buckbeak is executed... and they discover a method for structuring the temporal paradox in a way that creates stable time clones. Contrary to the trope, they get along with themselves just fine. Together, the two "families" of clones multiply and develop, preparing to take their revenge of the Wizarding World, hiding themselves perhaps even from Dumbledore himself...

- Hermione brings a hacker mentality to Hogwarts.

  - Before there was magic, there were Bulletin Boards, and telephone exchanges, and her first hack---to check out as many books as she wanted from the library, and not just from the children's section.
  - Sure, she isn't good at making friends with people who don't share her interests. Neither was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick][Kevin Mitnick]], probably. But, approaching a cog in the system and finding just the right words to make it turn it in just the right way? Always a guilty pleasure. If it weren't so guilty, she'd be a Slytherin.
  - Gilderoy Lockhart; she'd be lying if she said that she didn't have a crush on him, but there's no way he would last, always drawing attention to himself like that. And he didn't, but she did learn (from Harry's harrowing account) about Memory Charms---so much more versatile than the Forgetfulness Potion.
  - Learning about the existence of Legilimency was both terrifying and tantalising. Of course, she works hard to get in on the mind games.
  - If that Station of Canon is reached, she manages to persuade Umbridge that for all that she is a Gryffindor or Ravenclaw Muggleborn, she's on Umbridge's side.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/81txb3/discussion_never_written/dv5mx8i][The Sequestration of Draco Malfoy, or "Why didn't JKR have Hermione help Harry Investigate Draco in HBP?"]].

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/14070989/][Crossover with Lovecraft mythos.]] About a year post-DH, Hermione, having graduated from Hogwarts, shows up to take her position at the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures to advance House-Elf rights. She discovers that 1) DRCMC is also in charge of dealing with creatures left behind by ancient civilizations, cults seeking to summon or resurrect eldrich horrors, and similar nuisances; and 2) they are severely short-staffed after the War, so with her versatile skillset, she'll be working on the task force dealing with these nuisances. In fact, she, and Luna (who also joined, having just graduated), are the task force for the moment.

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/66i3u3/lfrequest_hermionecentric_fics_where_ron_and/dgl1v7o/?context=3][On Halloween of 1991, Hermione finds some other place to mope, so there is no Troll Incident. This has consequences.]]

- At the end of GoF, Harry is returned to the Maze with no memories of what happened. Cedric just disappears. "Moody" disappears shortly after. Vodlemort is not heard from again, and neither is Pettigrew. Life goes on. Harry is eventually exonerated, and goes on to play Quiddich professionally after Hogwarts. Hermione either does her Canon career or ends up teaching Transfiguration after Dumbledore retires and McGonagall becomes Headmisstress.

  Around 2005, the entering class of Hogwarts is "augmented" by a hundred Muggleborns, most with dark hair, aristocratic features, high intelligence and general magical talent, and with an increased prevalence of psychopathic personality traits. In the years thereafter, two hundred each.

  Voldemort had chosen a different form of immortality...

** I have a couple of ideas that I hope to make a reality. 1. Hermione time Turner (I know, I know, lol) to the Marauder era to help save Snape from his future demise & stop the Marauders from bullying him. But things don't go as planned, much to her annoyance. And young Lupin is head over heels for Hermione.

1. A female!Harry (bratty female!Draco too) but instead of killing Haddie, Voldemort wants to marry her to unite their magic (ewwwwwww). Oh and Haddie wasn't raised but the Dursley's. Instead, Sirius raised her. Snape and Lupin will play a big role too.

** Laurel Gaunt, Daughter of Delirium - wherein Bellatrix has Voldemort's daughter without him knowing about it, which is all for the best since she's born bereft of magic. Bellatrix foists the unwanted child onto her sister Andromeda, who fosters her with some of Ted Tonks' relatives.

But then, in June of 1995 when Voldemort is being restored to full power in a graveyard near Little Hangleton, Laurel has her first bout of accidental magic. She's a pissed-off goth teen with criminal tendencies, and she's being told by her Aunt Andi that she's starting her magical education several years late and with the secret that she's essentially the daughter of monsters.

And Luna's her new roommate.
