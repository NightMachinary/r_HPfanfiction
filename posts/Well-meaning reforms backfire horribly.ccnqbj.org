Good guys win and set out to change the wizarding world for the better... and in their righteous zeal go too far.

For example, vampires are granted equal rights and representation on the wizengamot, ignoring the outcry from bigoted purebloods. The vampires happily integrate into the wizarding society, while secretly forming gangs for grooming children to become their docile blood-bags. Once the government catches wind of it they cover it up and make it a hate crime to imply that a vampire would suck blood just because they're a vampire. All for the sake of the beautiful utopia they're building.

Or, in an effort to modernize Hogwarts and make it safer, they turn it into something which could hardly be called magical anymore. Children's theoretical test scores improve, but they can barely do actual magic because the boring and sterile environment stifles their imagination.

Any fics like that?


** I don't have any HP recommendations, sorry, but it does rather remind me of some portions of With This Ring, where the main character succeeds in getting legal recognition of non-human persons such as advanced AIs and various magical creatures. Unfortunately, this does make his superhero work more difficult, because demons also qualify as people now.

**** You're on the HP fanfiction subreddit. Which part do you think is ridiculous - the artificial intelligence (Sorting Hat), the sapient magical creatures (mermaids, phoenixes, centaurs, goblins, giants...), the demons (Dementors), or the poorly thought out legislation?

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter might have been the one to defeat Voldemort, but it was Hermione Granger who spent decades working on eradicating the pureblood supremacy. Twenty years after Voldemort's defeat, the magical Britain is finally entering an age free of blood prejudice.
