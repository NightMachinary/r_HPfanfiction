There's some guy named Mars who shows up in the HP world he's super powerful but a loose cannon. He also knows how to block the death curse I think. It was pretty terrible but I really want to read it again. It must be 10 years old by now


** Man I remember this first fanfic I ever read. To those looking M.A.R.S was his initials if I remember correctly and he'd been in exile before returning to teach DADA. Not sure if it was ever on FFNET because I'd read it of a PDF

**** Oh yeah, but I was so surprised at the time that someone had written there own version I was hooked. Then when I finished it and searched for more and discovered Fanfiction was a thing. I've since been falling down that rabbit hole
