I want to read fanfics where Harry is really good with children. There are plenty of next gen kids in Weasley family. Bonus if he is a professor and his students really like him.


** why are people downvoting this? This sub is so fucking weird, man.

OP this is a good thing to be interested in and I'm excited to see what people rec because I feel like Harry would be great with kids

** Dudley's Memories. He's not a teacher, but he's good with kids and all his interactions with his kids are very true-to-character.

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
