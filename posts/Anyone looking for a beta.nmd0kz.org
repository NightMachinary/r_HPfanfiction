Hey everyone! I love reading WIP works and helping out, so I always wanted to try to be a beta (since I don't have time/energy to commit to being a full fledged writer myself). I've been in the HP fandom for almost a decade now and I still read a lot of HP fanfictions. I'm usually not too picky about pairings or plotlines if the execution's good. My only hard line is that I work with ao3-based story and that it has to be a stand alone (as in, I don't want to read other novel-sized fanfics so I understand what's going on in yours, and I don't want to commit to helping with a series from scratch too). I'm not sure yet if I want to be a one-off help or if I'm even looking for just one person to stick with.

I have experience working as a translator and other media-based linguistic services working in languages including English, so I have a great functional command of the language and you can count on my spelling and grammar, too. I am currently in university for biotech, but I have A+ in English language and A in English literature for my GSCE's (British standardized tests that you can use to get into university). I'm not a UK national, but since I finished finished my high school education in a British school, I'm familiar with general British slang and can tell if it's being used incorrectly or if it sounds off/too cartoonish.

I prefer Harry centric fics and my favourite tropes are (in no particular order): Independent Harry, bisexual Harry, Hermione who is more cunning and more of a rebel than anyone realizes because usually only she knows exactly how many rules and laws their next stunt will break, fix-it time-travel, Harry who uses parseltounge more comfortably, Harry gets adopted as a child by a very loving and supportive family who end up teaching him how to kick ass, the Horcrux in Harry waking up when Harry is still a young friend-less kid in a cupboard and helping Harry/growing fond of him, Slytherin house protecting their own, perceptive Ron who acts as a glue to the golden trio when Hermione and Harry both have things to obsess over, Harry adopts young Tom, bitchy best friends Pansy and Draco, unexpected creature inheritances, and I always love having Harry befriend Neville and Luna (as in, they're closer friends than they are in cannon). I love Drarry and Harmony, but recently I've also been enjoying some Ron/Harry fics. Also Harry/Luna or Harry/Neville is cute! I'm really not picky about who characters other than Harry end up with. My most random beloved character is professor Flitwick.

The above preferences are just there so you know my biases lol. Your story doesn't have to be anything like the jumble above. Honestly, I can be sold on almost anything lol. Again, I ask that there are no series here please. I also don't mind crossovers if I'm familiar with the other fandom. Length of the story is something that's not a big deal if I'm really invested into the story-line, but it would be easier to help with shorter works of course. Not sure if there will be any interest in this at all, but if there is please tell me a bit about your story (mentioning how long it is, too) <3

Edit to add that I'm 21 and enjoy smut, so I can beta for all rating. I also love my fluff and comfort fics, but I also really enjoy angst and horror elements in writing too! Major character death is great when it's done well. I'm not really sensitive to a lot of stuff, so most of the things that require trigger warnings are fine.
