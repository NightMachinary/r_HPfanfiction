I'm looking for a fanfiction where Harry Potter swallows fiendfyre during the Battle of Hogwarts. He is fighting Voldemort.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Ron leaving them stranded on the hunt for the horcruxes wakes Harry and Hermione up to the fact that they cannot continue on as they have. They will have to think things through and not trust to luck or a destiny that may or may not turn out in their favour.

  Baby Harry is carefully examined by Dumbledore and is revealed to be a horcrux. Dumbledore, fearful that it might prevent the prophecy, carefully excises the soul fragment with a tiny lash of Fiendfyre- unaware that he was already the third step on the road of the Master of Death. *I do not own Harry Potter or the Harry Potter universe.
