:END:
Looking for a story where Harry goes back in time and meets pre-serum Steve and Bucky. He moves in with them and the become a threesome couple.

Edit: A bit more info is that Harry moved in and was basically a homemaker (ie cooking and cleaning) Bucky and Steve did odd jobs. Steve was always drawing. Harry made potions for Steve for all of his illnesses. I'm also pretty sure I read it on Fanfic.net.


** Oooh. I've read something similar with Hermione and I love it (WIP).
