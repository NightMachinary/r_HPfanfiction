So much has been written about "good" Slytherins including good!Voldemort but also just your run of the mill fic with Daphne Greengrass as the pureblood savior who helps Potter away from his unfortunate Muggle roots.

Any fics where Slytherins are blood purist racists and are treated as the enemy? Getting bored of the good!Slytherin trope.


** There are some weeks where I arguably recommend linkffn(Blackpool) /too/ many times on this sub, and this may be one of those weeks. But I remember one of the first things that caught my attention was that it didn't romanticize the Black family. The author doesn't hold back when crafting a plot about a family who hates Squibs, Muggles and Muggle-borns (and certain nieces who run away to marry Muggle-borns), and how that affects the children who grow up in a family like that.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

*** Huh. That actually looks interesting, and this is the first time I've ever heard the name, so you definitely gave at least one person something new and hopefully interesting. Thanks.

*** Honestly I doubt Blackpool can be recomended enough. It's probably the best piece of fanfic I've read. Like it's so fucking good. Spent an entire gut wrenching day reading it.

** That and the misunderstood!deatheater just remind me of the millions of "chaotic good dark elves atoning for the evils of their race" that cropped up.

**** Like all good stories though, it inspired a number of copycats, many of which had remarkably little skill, and even less originality.

** linkffn(12867536) This is the first story of a 6 part saga.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong as I haven't read this in a while, but this follows almost to a T what you're asking. Harry gets indoctrinated by the Malfoys into muggle hating and basically all the Slytherins in Harry's year and a few above become death eaters. People in the school definitely catch on about halfway through.
