What's the weirdest fic you ever read? Could be a rare pairing, an odd crossover or plot related.

Was it as awful as it sounded? Was it much better than you expected just off the wall?

I'm genuinely curious. There is such a huge archive of harry potter fic there must be some really weird stuff out there.


** I don't remember the name, but Harry found ATLA and decided he was the next avatar. Renamed himself Zuko and everything. I thought it was crack but it was so serious about it?? Idk dude that fic was wild

** depends on weird

Absurd? Lily and the art of being Sisyphus,

Unusual Plot? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28809843]] (ive literally never seen this plot or any variant (basically Harry is literally James) before and I think it's pretty neat. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26333881]] this is also unusual.

cracky and sucky- My Immortal

Cracky and NOT sucky - this one fic where Harry left Ginny at age 40, went back in time, was deaged, ended up with LV, took over the world. this fic, no clue if it's meant to be crack but it sure does read like it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8446057]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8446057]] ,

and this, which I can't sort into a category, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24886249]]

** Linkffn(the wizard and the lonely princess)

an extremely unexpected crossover, and a pretty good read.

A child locked in a cupboard. An exiled princess, trapped on the moon with her darker side. Both wish for a friend. They get that and more.

the first book is completed. Sadly, the author seemingly vanished halfway through the second one.

​

Linkffn(harry mewter)

Harry does the animagus ritual. He turns into the weirdest cat ever. A cracky idea done right.

** They Call Us Dark - crossover with LoTR, featuring a very different Sauron, and Harry being from a unique-to-the-story winged race native to... I want to say Mordor, but it could've been elsewhere on Gondor's borders (or even within them). It's been a few years!

It was... truly unique, and turned LoTR canon on it's head. Unfortunately, it was written by a non-native speaker of English, and it showed. Still, the author did a good job, and if she had a beta it could've been a great fic. As it was, some wording was just... awkward. Took me way too long to realize that calling Harry 'the raven' all the time was because of his hair colour, for example lol.
