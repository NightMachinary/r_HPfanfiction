There has always been much discussion and fighting over who Harry should come to have as his lover. The major 2 choices, however, have always been down to Ginny and Draco, canon against fanon, as it were. Well, why not let the two exist in harmony?

In case it wasn't obvious, GinnyxHarryxDraco, in any style you choose. But! All three /must/ be in character and only minimal changes to each as is necessary to make such a pairing possible! Enjoy!


** In-character drarry isn't a thing. Like, ship wherever you want, but it's /incredibly/ out of character for Harry to want any sort of relationship with a racist, classist, petulant, entitled bully who spent years tormenting him and his friends.

*** I mean bisexuality exists, and Harry notices boys as being pretty or handsome a lot, especially in the later books.

Also since overtly queer characters get books sidelined or even not published, there aren't a lot of them, so we're gonna take others and headcanon them and write nice fics about them.
