I'd accept any fics that are not Snily, Snarry or SnapeHermione. Other than that, recommend away!


** No fic will ever surpass the quality of the actual Harry Potter books. That said:

These are all completed and are of decent quality. There's enough variation that I'm sure there's a fic in there for your tastes. Of all of them, Realignment is my favorite. If you would like some incomplete recommendations as well or some more completed fics of dubious quality, feel free to ask.

** linkao3(The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow)

AU where Tom Riddle takes over the wizarding world early and Harry goes to Dumstrang. Also, this fic has by far the best Triwizard competition I've ever read that is different from the books.

Best fic I've read. Complex plot, well written story. The pairing is Tom/Harry but after 400k+ words it's not hinted at. I don't really like Tom and Harry fics but the plot in this story is unrivalled.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** I am re-listening with my wife all audiobooks again, and I have to say I appreciate her writing again a lot. Not in the great way (some of her plotholes are just big enough for a pair of dragons in heat to hide in), but in small way. There are so many small jokes, tiny scenes (just sentence or two) which makes everything so lively, which are not present in most even better outlined fanfic stories.
