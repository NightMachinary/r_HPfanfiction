I don't care how old he is or where he is at. Could be post epilogue time travel different dimension crossover whatever. an exaple would be like third path to the future linkffn(A Third Path to the Future) plz and thanks.


** linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh) is my favorite post-hogwarts story. It is fem!Harry and time-travel, so if you dislike it, that's fine.

It is one of the best fics with likeable new characters and loads of cool stuff.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.
