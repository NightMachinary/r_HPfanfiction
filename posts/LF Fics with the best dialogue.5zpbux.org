In most Fanfics characters seem to be just monologuing at each other instead of having conversations. While this can be acceptable for more 'grandiose' personalities who want to take control of a conversation like Dumbledore or Voldemort it really doesn't make sense for Harry to make a speech every time he opens his mouth.

Any stories in particular that stuck in your head because of their great dialogue?


** The recent chapters of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis) have some of the strongest dialogue I've read. Snappy, believable and easy to parse. The first instalment, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux), is likewise strong, although it suffers from teething troubles and purplish prose in places.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** I would say that “Seventh Horcrux” has good and maybe even great dialogue.

That said, I've found that people who are writing stories that are written for the sake of /being stories/, rather than for the sake of being the duct tape that holds a wish fulfilment fantasy in one piece, generally tend to write dialogues that are readable and consist of people actually talking rather than someone monologuing and then everyone going “oh-uh-their great and so right and magical core large and their are bestest lite wizards” (homophone nonsense deliberate) forty thousand chapters later.
