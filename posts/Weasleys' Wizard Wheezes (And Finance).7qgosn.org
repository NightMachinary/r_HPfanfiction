Writing some oneshots about George after the war, and I realized that I have basically no idea about Wizarding finances. How much is a reasonable amount for WWW to be making around a year after the war? Ten thousand Galleons? A hundred thousand? A million?

*** This is indeed the nominal exchange rate, but one must be careful in assuming that you can translate prices between wizarding and Muggle worlds using this rate, because purchasing power of currency can be different -- not to mention the host of other economic differences.

Some of those economic differences:

- The wizarding economy is small in absolute terms due to the low population.

- The wizarding economy does not have a banking sector in the sense of banks which create money as Muggle banks do, nor a central bank which prints money. It's true that you can get loans (see: Bagman) but given the nature of wizarding banking as essentially deposit boxes, it is likely that these loans do not expand the money supply because they probably are a literal transfer of cash rather than the crediting of an account with money that did not exist before (as in the Muggle world). It seems that the only way money is created is by the discovery of treasure (and, I suppose, mining). The money supply is therefore extremely stable, meaning there will not be a trend of inflation as in the Muggle world.

- The wizarding economy appears to still be on the gold standard.

- The wizarding economy does not have mass production and is not inclined towards it, given that you cannot automate the enchantment of objects. Innovation is common, but tends to stay on the scale of an individual craftsperson rather than becoming standardised (with a couple of notable exceptions, namely brooms and beauty products).

All these add up to a very stable economy with almost zero inflation and low growth, and a moderately fixed money supply, as well as no "wealth creators" of the kind who in the Muggle world create billions worth of economic value where before there was nothing.

In short, the wizarding economy does not have the capacity for billionaires. What extremely wealthy individuals it does possess will likely have their wealth tied up in illiquid assets like land.

On the other hand, wizards can use magic to satisfy many of their basic needs for themselves. They have no gas or electric bills, no internet or phone bills, potentially no water bills. Many of them inherit homes so they would have no rent or need to buy a house. In short the main expense on necessities for most wizards would be food and clothing, and rent for those who do not have a multi-generational home. Most everything else is a relative luxury. That means the majority of their wages will constitute disposable income. This allows wages to be quite low, relative to the Muggle world, while still allowing wizards a high standard of living. It also allows prices for most products to be quite high relative to incomes, because they are luxury goods rather than common necessities.

As a guess, therefore

*Weasleys:*

Land: 40,000 Galleons

Cash: 0

Income: 3,000 Galleons/year

*Harry (age 16, post Sirius' inheritance):*

Land: 120,000 Galleons

Cash: 100,000 Galleons

Income: 0/year

*Lucius Malfoy:*

Land: 20,000,000 Galleons

Cash: 500,000 Galleons

Income: 50,000 Galleons/year

** JK Rowling sucks at Math and it shows in her world building. My best advice to you is to throw out her Galleon/Pound conversion and make your own. A wand would cost more then 20 dollars just saying.

The 1000 gallons from the TriWizard tournament is essentially nothing with the conversion JK has (like 8000$) and somehow the Twins can buy a shop in Diagon with that? Unlikely.

Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by leadvone has a great economic system that actually makes sense (more so than canon). Galleon to Pound conversion in that fic is the first one I've actually liked.

*** The common excuse is that students don't pay the wands full price, either because of scholarships or other subsidies.
