So this came into my head a while ago, just because Blaise is probably one of my favourite underrated characters and for some reason I don't think I ever read a fic where he was Harry's best friend. I'm hoping to find a fic where Blaise is kind of protective towards Harry but not in a romantic way (romance is okay if they start as friends but I would prefer without). And if someone has a 'Harry adopted by the Zabinis' fic PLEASE TELL ME! Because I would love that!

â€‹

Also if anyone has any Blaise/Neville fics they could recommend, I would love some recommendations.


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8859591/1/Resolution][Resolution by Slytherin's Dragon]] Aurors Harry and Blaise end up back in their 4th year with new identities. Very enjoyable fic. linkffn(8859591)

  In 2013, Harry gets caught up in some powerful magic of questionable origins. Inadvertently, he drags an unsuspecting Blaise along with him back to the past. With a new identity, Harry tries to live the life that he was cheated out of by Fate, Dumbledore and Riddle. Time travel/Multi-house friendship.

  HP&OP. The professors no longer can scare Harry with talk of lost points, detentions or Quidditch suspensions. He's been beaten down for far too long, and he finally has reached his limit. Severus mentors, maybe guardian. Abuse, non-con, AU, evil!Ron
