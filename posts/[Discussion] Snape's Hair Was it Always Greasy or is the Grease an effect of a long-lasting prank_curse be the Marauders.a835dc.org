A common thing in Fandom is to comment on and make fun of Snape's greasy hair, but what if it wasn't always that way.

What if Snape once had long luscious locks that even Lockheart would be envious of? What if they were something he inherited from his Mother beside just magic? What if they became as we see them later in life because of how something the Marauders did turned his hair forever to the greasy way it is later in life?

Has anyone come across anything that plays with this in any way at all?

*** The incident after Defense OWL 1976 implies that his hair was greasy even during the Marauder era. So it is probably also a lack of hygiene, likely stemming from his upbringing.

**** Some people also have naturally oily hair. As in, they wash it every day and it still looks dirty by noon, in which case the solution is to wash it less often or with a less aggressive shampoo. In Snape's case though, I would assume lack of hygiene.

*** I'm of the opposite opinion. He actually cares a lot. He could probably use magic to clean himself up easily, but he has an image he wants to portray. Both to his students, colleagues, and the death eaters. He wants people to think he doesn't care, and to underestimate him.

** Some people are just naturally greasy. And the man feels mightily shit-on by life, so his self care would suffer and personal hygiene is generally the first thing to fall by the wayside there.

*** Greasy hair is a sign of a greasy face in my experience. Less shampoo and more skin cleansing.

But yeah, I think his depression likely plays a large role

** I always thought it came from his childhood...like it's meant to remind us that he was abused and neglected as a kid. His parents probably didn't bathe him or teach him how to properly wash his hair. Idk. Maybe it's a big leap. I just know I've always associated the two in my head.

** have you ever watched the walking dead? snape is similar to daryl in this, who's infamously dirty

i don't even think it was because of depression or something necessarily; he just doesn't care, which jkr pretty much confirmed. he could have fixed it in a few seconds with magic

  Hannah: Why was snape so badly groomed

  J.K. Rowling: Hmm. Good question. Poor eyesight? Did he look in the mirror and believe he was gorgeous as he was?

  J.K. Rowling: I think it more likely that he valued other qualities in himself!

**** Was James and the other Marauders humiliating him at every turn not enough to make him hate them?!! If the Marauders did curse his hair and he despised why didn't it show up during "Snape's Worst Memory"? Besides the only appearance after Lily's death, Snape was concerned was just how loyal a Death Eater he appeared to Voldemort

** I've heard that before. It's a really sad attempt at white-washing Snape and making the Marauders seem more evil (the over arching narrative being that the Marauders drove poor innocent Snape into the arms of the Death Eaters).

The fact that he has greasy hair is clearly a dig at a lack of personal hygiene, nothing more. This is pretty consistent with how he is described physically all the time.

** I'm not sure I've heard of anything like that, but I've pondered the idea a lot recently that he could just like... use a leave-in conditioner like brylcreem (sleakeazy would be an apparent in-world substitute product). Especially if he has to give it a rinse repeatedly throughout the day to keep potions fumes from damaging the crown of his goth style then it wouldn't ever really get to be styled better than soaked hair. And with trying to pick apart book canon and real-life subcultures of the timeperiod characters went through their formative years, like, Snape grew up in the muggle world in the 60's/70's. Greasers were a 'cool' thing then! And even traditional conservative types used similar hairproducts way back through the first half of the 20th century. Muggle popculture only really eschewed those products going into the 70's with advertising for products like hairspray mocking how 'wet' it makes hair look, which just as easily could be turned into 'greasy' by trendy kids that dislike the person for various reasons.

Similarly I feel the way Harry/James hair is described could be well applied to hair that's been stripped from overly judicious shampooing and lack of styling. I've noticed mine gets fluffy and hectic when I'm too harsh on it. And with Harry that could easily be down to Petunia not caring to instruct him on basic haircare, or even provide the means if he knew how. While with James it might be a subtle rebelliousness of not wanting to use the type of product that made the family Hair-Potion fortune. Or more like a messy somewhat 'dry' pompadour, who knows how accurate the comparisons of Harry and James' hair somehow being completely identical would be, having been mostly been given by mournful nostalgists.
