It's the same magical world of Harry Potter that you fell in love with as a kid! Except it's set in the 1940's, the character's names and personalities are completely different, they have been aged up for sexy time, their sexual preferences have changed, it's located in Austrailia. !NoHorcrux, !NoMagic, !NoTimeTravel, !NoVoldemort, !FembotDumbledore, !LiterallyGrey Harry (color TV wasn't a thing yet!). Slight AU. Rated T.


** Yes, thank you! I don't mind any of these while reading, but there's definitely a limit on how many can be used before a HP fic stops being a HP fic

*** Well said. That's exactly what I was going for.

A !Fem!Dark!Powerful!Vindictive!Lesbian Harry is not Harry Potter, it's an OC taking Harry's place.

If you're going to change the world or characters a little bit, that's fine; but at the end of the day I'm reading Harry Potter fanfiction because I love Harry Potter.

**** I don't think his comment was what you were going for. I'm fairly certain they were talking about "HP" as in the universe as a whole, not the character specifically.

Most fanfiction should replace the tag 'Harry P' with OC, then, with your preference, including much of the most recommended fanfics here. I honestly wouldn't still be reading fanfiction if every Harry had to keep strictly to his canon personality, or only be allowed a little bit of change.

A Black Comedy, Seventh Horcrux, Stages of Hope, Sum of Their Parts, etc. would all need to be labeled as OC, because they're most certainly changing Harry's character more than a little bit.

***** No, I know what he meant. I was simply using Harry specifically as an example, I should have included more examples to clarify that I don't like an overload of too many changes.

As for the the examples you mentioned, I've only read A Black Comedy, and although I do agree that Harry's personality is different from canon, the story as a whole won me over with its excellent writing and comedy.

Some changes here and there are fine. In fact, too little change is boring and uncreative. The meaning of my post was just a commentary on taking things so far out there that it's not recognizable anymore.

****** But you can have a Fem!Dark!Powerful!Vindictive!Lesbian!Harry without taking things too far. A daughter of James and Lily that happens to be lesbian, who goes dark --- the vindictiveness and power usually comes with dark!Harry fics. Unless a dozen other characters had changes similar, it really wouldn't be taking so far out.

If you have a daughter born to James and Lily, part of the prophecy, grows up with the Dursleys, and has other similarities to canon Harry, can you really label that character as your original character?

******* Considering that canon Harry is not Dark and extremely powerful to the point where he's good at everything he tries and a girl, and gay, I would label that as a new original character in place of Harry Potter. It's not /Harry/ reacting to a new magical world. It's a completely different person put into Harry's shoes.

And yes, I realize that Dark!Harry is usually associated by Powerful!, or Ambitious! or Vindictive!, or Intelligent! but that leads to my other point about "too little change". Lots of Dark!Harry fics out there. Many of them hit the same points. Starts to get repetitive. Bash the Weasleys, Dumbledore is manipulative, and Slytherins are misunderstood. Got it.

"Oh, but in /my/ fic, Harry's a girl and has a /lesbian/ relationship with Daphne Greengrass, instead of a straight relationship."

...Right. So where's the story about the magical world full of wonder that shouldn't be exploited and ripped apart, and friends banding together and fighting the great evil? Nothing in these 1000 fics? Darn. Oh look, another HP:MoR ripoff just popped up, this time with a "[Harry P., Tom R.]" tag.

Fantastic.

But that's totally recognizable as the same Harry we all grew up with, right?

******** It sounds more like you have a problem with how people write those fanfics than you do with how the "Harry"s are portrayed. Especially since you're okay with fics like Black Comedy, which feature a completely OOC Harry but are written well so it's forgivable.

Annoying. For a plethora of reasons.

********** Yeah, it annoys me too. We'd have a hell of a lot less fanfiction if things went that way. Not to mention you'd be sued to hell and back if you made your own book with a protagonist that was born to a Lily and James, grew up with the Dursleys, is a prophesied child, etc.

************ I mean, if your character is going to a magic school, has all that, has a super smart bushy haired best friend and a red head one... Yeah, you'd get sued. You're not even really writing a HP story if you change enough that you wouldn't get sued. So if you've got that fem lesbian Harry and everything else, you can't really take your story and make it your own.

****** I'm still kinda new to reddit and commening and everything so I had no idea that my comment spanned a discussion. I'm sorry if my reply is late or bringing back a thread that is too old by now.

Anyway, this is exactly what I was going for, not Harry as an individual, but any character that has been changed too much. I usually don't read fics that have Harry as a protagonist, so I did really take it as any character that's too much OOC. I definitely agree that too little change can get boring, nobody wants to read rehashing of the books.

Also, if the main character is OOC, even if it is a fem! Lord Slytherin! mightyallpowerful! whatever! Harry (or anybody, actually), if there's a good reasoning behind his characterization I'm willing to read it, but if it's a fic where I get informed in author's note in the first chapter, that this is not the Harry that we have from the books, and no explanation or reasoning whatsoever behind it, then I usually stop reading immediately.

*** Because according to new reddit rules you cant mention sexy time and underage kids without high chances of beeing banned ^{^} or because teenagers in HP doesnt have hormones and doesnt have sexytime unless they already left hogwarts. And why is it that in 9/10 non-smut fanfics that nobody wants sexy time before marriage? Isnt that a religious thing? Since wizards arent really religious that doesnt really make sence, also teenagers+hormones in hogwarts with broom closets and abandoned rooms? No way they "want to wait"

**** Well, I'm positive Hogwarts' students had plenty of “sexy time”. It's just that it wasn't an integral part of Harry's store so it wasn't in the books. And for it and religion, I know plenty of religious people who had sex before marriage. The banner is stretching thin now as compared to how it was with previous generations.

***** Ohh im not saying all religious people wait until marriage to have sex, i know that to not be true, im wondering if the act of waiting doesnt have its roots in religion and that waiting is in general a thing only found in religious couples? -since we are discussing religion here i want to point out that i am not saying anything for or against this concept, to avoid religious debates as this is not the place for such :)

****** Of course, religious debates is for a different medium. I think that maybe in families that follow tradition (arranged marriages and the like) have a belief that sex is sacred and should be kept only for after marriage. But the lines of tradition are blurring all over the world and becoming less of a norm. Also, maybe other couples just want to wait to have sex (religion and tradition aside). Obviously, it's a person preference.
