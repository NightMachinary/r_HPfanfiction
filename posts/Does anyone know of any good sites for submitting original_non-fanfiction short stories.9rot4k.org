It's all in the title. Thanks!


** Fictionpress is basically fanfiction.net but for original fiction. AO3, wattpad, and livejournal are all options, though AO3 is dominated by fan works and it's hard to find anything with livejournal, and I personally never go to watt pad because I've found the overall quality of the average work posted there to be rather poor.

On another note, I really don't think this post belongs on this particular subreddit.

** There is also [[https://www.royalroad.com/][royalroad]], it is rather famous. You can also check famous fanfiction forums that allow original content like [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/][sufficientvelocity]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/][spacebattles]] and [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com][questionablequesting]].

Lastly, although I dislike it heavily.. Qidian, the famous chinese webnovel publisher does have [[https://www.webnovel.com][an English site]] and supports original English content, though it's mostly about translation of chinese fantasy webnovels. It supports adwalls and premium chapter systems to allow the authors and translators the ability of getting some money, though I'm not sure about the details.
