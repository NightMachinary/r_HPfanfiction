It's October, what have you been reading?

Inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/d1z66w/its_september_what_have_you_been_reading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][This Post]] over on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]].

I don't know if anybody else usually makes these kinds of threads, but I've been trying to keep better track of the fics I read, so I thought I'd share them. And hear what other people have been reading!

So I managed to read a decent amount during the first half of september, but the last two weeks have gone by in a flash. Looking back, it's still kinda a lot!

So! Here goes:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6928496/1/Fade-to-Grey][Fade to Grey by Marianne le fey]] - SSHG 70k+, /favorite of the month./ Hermione travels back in time without her memories. I don't want to give away too many details, so suffice to say: It was great! I highly recommend this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12296750/1/Baby-It-s-Cold-Outside][Baby, it's cold outside by Potato19]] - 70k+ Hermione/Harry. Very sweet - like I-almost-got-a-toothache sweet. They're in their 5th year and Harry joins Hermione for the holidays. I liked Hermione's family backstory in this. Harry works through some trauma. Great stuff.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11706852/1/Beyond-84-Charing-Cross-Road][Beyond 84 Charing Cross Road by darnedchild]] - SSHG 110k+, SSHG as penpals. It's very sweet and I don't mind the alternating perspectives in this (not usually a fan). Snape is a sour old man, who yells at his bird at lot and Hermione has no ambition. I really hated Dumbledore in this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines][Crossing Lines by plutoplex]] - 64k. This was great. Fred and George go back to the Mauraders time. Not a fix-it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6722596/1/The-Northern-Sky-in-Winter][The Northern Sky in Winter by cathedral carver]] - 3k SSHG. A reread. It's really fucking sad.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3245929/1/Accountable][Accountable by Dyce]] - 160k+ SSHG. It's a well-written pregnant Hermione fic, which I've never read before, so that was a novel experience. Alternating perspectives works for this fic. (No smut)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The problem with purity by Phoenix.Writing - 600k+]] SSHG, it feels very long, for most of the fic the SSHG relationship is either nonexistent or they're fighting. I didn't really feel the *tension* in this one. SSHG's work on better communicating was very sweet. Contains a stupidly powerful and intelligent Hermione(and Harry). A lot of patting her on the back for being kind and good and strong and pure. Mostly an enjoyable read, but veeeeery long. (The smut: Most sex scenes aren't described in detail aside from the first one.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621][The Never-ending road]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8051980/chapters/18445861][No Journey's End]] by laventadorn - 500k+ not complete SSHG (fem!harry), currently we're in Order of the Phoenix. The story is really good and doesn't feel like a rehash of canon at all, lots of new fun plot points. Great characterization, no bashing. The Snape stuff: while they don't even touch, he fixates to an unhealthy degree and Hariett is just too young. There's a lot of time spent emphasizing how much Snape feels protective over Harriet. Harriett realizes she's in love with him from age 14(?).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435350/11/The-Incredible-Race][The Incredible Race by Cheryl Dyson]] - SLASH Drarry 50k+, I've read some slash this month, and decided to post my /favorite of the month/ instead of the whole list. It's fun and fast-paced! Aurors Harry and Draco compete in a televised global race. I could tell the OC competitors (and Rita Skeeter) apart even though there was a lot of them. Again, really fun and highly recommended.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5089614/1/Camerado][Camerado by MillieJoan]] - 250k+ SSHG, alternating perspective (mostly Snapes). There's a lot of rehash of canon toward the end. No epilogue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7554031/1/Unreliable-Sources][Unreliable Sources by Marianne le fey]] - 20k+ SSHG. Short and sweet. Hermione is doing a very bad job as a reporter and gets a mysterious invitation to go see a Death Eater.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12218274/1/Unrequited][Unrequited by plutoplex]] - oneshot, Albus Dumbledore has a type. It's beautifully tragic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12492649/1/Thine-Own-Self][Thine Own Self by plutoplex]] - oneshot, a bit of reflection on Tonks. She can often be a bit flat as a character, but this brought out something of her that seemed real.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12534413/1/The-Naturals][The Naturals by plutoplex]] - oneshot. On occlumency and legilimency, contains some really great thoughts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/3/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][Just a Random Tuesday... by Twisted Biscuit]] - 58k no pairings, McGonagall has a very long day. Hilarious and very well-written!


** I recently started on linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) and it's quickly become one of my favourite Ron-centric fics. Highly recommended.

*** Holy shirtballs 1.5 million words! I think the longest fic I've ever read was 800k.

What year are we on? Do you have any favorite parts? Also... Is there romance?

It was first published in January and just update 7 hours ago. That's a loooooot of writing to do in a year, the author must be an absolute beast!

I like the premise of Ron seeing the future. In canon he made some pretty funny accidental predictions in Divinations. I'll definitely check it out, but I won't promise to finish it!

**** I've actually just gotten to about chapter 46 myself, and that's just about the end of second year. It's long, yes, but imo it's done well and actually introduces enough plot points and executes them well, so at least till this point I haven't felt like it drags on.

There is some minor romance, and speaking as someone who absolutely hates the whole children being all adults, I liked how it's done, a little bit shy kids having first kisses and blushing, and a lot of jealousy and childish behaviour due to it, which is refreshing honestly.

As for favourite parts, it's not a particular scene I liked so much as character interactions and development, which are done really well, and the rarest thing, people's motivations and the plot actually seem consistent and make sense!!

And honestly, for my personal taste, I prefer the much longer fics, I tend to binge read when I find something I really like, and I read relatively fast, so it's always a disappointment because everything seems to finish so quick. Case in point, I'm more than halfway through and it's just been two days since I picked this up!

***** Yeah, for me with long fics, it's sometimes not so much about reading a great story, but spending some time with characters that i love.

I used to read a lot of long fics, but I just don't have the time anymore. And I guess as I've aged, I've become harder to please? You don't want to keep reading a rehash of canon.

I like your enthusiasm for consistency in plot and motivations!

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13306252/1/Double-Time][Double time]] Hermione travels back the end of 4th year, except that the original Hermione is still there too. I have enjoyed it so far and its still very actively being updated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12703694/23/Harry-Potter-Geek-of-Magic][Harry Potter, Geek of Magic]] Harry has autism or something similar to my layperson understanding, he is really good at transfiguration and not so great at interpersonal skills. This is another one i enjoyed and added to my list but it doesnt seem like it will be updated very often.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13189098/1/Code-name-Crimson-Hare][Code name Crimson Hare]] caught up on the chapters i had missed since author went on break for a few months. pretty solid AU with harry as a suave thief and hermione as a detective but its rather deeper than many others with good characters and world building so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13371464/1/Time-Takes-All][Time Takes All]] Second story in this series and newly published. Harry/Tonks where tonks time travels back a year during the fight at the ministry and tries to change things by going to hogwarts as a new morphed transfer student. Im not sure what the subs take on this series is but i enjoy it as ive been a sucker for tonks forever now.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/609872/chapters/1098801][Sands of Destiny]] Hermione travels back to marauder era and interacts with that group of people fic. its a bit generic at this point being from 2012-2016 but i never read it before. Its decent but doesnt really do much for me personally.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12683289/chapters/28918347][The Smurg]] War went bad, hermione time travels to the past plot. This one ends up around the 1920s hermione/grindelwald. it wasnt terrible, warning though it has smut in it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16524083/chapters/38706350][Interlude]] Another war goes bad fics, this time Hermione travels to the avengers universe. I rather enjoyed about half of this one, i think it was the concept more than anything that was nice. Warning again, this had sex in it at one point near the end if i recall.

I read and or dropped many others but i cant recall them offhand.

*** Uh! I've been feeling an itch to read some Hermione time travel lately! So I'll defininitly check out double time!

I come from a family of autistic people, so your second read might be fun if I'm feeling introspective.

I really like your list! It feels kind of fresh compared to what I usually read.

And no need to warn for smut for my sake (although other people might appreciate it!). If you noticed... I only warned for smut, when there was no smut (and I wanted there to be) or the smut wasn't explicit (and I wanted it to be).

Thanks for taking the time to write out your list!

** I have a long reading list as I've been busy. But here's what I plan on reading this month (either WIP or complete).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13016242/1/Vacillation][Vacillation]] - linkffn(13016242) Lucius/Narcissa in Lucius's POV. He's a total jerk and there is so much freaking tension between him and Narcissa. Narcissa isn't a docile pushover and they are totally at odds with each other. I also like how the author writes pureblood society, it is very interesting.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14046060/chapters/32352954][A dealer not a Death Eater]] - linkffn(14046060) Severus/Lily in varying POV. Snape deals potion-based drugs instead of becoming a Death Eater straight out of school. Except there's a lot of other issues going on. Severus and Lily face a lot of issues, separately and together, and can't help but be involved in the war...

linkffn(The Futile Facade). This is the fourth in series by murkybluematter. I finally got around to reading ch9 last weekend, plan on reading ch10 this weekend. I really like this story as things are really starting to amp up and Harriet is done with the BS.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11247748/52/Bullseye][Bullseye]] linkffn(11247748) - This is the best Drastoria I have read that takes place in Hogwarts years. It follows canon but not a rehash. There is a lot more added to the story as the book plots are not the main focus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12734980/1/Strange-Attractors][Strange Attractors]] linkffn(12734980) - Hermione travels back in time to when Tom Riddle is at Hogwarts. She's an Unspeakable with slight amnesia
