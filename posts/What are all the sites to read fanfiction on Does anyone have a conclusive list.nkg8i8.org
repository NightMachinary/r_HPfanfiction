** The main two are Ao3 and fanfiction.net but there's a lot of smaller sites. Siye.co.uk is a pretty big site meant exclusively for Harry/Ginny fics

** I don't think a comprehensive list is feasible, since new sites still pop up every now and then and there are still niche sites, but off the top of my head, there are Archive of Our Own, Fanfiction.net, Ficwad, and Wattpad.

*** Ficwad's still active? I haven't been there in years. I thought the place died.

***** Did they ever make it more user friendly? From what I recall it was a slog to try and find anything if it wasn't on the first two pages of any given category.

** even though i (mostly?) cross post my fics to ao3 and ffnet, i generally post and read on fanfictalk (the site doesn't have just hp fics, but the majority of them are hp)

** Ao3, FFN are the main ones. Last I checked HPFanficArchive was still kicking too, but most of what's there is smut (and not particularly great either, regrettably).

Also, I don't think HPFFA has updated their UI in like 15 years, so that's a thing. It's even worse than FFN's, which is a difficult thing to do but they managed somehow.
