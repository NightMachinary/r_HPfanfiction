So, as a trans person myself, I wanted to try writing this as some type of catharsis with the series, or something to that extent - some type of redemption. This is the result.

There's plans to work all the way up to the very end of Deathly Hallows, but at the moment it's pretty short. Hope you enjoy.

  It starts with a prank and some spite to the Ministry - a gender swapping potion, courtesy of the Weasley twins, just to mess with people. So, uh, if this was all just some joke, why the hell does it actually feel... Refreshing? Must just be a change of pace. (Trans!Harry Potter, attempts at daily uploads. Starts with Goblet of Fire.)
