I've searched a lot, but it's very rare to find good Ron and Hermione centric fanfic without any character bashing. If there please do link them below for others to find too. Thank you

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Curious, what character are you getting bashed? Bad Harmonys and Dramiones often include bashing, but bad Romiones are usually bad for different reasons.

Also, are you looking for entire romance Romiones things? Or just cool fanfics where cool things happen but that stick to Romione instead of changing that?

*** The second one, where cool things happens but Ron isn't bashed and Romione still happens without Ron being made "worthy" of Hermione or other way around. Something plot drive with good balance of Romance too.

  In the summer before her sixth year, Hermione finds herself in sudden, desperate need of a date for a family event, and turns to Ron for a favor. But when one little lie spirals out of control, they both end up with so much more than they ever imagined.
