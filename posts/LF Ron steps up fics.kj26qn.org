Preferably Ron-centric fics where he gets ditched by Harry/Hermione/his family but eventually stands out and improves on his own merit. I've read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10960462/1/Dragon-s-Garrison]]) and linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25028839]]) and I really enjoy them, but I want something longer. Ron can be dark, but Indy!Harry-esque dark, not Idiot!Bash!Rapist!RonThDeathEater-esque dark.


** You mean something like indy!Ron? Great idea!

** This isn't really what you asked for... Cuz his family and Harry and Hermione are still there, but it's Ron-centric and it's really good. And hilarious. It's basically Ron just learning dark magic and going with the flow on where that leads him.

  An unsung hero haunted by the loss of his brother's love. An overshadowed youth abandoned by everyone he ever loved. Why the enigmatic Lady of the Lake chose these two as her new champions against the growing threat of the Dark Lord--or why she chose now, of all times, to do so--is beyond anyone's rhyme and reason.But the Lady does what she wants. All Ron Weasley and Regulus Black can do is hold on for the ride.AO3 Exclusive. Canon Divergence starting from GOF's Parting of Ways. Inspired by Dragon's Garrison by underdoglover and Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina by Karmic Acumen.

  Voldemort's return spells doom for the Wizarding World. In an attempt to make sure Harry is not held back by anything that could be detrimental to him Ron is forced to stay away from Harry and coldly tossed aside. On the other side not all Slytherin's are on the side of the Dark Lord. Four of them don't want to serve and just want to be free. Will Ron be their salvation?

Exact same premise which you said, currently WIP, but updates almost daily. No bashing as well, so far.
