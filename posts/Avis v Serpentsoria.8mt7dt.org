I see frequently in ff that Serpentsoria can summon several breeds of snakes depending upon the intent of the caster.

That's fine. However, why does no one do this with the bird summoning charm, Avis?

Since Avis summons (according to the HP wiki) a flock of birds, what's stopping someone from using it to summon a flock of angry hawks? Or better yet, emus or ostriches?

Think of the crack implications! Can someone make this happen?


** First time I hear this about /Serpensortia/, which is mostly (and very justifiably) reckoned to actually be a literal snake-/summoning/ spell that only kinda /looks/ like it's a Conjuration.

But I do want ostriches.

You know, I'm borrowing that idea right now.

That's a pretty weird assumption, even if it's supposed to explain why Draco was able to cast the spell. Still, Book of Spells specifically states that

  for reasons that are still not fully understood ... two categories of creature are easier to create from nothing than any other: birds and snakes

There wouldn't really be much of a meaning to highlight the snake part if we didn't know about spells used to conjure snakes.

**** True, but on the old /Pottermore/ spell-simulation thingie that predated /Wonderbook/ had a /Serpensortia/ page, where if you "failed" to cast the spell, the AI-assistant would tell you "Louder... looks like no snake heard you". The specific reference is on the Wiki page for /Serpensortia/, if you want to have details.

As for why one would make that assumption, well, mostly because it's weird there'd be an easy second-year-spell to create a sapient being out of nothing. Birds are one thing (and on top of their nonsapience, there /Wonderbook/ tells us they aren't /quite/ real birds in behavior and appearance, more like broad simulations), but Draco's snake could speak and be reasoned with...

Was something like that on Pottermore? I know it was on the HP movie page. But movies. Wiki links to the movie page too.

**** From anywhere nearby. The closest wild snake, boom, here it comes. I saw an amusing theory somewhere that the reason there are so few snakes in the British Isles is that before the Ministry put an end to it, wizards drove most of them to extinction because they kept using /Serpensortia/ in duels and the snakes rarely survived the duels. (This is all based on something that used to be on /Pottermore/, per the Wiki.)

Alternatively, there's also the theory that dark families /keep/ some venomous snakes in their home which are preemptively marked with a Dark Mark-like spell so that they can be summoned anywhere by a member of the family. That one's a little more far-fetched, though.

** Or let's double down on the scary factor: Terror birds. Imagine an overgrown ostrich with a beak like a parrot. They are (fortunately) currently extinct in our timeline.

** Well since a group of hawks is called a cast of hawks and not a flock then the spell would just fizzle obviously.

Same if you tried to use avis to summon a waddle of penguins, a herd of cranes, a gaggle of geese, a kit of pigeons, or a murder of crows.

Duh

(A flock of ostrich would work though)
