** His chief enforcer Tom Riddle uses Harry's dislike for the Dursleys to convert him to wizard-supremacism and Harry becomes the third in line. Tom, given his nature of not accepting superiors, eventually murders Grindelwald. Harry, not accepting Tom as his superior, kills Voldemort. Harry takes a liking to Ginny Weasley and makes her second in command. She kills Harry because she disagrees with his ways but she takes a liking to Dean Thomas who wants more rights for the muggleborns and since Ginny is quite neutral, he kills her and takes her place. Dean Thomas is also quite fond of Winky who is bitter that Crouch fired her and that the House Elves don't get a more important say in their status. Because Dean doesn't care about the House Elves' rights, she kills Dean and Winky becomes supreme lady of Magical Europe. Thus Grindelwald's conquest of Magical Europe brings about the House Elves' supremacy over it. Humans are enslaved by House Elves and forced to knit hats and socks all day.
