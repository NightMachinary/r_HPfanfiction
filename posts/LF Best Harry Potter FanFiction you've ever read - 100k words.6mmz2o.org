** My go to answer for this will always be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][*A Long Journey Home*]] linkffn(9860311) because even while certain arcs remain unfinished, each is self contained. It's a masterfully well written story that takes the Harry Potter universe, turns a small detail on its head, and then shakes with some of the most well known tales of all time. The Merlin-arc alone is worth the price of admission.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

*** Is Whisper In The Night really worth it? I started it awhile ago but got very put off seeing Harry practically "complain" about having to hide his true potential (I don't mind a strong Harry, it just feels like he was bragging rather than complaining). Plus the suddenly flirty Hermione, with the additional Harem tag simply ring many alerts of the now cliched "Smart! Independant! Harry".

I'm torn whether to keep reading or not. Any advice?

***** Ah, no, I enjoy lemon, and definitely enjoy harem :P. It's kinda difficult to express this correctly, but it's more about the way the author writes things. Like I said, I know at the first part Harry was complaining, but for some reason it sounded like he was bragging. Probably having something to do with the fact he continuously listed all of his "virtues" that he'd been hiding one after another. Not a bad thing to have all those good points, but to be showered by them all at once is a little overwhelming.

The flirty Hermione part I can somehow tolerate, though I would prefer she started with a more canon-ish personality.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

Technically over 100k words. Gets Luna absolutely right. Probably the darkest thing i've read in the fandom that wasn't a crossover with 40k. The characterization throughout it is amazing, incorporating mental illness into a lot of it, even the background characters. A lot of my favorite versions of characters are in Twelve Dark Moons.

** Two fics I really enjoy that haven't been mentioned here are linkffn(C'est La Vie) and linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is). They're rather similar in that they feature an old-soul Harry returning to Hogwarts and I just really enjoy his mature and humble interactions with others. It is a lot how I aspire to be, so that might be a factor in my enjoyment as well.

** Anything by The Carnivorous Muffin is spectacular. Specifically "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus" linkffn(9911469) though be warned it is very... strange. It is Fem!Harry, but done very, very well. Currently at over 250K words, and definitely still alive. Also, the Inquisitor Carrow series by littlewhitecat, a crossover between Harry Potter and Warhammer 40K, though you don't need to be familiar with it to read. Starts off with Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens linkffn(8400788) at 55K words, but the sequels are all over 100K, and the most recent is still being written. I can't help but laugh every time I read it.

** Gonna have to throw in a vote for On the Way to Greatness by Mira Mirth linkffn(4745329). It's really well constructed slyherin Harry story that avoids a lot of the cringy/cliche elements that tonnes of other stories I've tried reading had.

** Linkffn(When a Lioness Fights by kayly silverstorm) One of the best Fics I've ever read. I go back to it time and time again. It's pretty gory and it's a Hermione/Snape pairing but dang it's good.

** I'm a huge fan of Hermione-centric stories, so I'll link my two favorite ones. linkao3 (Debt of Time) / linkffn (Debt of Time) linkffn (10654712) I'm a gigantic fan of Shaylonnie's Debt of Time. It's being rewritten and updated to AO3 with sex scenes intact, or fully completed on FFN with the sex scenes toned down. It's a bit of an acquired taste, with time travel and all that jazz, but it's technically longer than the bible, so that's fun.

The second one is a Dark!Dramione, post canon. Probably another acquired taste, but they really are my favorite.

*** Have you by any chance read Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin?

Very similar political-ey ness, except the world is larger and more dangerous. Also insanely good writing once it grows out of the first 20 or so chapters of trope-ism.
