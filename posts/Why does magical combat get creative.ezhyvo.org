For literary purposes, it makes sense to have duelists use fireballs and acid and tongue-tying and gusts of wind and hurled debris and transfiguring furniture into attack dogs and sticking feet to the floor.

But in-universe, what's the explanation? Why don't people use boring-but-practical spells repeatedly?

Thoughts?


** Predictability. If all you're going to do is sling the same few spells around, your opponent will be able to better predict what you're doing and better react to it. If you keep them on their toes you'll have a better chance of catching them off guard. This is, of course, assuming a duel and not a group on group firefight, and assuming that simply overpowering or outspeeding your opponent won't work.

And that's where the unblockable killing curse, and many other dark spells, ruin your fun. Because even if you manage to intercept the curse with an object, it still explodes/combusts violently, which isn't exactly great for your health or survival. And on top of that, making a mid-air intercept is rather difficult (try hitting a flying football with a brick to get an idea for the required timing).

Also, in most duels on a relevant level (against Death Eaters) power disparity is a thing and therefore the stronger side can get away with predictable attacks because knowing about them alone does not block them on itself.

**** Sure, but there are ways to write around that. The Killing Curse, for example, you can put limitations on, making it extremely draining to use, or only able to use when you have a true hatred for the person you're trying to kill, similar to what it is in canon. So that way most people can't just Avada Kedavra away someone theey don't know. That would make the exceptions to that rule exceedingly more dangerous than your normal Death Eater.

Like, Voldemort might be able to cast Killing Curse after Killing Curse without tiring, or he could hate all other living beings and see them as worthless compared to him, making it so he could use it on any target. Bellatrix could be so loyal to Voldemort that she holds enough hatred towards anyone who defies him she could use the Killing Curse without knowing anything else about the person. If you want your fantastic magic battles while keeping spells like the Killing Curse you have to put some effort into putting restrictions in place that would make those battles be more reasonable than just using the most effective spells available.

Although my original point is somewhat shown in canon. When Voldemort is after Harry, he uses nothing but Avada Kedavra (unless he's using Crucio), but when he fights against Dumbledore he has to get more creative because Dumbledore is as powerful, if not moreso, than him in terms of magical knowledge/ability and speed. So if he just shoots Killing Curses at him he won't get anywhere because Dumbledore will probably be able to block all of them, but if he does a lot of creative attacks and mixes Killing Curses in with them then he's more likely to catch Dumbledore while he's focusing on everything else going on.

***** Yes, but most people are not on Dumbledore's level, are they? Them attempting such a flashy defence is suicide and against most people, the effective use of a single curse will do the trick.

Assuming equal or similar enough casting speed, the one who gets the first offensive spell out has the clear advantage, especially if they are using area of effect spells where dodging is inadvisable. A magical shield cannot be used offensively, unlike a real shield (eg shield bashing) or a fictional weapon which can be (eg lightsabers). Dodging would be the obvious out, but explosive spells make that impossible (if aimed at the ground under a person).

*** Three or four very different attack options - maybe physical force, temperature, disability without injury, and environmental hazards - plus non-verbal casting, would be enough to get around that.

** For the Death Eaters, sadism. They throw spells that maim and kill in horrific ways because they /enjoy/ inflicting that on their "enemies".

Beyond that, let's look at a swordfight: A thrust to the heart is a reliable and eminently practical killing blow. Even if you're /really/ good at that move, though, you're not going to just spam it like you're in a button-masher. You'll throw a mixture of various cuts, thrusts, feints, etc. both because it's way harder to defend against and because you're having to defend against your opponent's attacks and certain defensive moves set you up for particular counterattacks.

**** In the books at least there seems to be a non-trivial amount of emphasis placed on recognizing and countering hostile spells, which suggests that this is in some way a preferable defense to a shield spell. Maybe it's not as tiring, or allows you to counterattack more quickly, or disrupts the attacker in some way.

Regardless, if you're using a lot of specific defensive spells, they'll position your wand in ways that are easier to cast some spells than others. If your wand ends up high after a counterjinx, then a downward swipe is going to be a lot faster than an upward one, for example. Beyond that, variety in your spells makes it more likely that your opponent won't be as able to use the better specialized defenses against some of them and will have to rely on something suboptimal like a shield instead.

** I think people do use boring-but-practical spells repeatedly, but a good duelist uses other types of spells to win as well. The benefits of animating statues or transfiguration are that you can have another entity that can react/attack, to block spells or to attack your opponent. I definitely agree that some spells are better than others. For a powerful wizard like Voldemort, an avada is going to be far better than a stunner. It can surpass shields and have a more permanent effect. I disagree with another reply's comment on the killing curse creating a lot of shrapnel and explosion. I think the curse actually scorched walls and even proved harmless to an animated statue. I think the damaging killing curse comes from the films. Animated objects and transfigured attacks and other attacks can come from more than one direction. A lot of shields seem to be unidirectional, and it's harder to protect against a dog, for instance, and a killing curse coming from different directions.

In my headcanon, wizards are born with a certain phenotypic range for magical power (a magical core of sorts). You can "exercise" the "muscle" through using magic, though it tires you out and exhausts your magical reserves. However, by exercising your magic you gain more reserves over time. Of course, wizards like Voldemort and Dumbledore start with larger cores and end up far ahead of the average wizard, though it does take practice and exercise, not simply being born with it. Had they not practiced, they would merely be above average.

I'd argue a competent wizard need not factor incantation length into his spell repertoire. Silent casting renders the length negligible. Another reason for spell variety, might be shield variety. I always found it out there was only one shield. Personally, I'd love protego to be an introductory shield taught to schoolchildren that can fend off only mediocre stunners. I'd love for more shields (both general like protego and specialized like a shield against physical attacks for instance).

I also like the idea of protections being placed on protection as a last ditch defense. It makes logical sense and I think it explains why the unforgivables are unforgivable. Rich purebloods would have the best enchanted clothing, and so spells that can bypass said protections would be terrifying and banned. That's not to say the killing curse is too powerful, I'd say it's one of the most powerful spells but you can certainly still conjure or animate to defend against it. I don't think dodging is really feasible. I think a killing curse which is easy to cast except for a hefty power requirement makes for a more interesting fic. It always feels like a cop-out when writers say it takes hatred to me.

** In canon and some fics we do see a reliance on powerful or easy to cast spells. A lot of the Department of Mysteries battle was killing curses and stunners. A lot of other fics focus on blasting hexes or bone breakers.

An in universe explanation is that there is a difference between dueling and combat, and that not everyone fully gets that. Imagine dueling isn't just a race to disarm/defeat the opponent, but is scored based on style as well. Flashy and creative spells would be preferred. Now if you take a dueler and put then in a fight, they are likely to rely on the fighting style they already know.

Compare that to Harry, who is a child soldier. He fights to survive and to generally avoid killing. He relies on a basic repertoire of spells despite knowing many more. He casts stunners, disarming charms, bone breakers, impediment jinxes, etc, and that's about it.

As to whether or not that should be effective in a fic is up to the discretion of the author. Personally I think that a good "fighter" relies on a crafted spell repertoire that is full of spells to kill and incapacitate as easily as possible and to cover for possible weaknesses. A good "duelist" style fighter is more creative and harder to defend against, but can be overpowered by a smart and consistent fighter. Dumbledore level duelist are in a class of their own.

I think that a certain level of creativity and variance of strategy is an absolute must. If a person focuses entirely on dodging spells to the point of predictability, their opponent will cast the types of spells that have instant effects rather than dodgeable "lasers"

If the person focuses on entrenching themselves with physical and magical shields, their opponent might respond with transfigurations to turn those defenses against them.

** In many ways it's a game of rock paper scissors with more variety. To relate to the modern world, imagine what the response would be if someone invented a kinetic shield that robbed everything that crossed it of enough energy that bullets become about as dangerous as it they were thrown by hand. Another shield that protects against light based attacks, etc. You'd probably see soldiers trained to use swords and Maces again. Or they'd be equipped with a variety of different weapons. The best ones would be the ones that could adapt to the attacks and defence they're up against the best.

This is what we see in magical fights, except there are 3 spells that have no direct counter, so if you're not up against someone that can defend against it it's an easy win. As soon as you come up against someone that can, you need to get creative, and you'll probably lose because they're obviously highly skilled while you've only been using a few skills.

Harry does do the boring thing by sending his "signature" stupefy at death eaters. Voldemort's and Dumbledore's duel represents two incredibly competent and hubristic fighters so it makes sense they'd be flashy.

** Two reasons: how magic works in universe, and storytelling.

In universe, the killing curse is the only spell that ignores the protego charm when the latter has been cast correctly. Spells ricochet off the shield charm in a variety of different ways, so you might hit yourself in the face with a reducto if you're not careful. Beyond that, Harry and co prove that even school children can reliably hold their own against more experienced wizards who rely on straightforward magic (DoM fight). It's the spells that they've never seen before that do the most damage to the group - the dark curse that hits Hermione, the curse that makes Ron all giggly (leading to him summoning a brain). If your opponent doesn't know what a spell does, they won't know what to do about it.

Narratively I believe the main reason is that many authors don't want to write “wands are basically just versatile guns” in every fight scene. I'm sure it can be written in an interesting way, but why limit yourself to that when magic allows for an insane amount of creativity? It's more fun to come up with creative uses for magic, in and out of combat.
