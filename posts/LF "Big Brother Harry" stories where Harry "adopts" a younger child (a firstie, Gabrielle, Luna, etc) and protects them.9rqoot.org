Mostly looking for stories where Harry takes a younger student under his wing and becomes their unofficial big brother, actual adoption not needed. I would strongly prefer complete fics but as long as the story is like 20k+ or so it's ok.

â€‹

Something like Hogwarts Dawn by Jeconais and the Harry/Gabby relationship is the kind of thing I'm looking for.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** I read one a long time ago (was completed too) where Harry adopted Dudley's daughter after she turns out to be a witch too and he essentially tells Harry "Take her or we're abandoning her". Harry hooks up with Ginny at some point in the story. His adopted-daughter gets kidnapped at some point too.

There's a sequel where the girl goes off to Hogwarts and finds herself academically competing with the son of the person who'd kidnapped her years earlier, and Hermione was the Potions Professor. I never kept up with that fic though.

Fucked if I can remember the name though. But maybe these details will spark someone elses memory.

** I remember a fic, it's a sequel story where all 6th years have to mentor a first year student and Harry mentors a slytherin girl. It's not the most vital part and I think the story is discontinued.

It's called "First Term" by "HarnGin"

You might need to read the first one though
