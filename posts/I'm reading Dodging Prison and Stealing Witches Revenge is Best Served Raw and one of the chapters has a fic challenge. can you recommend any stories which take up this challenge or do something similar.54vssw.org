[Fic Challenge: Hogwarts School of Witch-crime and Villainy]

Hogwarts is a school for organised crime children. Every magical family has a crime specialty.

Malfoy - Drug running. Bones - Organ procurement. Weasley - Tomb robbing. Longbottom - Cargo theft. Zabini - Cigarette smuggling. Lovegood - illegal wildlife trade. Gringotts/goblins - Money Laundering. Chang - Counterfeiting. Thomas - Art theft. Trelawney - Insider trading. Patil - Piracy. Potter - You choose!, Black - ?, etc, etc, etc,

Ministry must regulate 'muggle crime opportunities', but not actually make it illegal --- Wizarding world must believe there's nothing wrong with what it does. Everything is normal. Old wizard families court muggleborns to apprentice in their businesses. Hermione receives LOTS of offers. Voldemort attempts to become crime lord of Wizarding world. Dumbledore must be MOB (Manipulative Old Bastard), although how dark he is is up to you.

You can start the story from one of three places.

1. Hagrid lets slip Harry's family's crime specialty on the rock, in the sea, at the start of his first year. [Must finish by end of year four]

2. The goblet of fire contract includes a clause that champions must be in good financial standing of their family business. [Bonus challenge: Harry entered as Ilvermorny champion] [Must finish by end of year four]

3. Prophecy reveal at end of OoTP includes line that says Harry must inherit family business to succeed in defeating Voldemort. If you start at option 2 or 3, Harry can, if you so choose, start out ignorant of magical world's crime lord status through MOB's manipulations. [Must finish by end of year six]

Pairings: H/Hr/LL or H/GW or H/CTs [Carrow Twins]

Feel free to contrive reasons for LL/GW/CTs to be at Hogwarts early.

No Outraged Granger Parents.

The Power that he knows not must derive from Harry's criminal activities.


** Hm. Sounds a bit too corny. I'm not certain why the wizards would call actions they think are fine and dandy "crimes".

I'd prefer a story where Harry is the heir of a criminal syndicate, in Wizarding Britain. James and Lily fought Voldemort, but were not part of the Order, but allies of Dumbledore out of neccessity. After their deaths, Remus kept it running, but couldn't approach Harry because that would have exposed him to the authorites. Sirius is in Azkaban because the DMLE finally could pin something on him. Dumbledore knew the charges were false, but since Sirius dodged murder charges before, he thought it was karma catching up with the man. Snape hates James for dragging Lily into a world of crime and vice, and thinks Harry will do the same. He also hates Sirius and Remus for almost killing him and making it look like a tragic accident with a werewolf, James only saved him beause Lily told him to. Petunia and Vernon hated Lily and James not because of magic, but because they ran drugs, protection rackets and an escort service - they are not lying when they tell him Lily and James were criminals.

**** I'm not quite certain. I already have plans for the stories after my current ones end, and it's a bit close to the crack fic idea I had, where Harry inherits some shady obligations from Sirius (who claims to be too sick after Azkaban to deal with it) and has to handle weird demands and contracts for he "family business".

****** Few more thoughts:

What would be the motivation for Harry to engage in crime? If he was raised as a law-abiding good boy, Dursely style, he might resent that and do it out of spite. On the other hand, good Harry being presented by the news of his Family tradition might be more entertaining, but he'd need a reason to start running criminals then - family tradition alone might not be enough. Maybe some knowledge sealed off by his parents that will only be revealed to him if he has proven himself worthy as a heir, and which Dumbledore thinks is needed to defeat Voldemort?

If Remus and (later) Sirius are running the Organisation, he has mentors to learn the ropes. That might also be less entertaining - he wouldn't have much to decide, and would probably simply go with the flow. If they don't, there wouldn't be much left, or the different parts would have either split, or taken over by the competition. That could be gotten around by having the Potters use an oath to ensure loyalty, or a magical contract, maybe stipulating that Harry will have to be educated and trained to take over when he is of age. While it would lessen the danger of betrayal by underlings, they could still manipulate him.

So, maybe remove Remus from the picture, or lessen his influence. Sirius was the designated Lieutenant to run things in case James and Lily died, and with him in Azkaban, the Potters businesses suffered. With Voldemort coming back though, Dumbledore, who has tried to get around the seals and find the knowledge needed, has no choice but to "find evidence that Sirius is innocent", and has him released so he can teach Harry to become a criminal so he can gain the knowledge to defeat Voldemort. Sirius of course will be exploiting this as much as possible to restore the organisation, and do his best to corrupt his godson. Might be best to remove much of the Black fortune, or tie it up in trust funds and other legal hurdles, so Sirius can't use those funds to facilitate things.

Still, Harry having to prove himself means someone or something has to judge him. A person could be bribed or simply be told "we need this to defeat Voldemort", unless we introduce stuff like unbreakable vows or such, which seems a bit contrived for the Potters. Something means there's some Family Magic or whatever, also a tad clich√©e.

So, maybe it's easier to assume that the Potters and their underlings had a magical contract - with obligations for both sides. Obligations Harry inherited, and which, if left unfulfilled when he reaches his majority, will threaten his survival (and hence, his chances to defeat Voldemort). So, Dumbledore has to get Sirius to teach Harry how to be a successful criminal, in order to save Harry. He will, of course, try his best to reign Sirius in, while Sirius will do his best to corrupt Harry. All the while they battle Death Eaters, criminal competition, the law, and School issues.

How would Ron and Hermione react? Ron I could see going along - Harry needs all the help he can get, or he'll die, which is reason enough for my view of Ron. It helps that none of his brothers have done this, and that, as Sirius explains, he can get filthy rich as well doing this.

Hermione is trickier. While she does break any rule that gets into her way, she's not that fond of those who break rules she supports, to say the least, as her prefect days show. On the other hand, Harry has to do this or he'll die and Voldemort wins. And Voldemort winning means a genocide of muggleborns. Dumbledore could try to use her as some sort of conscience for Harry - not by hiring her as a spy, but by subtly trying to make sure she keeps her moral compass somewhere this side of "the end justify the means". On the other hand, if Hermione became disillusioned by the corruption of the Wizengamot and the Ministry, or if she knows that she has no career prospects (due to bigotry, or due to Malfoy ruining her future with lies and bribes) she might embrace crime. Or Sirius might think she'd be like Lily, she just needs a few nudges and she'll be a nice moll for Harry who doubles as an enforcers and Lieutenant, and so sets out to manipulate her himself.

Plot would start say at an alternate year 4 or 5. I'm leaning towards 5, with Voldemot back the urgency is there on Dumbledore's side, and it means the TWT can be skipped. The story would focus on other locations than Hogwarts as the trio works on (re)establishing smuggling routes, take control of brothels and territory back, set up money laundering schemes, and deal with competition - competition which would include Death Eaters.
