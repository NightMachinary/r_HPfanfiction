I'm aware that I may be asking for the impossible, but might as well give it a try: do you guys know any fic with a homosexual pairing (slash or femslash, as you wish) that's actually well-written and interesting and is devoid of bashing or excessive angst?

If at all possible I'd rather the pairing be something sane, as in no Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Snape, but if the story you have in mind is a reasonably non-queasy-making take (i.e. time travel) on such a pairing, that's fine. Similarly, I'd rather no mature content, but I'm not going to balk at the /occasional/ mature scene if the story is otherwise good for more than talking about how handsome its protagonists are.


** Finally my moment has come! Honestly though, most of these I read years ago so I can't be /sure/ there's no smut or of their quality. That said, I did save them so I thought at one point that they were at least decent. I am also including stories about trans people as we're also celebrating the month :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11578510/1/Becoming-Harriet]] - Trans Harry, with a straight OC pairing (I remember finding the OC compelling and he didn't feel shoehorned in.) I remember that sex occurs in this fic but I have no idea if it goes into explicit detail. This is probably at least partially angsty because figuring out you're trans can be kind of a whirlwind.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10755261/1/Descent]] - Fem/Fem Harry/Voldemort, I think this one will definitely push your boundaries/interests, but I'm sharing for other readers of the thread. I don't remember this well, but a quick skim seems to show some 3rd base and a cut to black before it gets explicit.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11197701/1/Yule-Ball-Panic]] - Fem Harry/Hermione, this one I quite enjoyed, the sequel isn't as good but is certainly worth giving a shot at least to see if it's for you. They're fourth year, so (thank god), no smut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9037058/1/Red-Headed-Stepchild]] - Trans Harry, I remember literally nothing about this fic so I include it only for comprehensiveness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3292970/1/Image-Of-You]] - Ginny/Hermione, I quite enjoyed this story, actually I would say I loved this one. Not explicit as far as I can remember? It's been at least 5 years since I read it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9084976]] Ginny/Luna, this story was really sweet. Not explicit.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/562941]] Harry/Ron, I think this one ends with smut? Don't remember. It's an interesting premise at the very least.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6433270]] Ginny/Hermione, no smut but there is heavy kissing. The angst is strong with this one.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11827911/chapters/26692608]] Fem Harry/Trans Fem Draco, there's definitely angst and definitely smut in this one. Once again, including for other readers of the thread.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501]] - My favorite Trans Harry story. Short, sweet, and utterly beautiful.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/]] - Trans Harry, a pretty realistic view into what being trans is like I think. At least I can see how I would relate if I were the same age and also had magic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11458551/]] - Trans Harry, I don't have much to say about this one, I enjoyed reading it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8495269]] - Trans Harry, total power wank ft. extremely powerful women, very gay as typical of the author (I say with the utmost pleasure :p). No idea if this one has smut but enough of her work does that I would suggest assuming it does. Currently on hiatus.

*** Does the current meaning of 'trans' really hold in the magical world? It had a lot of implications and cultural baggage to us, that I can't see existing in a world with polyjuice.

Thoughts?

**** I mean polyjuice transforms you into somebody else, which doesn't solve the problem of 'I want people to perceive /me/ as male/female'. You would essentially be living as someone else and would have to have constant close access to that person to get their hair. Plus polyjuice appears to have some fairly expensive or difficult to source ingredients and is either hard or at least takes months to make so that is maybe not the most consistent way to live.

Mind you, I can only imagine that being transgender would be easier in the magical world. There are spells for hair growth and sweets which can make you sound like an animal so one would think that a potion to alter a voice up or down would exist. Robes are also a fairly gender neutral garment so at the very least, if you are starting to realize that you'd be happier presenting as a different gender then trying it out would be less arduous than it is in this world.

If you then wanted to pursue a more permanent transition then I reckon human transfiguration would probably be involved in adding/removing breasts, altering the body or genitalia and theoretically, everyone with a NEWT in transfiguration could do at least part of that. I imagine there might also be potions which would alter hormone levels.

That's a very interesting idea there. Sure you can force your body into any shape, but even presenting as your desired sex wouldn't directly effect your brain chemistry right. The transfiguration Ron undergoes when they break into Gringotts was all very surface level and I don't imagine it's easy for people to transfiguring Testes into Ovaries or alter their adrenal glands.

You points about Polyjuice are all valid but I mentioned not as a perfect solution, but as an example of how accessible radical transformation is available to the public. If a precocious 12 year old or even just a mildly wealthy child could get their hands on it, well the implications are interesting.

Plus it would allow magicals to 'test drive' their desired gender, if only for a short while.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter meets Cor Leonis. He is not impressed. Neither is the young Insomnian.  

  The Gryffindor paused, blinking at the stranger. He was about his age, wearing a military uniform of all things, and bristling like a Coeurl fixing to pick a fight, his boots were shiny and black, his uniform was clean and pressed, his hands and fingernails were also clean, and there wasn't a single button or seam out of place. Even his sword-sheath gleamed, shiny, clean, and flawless. Stood in blood and sweat stiffened leathers, with mud up to his thighs, dirt under his nails, across his cheeks, twigs in his hair, and his pistols dented and caked with blood after he used them to club the last of his prey to death, he felt incredibly dirty and small in front of the other teenager who was already close to hitting six foot while Harry had only just reached 5'3”.

  He hated him immediately.

#+begin_quote
  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.
