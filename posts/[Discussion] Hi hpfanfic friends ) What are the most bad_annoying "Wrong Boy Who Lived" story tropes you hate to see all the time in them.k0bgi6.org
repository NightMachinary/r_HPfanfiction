Please tell me all of them! Because see I only ever hear about how these stories are BAD, and I want to try writing an actually good one! :) If it's even possible! Is it? :o


** Unrealistic or very exaggerated bashing of the Potters. They can be neglectful towards Harry but there's usually a line. They're his parents after all.

Good luck writing <3

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** The main premise itself of Potters abandoning/neglecting one kid while caring for the other. In real life, bias exists, but it has some basis behind it, nobody just decides that I'm going to igone one of twins.

Might be believable if there's magic involved, or it's massively AU with some solid reason (can't think of any, but then I don't write fanfics :)

The stories I remember who did this well are Harry Potter and the boy who lived, and the whole saving Connor saga, but it's just too much angst for my taste

**** I have a story I'm planning where Harry has a twin (and isn't living with Lily and James or the Dursley's). They don't get along so when Hagrid arrives and takes them to Diagon Alley the not BWL gets very jealous. I think a lot of it will depend on if the twins are in the same House, if they grow closer or further apart.

** My number one thing is the abuse and/or neglect by the Potter parents. We know very little about James and Lily in canon, but one thing we /do/ know is that they both gave their lives to protect their only son without a second's hesitation; it was their first instinct to lay down their own lives to protect their kid's. Yet, for some reason, there exists a whole-ass /genre/ predicted on the idea that they're shitty parents and shitty people who, at best, willfully neglect one of their children for not being special enough.

Its dreadful relationship writing, /miserable/ pacing, litany of pointless side characters, whitewashing of several Death Eaters, bashing of James, egregiously simplistic understanding of the House system, homogeneous characters even among the main cast, worshipful attitude towards Hermione, apparent unawareness of the utilities of a flat character, fixation on the minutiae of canon, and /many/ other shortcomings are all valid issues which prevent it from being anywhere near the pedestal on which many of its readers seem to place it.
