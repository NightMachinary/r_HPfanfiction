I like very AU kind of stories. So what are your faves?


** Arguably one of the best fics, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by The Santi. It's unfinished and chapters 13-17 are only uploaded on DarkLordPotter, but it's a very good read. Harry transfers to Durmstrang after a few months of Hogwarts. It's AU obviously and has truly excellent worldbuilding.

** There's Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]]. Name change? Check. Different school? Check. So AU it basically stops being Harry Potter? Double check. I like(d?) it very much, YMMV.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1992755/1/Forsaken][Forsaken]] is the only fic I've read where Harry gets a name change. It has been awhile since I read it last, but from what I remember it is /very/ AU, features an overpowered Harry, and the plot isn't always the most well-thought out in places. But I did find it to be an entertaining read, at least.

** The Wise One Trilogy doesn't see Harry reach Hogwarts until his fifth year being educated by many different people along the way. It might not be exactly what you are looking for but you may find it interesting. It starts here for mobile:

** I really liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Irish-Choice][The Irish Choice]]. It was ridiculous in some places, but still a very fun read.

** On mobile so I can't link it, but Si Vis Pacem, Para Vellum is a good one with this premise. Sirius and Narcissa take Harry and Draco to Bulgaria after Harry's parents are killed. They go to Durmstrang with Viktor Krum, and Harry goes by Harry Potter-Black.
