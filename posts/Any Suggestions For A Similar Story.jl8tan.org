Looking for stories similar to Harry Potter: Lord of Darkness by AngelSlayer135 . Does not have to be a harem. No main character slash please. Bonus points if Harry is sorted into Slytherin or Ravenclaw, or a different school entirely. Thank you!


** I just looked up that story and one of the relationships are Hedwig/Harry and I REALLY REALLY hope it's not what I think it is...

*** God no. She transforms into an actual girl. I have never come by an actual story with... that... I am both curious and horrified to find out if that actually exists. Probably best not to find out.
