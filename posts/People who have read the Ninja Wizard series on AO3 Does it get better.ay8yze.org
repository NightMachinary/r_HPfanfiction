I'm currently on chapter 5, book 2 and it's getting harder and harder for me to keep reading as I'm growing more and more frustrated with each passing chapter.

Where are the ninjas? That's what I want to know.

Aside from a promising start with Harry travelling into Narutoverse via dreams and practicing, after he got his letter the story took a drastic shift into a generic and standard "super harry fixes everything with his awesome intellect" story, there are hundreds of them out there like that and I'm frankly sick of them.

Aside from the occasional mention of training Harry never uses any ninja skills, as I said before but it bears repeating; it's frustrating as hell reading this story waiting for something cool to happen but instead I keep reading more and more "wacky hijinks with Sirius".

Ugh. Sorry if this was a mean spirited rant but I just felt I had to vent my frustrations with this story.

If anyone has read it, can you please tell me if it gets better? Does Harry eventually use his ninja skills or travel back to Narutoverse? Or will they completely be forgotten about in favour of more bland and stock shenanigans? I want to know if I should keep reading the story or not, well, reading is quite generous really, I'm actually skimming most of it just focusing on the stuff that seems important.

Why even call your story "Ninja Wizard" if a good 60% of your story has absolutely nothing to do with ninjas...


** To be fair, you aren't supposed to see ninjas...

** It eventually crosses over with the Avatar verse as well, and this is the setting the story ends in. It's disappointing because it seemed to have such promise and then it veers off into Weasley and Muggleborn bashing. There was some compelling stuff about how magic shouldn't be kept secret and that the statute of secrecy was a bad thing, but how it resolves it is to venerate the Purebloods and bash the Muggleborns.

** You won't find much mention of the Naruto-verse in the main story. Part 3 and 4 of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/313445]] the side story series has it, though part 4 is just a fluff epilogue of the main series.

Really, you read mad_fairy for the ideas not the compelling plot. If you're skimming for the important bits and don't enjoy the window dressing, it's not going to get better. It's unapologetic wish fulfillment with a few interesting themes thrown in.
