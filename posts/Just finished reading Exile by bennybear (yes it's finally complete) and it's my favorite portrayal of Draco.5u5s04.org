** It's the ultimate fic that centers around a canon at end of DH Draco because it portrays him as the weenie he is. Greatly looking forward to the sequel.

*** There's not enough remaining plot for the sequel though, is it? We already know he marries a muggle named Vivian who he will meet at the new bookstore. Also he'll have 3 children- Scorpius and two daughters. If it happens, it will probably be much shorter than Exile.

*** I think the thought process was that, being a pureblood, it would be his worst nightmare. He was going to go to azkaban, but Harry vouched for him, so they gave him the 2nd worst thing possible.

His Mom recieves the same punishment and she's miserable. It's like 5 years of House Arrest + having to hide + shame from your relatives and everyone else. Draco, however thrives.

True, it's a weak premise, however (imo) it's the only way for Draco to actually appreciate Muggle stuff and reverse his prejudices (getting dropped in headfirst).

*** What struck me as I read the fic was that DM had committed other, more serious crimes, but they went unmentioned.

The epilogue of HP also implies that DM got off quite lightly, if he was able to have kids at the same time as the Potters.

***** I actually think the injustice of Harry Potter is an example of good writing.

Rowling always portrays the wizarding world as incapable of delivering good justice. The government is at first too corrupt, and then after Voldemort takes over it's hardly concerned with justice at all.

Harry and his friends deal with justice like a couple of teenagers with no oversight, and they do it in the moment (rather than thinking about the consequences). Sometimes they throw out rather vindictive punishments. Once Harry casts the Cruciatus curse at a helpless death eater. On the other hand, after a long period of vicious villany, the Malfoys are forgiven for helping Harry out. I don't agree with Harry's actions, but I really believe her would do them.

So it makes sense that DM gets let off lightly. Of course Harry would put in a good word for him. Never mind the attempted murders, Imperius Curse, vanishing cabinet, or fervent ideological support of Voldemort. His mum did Harry a favour when he was pretty hard up - of course Draco's forgiven!

Harry doesn't really get it. He never really understands Snape, and flips between thinking Snape is all evil and all good. Snape is the worst traitor since Brutus, or he's such a paragon of virtue that Harry named his son after him! We readers know that Snape is more complex than that, and part of Snape and Harry's relationship is that Harry can't understand his complexity. Draco is judged on similar terms, although going by their animosity in Cursed Child I think Harry may have come to suspect the self serving nature of the Malfoy's defection.

******* The country was just torn apart by a genocidal regime and subsequent revolution. Developing strong accountability in a society that has never had it before is difficult for the most talented reformers in peaceful societies. There were lots of bigger fish to fry than Draco so it's possible he may have slipped through the cracks. On top of that, Draco had Harry vouching for his character.

******** 'Vouching' in court isn't a thing. It's highly likely the the tribunal that was sentencing him would look into his school records, in which they would find that ever since he was a first year, he was spouting pure-blood supremacy and generally hated those that were not of high-standing families. It doesn't matter who vouches for him, there is a high amount of evidence that says that he could have become a Death Eater of his own choice and committed those acts of his freewill.

Having an important and well respected person speak up for you doesn't have a formal effect on the legal process, but it will have a lot of influence. Do you want to be the person to throw the book at the person who Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, has vouched for? He might even tell the press that you are vindictive - that sort of criticism is bad for your career. This is why in the muggle world, which has so many more safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest and political meddling in court cases, politicians are criticised for speaking about ongoing court cases.

Having friends in high places matters, even when it shouldn't.

********** Except, no one seemed to care about that sort of thing when it was Harry himself in a court hearing. If his name wasn't capable of getting him out of using magic outside in the dark against dementors, I doubt it would clear anyone elses. Not much has changed for Harry after defeating Voldemort a second time, that's made abundantly clear in Cursed Child.

** After reading the first couple chapters I'll say I don't care for it. Too much of the 1st person prose is stuff happening around Draco that he isn't paying attention to and therefore the audience isn't told what it happening. It really bugs me when stories do this. It feels like the author doesn't have anything relevant to say and just wants to dangle irrelevant mysteries in front of the audience.

I'm equally annoyed and bored and I haven't even finished the 3rd chapter yet. Only 44 more to go.

"Draco in the muggle world" is probably one of my favorite fic types but none of them are ever exactly what I want in a fic. Until now.
