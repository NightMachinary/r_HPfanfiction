I really want a story or one shot, hell something in the comments where an IndyAllPowerful!Harry, or whatever, gets all prepped for the supposed showdown where he shows that Dumbledork. And then Dumbledore is just confused, like "what do mean meeting the Weasley's was a setup, do you know how many kids she has, she has to keep them on track somehow. And yes shouting the platform number for muggles is not a good idea." or "The Dursleys put bars on your window?? Oh I did not know that. Cause believe it or not Harry I believed you were safe there and didn't watch you 24/7." And "No Harry I did not purposely keep you from the wizarding world for nefarious reasons I just wanted you to grow normal. And getting bank statements at the age of 10 isn't normal. And Goblins don't like sending out bank statements, they see it as an insult I think."

I just think it would be funny.

Take this as a prompt or request whatever you wants.


** So time for another recommendation of my all time favorite HP fic

linkffn(10677106)

Basic premise is the Scarcrux takes over Harry immediately, but both it and the real Voldemort are crack-fic levels of stupid. It also has a lot of subversion of the more classic tropes in it and is overall a great comedic read.

How it relates to your request is interesting. The Dumbledore in it is pretty much Canon Dumbledore, whether or not you consider him manipulative, but Harrymort acts as if he were the worst of the fanfic Greater Good Dumbledores. One example is Harrymort stealing a lemon drop to test for poison. When it comes up clear, Harrymort concludes that it must be a particularly insidious poison undetectable by modern magics.

Like I said, its my favorite HP fic, and theres much more to it than what I mentioned.

** A couple fanfics to spring to mind is linkffn(Make a Wish by Rorchach's Blot), which takes place after /Order of the Phoenix/, specifically [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/42/Make-A-Wish][chapter 42]]. In that chapter, they discuss the events of /The Philosopher's Stone/(arguably the Dumbledore in this fanfic is one of my favorite depictions).

The other that springs to mind is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Breaking of the Blood Wards)

** The only problem with your Dumbledore's 24/7 comment is up through harry's 2nd year Dumbledore never checked on harry a single time, making the 24/7 comment complete BS (especially considering how Mcgonagall objected to Dumbledore leaving Harry as the Dursleys "...you can't mean the people who live here?"). In fact, when you find out that Mcgonagall didn't check up on him considering her objections at placing him there leads you to scratching your head in confusion.

*** Okay so I'd like to heavily object to McGonagall's objection being proof of anything. She had spent the day watching the Dursleys being /dreadfully dreary/ and /obsessively ordinary/. She watched them /spoil their child/ and /refuse to effectively discipline him/. Nothing about what she saw said they would in any way abuse or neglect Harry (in the usual sense).

McGonagall was objecting to the Dursleys because she was imagining Harry being raised like Dudley. She was objecting to the Dursleys because by wizarding standards, being 'normal' is just plain ridiculous.

She never thought the Dursleys would lock Harry in a cupboard, withhold food, or go full fanon with daily bone-breaking beatings. They did absolutely nothing to indicate any kind of inclination towards that. She thought they'd make Harry into James Potter, beach ball edition.

It's absolutely ridiculous every time a fic brings up McGonagall's reservations as evidence of how she'd always suspected they'd abuse Harry, and it was only her excessive trust in Dumbledore that stayed her hand. She's unconsciously prejudiced to Muggles by simple virtue of being a witch (the same way Arthur Weasley is) and didn't consider their boring and indulgent parenting to be proper parenting for a wizard, particularly the boy who lived. That's it.

*** And it is made worse by Dumbledore's own canon words:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well -- not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”

*** Dumbledore did have him watched and "checked on" by proxy, though. /That's/ the problem here and makes the "ten dark and difficult years" line all the more disgusting.

If Indy Harry or whatever hated him for that reason, I would be fine because it's more than deserved. However, they throw in embezzlement and marriage contacts, which is absurd.

**** Well remember that all fanfiction is AU so once an author decides that their story will contain a manipulative and/or evil Dumbledore they need to develop a reason why.

And the Why has more to do with "Why would you condemn a child to "ten dark and difficult years"? And your so called "blood protections" is not a good answer. Because you could have ensured that the Dursleys treated harry well and had the benefit of those blood protections instead of "abandoning" Harry and leaving him to suffer.

That immediately leads to the story lines that Dumbledore abandoned Harry to the Dursley's treatment because he wants a submissive, easily led child who would look to Dumbledore as a rescuer. Because he's trying to steal the Potter wealth, or their political power etc. Hence the embezzlement and marriage contract story lines. Or he wants harry to sacrifice himself and the Dursley's treatment of Harry would ensure he had no self worth.

Otherwise how do you explain not protecting Harry from the treatment of the Dursleys while under these so called "blood protections".
