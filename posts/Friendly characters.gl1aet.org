I'm looking for stories with really friendly characters that you wouldn't normally see, such as Katie Bell in A Cadmean Victory or Tracey Davis in The Merging. I've never seen these characters portrayed in such a likable and bubbly manner, and was looking for characters with the same feel to that.


** For some reason this is seen as a controversial rec in this sub, but Tracey Davis in linkffn(HPMOR) is a bubbly character and really friendly. A lot of people take issue with the Harry in the fic but I'd say that HPMOR has the best written Voldemort and Tracey Davis in all of fanfiction. That said, while she has quite a lot of really good lines in the work, it should be noted that she isn't a major character.

What's her name in Hufflepuff had a lot of friendly characters too. Probably my favorite SI fic. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]])

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
