Canonically, Voldemort is the Darkest Wizard of all time and the Wizarding Wars would have been more intense if Voldemort recruited Death Eaters overseas as well.

Not foreign Deatheaters, but other foreign Dark Lords that have their quirks. Voldemort recruits then and of course they have their own agendas. Consequently, Dumbledore's international reputation is considered and him being off screen in Hogwarts is explained by him hunting them down with other grand wizards.
