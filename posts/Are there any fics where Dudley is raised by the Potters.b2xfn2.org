** Sorry, the only thing I have is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]]. Lily was out of the house when Voldemort showed up so he went after Petunia. It is unfortunately a Robst fic with all that entails.

*** Thank you. I've found three others so far. One was too short. One badly written and the one I'm starting now seems decent. I'm not expecting it to be popular.

*** Honest question -

I used to really like Robst fics when I was first getting into HPFF. You're not the first person I've seen that dislikes him. Is there a reason why? No one ever seems to answer. I just want to know if it's worth going back to his writting.

**** I personally find his prose a bit stilted and awkward, but that's just me. On a more literary analysis side here's a quote from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/comments/arx32q/what_hhr_stories_did_you_read_that_made_you/egqwa8l/][a discussion on robst on the H/Hr subreddit.]]

#+begin_quote
  He has this amazing talent of coming up with good ideas and then ruining it through a combination of predictability and poor characterisation. H/Hr are never seriously challenged; the enemy is usually stupid or incompetent or both; and he writes Harry and Hermione as such sanctimonious, smug, little gits that I find myself wanting Voldemort to win.

***** Fair enough.

That thread is mainly people complaining about the fact his stories are guilty pleasures, and not well written Nobel winners, though. Maybe time has clouded my take on his stories, but they were exactly what I wanted at that time; an awesome Harry Potter that lives up to Voldemort's equal.

****** No one's going to begrudge you if you still like his stories, I'm just telling ya why some people don't. If you enjoy his fics more power to ya. :)

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"
