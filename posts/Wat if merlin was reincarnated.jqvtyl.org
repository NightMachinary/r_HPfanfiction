** I think Harry or Dumbledore are supposed to be his reincarnation. They are both really famous good wizards in their world. Dumbledore, in his old age, resembles Merlin with his hat and long white beard and they both prefer to serve as advisors rather than taking positions of power despite being extremely powerful. Harry is probably the most famous wizard of all times because he is so far the only one who came back from the dead and he is also, I think, surpassing Merlin's popularity in real world as well.

Now that you mention it, I would like to read a fic where Merlin and Arthur go through a rough patch similar to Dumbledore and Fudge. Even better if Arthur is just as incompetent and Merlin and Lancelot (who is the equivalent of Harry) are the only ones holding Camelot together.

**** If we are to follow the traditional idea of reincarnation, he would probably not react in any way because he'd have no memory of his past life or simply as dreams that he'd dismiss as childish fantasies when he grows older. Even if, by chance, his parents call him Merlin... well I'm pretty sure that most Jesuses don't actually think they are the second coming of Christ. But I guess he would make several jokes about his name in relation with the sayings. Furthermore, even if he somehow developed a spell that would show him his past life, I think he'd be confused since his original name was Welsh (Myrridin, I think) and then the French or the English changed it to Merlin. By the time he'd figure out that he is indeed the second coming of Merlin, he would be pretty used with both the jokes relating to his name and his popularity. Also, I think he'd be quite cautious about mentioning that because people might think of him as crazy at best or a blasphemer at worst.
