Looking for a specific fic I read a while back, though I don't remember much more than Petunia sending Dumbledore a couple letter bombs by owl.

Any other fics where the Dursley's get revenge on Dumbledore for leaving Harry on their doorstep but not by abusing Harry (Such as making Harry hate the magical world/Dumbledore/PUrebloods) would be good as well.

"What if Petunia put the blame where it belonged instead of on Harry?"

**** Look at the upside, it probably doesn't have a shitty rushed ending. Some of my almost favorites would have been better off 10 chapters shorter and by that I mean incomplete.

The Dursleys convince Harry that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane.
