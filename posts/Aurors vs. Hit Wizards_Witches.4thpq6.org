Is it possible these are simply different names for the same thing? Or maybe "hit wizard" is a team/task force within the aurors or something?


** I always interpreted it as Aurors being the equivalent to like the FBI or some other "elite" investigation and apprehension unit. The Hit Wizards are like a SWAT team, they don't investigate, just apprehend dangerous criminals, and the Law Enforcement Patrol was like your local police force.

*** I actually always thought Aurors were the Swat team, while Hit Wizards were like a Black Ops squad or Assassins/Spies.

The DMLE (Department of magical Law enforcement) was the FBI equivalent.

** To be honest, Hit Wizards sounds like assassins, but I'm guessing that's not meant to be the case, so I always assumed that if Aurors were the police, Hit Wizards were SWAT.

** I think the only mention of hit wizards is in POA. Fudge is talking to Hagrid, Rosmerta, McGonagall, and Flitwick about Sirius Black's betrayal. Hagrid wishes aloud that he had known and stopped Black and Fudge basically shoots him down, saying Black was too dangerous.

#+begin_quote
  "Hagrid," Fudge said sharply. "Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered."
#+end_quote

He goes on to say

#+begin_quote
  Black was taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad

** I like to think differently from most of the others in the fandom.

Hitwizards are Aurors who are trained specifically for targets that fight back. I came to this conclusion by the mention of them in PoA that is mentioned below. In the next book we hear ron describe an Auror as "dark wizard catcher" implying that they catch all "dark wizards"

Yet Hit Wizards would have dealt with a violent "criminal" in Sirius Black and it would have taken a team of them to bring him in. that is relevant because Moody, Kingsely and Tonks never mentioned having a partner except when occupying high profile targets. That means I must come to the conclusion that all Hit-Wizards operate in teams.

In the wizarding world it seems that teams (outside of quidditch) function for a higher goal against a formidable enemy. The examples of this are the dragon handlers, the OotP, The Death Eaters, and most interesting, how doing the tasks of the TWT alone (or without getting caught getting help) gave eternal glory. That would give us the concept that wizards are of the mindset that being able to operate singularly is of high importance.

Basically what I am trying to say is that all Hit-Wizards are Aurors. but not all Aurors are Hit-Wizards. My guess is that Hit-Wizards were the ones given the orders "eliminate without prejuice" during the first war.

I think that's my interpretation too. Their described roles just seem too similar to be completely separate jobs.

*** The comment saying aurors are FBI/detectives and hit wizards are swat, seems canonically correct. But I like this one more, especially for the TWT reference.

** - Hit Wizards are SWAT as far as im concerned.

- Witch Watchers are [[https://www.gov.uk/police-community-support-officers-what-they-are][Police Community Support Officers]], thought the mention of Special Forces doesnt make sense, especially in combination with the numbers available.

#+begin_quote
  "Minister Cornelius Fudge was taken by surprise and sent hundreds of Witch Watcher Special Forces to the Village, but when they arrived there he was gone."
#+end_quote

- Aurors are Inspector's (US: Detective) who actively investigate cases. They also do counter-terrorism, and protective detail work.

- The DMLE Department of Intoxicating Substances is the equivalent of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (US: DEA)

- The DMLE Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is the equivalent of community policing and most hold the rank of Constable (US: Officer)

** I imagine the Hitwizards to be the "SWAT" troops. Aurors seem to me like they also have investigative functions. Hitwizards seem like the guys who come in when the small team of Aurors is outclassed and/or outnumbered.

*** No. James Bond is definitely on the hit wizard side of things. He is not the subtle investigator who observes and cultivates contacts over months and years. Bond is the blunt hammer who gets sent in when the operation has already gone titsup, to salvage what is left. He is the high-profile killer everyone in the business knows who is sent to draw the opposition into the light and save what there is to save after everything else has failed.

** In my stories, I usually treat Hit-Wizards as the "Military" of Wizarding Britain, wizards and witches trained to fight in a war. They're generally small in numbers during peace time (where they serve as guards), which means in a war their numbers swell with green recruits. Aurors are the cops, ranging from patrol cops to special investigators. And they look down on the Hit-Wizards, and vice versa. "That's a job for Hit-Wizards, not Aurors; you don't need brains to blow a house up." "Why do Aurors wear red robes? So their boss doesn't notice that they were hurt trying to catch a runaway cat."

** I've always seen the Magical Law Enforcement Squad as the general police force, Aurors as special investigators for dark magic and highly trained in combat, while Hit Wizards are sort of a pure combat force called on for help to arrest dangerous criminals.

The wiki says that Aurors need at least five E+ NEWTs, while Hit Wizards simply have to pass 5 OWLs. No clue where that comes from though. But it would imply there is still quite a difference in capability between an Auror and a Hit Wizard. Wasn't Tonks supposedly the first Auror trainee the took in like 3 years or something?

** In alot of fics I read, Hit Wizards are usually the regular cops, and Aurors are the detectives/investigators, which is weird to me because when I see the names, I intuitively see it the other way around.

The only reason I can see for it is that iirc, Aurors are described as "dark wizard catchers". Few people who break the law are "dark wizards" they're just assholes or idiots. Then I just assumed Hit Wizards dealt with the rest.
