I'm planning to write (or at least attempt to write) a crossover fanfic with Harry Potter and Magic the gathering. I've got a (very) rough outline of how I want to do it but I'm a bit unsure of what kind of personality -and thus color affinity- I want to give Harry.

He essentially ends up growing up on Ravnica, with a guild as his familiy.

Orzhov's Black-White colors based on striking deals and extracting payment at any cost. This would make Harry akin to a sociopathic Devil-like businessman who deals in both monetary and spiritual compensation in exchange for his services. Even after the other party were to expire prematurely.

An Izzet League arcane scientist with an affinity for Red-Blue colors, craving invention and excitement. This would turn Harry into a very dangerous artificer and spellweaver with an unhinged mind that believes safety and regulations are for boring suckers, and that if he were to die in an explosion of magefire that would be the best way to go.

A Golgari Green-Black Harry that grew up amongst the swarm. A version that uses the natural cycle of Death and Renewal as a basis for everything. Think of a Harry that would murder his opponents with flesh eating fungi, letting them spread and reanimate the remains to wander the forests until they're needed. A mostly well-adjusted Harry but eerie in a way that most people can't put a finger on.

Any other guild combination suggestions would be welcome of course but please do describe how you would see Harry grow up to be.


** What part of this will be HP, as opposed to just MtG fiction?

If you change the setting, the character, and the plot, aren't you just writing an original story and naming the main character Harry?

*** The story will follow the setup of the books but Harry awakened the spark within him, making him a planeswalker capable of traveling between Earth and Ravnica.

This would give me the opportunity for some out of the box thinking, interesting story hooks and such while still keeping it grounded in the lore of both worlds.

I want him to go to Hogwards and still resemble the canonical Harry to an extent but with him growing up in a radically different environment his personality will most definitively be altered. After all:

Gruul and Rakdos desire anarchy and revel in Chaos

Azorius and Boros champion Order and Justice

Simic and Izzet despise stagnation and crave innovation

Golgari and Selesnya maintain the natural cycle and enjoy peace in their own ways

Dimir and Orzhov enjoy skullduggery and trickery.

Anyone growing up in one of these guilds would be influenced by them.

** I don't know MtG at all - are the Colours the Guilds you mentioned before, or are they magic types associated with each guild, or something else entirely?

Basically, are the colours the Guild environment he'd grow up in, or are they the end product Harry growing up in a Guild would create?

*** Mtg has 5 colors of magic, White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green. White is law, order, discipline. Blue is arcane, thinking, upgrading Black is death, ambition Red is passion, fire Green is nature, balance

Ravnica has 10 guilds that are each a combination of two colors. They're lead by wizards that perfectly embody the archetype, but the low ranks may be much more one color than another.

**** Ah, okay. So, both then. Well, I think the Golgari Guild would be most appropriate, then. Fits with the themes discussed in canon (Death is Natural, Harry is an outsider, the whole Master-of-Death thing being the big Deus ex Machina of Canon makes Death a nice thing to twist into more interesting stuff in fanfiction).

Though, you could also pick whatever might be most helpful or supporting for your plot. Would Harry being an outsider let you explore more interesting themes? Would an Adrenaline Junkie Harry with a penchant for Invention and Creative Solutions give you more interesting ways to solve the problems your characters will encounter in your plot?

And on your other comment's note - sure, it didn't make him like the Dursleys, but it definitely shaped his personality. His vague passive suicidal ideation, for one - that was a main thing for him in the series, what with him throwing himself into dangerous situations with reckless abandon and rarely any concern for himself living or dying, only ever really wanting to make sure other people made it out okay. That definitely came from the Dursleys. Environment shapes in reaction, it doesn't merely duplicate, especially if that environment is something to struggle against instead of something supporting you. If the Dursleys had treated Harry as family and integrated him as one of them, they'd likely have taught him the same snobbery and snoopery as they practised. There is debate in psychology about how exactly that development goes down, but those are both generally occurring patterns.

** Keep in mind that growing up with the Dursleys didnt make Harry a snoopy fat abuser.

His guild will shape his knowledge and magic formation, but his personality can be his own. He may grow to be a master of death who overthrows the Orzhov with a new, less evil, life/death cycle.

*** Very true, but the dursleys didn't turn him into a snoopy fat abuser because he was never considered one of them. They broke him down until he was nothing more than a meek, self-deprecating shell of a person.

It was only after meeting Ron and Hermione that Harry became more brash and passionate. That he really got a personality of his own because he was allowed to think for himself.

Of course Harry's personality wouldn't be "just the guild but in human form" but it would definitely be influenced by them, if only because they wouldn't abuse him emotionally like the Dursleys have.

** I definitely don't know as much about this as you, but I'll give my two cents because I think this is a /wicked awesome/ idea. : )

I'd consider giving Harry red/white colors. Red embodies some Gryffindor traits (like passion and conviction [which makes me think of Haste]). It'll also be familiar to readers (because it's a canon Gryffindor color), which might help keep them engaged. I picked white to emphasize the whole "Chosen One" thing, and as a symbolic contrast to Voldemort's obvious black---but depending on your plot (ie, whether or not you even keep the conflict with Voldy) this might be unnecessary.

It's not the most fun/unique/creative pairing, but I think it makes the most sense to keep Harry's colors more basic, for the purpose of plot and reader engagement / familiarity. That being said, I'd /definitely/ take much more creative liberties with Ron / Hermione / other supporting characters.

Good luck!

*** I definitely want to keep the conflict with Tommy-boy if only for my own entertainment. And while you're right about white-red being the best for a more canonical harry (passionate, heavily light oriented, champion of justice) I never really bothered with Boros. That's just my own preference in decks though. (I'm actually a heavy Azorius player, there's just something delicious about watching your opponents get more and more frustrated as you're no-selling all of their moves and locking down their deck.)

It's actually why I initially chose Izzet as one of the choices. It'd keep the passionate, temperamental energy of red (and thus the spirit of Godric Gryffindor lives on).

Definitively food for thought though. Thanks for the feedback.
