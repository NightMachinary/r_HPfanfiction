**** True, but I once found that fiction by googling "harry raised by someone other than the Dursley's" ad I still enjoyed it. And even though she is Marge Dursley, she isn't THE Dursley's that Harry was raised with.

**** Well, technically, “The Dursleys” refers to the family of Vernon, Petunia, and Dudley, so though she is /a Dursley/, Marge Dursley is not a part of /The Dursleys/.

But that's semantics, really.

  During the two months she had watched her eight year-old nephews, Marge Dursley discovered that Petunia was a pathological liar, Vernon had somehow been brainwashed by that no good b***h, Dudley was the spawn of Satan, and Harry was actually a good kid.

** These are both AU in that Harry is raised by James and Lily.

Linkffn(6663972) - I'm not very far along, but so far there aren't any ships.

Linkffn(Many Thanks) - The first few chapters focus mainly on Hermione through James's eyes. The rest of the story has Harry growing up as a normal child. This is one of my very favourite fics, let me know if you enjoyed it!

** Two really good ones are linkffn(A Study in Magic by Books of Change; The Katarn Side by Darth Marrs).

The first is a crossover with the new BBC Sherlock and Harry is raised by Sherlock and Watson (this is not the same as A Study in Magic by Vixit, another Sherlock crossover, which someone has already posted here). The second is a crossover with Star Wars (not the new TFA movie) where Harry is raised by an OC Jedi master. Both fics are particularly good.

Stealing Harry, linkao3(987408) is the best I have read. Copperbadge's writing is legendary.

Also The Maddest House, linkao3(72733) where Sirius goes into hiding with Harry in a world where Voldemort never disappeared.
