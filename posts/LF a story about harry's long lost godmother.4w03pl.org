I read a story a couple years back, and I have been aching to read it again. All I remember was that Sirius was still alive and Harry and the gang were all together and found either a pensive, a diary, or some kind of video of his long lost Godmother (which is also Sirius' love) and watched her story. I remember the ending but don't want to spoil it for others. Other than that, I remember it was completed and the author started a sequel to it. If anyone can help me, you would be wonderful!


** I can't help you but this sounds interesting as hell and I'd like to read it too.

*** I read it probably 5 years ago, and of course I can't find it anywhere! It has been driving me mad! Who knows, if we can't find it, maybe someone else can make a new one up!

**** That's usually how it works. Oh well. Hopefully someone finds it.
