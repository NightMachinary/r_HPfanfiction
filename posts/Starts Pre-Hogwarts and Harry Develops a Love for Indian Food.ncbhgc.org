:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I'll trying to find this fic that I read a while back. It starts pre-hogwarts and has Harry finding this magical shop (I'm thinking potions). He gets friendly with the shopkeeper who often orders Indian food (currys and the like).

Eventually Harry goes to Hogwarts, and I belive is sorted into Slytherin. And convinces the house-elves to make Indian food for him. Eventually, others from other tables realizes that he isn't eating the normal Hogwarts fare, and come and help themselves to the food the elves made for Harry.

Pretty sure this story also features Snape, because I'm pretty sure the shop from the beginning was a potions shop. And the shopkeeper is bad at paperwork maybe?

If any of this rings a bell for anyone, please, please, please let me know. I've been searching for it for ages!


** Haha, I'm actually reading it at this moment:
