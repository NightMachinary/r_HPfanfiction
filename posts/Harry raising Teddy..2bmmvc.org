So I know Teddy was raised by Andromeda, but I think it'd be interesting reading about Harry either raising or having significant influence in raising Teddy. He was only 17 when Remus and Tonks were killed, and had Andromeda not been around, he'd have had the responsibility to himself.

So, any recommendations? Doesn't have to be canon pairings either.

** Harry raising Teddy as his own son happens in Teufel1987's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]], an odd, clich√©-ridden yarn that eventually manages to jump a tank full of sharks with frickin' laser beams. The pairing is Harry/Daphne.
