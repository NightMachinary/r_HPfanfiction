By subtropes I mean a trope that is not enough to base an entire fic on. For example, my most hated subtropes are:

Use of Order of the Flaming Chicken or its synonms (Like seriously, Fawkes saved Harry and he calls him a flaming chicken)

Melting Galleons and selling them for muggle money to convert to Galleons for profit. (Besides the fact that the author is treating counterfieting money as cool, I don't think the goblins would've given coins with no security measures.)

Hogwarts Bashing( In some indy!Harry fics where he disparges Hogwarts because it doesn't over eosteric and highly theorttical courses that are near useless for everyday life and extremly hard to learn.)

Unforgivables are misunderstood

No Second Chances! (When Harry decides to be a prat and not forgive anyone)

**** Most Europeans speak (at least a little bit of) English though. As far as I can remember from GoF the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students speak english with pretty heavy accents so it's not like they're magically fluent. As a European I'd say that's accurate and doesn't have anything to do with magic. English people on the other hand aren't known to be very good at French unless they went to private school (which Harry didn't) and have a genuine interest in the language. (which most of these fics don't adress)

***** One can have a strong accent and still be fluent (common in 'professional foreigners' like language teachers). While we don't see them talk much in English, all of the announcements, rules and task descriptions and commentary are all given in English with no apparent translations for the visitors. There is a gap I feel between being able to stumble through a basic conversation in a foreign language and not having any worries about misunderstanding some of the rules of a high-bodycount blood sport.

Also 'most Europeans speak English' comes from a society where foreign language study is a core part of the curriculum from a young age and English language media is ubiquitous. Neither of these is necessarily true is HP. The only hint of language education in or out of class at Hogwarts is Ancient Runes, which I don't think counts. That doesn't mean it isn't taken seriously as a subject abroad, but that would be quite a big difference for Hogwarts which is never even hinted at.

That's not counterfeiting, it's arbitrage, and it's very cool when you do it legally. You're probably right that the goblins would probably have some means to prevent this, but nothing in canon states as such.

Gold may very well be worth very little in the Wizarding World, as would silver and bronze (remember, you only need a PS to transfigure gold. Silver, bronze, and presumably other precious metals would all be fair game). With a massive surplus of alchemically created gold and other metals, the raw material wouldn't be worth much more than the linen and cotton used to make dollar bills. The value only comes after it's minted, certified to carry a certain value, etc.

Neville Longbottom - lost his parents to DE

Dean Thomas - never knew his father because of DE and is believed to be muggleborn because of that which put him on the "to kill" list.

Ron Weasley - never met his uncles because of DE and is from a famous family of bloodtraitors which will put him most likely on the "to kill" list.

Seamus is the only one in the dorm who hasn't lost someone to the DE during the first war - but his father is muggle, so if Voldemort takes over that is only a question of time. And I am not sure what the DE would do to a pureblood witch who married a muggle.

Yes omg, the cleaning out trope is so annoying. Moody Indy Harry is like “she's throwing out all these things that I own, that's illegal”, but come on Harry, she's cleaning your house out for free?! Moody Indy Harry is also like “the Order are using my house, that's illegal” but Sirius gave it to the Order as headquarters when he was alive, and Canon Harry gave his blessing for them to stay there when he inherited it.

People also bash her for believing Rita Skeeter about Hermione playing with Harry's heart but honestly it is not that far fetched to believe a published newspaper- and she doesn't even know Hermione that well at that point.

******** In my country there is a newspaper that has about 40% readership in the population. It's known for printing false information. We actually learn that at school. And (as a western democracy) we have alternatives: TV, Radio, Internet and other newspapers. But their readers (nearly half of the country) still believe almost everything that is written in there.

Monopolism in media is poison and in the wizarding world there is only one daily newspaper. Witchs Week and the Quibbler are magazines. There is no Internet or TV as alternatives. Radio (until the Weasleys) seemed only to be used for music.

I never had any problems in believing the power the Daily Prophet had.

As in, every now and again, she turns in a *really* solid, researched, important story about some scandal or other...and this gives her the credibility to be believed when she's gossiping and muckraking.

- friends with a werewolf who endangered students

- a parselmouth

While she should have known Rita was writing BS, she counted Harry as her son and wanted to protect him. You can see this again when she spoke up against Sirius, but this looks like she is trying to keep them apart. She thought she knew best and would hear anything else. She was not kind to Fleur and she didn't want her with Bill. She can come off as overbearing, smothering, and rigid, so some light bashing could be seen as appropriate.

Molly is always a thief and a rapist. Hardly anyone who claims to dislike her ever uses the things she's actually bad about, which is rather ironic, since those actual behaviors and attitudes are the reason they don't like her character to begin with.

Yeah, she was a control freak who insulted and infantilized everyone around her and bullied people into getting her way, but that's not compelling enough to cause drama or cast her in a negative light, so I made her a gold digger and just had her spray amorentia out of a fire hose at everyone who came near her.

Say if a family can use branches of magic easier than others, or unique types of magic, like parselmouth, then mantaining the "blood" makes it last.

On the other hand, if they just marry to purebloods, then the "blood" stagnates, like the Gaunt line, where they were near squibs because of literal inbreeding.

The thing is, that while you /could/ kill with the levitation charm, that not it's primary purpose. As opposed to the Killing Curse which has literally one use. It is perfectly reasonable to outlaw a spell that can only be used to kill people, has no counter, and must be used by someone who hates their victim. Sure, you could use it for euthanasia, but there is certainly a better, less dangerous way to do it.

I think you misunderstood what they said. Wanting someone dead /isn't/ always equal to cold blooded murder. If you kill someone during a fight in a war, you couldn't call it that, would you? It's war and both sides want the other dead.

If someone gets hit by a lethal, irreversible but slow acting curse, killing them wouldn't be murder either. Especially if they themselves are not opposed to you killing them.

It's also an extremely effective option against anything but a Nundu, so a vital tool to stop rampaging magical creatures before muggles see too much.

Imperio is extremely hard to justify on people, but it does seem to work on animals, so I could see an origin where it was to make handling livestock or dangerous creatures easier, or even as an early alternative to muggle repelling charms, just imperius them to keave, that was damned when someone realised you could use it to mind control other witches and wizards.

Both could reasonably be highly restricted, they're far too dangerous to let just anyone learn, but have their uses.

The only other way (the way that I think someone like Voldemort uses) is apathy. The person you kill doesn't mean anything to you, not even a speck of dust on your shoes.

These emotions, if I am right, can only come from someone depraved and despicable enough to deserve Azkaban. These things weren't made for euthanasia. This spell is a murder weapon, and it is always going to be.

You cannot cast any of the Unforgivables without the intent behind it. You cannot cast Cruciatus without wanting to have pleasure in other's suffering, and you cannot cast Imperius without the need to be in control of others, and wanting them to do things they would never do.

These curses were called Unforgivables because they have no other use than what they do.

Never think that any of them could have been created for peaceful purposes. That is the same as saying that the Holocaust was a good thing.

Wtf no.

When you torture someone for information, you want them to give you information. If the only way they would do that is through suffering, you want them to suffer. But that doesn't mean that you also /have/ to take pleasure in it.

Also, punishing someone doesn't mean that you take pleasure in doing it. If someone hurt/killed someone you love, you want them to /hurt/. You are not sadistic, you don't take pleasure it it. You want them to feel what you/your loved one felt. It a lot different from the perverse pleasure that you are alluding to.

I don't think anyone can produce that much hate. For an average wizard (or a sapient being), hate would be a very personal emotion. But apathy? A sociopath like Tom Riddle should have literal oceans of it.

Also, an emotion like protective love would be the perfect counter for something like a Killing Curse. Think about it. Lily was terrified, she was asking for mercy, but not for herself. Only for Harry. She was begging Voldemort to leave Harry alone. At the same time, she was not budging from her position in front of Harry. No matter what Voldemort said, no matter what he did, she did not move. Not even in death.

She loved Harry, and she'd protect him at all costs. She'd protect him even from beyond the Veil. That kind of love, in my opinion, is something that not even the darkest sides of humanity could triumph against.

BUT, and I cannot stress this enough, I have read in a few stories where saying someones name gives them knowledge or power, such as the Taboo on the name Voldemort. I LIKE the idea of characters coming up with nicknames and other titles or insults to avoid saying the names Voldemort, Dumbledore, or Harry Potter because they are wizards seen as incredibly powerful by most others. But childish nicknames are weird. I would just call Voldemort: Tom or the Dark Lord with older peoples, Dumbledore: the Old Man, and of course Harry is: The One Who Lived. They sound a bit more mature, while still avoiding saying the name.

He is also super tan and hot for some reason in these stories and Dumbledore is always coming up with stupid ideas to have him under his control and Harry after learning all these super tricks from this brilliant school avoids these manipulations like a pro and laughing the entire time

- if James Potter is alive, he is portrayed as a complete asshole. Why would Lily marry him if he was that awful?

- Hermione has book smarts, but apparently no social smarts at all and always blunders through every social situation ever and is such an awful person that everyone absolutely hates her

**** Hermione is strange. Sometimes, she can seem pretty social smart, like when she tried to explain to Harry and Ron what Cho must have felt. Sometimes, she can give pretty debatable advices, like when she told Ginny to try to date other people (though it worked in the end so good job). And sometimes, she can just sound like a B.... like in most of PoA.

The death of one of your classmate's pet is not the best moment to try to explain that Divination doesn't work (which is already a can of worm that should not be opened). Justifying that your cat try to kill a rat because "instinct" (while refusing to do anything to stop it) is a pretty shitty argument when said cat is litteraly the only pet that tried to do it in the 10 years the rat spent in the school. Quickly changing your thune to "you have no proof he did it" (even though Pettigrew made it so every hints pointed toward Crookshank eating him) the second the rat disappear makes it sound like your refuse to accept any responsability. And the less is said about the Firebold debacle, the better (good intentions but she could just have talked to him beforehand).

Like most other character, Hermione is often written just like Rowling needed her to be for the plot (sometimes at the caust of constitency). Though I like to imagine her as a pretty insensitive person that finaly understood the utility of diplomacy around PoA and made effort to better herself, with some shaky steps along the way.

***** I've always attributed Hermione's inconsistent social awareness to her using cognitive empathy more as opposed to affective empathy. She doesn't instinctively feel what other people are feeling. Rather she gathers evidence and then logically deduces other people's emotions based on that.

This means that when she is an outsider to the situation or otherwise detached, her assessments are really spot-on. She can build really accurate profiles of the people around her, and if she needs something or has a specific result she wants (eg. getting Umbridge alone in OotP, wanting to assemble an underground defense club etc.), these profiles are brilliant resources. If Hermione enters a social interaction with a plan in mind, it's likely that she will control that conversation from beginning to end.

There are a lot of disadvantages to this method though. She needs time and the space to observe to build the profile. This mean that it isn't instantaneous and so is quite useless when she is just interacting with others for interaction's sake. The profiles also become less accurate the more emotionally involved she is with the situation. This what happened during that conversation about Lavender's bunny - she was so focused on Divination being wrong that she does not realize that her attempt at comfort was in fact hurting Lavender instead.

It also doesn't help that Hermione is a naturally abrasive person who doesn't suffer fools. She doesn't spare people's feelings even on a good day and will happily tell you that you're wrong. Which is a pretty terrible combination with the poor affective empathy.

I agree about the character development though. Her profiling ability gets more and more refined as the years go by. She also becomes more adept and faster at using these readings to interact better with others. And lastly, she thankfully gains tact and sensitivity as she grew up.

** There are two that annoy me.

1. Mpreg. I categorically refuse to read these books.

2. Random sex scenes, particularly in books rated T or less. This fandom is notably bad for these and it bothers me. If it's rated M or there's a warning and/or easily skip-able then fine that's cool, but it's like authors put this in because the want to characters to be doing something other than just important dialogue.

That said everything else I can think of is situational. For your list for example:

Order of Flaming Chicken. Of this is used by a character like the Malfoys of Voldemort than fine. I'm also not opposed to it being in used in jest. I read a fic one time that used it (among other names) as Voldemort put a Taboo on “Order of the Phoenix”.

I haven't seen melting galleons yet.

Unforgivables again depends. If the fic denies ‘Dark magic' than fine. Same if they argue it's a perversion on other spells, or if it's saying they can be used for other purposes. But saying it's fine while not altering/adding canon I'll agree.

Second chances. This depends, I wouldn't give Ron a second chance after 4th year. Nor the Horcrux hunt either. These issues are too large for me to ignore. Dobby or 5th year Dumbledore are different stories, despite the actions certainly being negative, the intent is notable.

Bashing is a term I personally feel has become over broad to the point of uselessness. I've seen a book tagged as Molly bashing when the author literally just had Harry tell Molly she was overbearing, then apologized in the same scene. I feel like bashing can be okay if done to a reasonable extent in a justifiable situation (ie. a fight, enemies, negative relationships, etc.)

One of the things that frustrates me about the books is how unimaginative witches and wizards are. They can design amazing spells but they never seem to have a creative mind between them to take them in new and interesting directions.

  No Second Chances! (When Harry decides to be a prat and not forgive anyone)
#+end_quote

I think that this one can be done right, in a way. Like, I once read a fic (i dont remember what it was) where Harry /forgave/ Ron for stuff like abandoning him in 4th year, but didn't forget it and trusted him less. I also think it depends on where Harry is in canon; I can definitely see him not forgiving Ron during Deathly Hallows, where he leaves Hermione and Harry (even though there is a slight explanation that could justify it), but no other time, really (even in Fourth Year Harry would take Ron back; he's too desperate for any friends and/or allies).

But one of the ones I really hate is "Ron is only Harry's friend for fame" because I can totally see Ron liking the fame, but I definitely cannot see him risking his neck over and over again just for fame benefits, especially because he doesn't seem to be getting anything out of it other than a perpetual threat hanging over his head from being best friends with Harry.

I really hate the “Ron lets fame go to his head” trope. Ron becomes a big headed ass and uses his fame to step on, a use, and manipulate everyone. He is also usually an alcoholic in these fics, stumbling through life making a mess of things until he goes too far and someone gets really hurt.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Listen here. I had written a grade S rant about that sentence. Because that's how insensitive and inaccurate it is.

But I accidently clicked outside of the Reddit post and I got a prompt saying "You have an unfinished comment, do you want to discard it?" and two options saying "Ok" and "cancel".

Both options discard the comment. SO we lost that amazing rant.

I'll be shorter now:

Saying that there is a slight explanation for Ron leaving is like blaming Ginny for releasing the Basilisk and saying "there's a slight explanation for it".

Which is, to say, bullshit.

Harry has no family to tie him back. Hermione obliviated her family, so she /also/ doesn't have a family to tie her back. Ron is the only one that left family behind. Family that may die at any moment. Family that the more times he stays away from, the bigger the chance is that he would never see them again.

Do you remember the plot of Book 7? The point where Ron left is when the trio had just discovered that the Sword of Gryffindor they were after is a fake and that the true one is missing. So they had a horcrux and no way to destroy it. The quest right then and there became hopeless.

The horcrux (that has been messing with their minds since they got it) wants to separate them. They get into an argument and the Horcrux influenced Ron insults Harry by saying that Harry would never understand since he never had any parents. Harry then tells Ron to gtfoh.

Ron does, affected by the horcrux, motivated by his need to see his family/protect them and by the thinking that the quest was meaningless anyway since they just lost their only lead.

The horcrux had brought all of Ron's fears of losing his family and never getting to see them again to the forefront. It also had been messing with everyone's emotions.

Blaming Ron is like blaming any victim of manipulations and is, by definition, victim-shaming. It's easy to forget that Ron was barely older than the average high-school graduate at that point, yet people expect from him to the experience to fend off the manipulations of fucking Voldemort himself while also perfectly handling his fear of losing his entire family and to continue with a hopeless quest.

And then it turns into them being in a sexual relationship.

On a similar note, assuming that Dumbledore knew about the Dursleys' treatment of Harry, and intentionally ensured he was abused. There's no evidence in canon that anyone knew the details of their treatment, and it's fairly clearly explained why the Dursleys were chosen to raise Harry.

Anything that involves a young teen making magical breakthroughs. HPMOR is the most well-known example of this, although imo it's really not the worst since that's pretty much the point of the fic. I really just don't like when it's thrown in as a "yeah btw Harry figured some magical thing that no one else thought of because he's just that good".

*Harry Potter*: "/Why didn't you tell me you're a/ [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Squib][/Squib/]]/, Mrs Figg? All those times I came round your house --- why didn't you say anything?/"

*Mrs Figg*: "/Dumbledore's orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young. I'm sorry I gave you such a miserable time, Harry, but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they'd thought you enjoyed it. It wasn't easy, you know.../"

Figg was /to keep an eye on Harry/. "the Dursleys would never have let you come if they'd thought you enjoyed it", Figg bloody knows that Harry was being abused, she was to keep an eye on him for Dumbledore. Dumbledore knows that Harry was abused and yet he still let him stay there and made him /go back there/ every single summer.

/This/ is why people treat it as canon. /Because it is./ This is the problem with JKRs extremely shallow world-building. Her lack of concern about implications.

  Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, ‘Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well -- not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.'

***** Yeah i think maybe when I read it I sort of glazed over those bits because they hurt, and also because from experience I know that while adults can know things are bad, they don't always appreciate just HOW bad it is or just what an impact it's having. So I sort of wrote it off as “he knew they weren't nice, but not just how damaging it was” like a cupboard?! Even Mrs Figg wouldn't necessarily know that bit, she'd just know Dudley was a bully and the Dursleys shouted a lot. Which isn't nice, but isn't quite the crazy abusive levels they were in reality. So sometimes when I'm confronted with the fact that even knowing they aren't nice and it was a difficult household - it still wasn't ok to leave Harry there, I have to confront some pretty shitty aspects of my own childhood and all these feelings of being let down and argh. Yeah. It's not the authors faults at all, and it's such an important thing for kids nowadays to know is NOT right, but I find it hard so I have to be careful. Sorry - word vomit there!!

I also hate the evil!molly /ron/ ginny trope. The weasleys, while perhaps not perfect, are people who truly care for Harry and his wellbeing.

And my least favourite trope ever is when Harry is suddenly this superhuman with 12 powers, millions of galleons and the heir to a bajillion houses. Like no. Harry's accounts, while not empty by any means, wouldn't be overflowing in galleons like in some fics. The kid has no parents or grandparents who have a steady income, and the Potters were a large part of the war, and probably used some money in their vaults as part of the war effort. Its also unlikely that the potters are gaining interest from stocks, as businesses the potters had stocks in are probably not businesses profitable today. The last person to truly manage the estate was probably fleamont potter, and his death in 1979 and the assumption that he didn't manage it whilst he was ill suggests that the estate has been left to rot for at least 12 years

Another one that ties into the unforgivables being misunderstood, which OP mentioned, is the theme of unforgivables not being meaningfully punished or disincentivized. Canon does this a few times, too; Lucius tries to cast an AK at Harry at the end of second year and nothing comes of it because Dobby stops him. If a muggle pulled a gun and put it to a child's head, there would be consequences regardless of whether he was stopped before he could pull the trigger. Similarly, death eater ‘teachers' in seventh year use the cruciatus as a punishment. Political extremists overthrowing the government is one thing, provided they have enough support to do so, but nobody makes an effort to explain why the public and even the death eaters themselves are okay with their children being tortured at school. In fanfics, Umbrige is especially guilty of this, usually using the cruciatus as a punishment while Albus is still headmaster. The cursed quill is heinous, but it was ostensibly bait for Harry to try to get Dumbledore to prosecute her so the ministry could accuse Albus of trying to drive her out. If multiple students provided veritaserum testimonies of her using unforgivables on students? She'd be run out of the school by a mob. It'd be a completely different story. A lot of people act as if getting away with being evil in canon means she can do literally anything and she's untouchable.

From what I remember, the use of the Unforgiveables was legalised shortly after the fall of the Ministry (which also means that Harry technically didn't break any law when he used the Cruciatus on a Carrow).

As for why is the public being "ok" with their children being tortured, I don't think it's that strange considering current events. Without going too political, we have seen people being ok with pretty horrible things, as long as they thought they were on the "right side".

People like Crabbe or Goyble would never have imagined themselves into the receiving side of the Curse, so for them it was only a matter of "putting the half blood and the blood traitors at their place". As for the rest, most would be too afraid to act, and the few brave one where not enough to change things.

​

In Canon, Rowling managed to make the whole situation quite realistic, but its true that some fanfics go way too far. It's one thing for Umbridge to use the blood quill on Harry (everybody think he is crazy anyways, so it's not like he could complain), it's another to use a forbiden spell in front of witnesses (though she also tried to do this in Canon, power trip can make someone lose all reasons).

I'm weirdly split on this. If it's alt-POV/canon-compliant and marked as such, it can be a fresh take on canon when done well. Also, if it's a short fic (novella-length or less), I give it quite a bit of leeway (especially as I went this route myself in /Honey and Magic/). When you can only cover the highlights, it's sort of alt-POV by default.

On the other hand, it annoys me to no end when an OC inserts themself into the plot in a long-fic and changes nothing even when they logically should. It's one of the few things that will drive me to write a really negative review.

**** By apologetics, I'm specifically referring to people trying to whitewash the institution of slavery where house elves are the victim. Changing things around so that house elves /have/ to be enslaved as a quirk of their psychology or biology, or trying (and always failing) to argue that it's bigoted to disrespect their culture by refusing take a house elf as a slave. That kind of thing. Usually it happens because someone has a character that they want to be the hero /and/ own a house elf, often Harry, and they feel they have to do some ethical gymnastics to justify him keeping a legally-subhuman slave.

And you're right, canon does have some of that, although nowhere near as much as some fanfics; having characters we're supposed to like and empathize with mock Hermione for protesting slavery, portraying house elves as desperate to be enslaved the same way Jim Crow-era bigots used to claim that slavery was the natural state of nonwhite races, and depicting Dobby as aberrant and hated by the other house elves for wanting to be treated with the bare minimum of respect for a laugh. It's disappointing, but not surprising; we all know JKR has no shortage of bad takes.

Also, I agree, I should probably have been more specific on what kind of fics don't sufficiently change the plot. I suppose the core of what bothers me is long fic insert characters who understand that they can and should change the plot, but just... don't. Usually for fear of derailing the timeline. Often they'll retread canon so thoroughly that the author just copy-pastes dialogue.

If it's short or the OC doesn't have foreknowledge of canon, then that's A-OK. But if I'm promised a self-insert going in the door and get the entirety of the first book, just written in third person limited POV from the authors personal wallflower, then I'm going to stop right there.

Most of the "biological" reasons or whatever we classify the "elves magic is tied to their owner's" is from writers trying to grapple with the portrayal of house elves as the most anti-SPEW people in the canon novels. Because the only other options seem to be to erase canon and make house elves all longing for freedom or to have a plotline that is entirely white savior

I think its dependent on how they approach it. Because canon is really awkward and never really explains why house elves hate anyone attempting to free them the way Hermione does. But it also doesn't justify anything all of the non-muggleborns say related to house-elves. And just saying "elves are brainwashed and don't really know what they want" is also problematic in that it basically is "these creatures aren't as intelligent as us so we will ignore their own self-determination".

A common subtrope is "house elves magic is tied to their owner". While still extremely uncomfortable at best, that actually does work as a canon explanation given we literally don't have anything other than Rowling's absurdity.

I honestly think the house elves debacle was one of the worst things Rowling put into the books because of the aforementioned issues.

*** I remember that I read fic where Harry was super Mature lived alone and in age of 13 Tonks tried to seduce him and then Hedwig turned into women and tried to seduce him too..... It was pretty good before that chapter

And I love my ship like tom/harry and harry/any male... But sometimes the characters are writen in way they dont feel like 16 year old kids but the act like 20 something adults so the fict doesn't read so predatory

** Said it in a reply somewhere but mine is that writers who I usually assume are American get English nicknames wrong. In the UK:

Harry ---> can be short for Henry NOT Hadrian Ted/Teddy ---> is short for Edward NOT Theodore

Those two bug me even though I should be able to just let them go!

I also really dislike Female Harry fics, I can't quite put my finger on why. I think it's maybe because it's usually so Harry can be paired with a male character and it feels a little homophobic to me? Or like comp het.

  Use of Order of the Flaming Chicken or its synonyms (Like seriously, Fawkes saved Harry and he calls him a flaming chicken)

I never imagined that as an insult to Fawkes at all(well, there were a few fanfics where Harry did call Fawkes that, but more out of immediate, fond exasperation than any real malice). It's an insult the the Order, which whoever using the term "Flaming Chicken" believes doesn't deserve so grandiose a name as the Order of the Phoenix, not measuring up to Fawkes' example.

** Familiars: they are so often used as exposition dumps or 'Deus ex Machina'. Example Harry gets a snake because he can speak Phraseltounge and said snake just conveniently overhears everything the antagonists plan against our Hero/s. This often Sucks the tension out of major plot points.

The biggest crime is made when Harry gets a Basilisk because if he uses the Snake it feels like nothing is a treat anymore and if he doesn't then it just makes no sense.

Or how they all decide to believe a smear campaign despite Dumbledore explaining things at the end of the previous year.

That'd be bad enough on its own if he hadn't saved the entire school twice by the end of his second year.

Most of the students, and apparently general public, in the HP universe are ignorant, gullible and thoroughly ungrateful.

He's got every reason to be pissed

** Highly theoretical courses that that are extremely hard to learn? Oh like all the electives that are already included. Like divination the study of vague portents of the future taught by a drunkard. How about arithmacy, divination but with magic numbers. Oh what about ancient runes the study of dead languages. Nah let's look at muggle studies the course so worthless that a canon muggle enthusiast can't pronounce electricity. Last but not least CoMC taught by someone with a third year education. But I guess enchanting, rituals, alchemy are too niche a topic to have in magic school.

Harry becoming super smart in 2/3/4th year ('Harry decided enough was enough and he would use his intelligence' and similar descriptions) without any character growth or other explanation
