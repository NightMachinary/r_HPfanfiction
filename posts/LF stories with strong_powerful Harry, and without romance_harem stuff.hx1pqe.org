Hey,

So, I am looking for stories with a powerful Harry. I also don't care if he is ridiculously op as long it isn't some fic where Harry goes around and acts like an arrogant, spoiled brat.\\
Something with a Harry similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] (yes, there was some 'romance' but just a little)... or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]]

My aim is to find a story that is focused on Harry and his rise to power, him shaping the world, or influencing his environment due to his strength. Something where he crushes his enemies and humiliates Death Eaters into the ground... and acts on the overall just badass.

But no Harry that is running around chasing skirts, please. Romance is more often than not adding nothing of relevance to the story, and I am getting sick of reading stories where 14y olds have the sexual drive of young adults...\\
There are some good stories with romance that deliver an interesting side-character/partner, but these are few... most are just beauties that only exist to make the mc look more awesome in the eyes of the reader.

Anyway, I would love some suggestions. Thanks!


** I have to laugh at the 'sex drives of adults' comment. Didn't you go through puberty? Hormones are a hell of a thing.

I have certainly 'calmed down' in that regard since I was 14 years old...

*** Yeah, but it was more just talking and only kissing/snogging. Some stories have them all act as if shagging your classmate is the second-best thing after ice cream...

Ps: Thanks for the suggestion so far :)

**** Again, maybe I was just a lucky teenager, but I had sex pretty early. While I have no interest in using my fanfics to graphically describe underage people 'doing the deed', I am pretty surprised at how puritanical this community is. I was barely in high school before i was sexually active. If I had been in a poorly supervised boarding school, hundreds of miles from my parents...?

If anything, the smut fics are probably more accurate than any others lol.

***** Yeah, no, op is just full of shit and you're the one who's right. There's nothing more horny than a teenager, especially if it's a boy. Guys who say they weren't constantly talking about sex with their bros in middle school and high school didn't have any friends to talk with or they're lying.

****** Constant or regular talking about sex is a rather disturbing habit for a 14-year old ish kid... You talk when it fits the situation (while playing GTA San Andreas during that special mission), but too much just gets odd...

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
