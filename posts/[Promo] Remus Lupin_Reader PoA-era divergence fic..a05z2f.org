Hey, everyone! I've been a semi-lurker of this subreddit for a very long time. This place has been one of my primary motivations in writing my first HP series, so I thought I'd toss my meager offerings into the ring.

My genre across fandoms is second-person narrative Reader-insert fics. If those words haven't scared you away yet, I'm really looking forward to what I've got in store--a surprising amount of research is going into this, and I'm having a lot of fun so far!

It's half-romance, half-Hogwarts-student-fantasy, all as-in-character-as-possible slow burn goodness, featuring interactions with a bunch of side characters I've been dying to write.

Either way, thanks for your time!
