** linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel). Humorous and fairly short story where Hermione travels back to her 1 or 2 year old body and Dumbledore does the actual fighting.

*** This sounds absolutely epic. I can just imagine a little Hermione running around saying "LISTEN TO ME!"

I did recently read a fic where Harry and Hermione actually have met as toddlers and Hermione's first word is Hawwy (Harry). Was adorable.

***** The Vanishing Cabinet Of Time.

But in case you were wondering, its not about them as toddlers though, it just references it (when modified memories are unlocked), and fairly briefly.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
