  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

** I read Thirty Years On: The Man Behind the Mystery and to welcome you home recently and loved them. They're oneshots-but amazingly funny and sweet.

You might enjoy Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood as well, it is Harry post-war but it's well past the epilogue when Harry, Ron and Hermione are significantly older.

  Tabitha beamed. “I wanted to run an idea by you. We were thinking, you see. It's coming up to the end of October, which means the anniversary of your first defeat of You-Know-Who. Thirty years! So we thought it'd be great to have a whole feature on, you know -- your life now. The Boy Who Lived -- Thirty Years On. No Longer a Boy ...” She was leaning forwards now, tone hushed, fingers wiggling to emphasise the supposed enthrall of this title. “We'll interview you, ask you all about how things have changed for you -- and we were thinking we'd go to Godric's Hollow, where it happened, to do it --”Harry blinked. “You want to go to the scene of my parents' death to ask me about my life?”“It adds an emotional dimension, you see,” explained Tabitha, apparently without irony.“There is already a fairly emotional dimension for me,” said Harry. “You know, since they died and everything.”

** Have a look at the mischiefmanaged!verse by irnan.

It's a series of 20 connected one-shots that all take place after canon and are epilogue-compliant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/13075][mischiefmanaged!verse by irnan]]

Series summary: Post!dh headcanon, epilogue-compliant; a continuation of irnan's fascination with the question of what-came-after-the-happy-ending. Not in chronological order; but hopefully, doesn't need to be. 20 stories ~50k words all in all

  It is nearly eleven years since Harry defeated Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts. Life for the youngest Head Auror ever appointed is busy and chaotic, but it's good. Not everyone in the wizarding world, however, is content. When a mysterious artefact is stolen from the Ministry of Magic and someone Harry had never expected to see again returns, a new adventure begins.

linkffn(These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo) - from what I remember, more focused on how Harry & co cope emotionally after the war than War Is Over, but there's still plot to be had; also has a sequel, linkffn(Some Cuts Leave Scars by Melindaleo).
