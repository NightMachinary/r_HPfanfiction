:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've tried searching for this fic for years but it's either been deleted or I've not been successful.

It's a crossover with fall out boy, there may be other bands such as P!ATD, not really sure, but it mainly focuses in the Harry Potter universe. What I can remember is that harry can sing really well but noone knows, he also plays the guitar. He is living with Sirius and remus and they know the band members who come over to practice. Harry watches them play a song and wants to learn how to dance/perform.

One night he sneaks into the practice room and sings his own song but Pete from FOB finds him and strikes a deal where harry pretends to have guitar lessons with him; when actually he practising a performance for a competition that the band members are going to.

Harry also sings Take me home by Jess Glynne while Pete is playing the piano. But he eventually confronts remus and basically sings in front of him before the show. Sirius finds out when harry gets up on the stage as the last act.

If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it!
