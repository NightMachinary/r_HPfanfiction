For some reason , I felt like reading some and the ones I found were kinda crappy. If you guys have any good ones please let me know.


** I enjoyed Linkffn(I'm A What!), in which teen Severus Snape turns into Selena Prince and gets tutored by his/her grandmother on how to be a girl. It's up for adoption because random-fruitcake04 wanted to focus on her Ron-centric story Choices, but it's still a nice story.

I'd self-plug my Hermione-is-Salazar story but it doesn't read like a gender bender

  AU! No Voldemort and Death Eaters. Female!Severus. Waking up as a female isn't something Severus Snape had in mind on one chilly November. THIS STORY IS NOW UP FOR ADOPTION! IF INTERESTED, PLEASE SEND A PM!

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they called her- and yet...Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar?

** They're short, and just the initial scenes to what feels like could be longer genderswap fics, but, "The Matron of Hogwarts" linkffn(11933058) ch. 8, "Trouble Through the Ages" linkffn(11372853) ch. 9.

Then, this Percy/Oliver fic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304901][A Learning Opportunity]] on AO3 wasn't half bad for a genderswap fic if you don't mind slash.

*** I'll second this one. It's a really great "freaky Friday" type plot. Although I did hear the sequel sucked so I didn't bother.
