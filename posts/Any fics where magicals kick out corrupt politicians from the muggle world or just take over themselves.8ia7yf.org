** The corruption aspect is nonexistent, but Rise of the Wizards kinda fits.

*** Is there bashing? If so, how much?

**** There is some bashing, but if you read it the whole way through, it's done in a fairly reasonable manner, not completely out of left field or anything, there's in-universe justification for it.

I can explain a bit further if you're okay with knowing bots of the plot.

***** Yeah, sure. Specifically about Dumbledore and Ron bashing.

****** Most of the Ron bashing comes from the cliche of him accepting money to report to Dumbledore about Harry.

IIRC there's a chapter maybe two-thirds of the way through with Ron's perspective about him reflecting on why he'd done it - tl;dr is he wanted the money + thought it would be good for someone to know about Harry and look after him given Sirius's death recently.

The Dumbledore bashing is completely due to miscommunication essentially. Harry, at some point close to the start figures out he's a horcrux and realizes Dumbledore knows that he needs to die, and is probably steering him towards it.

The miscommunication is that the horcrux was removed - I forget the specifics - and that Dumbledore has abandoned the whole sacrificial plot already, but obviously hadn't told Harry, as he didn't know he knew.

It's not an amazing story really, but it's one of the first I have memories of reading as it updated, so I'm perhaps a tad biased. Certainly most of what I just revealed sounds very cliche.
