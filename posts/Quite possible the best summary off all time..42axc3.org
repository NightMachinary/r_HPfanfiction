#+begin_quote
  Hermaphrodite!harry. Adopted!harry. Sub!harry. Abused!harry. Neglected!harry. Powerful!harry. Good!dark side. Light side bashing. Abusive!vernon. Mpreg. Harry is the child of Magic named Aster. That's all you need to know.
#+end_quote

You are right, that is all I need to know.


** Talking about bad summaries. Let me show you the following:

His Hidden Heart by sure_as_elle

Summary:

Harry Potter is not like other boys. He's not even like other wizards. Everyone thinks they know the real Harry, but they're wrong. He has a secret even his friends Ron and Hermione don't know about, a secrets that he fears they would never understand or accept about him. But he may have found someone who understands and accepts him completely; someone who shares his secret. (AU)

Can you guess what this one is about?

Hint: [[/spoiler][The secret is pedophilia. It's also a harem fic featuring Harry and Luna grooming a first year for a threesome.]]

**** Yeah, it sounded interesting enough. The author uses Harry as a pro pedophilia mouthpiece and Luna to agree with his ideas to portrait himself in a good light. The first chapter was an interesting perspective into the authors mind, then it devolved into smut. The justification the author uses primarily are "love can't be immoral" and "if the first year likes hugs, she will love getting double teamed so it's ok to talk her into it."

*** I hate this fic, it lured me into it, giving me the expectation of something interesting.

That's not even fair, because it /is/ interesting, but in totally the wrong way. The summary reminds me of the Firebird Trilogy, another series I detest. All three of those fics have equally non-descriptive summaries.

Go in TvTropes, research and create the most ridiculously cliche story you can. Super!Dark!Harry, Magical cores, Basilisk wands, unbreakable vows, marriage contracts, Ice Queen of Slytherin, Herm*oi*ne, Weasley bashing, Dumbles, Gred and Forge, Friendly Goblins, Drako in Leather Pants, Orgies (lots of them), Harems (yes, plural), Sexy!Snape, Expandable chests, Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell and Seer!Sexy!Luna.

Instant fave.

**** I would honestly do this for sure, only to systematically subvert every single one of these tropes near the end, by making the Super!Darkbutnotevil!Harry the bad guy, and show that the evil manipulative Dumbledore was really in the right all along, the friendly goblins were really just in it for their opportunity to do away with the gold, the Weasleys were innocent and Voldemort was most /certainly/ not the one to root for.

I wonder how the average fanfiction reader would take it...
