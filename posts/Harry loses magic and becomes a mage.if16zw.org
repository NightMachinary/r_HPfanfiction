:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Im looking for a fic that was on ff.net about Harry losing his ability to do magic with a wand. He lost it in some sort of accident in 5th or 6th year and he has to absorb magic from the Hogwarts “soakstone” (i think it was called that) it was a fairly long fic and i would appreciate it if someone can help me find it

Edit: I found it, i had to word my search differently
