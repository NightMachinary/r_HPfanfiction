Can anyone recommend a fanfiction about Lupin and Tonks relationship ? But I mean the kind of fanfiction which does not put emphasis on mature content and where Lupin's character remains close to the original Rowling created.


** This is exactly what you are looking for - in character, canon, does not emphasize mature content and a great story

**** Yes, it's a great one. What was the other story you liked? I think we enjoy similar kinds of canon stories that flesh out what happens with characters in the background so I'm curious what other ones you like.

***** it was called Tonks and Lupin: until the very end. It's not finished yet, and covers their relationship from the end of HBP. Others I've found focus on mature content and this annoys me terribly. The one I've mentioned is a bit idealistic, but I liked it anyway.Now I'm reading the story you recommended (instead of studying-shame on me).

************* Good question. I can't say I like Ron Hermione pair much. So maybe Harry Hermione then because Harry started fancying ginny very suddenly- in the fifth book he didn't care she was dating with someone and then all of a sudden he noticed her, it's like when Ron suddenly remembered hermione is a girl. I'm that kind of person who always finds fault with everything so I have certain doubts about Lupin and Tonks sometimes. How about you? Do you like original parings?

************** Yea I do. Ron and Hermione is basically not even canon to me, it makes zero sense in terms of being in character. I'm the same way about finding fault with the ships, but the one that makes the most sense that I like is Harry/Luna, there are a few good fics for that one.

*************** Really? I've never thought of Harry and Luna. I also can't make myself read fanfiction which has Draco and Hermione though many people seem to like it. I read a couple of fanfics which have Hermione and Lupin (in most of them this paring doesn't seem to work), I liked a couple of fanfics which had Sirius oc pairings. But Harry Luna...wow....

******************* I agree about Weasleys being overrated. I've never been a great fan of Ginny, I don't know why. I was surprised so many people were so upset when Fred died. To this day I can't understand why his death to many people seem so tragic, I'm not saying I wasn't upset that he died but judging by the coments I've read my sadness was nowhere near the sadness others felt. I felt more sorry for Lupin than Fred. But as you said- to each their own.

******************** Exactly. To me, Fred and George were annoying bullies. Lupin is a tragic character so yea that one is 10x more powerful than Fred's death. And don't get me started on Harry naming his kid Albus Severus. The whole epilogue is basically not even canon to me, just like cursed child.

********************* you know it's funny because I've just been thinking to ask you whether you are Snape fan, it seems I got my answer already :). I've read a comment somewhere which said that Snape told Slytherins about Lupin's condition in POA because he cared about these students. Maybe he did, but telling them was the same as announcing the news on the radio. What I mean is that sometimes fans, especially Snape's fans, are ready to ignore obvious facts to defend their favourite characters. Besides, I have found some kind of ranking of deaths in HP series and Fred was ranked first. Maybe they all have twin brothers?

*********************** I mean there are so many Fred fans and I just don't get what is so tragic about his death, other than that george lost his twin brother. So maybe they have brothers or sisters and can relate to that in some way ( I don't mean to say their brothers and sisters are dead or something). btw I liked the way you compared Snape's love to Lily to his fan's love for him- they would be outraged.
