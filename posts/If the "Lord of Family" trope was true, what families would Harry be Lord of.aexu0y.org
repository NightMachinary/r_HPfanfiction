** Either Potter only or maybe Black as well, but that one could just as well go to Draco or Tonks.

Who am I kidding, it would be Potter, Black, Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Peverell, Baggins, Targaryen and Tudor.

*** Harry was made sole heir by Sirius, it would go to him. Andromeda and her daughter would be disqualified after being disinherited. Malfoy might be a contester, but it should go to Narcissa and not Draco if not for Sirius' will.

** The most common ones I've seen are: Lord Potter and Lord Black.

Some writers like to add: Peverell or Slytherin (by conquest) lol.

Personally, Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black sounds the most right, as we are not entirely sure Potter is a noble house.

*** We're pretty sure Potter ISN'T a noble house. The Potter family is old, but decidedly commoners; they're descended from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, also known as "Linfred the Potterer," who was a potioneer and a healer.

But.. we're not sure that the Black family is a noble house either. Yes, I know Sirius once called it the "Most Ancient And Noble House Of Black," when presenting his family tree to Harry... but given that he was esssentially presenting them as a group of evil, fucked-up, racist monsters, he MAY have been sarcastic...

** It depends on a couple factors, namely which families have Lords and how heirs are named. If the Potters are noble, then Harry would have that, and if Sirius can name anyone as his heir, Harry also could be Lord Black. Technically, once Voldemort dies and/or if Voldemort hasn't claimed a Peverell lordship, Harry could have that too.

It gets more complicated if you add in rules where only direct descendants can inherit or only males can inherit, because the Peverell line could have died out, and Draco would inherit the Black lordship before Harry would since he'd be the next closest male after Sirius.

** Just Potter (if the Potters were ennobled). If they weren't before, they would be after either 1981 or 1998.

It's a plothole where Sirius is allowed to keep his wealth and titles in the wizarding world after he's declared to be a traitor and imprisoned till death. All of those things would either be confiscated by the Ministry, or go to the next of kin, who in this case are the Malfoys.

** Potter by blood and Black by heritage if the Canon Universe isn't changed and Sirius still named him as heir.

Some fics make him "secretly" the heir of the Peverell house, which makes no sense because there is no way nobody in the Potter family through out history found out about that when they went to the bank and claimed it.

Plus, with all the inbreeding and "everyone is a cousin" there is no way there aren't other people related to the Potters in some way that are older and have a better claim.

So, canonically, Potter and Black are the houses he would have. Anything else would be fanon in action with made up rules like "conquest" and secret bloodlines.

** Realistically, so to speak, it would just be Lord Black. The Potters were wealthy commoners, probably landed gentry or Esquire. It's my personally theory to add “Sir Peverell of The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of The Round Table” to lean into the Arthurian connection. Just as Arthur is “The Once and Future King” so too are the Knights.

** If the "Lord of Family" trope was true, and we even try to make it even vaguely like how inheriting of actual titles work... then Harry would ONLY qualify as Lord of the House Potter.

A lot of fanfic love to make him Lord Black, since he was Sirius's heir, but that's not how hereditary titles work. Harry was never part of the Black family. He wasn't born into it, he wasn't adopted into it. Sirius named Harry his heir, yes, but that only means Harry got his worldly possessions... his money, his house, his things. Those were Sirius's to do with whatever he wanted; so if he wanted to give them all to Harry, he could. A TITLE is completely different.... If Sirius had actually had a title, then he could not pick a successor. It would go to his biological son, or it wouldn't go to anyone at all. There's no third option here. That's the thing about titles, you can't transfer them to whoever you want, not even if they're your godchild and you "would have adopted them if you had the chance."

If Sirius really had a Lordship, then Harry would have no claim to that title. And neither Sirius nor Harry would have been able to do anything about that, short of claiming that Harry was actually Sirius's son. But in that case he couldn't be Lord of the House Potter, since then he wouldn't be James's son.
