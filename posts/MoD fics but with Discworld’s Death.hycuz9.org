Hoping to find something where Death is a frequent character interacting with MoD Harry. The Death of Rats is an acceptable substitute. :)


** This would be so awesome. I also love the idea of Susan reacting to Harry's choices. “You did what?”, “well, that was a very stupid thing to do”.

** There‘s a Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy crossover or two...

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2666277/1/Something-Grim-This-Way-Comes]]) is the one that comes to mind for me, though it's entirely crack.
