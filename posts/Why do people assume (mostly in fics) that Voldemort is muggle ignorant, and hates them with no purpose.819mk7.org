There's plenty of reason for Voldemort to hate muggles, and those reasons are justified.

- The bullies at the Orphanage.

- His father abandoned him.

- He went to school during WW2(He got his wand in 1938 and joined Hogwarts, which is a year before WW2)


** Bullying doesn't excuse racism. Neither does family abandoning you. And I'm not even sure what your last example is supposed to show, because the Wizarding World also has a very large war around the same time. None of these reasons justify racism.

Edit: I realized something after I posted this. Voldemort being bullied by muggles and fearful of muggles gives him the right to stay away from them, and that would be justified. But it doesn't make him murdering hundreds of muggles justified.

*** I'd agree with you but for one point: Tom Riddle is a sociopath.

He finds out about magic at a young age and sees himself above the muggles at the orphanage. Them bullying him makes him want to prove that he's above them, and there is born the hatred for the muggles.

No, those aren't justified. Someone who's /X/ bullying you as a kid isn't a justification to hate all /X/ people. Ditto for the other two.

Not to mention, Tom Riddle Sr. left because Merope Gaunt had been love potioning and raping him. Hard to call that abandonment...

That, Voldemort, did not know, and he grew up thinking one or both of his parents abandoned him. Bullying is always cruel and in a justified karma way, get punished for it by the one being bullied. See American School shootings. They happen due to bullying, as far as I am aware. But let's not bring politics into here. I noticed you did not comment on the WW2 portion of my thread.

I thought the point was clear, but I can be more explicit.

WWII was bad, obviously. But that doesn't make it justified to hate all muggles & muggleborns, like how it doesn't make it justified to hate all Germans.

I cannot fucking believe that this has to be explained. Racism is bad. It isn't justified just cuz you had a shitty childhood.

******** What threat? The only way one could use WWII happened to conclude all muggles are a threat is if one were ignorant about muggles. (Also, isn't it canon---or at least Pottermore!canon---that Grindelwald was involved in WWII?) If that's what's Voldemort thought, then it would be accurate for fanfic writers to portray him as muggle ignorant, answering the question in your title.

******** Ima stop you right there, fella - how is he /saner/ after resurrection? It was implied that before, all the death eaters had cool codenames and anonymity (Voldemort referred to Malfoy as 'Mr. White' at the graveyard.) but then it never came up again. That means he stopped caring about his followers' anonymity. That kind of implies a drop in general reasoning levels?

Not to mention the whole portkey-murder-games plot, which was ridiculous.

And then he hatched this whole plot to get Harry to get the prophecy even tho he coulda gotten it himself easy-like?

**** He believed /Riddle Snr./ abandoned him. Mrs Cole may not have been the perfect matron, but I'm inclined to think she was no Dursley either, and she wouldn't keep the fact that Merope had died just after giving birth to him from Tom.

See, that's precisely a big part of the reasons for Voldemort's hatred and fear of Muggles. The way he'd worked out the chain of events, without considering his mother might have been in the wrong, he thought his was the same case as Tobias Snape and Eileen Prince, except worse --- that Riddle Snr. had thrown Merope and her unborn child out because he'd learnt she was a witch.

***** Regarding your last point, a young Tom Riddle thought that his mum wasn't a witch because she had died. He assumed his father was a wizard. And I would question the role, if any, Mrs. Cole played in Tom figuring out his parentage. He doesn't possess the personality to ask others for help. There could've been a multitude of ways Tom found out about his parents. He probably had an idea of them whilst in the orphanage but he pieced it all together when he found the Gaunts as a teen.

It would justify a personal need to stay away from them, even a profound distaste for them and their culture. Hell, I'd even somewhat /understand/ if he felt the need for Grindelwaldian approach of ruling over humans who, by all Voldemort witnessed, seem to be incapable of being trusted with power.

It doesn't justify becoming a tyrannical, genocidal overlord with the desire and will to kill clean entire continents.

Overproportionate response to wrong-doings are seldom justified, and even rarer commended. If anyone was a master of overpoportionate responses, it was Voldemort.

** Oh yes, definitely. There's really a bit of drama with Riddle during WWII --- he literally begs Professor Dippet to stay at Hogwarts during the summer. Both Dippet and Dumbledore, being wizards disconnected from the Muggle world, assume it's because he just loves Hogwarts that much, and sure, that's probably part of it --- but it's clear to any Muggle that he was also terrified of being stuck in Wool's Orphanage in the middle of the bleedin' Blitz.

Surely that's just as good a reason to dislike wizards as it is muggles? Yeah, muggles are the ones fighting but it's the Hogwarts staff who keep forcing him back to an orphanage in London.

In fact, they may have even forced him into being /homeless/. Wool's Orphanage is in London, the children there would have been evacuated to the countryside. Operation Pied Piper started 1st September 1939, there were further waves of evacuations until the end of the war. So basically, from summer 1940 he would have been 'going home' to an *empty building* or one which had been re-purposed into something else. The orphanage itself might have even been destroyed in the Blitz.
