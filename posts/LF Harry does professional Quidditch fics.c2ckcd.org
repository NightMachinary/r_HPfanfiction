Since I haven't seen a thread about Quidditch in a while, give me your best Quidditch fanfics. Quidditch doesn't have to be a main part of the storyline, but Harry must go pro in it. Does not matter if he goes pro while in school or out of school. Mainly looking for fics where Harry is pretty much uber OP at Quidditch. Preferably complete and please no slash. Any other pairings are fine.


** The same author as above also wrote linkffn(The Quidditch World Cup by TheEndless7) which is Harry/Luna after Harry/Ginny split and follows Harry through his Quidditch career in flashbacks.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

** Vitam Paramus linkffn(9444529) is pretty Quidditch heavy and is a rare Harry/Gabrielle fic that doesn't make it /completely/ weird.

Has some OK sports scenes and the politics/shenanigans of being a pro-athlete.

** Neither of these fics have Quidditch as a focus, but I found these two to have the best written Quidditch scenes, especially when describing the chaser/keeper in-game dynamics.

linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games]])

The latter is a one shot where Ron is professional keeper. The former is a multi-chapter fic that takes place in the latter part of PoA and all of GoF. All of the Quidditch scenes appear before the start of Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

** Linkffn(A game of style and brutality)

pretty over the top, quidditch is somehow a bloodsport in this and Harry regularly sustains brutal injuries and somehow shrugs them off. Requires a little suspension of disbelief as a result, but it's an otherwise entertaining read. Unfinished, but it doesn't end at a too terrible spot.

** In line with /Vitam Paramus/, there's also [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope by Jeconais]], which also features a Harry/Gabrielle pairing. It's not quidditch-heavy, per se, but has it as a big theme.

Harry is a pro quidditch player who has to take a year's break after an injury. He's persuaded to go teaching flying at Beauxbatons; however, the Head Girl, Gabrielle, is keeping a big secret. Meanwhile, back at Hogwarts, schemes are afoot to ruin his quiet year.

Features an OP Harry (!), a revamped triwizard tournament (incl. quidditch), the good ole' Gryffindor team reunited to show off, humorous Malfoy/Snape/Dumbledore bashing, magical theory & wonders, veela mates, romance & fluff. (I do have to mention that if you really don't like fluff, this is not for you; it can be a bit heavy on it at times.)
