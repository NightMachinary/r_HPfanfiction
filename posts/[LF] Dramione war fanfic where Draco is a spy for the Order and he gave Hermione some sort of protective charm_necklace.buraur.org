I'm suddenly reminded of this wonderful Dramione fanfic I read long ago (I think on FF.net) and I can't remember the title for the life of me.

PLOT: This takes place during the war and Draco is a spy for the Order who liaises with Hermione. He's been in love with her for a long time and he passes her this charm or necklace that protects her. Hermione eventually does the same for him.


** You might be looking for Turncoat by elizaye. I'm on mobile but here's the link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7030506/1/]] it's one of my personal favorites.
