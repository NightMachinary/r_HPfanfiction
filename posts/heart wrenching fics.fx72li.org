  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

With his friends being less than supportive, who will he turn to to make it through the toughest year of his life? Contains Mpreg. Abused!Harry. Severitus-ish.

** linkffn(An Hour of Wolves)

Romance has only touched upon for now, though I'm sure it'll come in the later chapters. But you will easily understand why it would take a long time for that to happen.

  Harry's doing just fine: being Quidditch Captain and 'the Chosen One' doesn't leave him with time to worry about much besides school and the growing threat of war. He's especially not worrying about the fact that Sirius is dead. Or about an embarrassing, uncomfortable night with a classmate he'd rather just forget. Really. He's fine. Features an eating disorder, other tags inside.

** Linkffn(Stages of Hope) for a realistic depiction of what happens when adults drop the ball and teenagers are pushed into a war, from the POV of adults who didn't (from a different dimension). I'll especially draw attention to Harry and Hermione's argument in chapter 27 and when the full truth is revealed in chapter 29. /Stages of Hope/, I believe, should be mandatory reading for anyone who applauds books 4-7.

Linkffn(I Should Have by BreetanyaViolet) for why you should never ever ignore child abuse of any sort.

Linkao3(If death is a doorway, I am gate seeker) in which Lily and Harry survive Halloween 1981 but James does not.

** I guarantee that if you binge read [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry]] by The Seeker, you will be full on sobbing.

Here's the summary: * What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse.

Though I have to give a shout out to [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] because I'm me, and I'll recommend whenever I can. Tears come in book 2.
