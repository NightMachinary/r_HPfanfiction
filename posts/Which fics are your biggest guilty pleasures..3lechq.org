Mine are the Princess of the Blacks trilogy by Silently Watches . Dont^{Judge^{Me^{Pls}}}


** The Malachite Series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4798684/Lazov][Lazov]]. It's full of horrible cliches, doesn't have much in the way of plot, and Harry is pretty much a Gary Stu, but the prose itself is really good, and I found myself easily emotionally immersed in the story, with its somewhat idle pace. Wish it wasn't abandoned.

dialogue from the fic.:

  Severus sneered superciliously at her. "Oh please, Tuney, don't pretend you know anything about feminism, you'll only hurt yourself."

  "How dare you!" shrilled Petunia, as Lily suppressed the urge to giggle.

  "Sorry Tunes, he's right. If you can name one feminist source of reading material, I'll eat my owl. You don't even have to have read it. And no, Cosmo doesn't count," she continued, anticipating Petunia before she even had a chance to respond, "as much as Helen Gurley Brown2 may fancy herself that it does." Petunia snapped her mouth shut at that and scowled.

  Longbottom replied superciliously: "It's clear you understand nothing of economics. By saving Pot & Kettle, we are saving the economy."

  At that point, Sev jumped in. "Yeah, for the rich," he said snidely.

  This incensed Longbottom. "Excuse me?"

  "All you're doing is saving the shares of people rich enough to invest in the market. Those families struggling on Knockturn Alley don't have a knut to spare for investing in anything."

***** I'm pretty sure the commonly accepted meaning of guilty pleasure is something you enjoy reading, but contains bad tropes. If you like Rent-a-Hero or Travel Secrets, you can classify them as guilty pleasures as the former has everyone in the Order of the Phoenix as evil for stupid reasons and the second has bashing, general inconsistencies in the plot etc. You can't call them genuinely good fics because no good fics would contain such tropes, but you still enjoy reading them.

My guilty pleasures would be:

linkffn(The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville): Lucius is really a nice person, Molly bashing, caricature Ron, Snape is a super-mega Genius who outsmarted Dumbledore and Voldemort, Crouch is Hermione's father, Ginny marries Harry and Ron marries Hermione because they are 'expected to' even though they can't stand the other's presence without some sort of drug. These are the author's interpretations of canon, and whoever wrote this needs to get their head checked. Yet, this is strangely enjoyable. I can't call such butchery of canon a good story, hence it is a guilty pleasure.

linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and resistance of the Soul Bond): A Soul Bond story, and not a particularly well written one at that. The humor is more silly than anything else, yet I find it strangely amusing.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ginnysdarkside/SDIWIWIS.html][Some Days I Wish I Were in Slytherin]]: Well written story, but any story with the premise "character suddenly embraces his/her Slytherin side" is a guilty pleasure at best. Here Ginny has one such epiphany after her fourth year, and persuades Snape to tutor her in the art of spying.

linkffn(The Rebirth by Irina): Ginny fics with bad tropes are my guilty pleasure, it seems. Average writing, and a rather sue-ish Ginny, especially at first. The sequel is more balanced. The plot is quite interesting as well, but a guilty pleasure it remains.
