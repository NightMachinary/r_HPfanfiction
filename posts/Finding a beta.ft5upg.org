Hi all,

First time writer who has been mapping out a lengthy HP fanfic (been reading them for... jeez, like a decade). Was wondering how/where authors come across betas? I don't think it will be essential for proofreading, as I am a competent writer, but having someone who can look over my ideas and plot points would make a big difference.

I guess what I'm asking is, does anyone here ever 'pitch' their idea to a third-party to see if it works?
