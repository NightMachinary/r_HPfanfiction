Just gained this idea and thought it would be pretty funny. Harry and Hermione could grow closer and eventually fall for one another, so when Ron comes back and Harry sees his nightmare via the horcrux, he'd be like "Well, this is gonna be a painful next few hours." Doesn't have to be exactly the premise in the title, but something at least similar would be appreciated.


** Oh God. I hope so.

** There is a one-shot where Ron comes back and sees Harry and Hermione going after the doe patronus together - I believe Hermione kisses him before he jumps to retrieve the sword and they declare their love for each other. Ron is dejected and leaves without them noticing, but I can't seem to find it...

** Almost what you're looking for: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5246064/1/Just-a-Dream]]

The only difference is that Ron witnesses Harry and Hermione together, instead of Harry telling him.

I seem to remember one where Harry has to tell him. I'll keep a look out for it.

EDIT: Kind of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10915346/1/Hunt]]\\
There are also a couple almost exactly what you're looking for in Broomstick Flyer's one shot collections (She has more than one). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5356707/34/All-sorts]]\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4581494/25/More-one-shots]] For the rest You'll have to hunt for them on her page. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1082315/broomstick-flyer]]

**** Honestly, I'd read this kind of thing so that I could see Ron learning to move on from the jealousy and insecurity to become a better wizard. I don't have any doubt that he could overcome these difficulties, especially since there's still the death eaters and Voldemort to fight. And if the story isn't a bashing fic then I'm sure Harry and Hermione would still want to reconcile with Ron and vice versa.

**** Cringe-reading can be fun.

There's an anime that's built on cringe, /Watamote/ (name too long to write). The character is the most cringe-inducing one I've seen; to the point where people had to drop it because "it hits too close home".

It was entertaining.

**** See for most fiction I'd agree. But HP is a special case, I've read so many different fanfics and AUs that although I love the world, I can't take much seriously about it anymore. If I see one person die, I know they're alive in another bajillion different fics out there, living their lives happily all the way through. I appreciate the writing and plotting and new ideas more than I have empathy for the characters, they're like beloved puppets that we pick up and play out scenes with, but in the end, they're all right.

** I feel like variations on this scene played out in a whole bunch of mediocre Harmony “tent fics” circa the seventh movie, either to write Ron out of the narrative or solidify his latent villainy.

*** That always comes across as sad to me. He has the base to be a really interesting character if people take the time, but it's too easy to join the bashing band wagon and write him off. He'll never be my favorite canon character but I would still love to see him more often as something other than the trio's dip-shit or the jealous ex friend. (note, I mean this for harry centric fics which I spent the majority of my time reading)

**** I'm not into Ron bashing, but I find him (and any Weasley with the exception of OotP Ginny) utterly boring and unrelateble. That doesn't mean that I want to read them bashed again and again, but their absence is a state which I greatly enjoy.

***** Hold up. The comment I responded to is a clear cut violation of rule 8. It's a request thread, and they complain about the notion of the request and start talking about how the would want something else entirely. Hence them acting like a twat. If calling them a twat is vicious enough to qualify as a 'personal attack', there's no way in hell then taking a paragraph to deride the very notion of Hermione enjoying Harry's company doesn't qualify as 'expressing your opinion about the thing being requested'.
