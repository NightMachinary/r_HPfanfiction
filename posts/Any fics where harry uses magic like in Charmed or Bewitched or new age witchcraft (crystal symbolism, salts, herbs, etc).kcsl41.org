I've read Now Charmed on ffn but it's incomplete. Thanks.


** I find this to be a pretty great blending of Harry Potter and Bewitched. It keeps some of the quirky Bewitched comedy too!

  When Hagrid arrives at the Potter cottage in Godric's Hollow, he finds no sign of Harry Potter. It takes five long years for Harry to be found, in the care of a distant cousin, having been dropped off by his Great Grand Mother.

** I've not seen either series, so it may not be exactly like you asked for, but Grounding Magic has some symbolism based magic

  Last time Harry was lead around by his nose. Only seeing what others wanted him to, only doing what others wanted to. Everyone had their own agenda, and it eventually got them all killed. Except Harry, who couldn't die thanks to accidentally becoming the master of death in his teens. Now he's back. A new timeline, a whole new world of opportunity. He'll save the world, but not by following anyone's script for him.
