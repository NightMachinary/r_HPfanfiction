I'm looking for a one shot fic where Harry's brother is the bwl and in the final battle dies for him and later his brother kills himself out of grief. Also if you have any other fics like that you can suggest them.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.

*** That author is one of my favorites. Elizium for the Sleepless Souls is in my top5 potter fics for sheer originality.
