I know it's a bit of a weird prompt but I really like this premise. I've even read one before where this happened. He was killed in the final battle but for some reason, he was reborn as Harry's son. I read one where he was his bastard son but I'm okay if he's Ginny's son as well. Please recommend to me a fic where this happens. Would be best if it's long but I can take one-shots and abandoned fics as well.


** I think it would be funny if it turned out to be James Sirius that's the reborn Tom Riddle. The Heir of Slytherin ending up in Gryffindor would be hilarious.

*** Don't know unfortunately can't remember it or find it which is why I'm looking for things similar to it and maybe in this list of recommendations someone might even recommend that specific one.

*** Hell yeah... would be cool to have a story where Albus is this shy friendless child who eventually befriends a Tyler Durden-style version of himself which coincidentally happens to be Tom Riddle.

** Oh! I have one where Harry was born as Tom's son in an alternate universe? That's only mentioned briefly and they eventually return the the original universe. It's a bit of a crack fic but its one of the best!

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

  Tired of human stupidity, Death decides to teach those who sought to be Masters of Death a lesson. Thinly veiled as a favor, Death offers Tom Riddle a second chance, the opportunity to be born again and live a new life. Some things are just too good to be true, and Tom soon learns there's a catch. There always is. Rated T for swearing.

*** OMG thank you so much this was gold I loved it. I'd never watched it before and the only thing I can say about it is that cliffhanger was not cool. Other than that though the story was awesome and I loved Lily and Albus being other souls as well.
