Any good Harry/Katie fics out there? !


** The short answer: No.

The long answer is that linkffn(Hells Bells) is probably the only somewhat good one out there, but surely not the only one.

Here is a [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search%5Bfandoms%5D%5B%5D=224&search%5Btitle%5D=&search%5Bauthor%5D=&search%5Bsummary%5D=&search%5Bcharacter_required%5D%5B%5D=1&search%5Bcharacter_required%5D%5B%5D=848&search%5Blanguage%5D=english&search%5Bstatus%5D=&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=k&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=kplus&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=t&search%5Brating%5D%5B%5D=m&search%5Bwordcount_lower%5D=&search%5Bwordcount_upper%5D=&search%5Bchapters_lower%5D=&search%5Bchapters_upper%5D=&search%5Bsort_by%5D=_score&search%5Border_by%5D=desc][Scryer Search]] that may help you.

** I read a fic once where they briefly went out but something happened and their relationship just pretty much snowballed. It was a "What could have been if this didn't happen" situation. Harry had moved on Katie still somewhat had feelings for him and they remained friends I totally forgot what it was called and whether it was good or not but maybe someone else will know idk it's the thought that counts. If it helps, I believe they were going out and around the time of the Yule ball had an argument Harry ended up taking Fleur to the ball Katie took someone else and because she was angry with Harry and in a moment of weakness she had sex with or kissed another guy. It was something along the lines of that that's all I really remember and that might even be wrong lol

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
