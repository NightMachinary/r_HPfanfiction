Every other story I read, without fail, somehow manages to bring up this weird chastity dynamic. I get that people seem to think that because the wizarding world still carries the aesthetic of the 1700s that they would carry similar societal expectations, except that the MOM had a female Minister for Magic IN the 1700s. A society that doesn't have a gendered hangup on the sexes obviously would not have a problem with sex, because that sense of ownership is the only reason the idea of purity exists anyway.

And setting aside by historical and societal hangups about it, it's often completely irrelevant to the plot! It's always interjected weird, like "oh, I'm an authority figure, see me busting all these stupid kids having sex everywhere", or "I'm a virgin at my wedding and some magical spell is going to magically prove it right in the middle of the fucking ceremony".

WHY. There's no point, it just throws off the story, and it ruins my immersion.

Seriously, it's an american hang-up, together with teenage pregnancy. Europeans, unless a bit weird, or older than -- say --- 70 wouldn't even think of it.

** This reminds me of something Jason Isaacs said regarding Lucius Malfoy's initial costume and how it clashed with his concept of the character:

#+begin_quote
  “I went to the set, and they had this idea of me wearing a pinstripe suit, short black-and-white hair,” Isaacs recalls. “I was slightly horrified. He was a racist, a eugenicist. There's no way he would cut his hair like a Muggle, or dress like a Muggle.”
#+end_quote

My headcanon is that exact attitude was widespread among pure-blood society after wizards passed the Statute of Secrecy, with the societal separation really having begun /before/ the 1690s for such a law to even be considered.

Pure-blood witches and wizards would want to distance themselves from Muggles as far as possible, not absorb their culture. And they would both naturally diverge from that point of isolation.

Muggles had an emphasis on purity and chastity, so maybe wizards started associating that with the same barbarous culture that burned and hanged their people, and went "nah."

Even putting the Statute aside, magic evens the playing field. Gender seems to have no bearing on magical ability. Witches can just as easily cast spells, make potions, etc., as wizards do. It's difficult to imagine literally empowered witches putting up with being the "inferior sex" and all that phrase entails.

Not only that, but magic also could have offered things that contemporaneous Muggle societies of the past would not have had -- in theory, Rowling's brand of magical system could certainly have spells or potions to prevent pregnancies, determine paternity, and eradicate sexually transmitted diseases.

So, for me, I just don't see a purity culture as very widely-supported among wizards.

Unless you're talking blood purity. ;)

Actually, this opens a whole new can of worms, because a witch who was intimate - even unwillingly - with a muggle would probably be seen as 'impure', though I'm going to say that a wizard would likely /not/ have the same issue. If anything, it would be more like the Roman view of homosexual acts: penetration is fine, but being penetrated is deplorable.

One could write a strange yet interesting fanfic around this concept.

But two pureblood kids getting it on between classes? Aside from some potentially awkward political complications, it'd be seen as 'kids being kids."

** I know what you mean. Gender disparity in general makes no sense in that universe. With the exception of pregnancy, magic ought to level the playing field on every other subject (and some of those mpreg stories even ignore that... but.... /shudder/).

Hence a lot of the gender powerplays probably never even existed in the first place. It would make a lot more sense for purebloods to find the "purity" stuff the christian muggleborns bring in to be rather weird.

I even once wrote a short piece where witches and wizards had sex asap because it made them unusable for dark wizards and their rituals that require virgins. (I admit, I was hangover af when I wrote it - do not mix Sangria and Scotch. Friendly warning.).

But hey, we have almost 0 tangible lore for it, so I always figure "whatever makes the authors boat float". I don't have to read it. The only one we really follow is Harry, and for all we know he's so emotionally stunted that hes the very exception to the rule.

#+end_quote

See, that makes much more sense to me. Here's one of my favorite little snippets concerning that idea:

[Remus]"...it's an extremely poor risk for Harry to remain innocent. He could be used in all manner of dark rites as a virgin. We can only be fortunate it didn't cross Voldemort's mind during fourth year when Harry was kidnapped after the third task.” He winced when Molly paled. “The Dark Arts are ripe with virgin sacrifice rituals, you know.”

Hermione promptly raised her hand and blushed when Moody and Remus both laughed. “Right, well, does that mean that a witch must have an intact hymen or does it require penetration by a wizard?”

Remus blushed furiously, Molly gaped in horror, and Moody grinned at her. “You'd need a wizard, lass. There are some rituals that call for a ‘witch who has never known a wizard intimately' and are considered in the same class of acts as a virgin sacrifice.”

Hermione huffed and shot Ron a shrewd look. “What? Don't look at me like that! There is no telling what a Death Eater might do with me---I don't want to be a virgin sacrifice.”

“Who does?” Sirius asked blithely as he entered the kitchen.

(/That Old Black Magic/, Keira Marcos)

Recently I found a fic called "Nobody cared" in which (amist tons of other problems) Gryffindors are all apparently rule-breaking bullies who get their prefect duties taken away because they have sex.

There was fic, I think it was called The Problem with Purity, which made sex this super important thing, although I'm less inclined to hate it since it /was/ technically a plot point.

**** I recently tried to reread TPwP and found I couldn't do it even though I enjoyed it the first time around. A few months ago I read an article about Elizabeth Smart, how worthless she felt after being raped, and the dangers of a society that places a high value on virginity. It really changed my perspective.

Before I found fics with emphasis on physical "purity" just eye-roll inducing but now I can't even read them. In my own fic, I changed a scene where a character is able to gather a rare potion ingredient related to unicorns because he was a virgin. Instead I made it so anyone could do it so long as they were "pure of heart". It's probably extreme of me, but I refuse to write anything that implies that being a virgin makes anyone extra special. Even something as silly as being able to collect fungus growing on top of some unicorn shit in the light of the full moon.

******* Indeed, but being Ron, we know he's good at chess and Quidditch strategy, but he's not a war aficionado nor a great reader. We don't know much about Ginny, so it's plausible she also can strategize, but more importantly, could become war obsessed after her Diary experience. Padma is a smart girl we know little about, so it's conceivable to invent a grandfather who was high up in an army, and that she learnt heaps about battles and weapons and the good old days. Same with Susan, I don't see Amelia being the type to refuse to tell a kid war stories, and we could pretend other family members were retired Aurors from both wars. A half-blood might have a granddad each from magical and mundane ww2, who like to swap stories and teach young Junior who lost parents in volde's war all about battles and wars and fighting.

I like this one. An orphan raised by four world war vets jointly, from both sides - three fighters and a nurse. If only I could write, and actually knew anything about the military.

******** You see, this kind of answer makes me kinda want to read outside of my habitual tropes. It could be great ! Super interesting. But with fan fiction (I read HP mostly, with a bit of Marvel CU on the side, for Loki), I don't really want to read anything that doesn't involve my favorite parings, and I like somewhat uncommon stuff (Hermione, with older guys, Snape, Lucius, and more importantly Voldemort/Tom Riddle). I haven't been reading FF for a long time but I think I kinda read almost everything I could about those pairings (definitively read everything readable, and even terrible fanfics with HG/TR or LV as a main pairing). But I can't find it in myself to read anything else. I tried, and will keep reading when I think about it, that fic about Neville and Ginny and the resto of Hogwarts during their 7th year. It seemed cannon, which I don't usually read, but it's the first time something different gave me interest. I'll keep trying !

India had Indira Gandhi (in the 60s, even, and then in the 70s again), but I really doubt anyone would claim with a straight face that India had no issues with gender back then. Of course, it doesn't mean that there have to be problems with sex.

I used a quite liberal wizard society - to the point that the wizards thought British muggles were prudes - in one story, to show that wizards didn't have to be stuck in the Victorian era.

** While people misunderstanding the difference between an 'alternate secret society' and 'ye olden days' in relation to the wizarding world plays a significant role, I think the real problem simply lies in where people draw their inspiration from when writing. Specifically, people tend to write about things they are either familiar with or dream about. The latter produces the fantastical and irreverent wish-fulfillment adventure-type fics while the former produces the more introspective and slice-of-life type fics. When you read about the main character having harems and everyone fucking like rabbits the writer is drawing on that second source of inspiration. On the other hand, when you read a story where the characters are all sexually repressed virginity worshipers the writer is drawing on that first source of inspiration because, unfortunately, such attitudes are still prevalent in many parts of society, thus people write about it.

All it would take is a few kids confusing sex and feelings for their parents to see sex as something that corrupts their minds and makes them act stupid. Considering how hysterical wizards get, I can easily see them being very superstitious about how a sexual relationship can send you off the deep end, even if you can't get preggers or an STI (and we have no evidence that wizards can't get those).

The story is more about social relationships than anything else, and conflicts that can be resolved with power aren't the focus, but there's a fair bit of power creep. That can be grating. It also suffers from the standard problems in powerful!Harry stories: the protagonist is the only one who does anything proactive, can do no wrong, and can defeat Voldemort without the Dark Lord managing to get a shot off.

Refreshingly, it's Hermione, not Harry, who gains all these benefits. Hermione's the second most popular target for that, but that still leaves like fifty powerful!Harry stories per powerful!Hermione story.

** Honestly sex in fanfiction rarely adds anything to begin with, and in fact usually starts killing the plot. Now this isn't to say it can't add something, just that it usually doesn't.

For every well written romance or drama that uses sex tastefully to build up the plot we have hundreds fics that implode after it's brought in. Obviously this doesn't include smut-fics, where sex is the whole premise.

The virgin detecting magical wedding is a god awful trope, I will give you that. But, authority figures preventing their charges from having sex should 100% be a thing. Between maturity, potential sexual assault, rape, and pregnancy the staff at Hogwartz better damn well be actively discouraging it on premise. Of course, proper education into the matter should be offered.

Sorry, rambled for a long while their, but when it comes down to it, overall I feel sex is rarely used well in stories, nor is sex prevention used well. In 99% of stories honestly it should never come up, and if it does it honestly shouldn't be a big focus. Acknowledge that it's happening, we don't need to read several chapters about hooking up in closets, or of professors patrolling the hallways.

****** I am not the person you are replying to, but I do think that it should actually be discouraged.

That said, it should not be done by saying that sex is evil and stuff, but rather by talking about the possible consequences and showing sex as something that should not be done unless one is ready to accept the consequences and pay for whatever mistakes were made; obviously, talking about alternatives (i.e. masturbation) at the same time would also be necessary. So more of a “please do not do this if you are not really ready, you can harm yourself that way; here, this is what you need to know to be ready” thing.

Because really, I think that in a lot of cases sex education as it is fails both in teaching about masturbation as a thing that is normal and acceptable (especially when it comes to girls) and about the fact that sex can have consequences, long-lasting ones, and some commonly thought to be working ways to prevent those are nothing more than misconceptions, traps for those who do not know better (like the whole “you can't get pregnant if you are a virgin” nonsense, in many cases sex education does not explicitly address stuff like that).

Edit: And when I said “discouraged”, I meant by comparison, by presenting it as something with possible consequences and with actual alternatives (masturbation) that do not have those consequences, and as something that should be taken at one's own pace rather than rushed because “everyone does it”; not explicitly by saying things that are blatantly false or by shaming the kid for thinking about it because that's probably the second worst idea there is (the worst idea period being not to tell them anything about sex).

This is the very thing I effing recommended. Tell them to wait until they learn, immediately teach them, and then let them choose. But no, you had to get oh-so-righteous and decide that what I wrote was that we should tell them that sex is evil.

By the way, considering that my point basically amounts to “teach them of the risks and how they can prevent those”, your examples are crap because any trainer worth their money does discourage people who don't know anything from going into serious training without learning about it and we do teach people how to drive before letting them do it.

************** Because the overall tone is closest to discouraging: since many teenagers who do not have anyone to educate them do encourage their peers to not care how ready they are and just do it because why not, I believe it is worth it to mention when providing the education in question that they should not do it if they are not ready to provide a counter to that recklessness, which in my opinion makes the overall tone of it closer to discouraging than neutral because there's no mention that they should do it if they do feel ready to balance it (as I do not believe such a mention to be necessary if a thorough education---including the fact that sex can be pleasurable and there's nothing wrong or shameful with it “just because”---is provided).

Many teenagers are unsure of many things, including how ready they are to get intimate with someone else. Many of their peers encourage them because there's nothing for them to gain from discouraging, but if they do fall for that before they actually are ready they may---though they also may not, it depends on a lot of stuff---regret it. The adults around them in many cases discourage it in a destructive way, by presenting sex as evil or shameful or both; it is discouragement of the kind many people think about the most, true, and it's fairly useless to be honest. Then you have the people who say it's the girl's own choice; while the fact that they do not try to shame the kids or pull them into sex is commendable in itself, for those who don't really know what they want and how they feel it provides nothing, and the peer pressure trying to sweep them remains. That is why I believe it to be worth it to say that “I think they should not do it if they do not feel ready”; it is discouragement of a kind, sure, but it also says that the choice is completely theirs to make once they feel they are ready, and it provides them with /something/ to catch onto if they don't really want to be swept by peer pressure and do it “because everyone else does”; and if coupled with actual sex education worth something, it also means giving them some means with which they could judge if they do feel ready.

That is why.

Look, what I know by now is that it all boils down to the difference in circumstances: Where you live sex education is---assuming it is as you wrote it is---comprehensive and actually useful, making it unnecessary to discourage anything because the kids know what they ought to know, and were you to actually write about that I would have admitted that.

You could have written that I hid it in a wall of text so you missed it, or you could have written “sorry, I missed it”, and I would have understood because mistakes happen and sometimes on both sides. But you didn't do any of that. Heck, if your first reply concentrated on that one and went about the semantics of calling that discouraging, this discussion would have turned out much more constructive too, because whether or not one calls something like that discouragement or not is up to the person and I would have understood and possibly even admitted that I shouldn't have used such a word for it because the other party felt the word unsuited. But, again, that didn't happen and instead of replying to the core of the message you concentrated on the word “discouragement” to an unhealthy degree. And most of all, I did write, at the very beginning and then mentioned it again and again, that it is all because sex education where I am is a useless mess and the adults in general simply do not want to talk to kids about it. And yet you chose to not see that either.

Frankly, with all that, throughout the entirety of this “discussion” it felt as if you weren't replying to anything I wrote, but as if I was instead some kind of stand-in for people who are trying to shame sex where you live and who annoyed you. I can understand that as I get that people can get emotional about things of this kind when others are being irrational, but I tried to explain myself and again and again instead of addressing /what I wrote/ you replied to ... something else, cherry-picking stuff in a way that made a lot of our comments pretty much a waste of everyone's time. Do look at it from that perspective and tell me, would a little bit of annoyance at my side not be justifiable right now? Even now, you boil it down to “you don't get”, but have you ever, at any point of this discussion, actually read the entirety of the comments I wrote and tried to look at them with what information I gave you instead of with what you see in your country? Because to me it looks like you didn't even try to do that and as if all I did was a wasted effort because the other party decided not to actually read anything and then by the point they maybe did they'd already decided that since we were disagreeing for so long there simply cannot be anything right in anything I say. It does not feel good, let me tell you. It feels like I'd wasted time and effort. And this isn't the first time I'd seen you do something like that with some kind of discussion, nor am I the first recipient of such an approach.

My whole damn point was that sex shouldn't be discouraged, and starting a post with that line was simply more fuel for the idiots who think so. As is trying to justify the whole sham. If you write page-long diatribes about how sex ed should be good and why sex when ready shouldn't be discouraged, then why can't you simply say "sex shouldn't be discouraged"?

My entire point was that you led with one stupid line, which coloured your whole post.

Again, you could have told me that I should have put it differently, then, instead of treating it as if that was the core of the message. And you say it coloured it, the possibility of which I will not dispute, but later on you chided me for not writing things that I actually did write and you concentrated on the word to a degree that would make any external observer agree that it's not about the word colouring anything.

That does not make for a healthy discussion, and though I will accept that I might have put it differently and that at least some of the fault lies on me, the way you replied to it makes the lion's share of it go to you. You could have acted in many ways that would have made for a better discussion, but instead you chose the one way that showed you as not trying to actually reply to my comment. Indeed, you say you agreed with some of what I wrote, and it took how many comments exchanged for me to get you to stop talking about this one part to the exclusion of everything else and doing it in a way that could be construed as you disagreeing with all of what I wrote?

So, again, while I do accept I could have done it better, I put a lot of the blame for what happened on you.

************************ Because you went about it all wrong. Do note your first reply, in which you acted as if I wrote that it should be discouraged regardless of the circumstances, which simply isn't true. Then note the fact that later on you wrote that I didn't write something that I have already written, more than once, and later it happened again with something else that I'd also already written; and none of those things you'd actually addressed, outside of giving the word “defensive” with no reasoning that led you to such judgment. This is your first reply to mine:

#+begin_quote
  So, should we "discourage" sports too, since if you have an accident on the field you can ruin your life or even die? What about driving? Why should kids learn how to drive if they can kill themselves and others in accidents?

  See what happens if you actually think your argument through?

  We teach people how to do it safely, and then let them do it. Sports, driving, or sex - it's the same, just the age at which you start differs.
#+end_quote

You wrote in your previous comment that it is all because the initial sentence of my first comment coloured the perception, but your replies could very easily have been construed to focus on that one sentence to the exclusion of anything else.

You did not actually address the rest of the message, the core part of it, nor did you agree about anything here. No, this very message centres just on the word “disagreement”, and just like you say my one sentence coloured the conversation from my side, so has this comment from your side. And allegedly by that point you knew that the word “disagreement” was not what I meant and that it was just unfortunate phrasing; if so then this is the very worst course of action you could have chosen because if you really knew then this message of yours, as one that does not actually address what I wrote and implies that I had not been thinking at the same time, can be taken as rude and condescending. And, again, we are talking about the impressions being coloured, so take that and think for a moment why would I not try to justify what I said earlier and that maybe if you did not concentrate on that one stupid word to such an unhealthy degree this conversation could have actually been productive and instead it isn't.

And yet I explained in the next paragraph that I do not mean it in the same way that the other person. You seem to have missed that, but you claim to have known. You acted as if I treated sex as bad despite the fact that more than once I wrote that I object to shaming it and treating it as “evil” which as far as I know counts as the same thing, and again you claim to have known what I meant. You say that you agreed to the “they shouldn't do it if they don't feel ready” thing, and yet you continued to go on about how I am wrong about discouraging it when I wrote that this is the one form of discouragement I support at all. My latter reasoning for why I called that particular thing a “discouragement” you called “defensive”, without giving any reasoning for it; this does not at all support your claim of agreeing with it, neither of those acts does. Twice, you have said that I did not write things that I wrote, as if that was a way to prove me wrong, and yet again there is the claim that you knew what I wrote.

We started from a difference of opinion. My first line wasn't the best, not even close to it. But then so was your first reply, whilst the latter part of my comment, the core part of it, was not as bad. And your claim that you knew, when you acted as if you had no idea, makes what happened worse because it means that you knew I did not mean what you wrote I meant with your cherry-picked stuff and tried to prove I am wrong for. And this---knowing that someone does not mean what you imply they mean and then getting onto their case for what you know they do not mean---is something I do not believe proper for an actual discussion, but rather an underhanded way to undermine someone.

#+end_quote

It could have ended after one reply, maybe two, with both of us agreeing to that, maybe disagreeing to the reason for me classifying what I did as “discouraging”, and not wasting time on a useless back-and-forth “no, you” thing that this became. I believe that in comparison this would have been much more productive than what we got simply because of lack of stupid disagreements over things that you claim you knew were expressed with the wrong words and yet acted as if you didn't.

Look, I really do get that I could have worded it much better. I do, really. But the same thing /really/ applies to you, especially with your claim to have known what I meant when you were replying. I did not know what you meant when you started acting the way you have, and so I replied with what I replied, some of it wrong (I do admit my second comment was aggressive, which was justifiable considering the circumstances but not excusable), but if you really knew then at any point you could have stopped the very thing that was happening. You did not. /That/ is a failure in communication, and that one is on you, no matter what was wrong with my replies. And honestly, right now I am continuing because I have seen a few discussion chains go to a weird place because you acted in a way similar to that, so I am writing to say that please do stop that and reply to what actually is meant when you /know/ the other person has failed to convey their ideas, rather than replying to a few words taken out of the context and meaning you know about which then results in nothing useful.

I do know I made mistakes here, sure. I could have not made my second comment what it was; I could have tried to reply differently than I have; I could have not used the same opening sentence for the first comment of mine that I have. But I know you also made mistakes. Are you capable of admitting to /that/? Because so far it does not appear to me so, and that is the core of the problem we got to now, or at least I think we did.

Could I have worded that better? Probably. I could have let the matter drop too. I could have written "Well, starting a long post with a statement you don't actually mean is a bad idea", or something like that.

****** There is a rather large difference between knowing something is going to happen, and being ok with it. Yes, students will get into things they really shouldn't. No, it is not ok for teachers to ignore or encourage such a thing. They have a responsibility to get students through their halls as safe as possible. Education is key. Almost as important though is taking precautions to try to make it happen less. Sure, the determined ones will find a way, but if they can cut down on sex in school then there will be less incidence at school. Give the kids the tools to be safe, make sure they know that their could be consequences, STD's, Pregnancy, make sure they know that sex isn't the end all be all of relationships, make sure they have a healthy attitude, yes it feels awesome, no it doesn't mean love. Tell them to not do it at school. I don't feel like it's that crazy of a concept.

As for your question, how weird that you would even ask it. I feel like there is not real good answer to it, because either way I am advancing a weird stereotype. I will say that usually when America comes up in these sort of things it's because of lack of education, which is absolutely not what I am encouraging. Education is the first and most powerful tool when it comes to preventing teen pregnancy and disease.

***** Of course they don't want their students having sex. But will telling them not to do it stop them? No.

The best way to approach this problem is teaching kids about how to have sex safely, that's it's okay to have sex and it's okay not to be ready or not want to, that having sex is something natural.

Telling them not do it will not help because sex feels good and they are hormonal teenagers. Abstinence only does not work.
