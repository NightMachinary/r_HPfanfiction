I can't find this fic and I know I read it.

Harry finds some kind of magical artefact and he activates it. It sends Hermione into the past where she wakes up as Lily Evans' twin sister.

I only remember vague details. Something about there being Hermione roses on the wallpaper in the room Lily and Hermione share in their parents home. I believe Hermione ends up dating Sirius and that both she and Lily end up breaking off their friendship with Severus.

Help me out, does anyone know what fic I'm talking about???? Every time I search I end up finding fics where Hermione is James' sister. Those fics are all awesome, but not what I'm looking for.

*** I don't believe I've ever seen that one before. I'll add it to my list, but this isn't it either. Thanks for looking. :)

**** There is also [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7719418]] which is again not a perfect match but has lily and hermione as twins and Sirius/hermione listed as a pairing. It's not complete either, though

** It is definitely Thief of Time.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4714340/1/The-Thief-of-Time]]

The author abandoned this fic and is rewriting a new one called fair fortune (which someone already linked). But it hasn't been updated in a while.
