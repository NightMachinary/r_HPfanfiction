From Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Malicious compliance is the behaviour of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly following the orders of a superior knowing that compliance with the orders will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order's intent but follows it to the letter.

I love the concept of Harry being fed up with all the nonsense and ridiculous demands of him, and cranks "passive aggressive" up to eleven. linkffn(Saying No by Bobmin356) is a perfect example of this.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  Eight yearold Harry is ignored, treated as a servant, and generally detested by his so called family. Naturally, he's not about to take that lying down. Join Harry on his passive aggressive quest for revenge on a normal day in his perfectly abnormal world
