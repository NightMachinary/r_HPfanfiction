I can't read any of the more popular fics because of the following things:

- bashing

- overpowered Harry/Hermione(intelligent, powerful etc.)

- manipulative Dumbledore

I want to read a story where characters act like they do in canon(Ron is still a good friend). Their romance must NOT be a big part of the story.


** Forever Knight [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1]]

In my opinion this is the best Harry/Hermione story. It is AU, however it is a joy to read. One of the few fics what I stayed up all night reading.

** linkffn(3186836) voxCorporis a good fic, the ending is pointlessly dragged out but becides that very enjoyable

linkffn(2841153) the sword of Gryffindor again pretty good it goes a bit over the top at points but some of the scenes are golden.

that was off the top of my head if I think of more I'll edit them in

** I think you might like my crossover story, "Uncle Quentin's Spy". Though while I do not think there's any bashing there, and Ron stays a good friend (and hero), Dumbledore is quite a bit more active than in canon, and quite a bit more ruthless as well (at least when it comes to handling Death Eaters and other threats to his students). He is firmly on the side of the innocents though, and he doesn't want Harry to die, doesn't meddle with his love life, or otherwise tries to manipulate the boy's life.
