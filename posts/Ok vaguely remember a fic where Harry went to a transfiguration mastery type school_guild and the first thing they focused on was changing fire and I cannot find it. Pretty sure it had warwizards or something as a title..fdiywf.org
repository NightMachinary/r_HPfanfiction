#+TITLE: Ok vaguely remember a fic where Harry went to a transfiguration mastery type school/guild and the first thing they focused on was changing fire and I cannot find it. Pretty sure it had warwizards or something as a title.

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.
