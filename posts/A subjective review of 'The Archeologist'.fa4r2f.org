So, I'm making this a semi-regular thing. This being writing reviews for fics after I read them, obviously only if I feel like I actually have something to say. For my first piece, here is a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ebv6rt/a_subjective_review_of_core_threads/][link]] for my review of Core Threads that I posted a couple months back, if you want to have a look at it. Warnings apply - subjective opinion, not omniscient, don't intend to offend anybody, could be talking out of my ass, the usual stuff.

Let's get started. Today I'm going to talk about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318951/1/The-Archeologist][The Archeologist]], written by Racke. I read it all in one go this afternoon, so it's never gonna be fresher in my mind than now. As with Core Threads, I'll make a short, mostly spoiler-free section outlining the generalities of it, then go into detail after a warning for those who would prefer reading it first. I'll also cover my thought on the author in this section, since they shouldn't have much to do with the fic itself.

It's a Fem!Harry fic, in which a Harry in his 30s who has been working as a curse-breaker for years gets caught up in a curse/ward and thrown in another dimension, in the body of a long deceased Rose Potter, in 1993. Things evolve from there, with the now renamed Harriet Azalea getting a new legal identity and going from there. I know this sounds kinda generic, but bear with me here, I'm leaving a lot of details out that I'll give later.

Since it's a pretty important part of the fic, I would also add that elements from Bloodborne feature very prominently in it. It's not tagged as a crossover, and the author explains why that is in one of the notes; they want a ruin for Harriet to traipse in, but don't want to create one from scratch, so they used Yarnham as a backdrop. Knowledge of Bloodborne isn't required, as they do a pretty good job explaining things (I could follow along well enough without ever having played the game, though I admit to having absorbed more than a bit on the setting from crossover fics). Some cameos from other works also feature into it, though I'll talk about them in the spoiler section since one of them is a relatively important character.

Side note: placing Yarnham in northern Italy is stupid. The aesthetic is so aggressively gothic that it just doesn't make sense to place it anywhere but in Britain, or at the very most northern France/Germany. I say this as a guy born and raised in Italy, though I can acknowledge it's nitpicking.

Now, before I start criticizing stuff (and I tend to criticize a lot, like 80% of this is going to be me complaining), let me be quite clear on this - I like this fic. It's good. 8/10 easily. That said, there are things I don't like about it, and I'm entitled to my own opinion on the matter and have the right to share that opinion with strangers on the internet for a nebulous sense of recognition or whatever. Most of what I write is criticism, because I try to keep a running tally of everything that doesn't agree with me. The good stuff, most of it ends up left behind - I'll probably mention something good if it's a general vibe of the fic, or if it's something Really Good with capital letters, or if it's something I find unusual. That's why most of my review is weighted towards negativity.

Would I recommend this fic? Yes. Definitely, at least worth a try. Cursebreaking isn't something you see done well often, the characters are quite likable, the story itself has a slight humorous bent to it that reminds me of fics like 800-Rent-A Hero. It's not for everyone, and the writing can be a bit off-putting, but it's not overly long and it's pretty self-contained.

My most pressing complaint is that, well, frankly, I don't like how it's written. It's very, very heavy on exposition over dialogue. Quite a lot of time is spent describing things - things that are happening, that have happened in the past as Harriet reminisces, and obviously what is passing in the characters' heads. It makes the pacing of each scene very slow, especially during conversations: between one line of dialogue and the next there could very well be five paragraphs of tangents to parse through, which meant I often had to go back up to see what the new line was responding to. Not always, but often enough.

The author addresses complaints about this in chapter 3, where he (rightly) professes that 'show, don't tell' is not the end-all of writing advice, since it mostly pertains to writing movie scripts. Which, well, ok yeah, you're right. He also says that he doesn't like dialogue-heavy stories, which ok, matter of taste. You're the author, you decide what to write. On the other hand, between this and the next chapter's notes, he expresses opinions I disagree with, so I'm taking the time to address this now.

He says, and I'm paraphrasing here since it's spread over a few paragraphs, that giving unsolicited criticism is wrong, because it discourages authors from continuing their stories. That becoming a better author is done by keeping writing, and listening to advice is useless. And that fanfiction authors don't write to "perfect their art", but for the sake of telling a story.

And I'm here like, ok bro, that works for you, but maybe dial back on making sweeping statements like that. That's your perspective on writing fanfiction, but saying that everyone has to share it is kind of... arrogant? I know this is really obvious to a lot of people, but not everyone is the same. Maybe you've got the guy who writes fanfiction to better their English, or who wants to go on to write professionally one day - in that position I would rather have a hundred nitpickers telling me what I'm doing wrong than a thousand well-wishers with vapid praise. Saying you just get better by keeping at it while ignoring any and every criticism sounds like a recipe for disaster.

But speaking of praise, I'm pulling an actual quote from this part because I can't even

#+begin_quote
  (It should also be noted that reviews that are condensed into the phrase "update soon" should probably be rewritten as "great work", in order to actually encourage an author to continue working, instead of convincing them that you're treating them like a fic-dispenser that can never create enough for you.)
#+end_quote

I get where you're coming from since it sounds like you got swarmed with the same useless advice over and over, but at that point, if you don't want criticism, why do you even read reviews? If all you want from them is a pat on the back and a 'great work', just look at the number of favorites/follows and ignore the comments altogether.

In case this wasn't clear (it probably wasn't from how I'm talking about it), the overall message underlining this is, quite explicitly, to respect others. Good message to have as a rule of thumb, but I still think it's lacking perspective - especially on the part of the readers. You can't consider any kind of media without thinking of the audience.

But I think I've said quite enough about the author, so let's give a quick recap and then jump into the spoiler parts.

*TL;DR - Like the story, found some questionable advice in the author's notes. Fem!Harry (of the genderbend variety), curse-breaking, mild AU, dimensional travel to another mild AU, stealth crossover with Bloodborne.*

​

* Spoilers for everything in this fic, from this point on. Beware, Ye who read below.

  :END:
​

Let's go straight in the deep end and start with the biggest thing: I don't like how this fic tackles gender. Now, before you start throwing stones at me, the problem I have with this story is not the use of a Fem!Harry. I like it as a concept, some of my favorite stories have Fem!Harry (I avidly follow Swords and Sorcery, which is probably the best Fem!Harry I've ever read). What I don't like is how... Irrelevant it is. To everything. Making Harry a woman in the first timeline too would have been better, in my opinion - it would make sense for him not to be fazed by a sudden gender change, if there was no change at all. But that's not the case. Harry went from his late 30s to a little girl and it feels like he barely reacts. He just steals some money, gets a potion to permanently age himself to around 16, gets a legal identity and goes on to Yarnham to think about the situation, because fucking Yarnham is the perfect place for some quiet contemplation. No crises of identity, no gender or body dysphoria past a momentary confusion, he just shrugs and goes "well, I could change my sex back to male with a 2 years long potion regime, but who cares". It's baffling.

As I said, making Harry having been already a woman resolves this pretty neatly. You can keep the old timeline vague enough that people would expect a normal 'stations of canon but with Fem!Harry' setting, but it's fine because it's just the backstory. It would be practically the same as it is right now, with the exception of Harry's relationship with Ginny (you could change it to them growing closer as friends and living together for a period while Ron and Hermione got married, or any number of other things). And another way to resolve this neatly would be, well, just eliminating the Fem!Harry element altogether. It doesn't really add much of anything to the story - if you swapped every Harriet for Harry and deleted a half dozen paragraphs in the whole fic it would be basically the same.

On that note, I felt like one of the weirdest things about this fic was how complete the shift to being a woman was. There is no degrees here, no gradual shift - he was male, then she was female. No tripping over pronouns, no real problems adjusting, it felt like a switch was flipped and that was it. The only thing that doesn't change is his orientation, as he still likes women. For the slash pairing. That all is why the Fem!Harry element of this fic doesn't work, in my opinion.

Related to the Fem!Harry stuff but kind of tangential, I want to point out two things. First is, what's up with Rose's body? For context, Rose is AU!Harry's twin; Pettigrew betrayed the Potters' location as in canon, but due to convoluted circumstances involving him being Rose's godfather and Voldemort being asked to spare her, Harry gets his blood protection and the scarcrux due to Rose's sacrifice. Lupin dies instead of Lily and James, as he was babysitting them and they weren't there. So, Rose Potter (age about 1.3) gets buried, and about 12 years later gets body-jacked by Harry. The question is, is he in her barely toddling body? Did the body get aged appropriately (to local Harry time)? I have no clue. He describes the body as prepubescent, which a dictionary tells me means early teens, but why did this happen, like, at all? Why has her body aged rather than staying the same, and at that point, why not age her to MC!Harry's actual age, rather than local!Harry's?

I wanted to say two things, but while I was writing the above I forgot what else was there. Ah, no, wait, I remember. The womb thing. Practically the only nod to the fact that Harry is now a woman, and has to deal with women things, is that not even a month in his new situation he gets the urge to use an ancient Indian ritual to remove the entirety of his sexual organs so that he doesn't have to deal with periods.

I'm being a bit facetious here - the actual stated reason is that he doesn't want children, as he already had his fill with raising Teddy and, more importantly, his passion for cursebreaking would have him missing for months on end and he wouldn't want to inflict the loneliness he himself felt on any child. And the period thing, that also factored in. Still, great reason/character moment, kind of needlessly disgusting in execution. If I didn't want to have children I would get a vasectomy, not cut off my penis and testicles in the spur of the moment because I don't want to deal with awkward boners. But I'm not a woman, so I don't know if there is a different mentality about it. Also, possible medical concerns are raised about it when he tells the truth of everything to everyone he's close to, but it doesn't amount to anything. It's mentioned, and dismissed just like that.

Let's switch to another topic now, though. Let's talk about cameos. And the Bloodborne stuff.

I don't like how he used cameos (shocking, I know). They are wholly unnecessary to the fic, and add nothing to it. Since there aren't many, I'll go through them in order of ascending importance to the plot. Tintin (who I'm not familiar with other than knowing he exists) is the DADA professor at Beauxbatons, accompanying his students for the Triwizard tournament. An Einzbern (from Fate) is the potion master from Durmstrang, doing the same - with the added note that he's here specifically because Hogwarts had problems with the potions' teacher position the year before (to recap - Dumbledore has been sacked due to butterflies from Rose's body being desecrated, McG took his place as Headmistress, she reviewed Snape's work and found it appalling, keeping an eye out for an opportunity to kick him out. He goes ballistic over a prank after stewing for months and gets sacked around the winter holidays, but since McG can't find a substitute on short notice the Ministry sends Umbridge to fill in, who sucks and is hated by everyone, eventually she gets thrown out around the end of the year for having offended Draco, then next year McG hires Lily to teach).

The first cameo seems utterly pointless to me - maybe there is something I'm missing about it from not knowing the source, since there is a quite lengthy tangent about vigilantism in France due to how they teach DADA following Grindelwald causing a dearth of serious Dark Lord problems. Still, could be cut out without losing anything of value. The second is the same - I know the source material this time, and potions+Germany=Einzberns isn't a stretch, but I still question the inclusion. The little detail, of Durmstrang bringing a potion teacher along because of previous event, that's good. Great, even. It really ties the world together, to see actions having consequences, and I think the author has a really good grasp on this. You could take this little detail and spin a number of narratives from it, all equally valid - Did Karkaroff bring him just a slap on the face to Hogwarts? Is this a nod to it being a more traditionally pureblood establishment, that they don't think a muggleborn like Lily can teach potions adequately? Is it just because they had heard of the trouble Umbridge caused the last year, and wanted to make sure they got their education? Could be all of them, could be none. Still, the point is, the name Einzbern is void of meaning here. Not having a name would have given the same result, as would have giving them a random germanic name.

Maybe I just don't get cameos at all, and I'm charging at windmills on something that doesn't matter.

Let's shift out of the cameos, and talk about the straight-up expys - at least those have an actual role in the story. There are three of them: Kagome and Inuyasha, both from the eponymous anime Inuyasha, and Argo, from Sword Art Online.

The three of them are introduced during Harriet's second foray into Yarnham - having gained a kind of 'dibs' on the site since she was the one who brought it to light, Gringotts' (who more or less have a monopoly on the international curse-breaking business) sends the three of them, plus a young Bill Weasley, to 'help' her with the exploration in hopes of gaining credit for the whole operation. Kagome and Inuyasha are married, and are both veteran curse-breakers who specialize respectively in purification rituals and barriers. Argo, like her counterpart, is an information broker/journalist, with the addition of being a history buff. She's also about the same age as Harriet's body, which means slash romance between the two as a last chapter tease.

So, the five of them spend a few weeks exploring what I believe is supposed to be the Chalice Dungeon under Yarnham, and we get a good chapter and a half of action, magical bullshit explanations, piecing together history from architecture, cursebreaking and Harriet Azalea being what is basically memetic Madara with a wand. It's great. These are the parts that I think really make the fic worth reading - the writing style full of tangents the author prefers lends itself very well to the more action and exploration-focused parts. Well, these and the parts where she pulls a Rent-A-Hero, just with History of Magic instead of Divination. And that part where McGonagall caught her after she exorcised Binns, and they start a running fight around Hogwarts. Or when Argo gets to write articles in the Prophet about the TWT, and uses the occasion to drag Fudge through the mud. And Argo explaining her backstory as a runaway who faked her own death, and attended her funeral as one of 700 Athenian prostitutes. Lots of great moments in this fic, for all that it looks like I'm shitting on it.

Let's get back on the negative train. The way the author handles it's 'crossover' elements (I mean both the Bloodborne stuff and the cameos) just rubs me the wrong way. It's kind of a two-sided coin though: there is a good part, and a bad part. Pulling some quotes from an author's note

#+begin_quote
  It's really just done for the sake of convenience, in that I'm very familiar with Bloodborne's twists and turns, and can concentrate on having fun translating the magical theory of it into something consistent.

  [...] If I wanted to do that much work, I'd be writing original fiction instead.
#+end_quote

That second part of the first sentence? That's the good part. That's how you make good crossovers, at least for the fusion kind. The rest of it smacks of laziness. Especially because, well, you don't need to make stuff up whole-cloth. Since you don't want to call it a Bloodborne crossover (which it totally is), you could have filed off those serial numbers - you already changed a bunch of stuff to make it fit with HP, why not go all the way? The specific names aren't important. The atmosphere, the vibe of Bloodborne is already there, you already wrote a ruined city with ancient, magical secrets, why not go the extra step and change the name? I just don't get the point.

I'll try to cut this short from here, so I can get some sleep. Here are a few miscellaneous things.

The AU elements for the magic is generally pretty good. The things like resonance and similar, the various rituals and ancient spells, good stuff. Magic in this fic is interesting, which is something you actually don't see that often. On the other hand, there is a burning question in my mind: if, while messing with wards, it's easy to get cascade failures that result in giant explosions, why the fuck would anyone want a ward around their home?

Then a small complaint - it's said a couple times early on that messing up while dealing with the horcruxes would result in demons being summoned, but without the explanation for why (the method she would use makes a small rip to let magic/evil stuff go into another dimension, from which demons could pass through) it really doesn't mesh with the rest.

Some of the tangents get pretty preachy about tropes, to the point that sometimes it feels like there is no separation between author and narrator. On the other hand, some of the tangents are genuinely interesting. Lots of interesting trivia in there.

Cutting it off here since it's 3 in the morning. Posting it now, so I can regret not having combed through it for edits tomorrow morning.

Edit: forgot a couple things I wanted to include in the last stretch, so I'm just gonna add them quick. The horcruxes being considered as anchors rather than one-ups for ghost!Voldy was a great idea that I can't remember having seen before (basically, destroying the horcruxes while V-man doesn't have a body would make his free-floating soul pass on because it has lost its tethers). Didn't like the ending very much - I know the '16 hours of sex' was supposed to be a joke/callback to Argo's backstory, but the whole thing felt like slash for the sake of it. Could have spent more time on them slowly growing closer, rather than putting practically all of it in the same chapter. I felt like Sirius had a bit of a strange place, while Andromeda felt like a wasted opportunity - actually, first of all, did Sirius go through more than one year as DADA teacher? Is the second year after she destroys the diadem/voldy dies? can't remember now, I'll check tomorrow because I'm dying. Andromeda, her relationship with Harriet could have been more. There are hints of a motherly relationship, but it really could have developed a bit further than she being angry because Harriet keeps doing stupid shit and almost dying. Could have gone a bit further into it, with Andromeda being lonely because Tonks has grown up and become independent so she's seeing Harriet as a substitute since she would be about the right age. Harriet using the Stone as an eye is really interesting, but ultimately doesn't do much. Still, really cool idea.

Now for real, see you tomorrow.


** Wow this is a deep dive. I found the fic a breezy enjoyable read, except for some cliche repetitive moments like resorting to getting drunk to show exasperation, or the random pairing at the end. I think Inuyasha randomly showing up in the story was a bit out of place, but the author made it work by portraying him as this absentminded academic.

The one thing I didn't like it how the author responds to criticism. He gets very angry at what he perceives is unsolicited criticism and will definitely make his point clear. It totally soured my look at the whole story after getting a long angry personal message in that vein. There are some really interesting ideas, like turning the Resurrection Stone into an Eye, and the unintended effects of teaching wards to underage wizards, but a lot of that gets lost in some of the character interactions and a lot of detail in a game that if you haven't played, takes you out of the story

Already said my piece on cameos and expys, but to be clear I'm not completely against them. I just prefer them to be more subtle than "here is this guy from that anime you like". It would also work better to be subtle about it because, well, there are people who haven't watched Inuyasha, but know about it. If the cameo is subtle, a fan of the series can point at it and go "oh, cool, a cameo" and move on, and one who doesn't know it can move on regardless, oblivious to it, without losing immersion. It seems like a double-edged sword.

**** Oh I agree definitely. I actually don't watch anime or play video games, so I wasn't even aware of the unlisted crossover until the end. But I think the characterization of the Harry Potter characters was just slightly...off, and not because they were in an alternate universe.

And I think the author only acts this way when you address him personally. I think this general review in a forum will not be a problem

*** Inuyasha showing up was when i stopped reading. I dislike untagged crossovers, but at least with Bloodborne I could think "Ok, maybe it could work and while i'm miffed about the crossover i'll get over it" but then suddenly Inuyasha is their and it makes me flashback to my Naruto days. Their are to many fucking Naruto fanfics where Rukia and Ichigo are in the Naruto Universe for no goddamn reason that it's left a bad taste in my mouth for YEARS, and while the Archaeologist has it's moments it doesn't have nearly enough good moments for me to read past where i stopped.

You see this position with growing frequency. To me this inability to handle criticism just screams narcissism.

If you're writing purely for yourself and you don't want to expose yourself to criticism: don't publish your story online.

In reality, most of the individuals who adopt this position are in the business of writing fanfiction for ego-enhancing praise. It's a transaction: I write, and instead of paying me, you praise me in exchange. But in seeking out people to comment on your stories in the hope of receiving that praise, you impliedly consent to the risk of some of those comments being critical.

As for the fic, my overwhelming impression when I tried to read it was that it was just incredibly dull. The inconsequential gender change, the crossover elements, and the dense prose all add up to severe disinterest. Add the magic system to that, which is at best uninspired, at worst actively irritating, and it wasn't long before I was skimming and soon after that walking away.

I have to disagree on finding the magic system dull, but I can readily admit to being a sucker for exactly this kind of system in the first place, and I've already said my piece on the prose, but I generally agree.

  Except Voldemort had decided to honor that request enough to give Rose an opportunity to stand aside. And Rose hadn't taken it.

  She would've needed to understand what Voldemort was saying for the sacrificial requirements to be acceptable, and she'd still done it. Only a bit more than one single year old, and she'd given her life for the safety of her brother.

  So the idea of a girl who wasn't even a toddler, willingly sacrificing her life for the sake of her brother-...

  Side note: placing Yarnham in northern Italy is stupid. The aesthetic is so aggressively gothic that it just doesn't make sense to place it anywhere but in Britain, or at the very most northern France/Germany. I say this as a guy born and raised in Italy, though I can acknowledge it's nitpicking.
#+end_quote

I agree with this, it doesn't make any sense for Yarnham to be in Italy, you could probably put it somewhere in like Calais or Normandy, or Somewhere in Prussia or on some remote Island off the coast of Britain that it would work but not Italy.

My main issue with the story overall was it's pacing and the fact that it was an Untagged crossover. when i started reading the story and got smacked with Bloodborne all of a sudden it left a sour taste in my mouth...yes the setting can work for it, Yes i love Bloodborne but years of dealing with Shitty Naruto fanfics where Naruto is suddenly a soul reaper has ruined untagged crossover for me to the point where it's a pet peeve of mine.

** Well, Yharnam is based off of Prague, so Central Europe somewhere is the appropriate location for it. The author probably went with Italy due to the Healing Church being similar to the Catholic Church in general theme and appearance. As far as the fem!Harry... I despise pointless genderswapping, so I've never read this fic, despite Bloodborne being my absolute favorite videogame of all time.

Excellent in-depth review that confirms the opinion I already had of this story. I am uninterested in it.

Can't say if the Healing Church is similar since I haven't actually played the game, but the aesthetic is all wrong for northern Italy. We just don't really do gothic, outside a few very specific exceptions like Milan's Duomo. The names too, they are very Germanic in how they sound while we tend towards the Latin ones. It really feels like a British enclave, which could make sense if it was a secreted wizarding place built by British wizards in another country, but that's not how it's presented.

**** ...yes

Byrgenwerth is on the edge of a lake, quite possibly the same body of water near Castle Cainhurst. However, the Fishing Hamlet is on the coast, and is based on Innsmouth. To my knowledge, we're not given a very good indication of where Yharnam is in relation to the Fishing Hamlet, since the only way to access it is the Hunter's Nightmare. Geography is a little odd in there.

I personally would place Yharnam somewhere between Germany and Poland and have the Hamlet be on the Baltic Sea. That fits with Germanic names and gothic architecture and puts it close enough to the sea for the Kos-or-some-say-Kosm screwup.

** Oh, I've been slowly working on a review too with this fic, though it's mostly jotted down notes right now. It seems like a fairly divisive fic. Saw a bunch of people recommend it as a good fic and then a bunch of people push back against it. I'd personally put it slightly above average. Technical execution is good, premise is interesting, but heavily marred by all the telling which makes action less intense and the whole cosmic horror much less horrifying. The cameos are downright awful and the whole shrugging off the transformation in a way that isn't in-character greatly bothers me since reading about how characters have to deal with transformations is one of my favourite themes. And oof, I don't read author's notes usually so I didn't know how salty Racke is. I am of the opinion that if you willing put out a work for others to read there is an implicit understanding that you will get criticism, constructive or not, positive or not, and if you don't like it then you shouldn't be putting it out into the world. I think I've read like two or three other stories by them, I think they said this was their first long-form work? Regardless, it's their worst one by far.

** It is an interesting fic though a lot of things happen (as you point out) simply to happen and not for intrinsic reasons. I still think it is better than The Mad Mad Mad Reviewer's Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool which is another take on OP!Harry wakes up as Harriet in a parallel universe.

*** You can definitely see the influence, I think he even explicitly points out JE as inspiration. Still, I don't know if I would call it better or worse. JE mostly just sticks in my mind for the climactic duel against Grindledore, and I guess the interaction with Hedwig. I definitely found this fic more memorable, though time will tell on that front.

** I'll have to say, from your description, it sounds like a barely legible shitshow that has a very few interesting scenes in it (cursebreaking), but is otherwise uninspired, stale, and generally unpleasant to read.

For example, the cursebreaking segments sound very interesting, and the original lore is also pretty good, but I don't see why time-travel had to be an element at all. Like, the story would have been much better if it was just an original prompt with an adult fem!Harry cursebreaker that has an adventure. that way the author could have focussed on that aspect without being bogged down with original canon, which doesn't seems to be the story's focus at all.

It would also have avoided the expectations of dysphoria and the problem of age.

** I read this fic before and until you just said it, I had absolutely no idea there was supposed to be a bloodborne crossover. The name Yarnham means nothing to me, so I didn't pick it up at all.

I also didn't know who any of the other cursebreakers were or that they too came from other sources. I thought he made them up.

In that regard, he did an excellent job of integrating them into HP, because they don't feel out of place at all.

*** Don't get me wrong, integration of Bloodborne in a HP-ish setting was definitely one of the strong points of the fic, pretty sure I acknowledged it in the post too. My complaint with the cameos is mostly from a perspective of someone who knows just enough about the series they come from to know they exist, and this definitely took a toll on my immersion. I was mostly fine with Inuyasha, Kagome and Argo because they have a role in the story and (at least for Argo) diverge quite significantly from their counterpart, so after a momentary loss of SoD I shrugged and disassociated them, but the other two had no role in the story after being introduced, which makes them stick out all the more.

** I just finished reading the story and I completely agree with everything that you've said. Unnecessary cameos, unnecessary crossover (the whole city could have been called Atlantis for all that matters) and most of all: the tangents are a pain and the writer complaining about reviewers advising against show-don't-tell just feels entitled rather than pertinent.

One thing that I disagree with is the story being an 8/10 overall. I agree that the story COULD have been an 8/10 if the author had a nicer writing style (a tangent once in a while is ok, but the story feels a bit too much like an essay rather than, well, a story). The story would have been an 8/10 for me if it didn't fall into the unnecessary things mentioned above, but in it's state, I fought a lot against the tangents to not bore me to death and actually power through them to get to the rare interesting parts making it feels only a little above average for me. A shame!

** I feel that the change into fem!Harry did have a point, as a introduction to Harry's character... as in: Harry is so used to crazy stuff, that this life altering change doesn't really matter to him at all.

Other than that, yea I agree... except I fall into the camp that likes the writing style (especially that while we are given facts about the past... they aren't in /Flashback/-form), and don't really care either way about the Crossovers.

so, I too do recommend reading The Archeologist

*** I disagree, I really don't think you can change someone's sex just like that and have them "taking it in stride" neither biology nor psychology works like that unless they have an ego so big that they literally believe to be above the matters of the flesh (a very specific case of god complex) or if they are in the other extreme and simply don't have any ego at all for it to make an impact, besides there are a myriad of things you can do to add that shock value without adding what should be a monumental shift in a character and ultimately adding nothing to the story.

*** I really liked the hints to the past timeline. Except for one thing - there is no separation between his new persona and the old Harry, at all. If you skipped the first chapter, you would think he was born a woman. Just the simple change of thinking of himself as male when thinking about the time when he, well, was, would have made it so much better on both fronts (the tangents and the sex change).
