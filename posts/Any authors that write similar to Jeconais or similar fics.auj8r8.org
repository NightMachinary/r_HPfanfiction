Hi all

As the title says, I love reading and re-reading Jeconais' stories. Do you know of any fics or authors that are similar in style. I particularly enjoy Blue Steel and White Knight, Grey Queen and Perfect situations.


** There's James Spookie, who has an almost identical style. Like Jeconais, he's managed to write the same story with a dozen different titles.

*** I don't think that was really a complement. But James Spookie is one of my favorite authors and I really enjoyed Jeconais work as well. an extra rec is jbern. I think it was similar but not as close as Spookie.

** Anyone from that same time period feels similar. The first name that comes to mind is Kinsfire, but that could just because they are both on Fanficauthors.net...

I devoured that site way back when, so a lot of it is jumbled.
