** - Spreadsheet sounds like a good idea.

- I could never completely ignore the judgement if I posted my entire reading list publicly.

- ff.net favorites and follows system only allows for saving things from that site.

My solution? My Google Chrome bookmarks bar looks like a bomb went off. I probably have the most comprehensive list of H/Hr fanfic ever collected and its absolutely not sorted in any way, easily a few hundred fics, probably closer to 1000 than 0.

*** This sounds like me. My bookmarks bar is insane. Thank god Chrome will save your bookmarks if you log in - I just got a new computer and wanted to cry thinking about trying to save all those fics. But I didn't have to, in the end :D.

I keep meaning to Google doc them all and save offline copies of my faves but it's just such a massive amount of work I keep putting it off...

** Am I the only one who... /doesn't?/

I read something I enjoy (or don't enjoy) and if need be (for references, referring or rereading), try to find it be searching online using bits and pieces of my memory.

It works out pretty well and is efficient because I don't need to do anything.

*** I fav fics when I consider them good enough to re-read. Beyond that I don't log either.

** I keep a word doc, just with the pertinent details and links of each fic, and I download stories as well. Recently I've decided a word doc isn't ideal and I'm converting my list to excel, with a few extra details and an "out of 5 stars" rating. (I really, really suck at reviewing things, so a star rating is the best I can do.) I'm logging them on delicious as well to have an online bookmark archive, but as I'm re-reading things in the process of doing this it's a bit slow going so my word doc is still the primary log.

*** I do something similar, except that I sort by Pairing and then Title

** I wish there was a "read this" button on fanfic.net as well as the favorite option. Pretty much if I read it and liked it at all/didn't consider it completely terrible, I favorite it.

** I download everything that sounds promising or that I liked. I then sort the epub-files in categories based on era (Canon, Marauders and Next gen) and, if I have enough stories to fill a subcategory, in subcategories. I prefer to read on an e-reader, hence all the downloads, but even if I've already read a story online I'll download it if I liked it. I've only started doing this recently, because I hate remembering a fic but not being able to find it again. It's not perfect, but I know that even if I start a file with reviews I'll just abandon that after a while because I get lazy.

** Making use of a spreadsheet or downloading everything you read and keeping an archive seems like the way to go.

That said, I am lazy so I just use bookmarks. Firefox has a neat bookmark sidebar that allows to search for something you have already read, and it gets even better with an addon that has a 'find target' function. (It basically shows you the exact spot of that bookmark you just searched within its folder, which is really helpful if your folders are as large as mine.)
