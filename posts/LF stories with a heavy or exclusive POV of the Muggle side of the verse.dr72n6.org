** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Harry with his typical tendency to get into trouble accidentally manages to get himself into the background of a Super Bowl ad seen by millions and the Statute of Secrecy goes down the drain.

It's a pretty unusual fic with dozens of interwoven subplots and even more different perspectives, with lots of different things happening at the same time all around the world, from car companies hiring wizards to make flying cars to international politics struggling to avoid all out nuclear war.

There's some chapters from the perspectives of Harry or Voldemort doing their plot, some from the secretary of magic of the United States dealing with international politics, some from the perspectives of religious extremists in Westboro or Palestine plotting how to rid the world of wizards, some from the perspectives of students at MIT learning about magic in physics class, some from the perspectives of scientists trying to make sense of it all, and one of my favorite chapters is from the perspective of astronauts on Mir wondering how an old shoe got into their station.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** I have some self-recommendations:

This one's seasonally appropriate, especially if you enjoy depressing Christmas stories.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255]])

Here's a work in progress set earlier in the same depressing universe:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14939201/chapters/34612796]])

And on a lighter note, here's another WIP, this one starting with some muggle strippers discussing a peculiar customer:

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  When a human is captured by werewolves, escape is impossible, but she might be able to accomplish one thing: kill Remus Lupin. He's the most evil werewolf in the pack because he's the best at pretending to be human.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.
