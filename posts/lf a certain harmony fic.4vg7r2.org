I remember reading this Harmony fic awhile back that I'd love to read again but I can't find it to save my life. It was a soul-bond Harmony where Hermione had a creature inheritance because her mother is a dragon and so Hermione and Harry both turn into dragons at some point. (I'm horrible at summarizing things, it really was a good fic though) Thanks in advance for any help!


** "On Crimson Wings". It's not a soul-bond, they are linked after they do a ritual.

  Response to GoldenSteel's My gf is a what? challenge. GoF: Hermione has a secret. One that even she doesn't know. When she unearths a highly dangerous ritual to help Harry in the first task, the two of them never expected that secret to hit them both and change them into Great Dragons! Are they doomed to be treated as beasts? What does this mean for the TWT? H/Hr; AD/RW/MW putdown.
