** “Thank You Ms Bones by old-crow” linkffn(3230439), but it is a typical old-crow story, with all its heavy Harmony, bashing, etc.

  Post OoTP Harry's life takes an unexpected turn when Fawkes provides Harry with a means of mobility. Ch 32 concludes the final six-chapter arc. Forget Book 7.

** Can't link it while on mobile but 'From Ruin' has a time traveling Harry getting a Phoenix from the Flamels.

It sounds cliche as hell but I was enjoying the fic. Not sure if it's been updated since January while the author works on some Naruto fic though

  It all went wrong. Harry was locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond, unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him when Harry is sent back in time with one mission, to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

** linkffn(8413047)

Trigger warning on Good Master. Also on undetermined hiatus and ends on a slight cliff hanger in an intense scene.

Against My Nature, originally posted by Araceil (she deleted from ffn, still on ao3, but the story isn't there). You can find her original posts of it up to ch 31 on her Facebook here: [[https://www.facebook.com/Araceilfanfiction/notes/]] But someone has also reposted up to ch 32 on Wattpad here: [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/190422945-against-my-nature]]

Note on that one is it is Newt/Harry (Harry time travels to the past), and it's abandoned.

  Harry didn't have the authority of the Ministry. He didn't have the reputation of the Dark Lord. He didn't have the influence of Lucius Malfoy. At heart, he was a simple tailor. "But anyone who had heard of Harry Potter knew that he was more than just a simple tailor. He was a good master." Abused, wise-beyond-years Harry.
