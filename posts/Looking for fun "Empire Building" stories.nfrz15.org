Hello there!

So I'm looking for basically what the title asks, but that can be in the form of a company, a group or team, a government organization, etc etc.

The themes or tropes that typically come into play are incremental increases in power and group size, usually with a base or town as the center of operations that steadily gets bigger or new locations are created / acquired. Super!Harry is common but /ideally/ done over small incremental increases in power.

Some example stories would be the HP/GoT crossover: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132113/1/The-Difference-One-Man-Can-Make][The Difference One Man Can Make]]

And to a somewhat lesser extent the HP/Avengers crossover: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13326497/1/Post-Apocalyptic-Potter-from-a-Parallel-Universe][Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe]]

(It's been quite a while since I read the latter but I recall liking the progression of Harry's abilities and gaining allies from the MCU.)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] is exactly about Harry building an empire. It's a significant AU obviously. For example: James and Lily survived, there's no BWL, Harry never went to Hogwarts, and Voldemort is not an Avada Kedavra addict. Every side is smart and ruthless, so it's great fun to see these operators plotting against each other

** You're mostly looking at time travel or crossovers for this. And even then the pickings are slim. An HP/Stargate one:

If you stretch the definition of "empire building" to include "having a powerful influence over an extended period of time which guides a society" then I'd add these two:

  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
