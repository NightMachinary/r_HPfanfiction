Dear Fellow Fanfic readers and writers,

Why do we keep glorifying muggles and muggle culture when the world of magic is at our feet? When placed in the perfect position to go further, allow our creativity to run wild and explore new things, we constantly limit ourselves by falling for the trap of refusing to leave our comfort zones. While I understand the need to write from personal experience and establish a grounding, it doesn't make sense for us to write about the world we try to escape from in the world where we have utilised as our escape.

I've just read too many muggle culture glorifying fics and its left a bad taste. And honestly it is extremely confusing.

Also, if you do want to glorify muggle culture, please come up with something more substantive than Pizza, Pancakes, Popcorn, the cinema and a trip to the moon. Magicals would have eaten pizza too. Guess why? Pizza is a dish from Italy that is pretty common amongst everyone. It's highly likely that Italian wizards eat there. And unless you have an impression that magicals in Britain have or will never leave their own country, or interact with Italians, it's again, highly likely that they know about it. Same goes for coffee. While it may not be as popular in England as it is everywhere else, people in England know about coffee. The sun never sets of the British Empire, remember? Pretty sure some colony was being used as a coffee estate. And magicals can fly on brooms. Don't tell me they'll be impressed by aeroplanes and tall buildings. These guys were probably the first to enjoy the view.

And enough with the stupidity of cameras and satellites being able to spot them. Here's how muggle repelling charms and muggles work - they literally give any other explanation in the minds of the muggles as to what's happening or that they need to be elsewhere, and muggles jump at that and accept it because they'd rather believe anything else. So in other words, even if those things work and give evidence to the muggles ( which I really don't believe would happen ) the muggles still wouldn't see it.

What I'm trying to say is, Magic isn't backward. The trend of making muggles greater than magicals is stupid. Also probably why Grindelwald wanted to kill them off. If muggles were so great, why do they all want to be magical?


** I take issue with your framing of the question; there is no "we" in this context. There are individuals who like to write certain types of stories and individuals who like to read them. That's it.

Why do /they/ glorify muggles? because they want to, and because other people want to read such stories, that is ultimately what it boils down to. The good news is that you can exercise that same level of individuality by avoiding those stories in favor of things you prefer or better yet, write your own that focus on the magical world, that way you get to express yourself (while letting fellow authors and readers enjoy whatever kind of stories they like); other like-minded people can enjoy your stories and perhaps feel inspired to write their own, similar fics.

Who knows, maybe you write some sick fics and over time perhaps you can even tip the scales and outnumber those pesky muggle-loving stories.

*** You're a very mature person and I appreciate your approach.

I wasn't looking to fight. Rather I wanted to ask those that did write those fictions the mind set behind their stories to gain a better understanding and perspective in order to appreciate what they are trying to convey.

The purpose of this post was always to have a discussion. Unfortunately what I aimed to ask, and what people thought I was asking was very badly miscommunicated, and probably is something I need to work on. However here is to learning from this experience and those to come in future, and getting better at communicating. Fortunately despite the miscommunication, I did learn a bit regarding their reasoning as well.

  If muggles were so great, why do they all want to be magical?
#+end_quote

They don't.

Sure most people do, that's the whole point of fiction isn't it? You aren't "supposed" to read Harry and wish that you were a muggle in that setting. You put yourself at Hogwarts. You make yourself magical (even Rowling has stated that Hermione is essentially her stand in). And that generates the kind of stories that either ignore muggles entirely as people (including canon. Hermiones mind wipe of her parents is objectively wrong and dehumanizing), or that treat them as inferior.

The thing is, you aren't a wizard, and you never will be. None of us will be. And for some readers and writers, that changes the perspective they approach a fic from. No longer are they "on the side of the wizards" justifying the terrifying implications of the Harry Potter Universe. They are thinking about how they would feel in a world where magic is real and they don't have it. They don't want to write a story where they are inferior or ignored. So they don't, and they often find perfectly logical reasons to feel that way. Sure the moon landing might be overplayed in fics, but nothing in canon gives any indication that wizards have been there other than a crackpot in the quibbler that claimed to fly there on his broom. Wizards are isolationist, so its perfectly reasonable to assume that the same wizards who can't figure out how muggles dress have no idea what muggles are capable of and haven't considered the implications of muggle surveillance.

There is, of course, the other direction of extreme though, "mugglewank" as its often referred to. Muggles are better than magicals at "everything" except magic, and even then technology will always win in the end. Its not good writing either but it's understandable. Its the same exact style of escapism and fantasy as pro wizard fics. It lets the author and readers feel less powerless. Not by giving them magic, but by elevating their entire peer group.

Completely pro wizard writing misses the entire point and moral of Harry Potter. It establishes the line that Wizards > Muggles in the same way that bigots in universe establish that same line and take it one step further to say that Pureblood > Mudblood.

Why can't muggles be better at some things than wizards are? There are plenty of reasonable areas where muggles would be better than wizards and visa versa.

*** I understand your perspective and appreciate you taking your time to explain.

The purpose of this post was unfortunately lost with the poor framing of it, particularly with the title and certain statements.

I actually didn't know most of the terms used until I posted this, still new to Reddit and whatnot, and haven't really interacted as much with the fanfic community extensively.

This post was directed towards "mugglewanking", stories and their authors. I simply didn't understand their approach and was hoping to get a different perspective.

Most of the stories I read, good stories by the way, had small snippets all across, where Muggle culture was being superimposed on top of wizarding culture throughout the course of the entire story, trying to subtly, and many times not so subtly, emphasise that Muggle culture is superior.

Now again, I'm not talking about the large issues like a political philosophical debate. I'm talking about the smaller issues, the ones more relevant to lifestyle.

Like hitting at dietary habits, physical activity, fashion. The whole approach in many Fics is that, wizards don't know about foods beyond what they've cooked in their country. That foods like Pizza and Pasta are purely Muggle, rather than regional and therefore highly likely that wizards have never heard about it.

With physical activity - these stories try to make it seems like muggles are superfit and wizards are just fat and lazy People who sit around all day, incapable of physical activity.

Fashion - it's almost always emphasised that Muggle fashion is superior.

At a certain point, it goes away from wizards and muggles are different, muggles are pretty good in their own right, we should appreciate their abilities, to wizards are ignorant and incapable, muggles are superior in nearly every way. - Basically Muggle wanking, a term I did not know about.

In hindsight, I could've made this post "Why do we bash Wizards and Magic so often", but can't do much about it now.

I get that wizards are isolationists and unaware of muggles, but a bit more credit to perhaps balance the story would be better, because many Fics I've read thus far, choose to adopt a secondary theme of Muggle wanking which unfortunately discredits the story for me on a personal level, which is why I asked the question in the first place.

**** I can understand. You were probably frustrated with finding mostly highly pro muggle fics for too long and it came out in your writing. I don't know if you are a writer yourself or just a reader writing critique for the community. I am not going to try to stop a wizardwank author anymore than I want to stop any other thats not hurting people with their writing. The best thing to do is just move on. If an author is asking for constructive criticism then there is room to mention how a balanced approach would improve the fic. But if they aren't, just close the fic and move on. Vent threads are validating and can feel good and you are certainly not alone in despising "mugglewank" fics, but they generally have only one of two outcomes. Nothing changes at all, or authors are driven away by the anger they see directed at them.

One of my favorite authors has taken a break from HP fanfiction for years now, with multiple unfinished stories and I would be doubtful that it has nothing to do with how a single one of his fics was written to counter the then dominant wizardwank status of the fandom became the rallying point for anti mugglewank mindset after it became popular.

While my points about the negative connotations of fics written in a way that magical people are superior to muggles stand. So do points about how fics are escapism and don't always need to push a moral or satisfy everyone. Mugglewank to the mugglelovers and wizardwank to the wizardescapists. Balanced fics for the rest.

All that being said, the final answer to your question "Why do we bash Wizards and Magic so often is simply that some people like it, even if others don't.

*** First bit - completely fanon. It's also only common in fics that go completely Pureblood/Lords and Ladies/ Manors/ Grimoires/ No dark no light, only Gray kitsch.

The only squibs we come across are Filch and Figg. Both are alive. The first is a prick so he is hated, the second wasn't. She was just an old lady minding her business. So it's not entirely accurate to say that Squibs are killed off.

The second and third bits of your comment just describe America over the last four years to me. Also a few other countries but America comes to the forefront.

So how is the Wizarding World so bad, and how does incorporating an already flawed system remedy the existing flaws?

****** If we want to play canon bingo: the Ministry does refuse to include them in birth records, which since you wouldn't be sure for over a decade, means they're explicitly removing them upon discovery.

What is that if not tacit approval for them to disappear? Whether that means the family quietly sets them up with a normal job, or obliviates them and abandons them somewhere, or uses them for curse practice and vanishes the remains. Either way, not the government's problem since they clearly don't exist.

And as to Marius Black, the fact that he's Dorea's brother probably influenced what happened to him, since she presumably would've been the sort to still care about him if she later ended up married to a Potter (or was already at that point, we don't really know their relative ages).

  The common practice with Squibs is to send them off to Muggle schools as children and encourage them to integrate with the Muggle community, which is much kinder than letting them live in the magical world where they will always be treated as second-class citizens.

As far as I can tell, there's no actual evidence that Marius wasn't killed or even that he was a squib. And the only record of his mere existence is very dubiously canon at best. So I don't think you can really use him as evidence of anything.

******** I was always under the impression that Merope was more like Neville: not particularly strong magically (or at least not obviously and visibly so). And then all of the abuse just repressed he magic even more.

I know her father called her a squib, but I think of that as just insulting her for being magically weak, not a literal truth. It's just like when Malfoy calls Neville a squib (which didn't ever happen in canon, as far as I can tell, but it happens all the time in fics and is completely in character for Malfoy).

But I think the only actual proof that she might not be a squib is that she was a parselmouth, which is definitely a magical ability. But I don't think canon ever gives us much information about just how magical someone has to be to inherit a magical ability like that. Squibs can see dementors, so maybe they can also be parselmouths.

And even if Merope was a squib, her family might have decided to keep her around just to do the cooking, cleaning, etc.

So basically, I think Merope isn't definite proof, but she is a decent example.

******* I think what people forget about the first few Potter books is how influenced by Dahl they were. The adult characters weren't meant to be believable and realistic, they were grotesque caricatures in both appearance and behaviour. In Dahl's books, most grown-ups were either cartoonishly horrible (Miss Trunchbull in Matilda, Grandma in George's Marvelous Medicine - just like the Dursleys and Snape in HP) or well meaning but not always the best person to advise/help a kid (Grandma in the Witches, Willy Wonka - just like Dumbledore and Hagrid). These style of books cast the kids as the Only Sane Man and the Dumbledore/Wonka character as the Only Good Grown Up.

The point of this is that, for literature aimed at 9-12 age bracket which Dahl and the first three Potter books fall into, having the adults as distant caricatures gives a reason for the children to have agency. No adult would act like that irl and no kid would have that much agency irl. But a book where you can go to your nice helpful clever uncle and he solves your problem is boring. It's also how kids see adults to an extent - when you're 9, a fat man with a booming voice and a moustache can be scary, even if he's the nicest man in the world when you get to know him, and the grandfatherly headmaster who gives out sweeties seems like Santa incarnate, even if he is actually flawed. But exaggerated behaviour from adults - making the adult a figure of fun and giving permission for kids to laugh at grown ups or even giving permission for kids to actively hate a grown up - is exactly why these books are so popular with kids. They're kid centric, with the kids as the character you want to be living in a world where, actually, everything is quite simple. Grown ups bad, kids good. So Neville's uncle hanging him out of a window isn't presented as that bad, because in this style of literature it isn't. He's stupid, irresponsible and does dangerous things. /Of course he is and does. HE'S A GROWN UP./

The problem Rowling has is that her books and her audience outgrew the age bracket where you have simple worlds with bad adults who can be outsmarted by wily kids much to the delight of the One Good Grown Up. By the time she gets to GoF and her protagonists are 14 and 15, as are her most loyal readers, simplistic "angry man dressed in black bad, nice wizard with stars on his robes good, kid saves day, everyone has some cake" doesn't cut it as a plot anymore, because teenagers and young adults understand and expect more nuance. So she now has a situation where she's created these caricatures - Vernon, Snape, Dumbledore, Hagrid - and she now has to make them work in a more realistic world where people are complex, where bad people do good things (Snape) and where good people are absolute idiots 70% of the time (sorry Hagrid but it's true).

Because Matilda is forever ten years old, Miss Trunchbull can remain a caricature that the readership doesn't question. It makes sense to kids - this is a Bad Adult and by the end of the book she is defeated by the Good Kid. Harry, however, is seventeen by the time we say goodbye, and a lot of his readers were older (I think I was 22 when DH came out), so we, and he, start to question his world much more, especially because Rowling had to change the tone. The older I got, the more horrifying I found the Dursleys. At eleven, I didn't question it. They're mean, but the good people will save him. At seventeen, or twenty two, life is much more complicated.

***** He held him out a window to distress him so that he produced magic. Not a smart thing to do, but he wasn't trying to kill him. From the information around it and the reactions it garnered, it was just a common practice at that point. He accidentally let go because some lady offered him a biscuit at that point. Not saying it was good parenting or even smart, but it's still a far cry from killing them off as you stated.

But then again, this was the 80s and 90s. Not exactly the period of enlightenment we have today. Corporal punishment was still a thing during this period? People don't acknowledge disabilities or mental illnesses now. You expect them to do the same back them? Back then the way to beat Dyslexia in many institutes was to force them to read and read again and again. Schizophrenics were given horrid treatments.

During the 80s and 90s numerous children died from the negligence and treatment of their parents because their parents thought they were doing the best for their children. Many backward practices continue today.

So even if you find it horrible and distasteful, how is it different from the muggle world that makes the muggle world better?

** I am in total agreement. This is one of the reasons, I prefer, not necessarily canon plot compliant, but canon theme and setting compliant fics, as few and far between as they are. Canon feels ‘timeless' and its progress will remain ‘timeless' and anachronistic. To introduce contemporaneous muggle culture feels wrong somehow. Maybe I just enjoy the anachronistic steam-punky, enlightenment hybrid that is the Wizarding world.

When we look at the themes of Harry Potter, what do we find; Death, Love, Fate and Free Will, but I think one that I've hardly ever seen brought up or noticed and i refuse to believe is an original point, is History. History and Folklore is a theme that pervades all of the Books, but it gets forgotten about in Fanfiction. In Book 1, we are introduced to the Philosopher's Stone, an element of historical alchemy, that is proven to be true in the Wizarding World, we are introduced to subjects, that would be expected for a school that teaches what I'd call ‘Folklore Magic', e.g. Astronomy, Herbology, Potions etc. The creatures and characters we meet behave in-keeping with their historic characterisation, see Dragons, Centaurs etc.

This is a world where it is implied that both Merlin and King Arthur were objectively real.

In Book Two, the whole plot revolves around the History of Hogwarts and it's legacy, we get introduced to some of Voldemort's personal history and it gives some context to his behaviour. We meet more folklore creatures, including house elves and are based off of the ‘Brownies'.

Book Three, starts with Harry writing an essay about Witch Burning, and Ron and Hermione talk about historical magic in Egypt and France, and the story culminates in Harry learning more about his own history after a fashion.

Book Four, introduces some wizarding cultural institutions, which in some sense are far older than the Muggle Equivalent, The Quidditch World Cup started in 1473, and the Tri-Wizard Tournament is centuries old itself. We get further knowledge of some of the events of the First War, and Voldemort's return using a ritual that seems ancient or forgotten. The role of old or ancient magic is clear throughout the series.

Book Five, discusses elements of The First war too, introducing the Order of the Phoenix.

In Book Six, the lessons focus entirely on the personal history of Voldemort, and his drive to find historical artefacts to create Horcruxes.

Book Seven, the entirely plot McGuffin, is based on The Tale of the Three Brothers, a wizarding legend, which turns out to be somewhat true, we learn more about Harry's family history and there's even a subplot based on The History of Dumbledore.

The Wizarding World feels Ancient in a way that ‘MaGiC iS bAcKwArDs, MuGgLeS aRe SuPeRiOr' just doesn't work with. One of the other themes is actually Social Justice, and Muggle superiority is the exact antithesis to that. Canon talks about how movements of prejudice are plain wrong. Death Eater apologism in fanfic is guilty of this, so is Muggle wank. Moral relativism exists too, especially as The muggle and magical worlds are so culturally distinct.

**** If you want to get a feeling for how to write ‘like' canon thematically, I'd thoroughly recommend ‘A History of Magic', the guidebook to the 20th Anniversary Exhibition of Harry Potter at the British Library. Of course, its quite ‘Euro/Brito-centric' but it gives an idea of how to write a wider wizarding world too, and it helps to give an appreciation of some of the folklore, some of which is older than the US by a Millennium. I think an appreciation of ‘Cultural age' helps especially for American Authors. In the US, something built in ‘1850' is considered old, but in my native Scotland it wouldn't really. My village, for instance has evidence of being continuously inhabited since the Neolithic Era. Another example, Clachan Chalanais (The Callanish Stones) on Leòdhas were erected in the 3rd Millennium B.C. and Stonehenge was erected in at least the 4th Millennium B.C. Britain is old Europe is old Magic seems to be more in tune with this.

My Weird ‘rant' is finished.

** Magical Britain is backwards BECAUSE it's at a similar or slower stage of societal growth, despite having SO MANY material advantages. It's like someone in the top 1% complaining about how hard their life is because they're living paycheck to paycheck.

The reality is that based on what we know of the magic system, the HP world should be a utopia on par with the Star Trek universe as far as social issues go. However, Rowling preferred to write about existing issues she sees in our world through the lens of this different world. This would have been fine if the magic system were limited enough to justify a world that isn't post-scarcity, but really doesn't fit with the limited and fairly floaty rules we were given.

This leaves fanfiction writers with three choices:

- try and solve the obvious societal problems. The issue is that they are so large that you pretty much have to focus the entire fic on them to do them justice. There are some great fics in this vein though: linkao3(15687453), linkao3(Made of Common Clay), linkffn(The Sum of their Parts)
- Handwave the issues away as "part of the societal culture" so they can focus on something else. This can work if the writing is good enough to obscure the paradox, but doesn't hide the fact that Magical Britain as a society is shit.
- Attempt to solve the issues in the background while focusing on something else as the crux of the story. This is where Muggle Wank happens - the author can't devote an entire chapter or chapters to digging into the issue, so they shorthand it by having a Muggleborn say "This is crazy! _____ issue is fixed in the Muggle world by ____" and all the Purebloods/Halfbloods are suitably impressed/horrified depending on whether they're heroes or villains. I don't love this tack, but I still prefer it over not even acknowledging that issues exist.

Also, post-script: Probably not a good idea to close your argument agreeing with the guy who tried to commit genocide.

Hard disagree re utopia, post-scarcity and the rules. The point of post-scarcity in Star Trek is that humans have created tech that has helped them to evolve beyond that. Anything can be replicated, including food, and the Federation has done away with money. Rowling specifically highlights from the very beginning that the wizarding world is still tied to a monetary economy - potentially even still based on gold, and makes v clear in DH that they don't live in a post-scarcity world, as food cannot be transfigured.

The whole reason Star Trek works the way it does as a universe is down to the replicator tech. No one will ever want for anything. Economics no longer exists. Poverty has been eliminated. That's absolutely not the world Rowling set out to create. As you say, she prefers to look at existing social issues through the lens of the wizarding world, so she had no desire to set out a post-scarcity equal society. She wanted a world with very real issues and very real conflict.

I think sometimes fic writers spend too much time trying to solve these societal issues and complaining that magical Britain isn't perfect. Of course it isn't. No society is, because humans aren't. The Wizarding World is allegorical to the Britain JKR was writing in. At the time she began HP, I think it was 1990. The UK was still (even more so than today) entrenched in class politics. The posh rich people ran the country, the newspapers had far too much power, the monetary system was free to those who could afford it yet very expensive to those who can't. In all honesty, none of this has really changed by 2020 but I digress. Those things are reflected in the world she created - Malfoy Snr goes around greasing the palms of government to get what he wants and his son is an entitled little shit who thinks daddy's money gives him influence over his peers, the Prophet builds people up to knock them down and their journalists can intrude on privacy, Gringotts turns a blind eye to criminal activity as long as it's bringing the gold in.

Why would you want to solve these issues, when they hold up a mirror to the flawed world we live in? Good literature shows us something of ourselves and every flaw the wizarding world has, has a twin in irl Britain. Until we get the society we live in correct, authors and other artists /must/ keep highlighting our wrongs. Art holds society to account, and I for one wouldn't want it any other way. A fic set in a perfect society wouldn't say much, other than "magic makes everything perfect," which very much isn't the message of the wizarding world. Humans are still flawed, whether we can do magic or not.

The mistake a lot of fic writers make - and you touched on it on your middle bullet point - is that they give the impression that they /agree/ with the flawed system. All the pro pureblood stuff makes my eyes roll. JKR didn't invent the Malfoys and the Blacks because she liked them! She invented them to hold up a satirical mirror to the worst excesses of the English class system and to show her revulsion for rich racists that buy their way out of obeying the rules. The characters she wants us to love - Hermione, the Weasleys, Hagrid, Remus, Sirius - have all been let down by or excluded by the system and the society in one way or another, but they're all much more moral, good, kind and fun to be around than the people in power. Writing a fic where the system exists and that's that, but let's undermine it in little ways is great and true to the original spirit. Writing a fic where either all the problems go away or, worse, licking the arse of the pureblood aristocratic society and excusing/handwaving the racism and classism, very much not true to the original spirit.

Obviously people can write whatever the heck they want, but your post did get me thinking.

**** Agreed that Rowling didn't create a post-scarcity system, but her magic system is so loosely defined that it's hard to understand how they HAVEN'T reached that level.

She provided a few rules regarding materials with Gamp's Laws of Transfiguration*, but broke so many other fundamental things (time travel, space expansion, etc) that it's hard to understand how wizarding society isn't post-scarcity by this point.

I just feel like there's a disconnect between the current state of Rowling's canon world and the capabilities she's shown magic to have. I do believe that people are fundamentally good and enjoy helping each other, so it just rings hollow to me that they'd have all this power at their fingertips but no one has figured out to eliminate poverty from their society.

*Now that I look into it more, even these laws are swiss cheese. [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/gamps-law-of-elemental-transfiguration/][Gamp's food exception]] states that food cannot be conjured out of thin air, but can be summoned, duplicated, and transformed. So could you just keep a "mother" of some type of food, duplicate it to any amount, then transform it into any type of food you wanted? That's essentially a replicator. Without some more rules around these types of things, any fanfic with a bit of imagination can entirely break the system. That's part of the fun of fanfics, seeing what authors can come up with when they start testing the rules, but it really speaks to the weakness of Rowling's canon magic system.

Because most people may be fundamentally good, but the systems we put our faith in aren't. We, in the real world, technically /do/ live in a post-scarcity society. If everyone worked together, there would be enough food, water, and shelter for every person on this planet. But we don't, because of petty geopolitical and economic concerns. We can't even help the homeless in our own countries - look at Britain and America. Disgustingly rich to the point where pretty much all of our citizens live in at least the global 10%, yet people still sleep on the streets and beg for food.

The reason wizards haven't eliminated poverty is for the same reason that muggles haven't. It's not because we don't have the ability or resource. We do. But there's always people like Lucius Malfoy for the Wizards or Donald Trump for the muggles who plays the system around to keep themselves at the top - for people like that, it is not good enough that they succeed. Others must fail. For if others succeed, how are the Malfoys and the Trumps special? Once the system starts working for you, I guess it's very easy to cease giving a fuck about those who it fails, and if you can bend the will of reality to your favour there's always going to be a Malfoy out there who will want to bend it not just to his favour, but to others detriment.

I always thought the Weasleys did this. They didn't have money for new stuff, but they did always have more than enough food. The problem is that in a society controlled by limited political interests and in thrall to the One True God - economy - it's not just about food. Think about all the stuff needed for just one kid to go to Hogwarts. Why can't the school buy one of each book and then duplicate them for the kids each year? Because "thats not how it works," ie someone, somewhere, is profiting from this so heaven forbid we challenge the orthodoxy.

But I do think a big part of why the wizarding world isn't perfect is JKR making these points but subtly. The wizarding world is great on some things - there's no racism as we understand it (ie no one gives a fig if you're black) but it's replaced with a different kind of prejudice. Everyone has enough to eat, seemingly, but there's still rampant classism. People are still shit, even when every person has a magic stick that could technically make everything better.

God, when you think about it, it's horrific isn't it?!

*** You are missing the fourth option: Stop judging, and just write a story set in the HP world as it is, using it to ponder issues that always have and always will exist in all societies.

Which is why I take issue with "doesn't fit with the limited and fairly floaty rules we were given". Those have no bearing on what kind of society should derive therefrom. Rather, you are presupposing that with the existence of fairy tale power come fairy tale characters, and all contradictions in humans, all the dark sides and abysses inherent in being alive, they all disappear. But people do not become automatically better just because they have an easier life or more power (especially not then).

Sometimes, I actually think people (in general, not you in particular) are offended at what they see. Offended because there is all that awesome magic, people with all the good things in life and everything they could ever want -- /in theory/ --, but in reality, turns out they aren't better than we are; it offends the fairy tale sensitivities, but perhaps deeper and more important than that, the reaction is the result of an inherent unease because of what this says about us, and a vague suspicion and fear that it's the truth.

But I think rather than ignoring those feelings and (subconsciously) masking them with anger, it's worthwile to stop and ponder them. There's a lesson here. And it's one Muggle-FixIts paper over and bury under tons of sweet sugary icing, as deeply as they can, so it's hidden away as quickly as possible. IMO, that's a fairly arrogant position to come from.

**** This...is a really bleak outlook. As I said in another comment, I do believe that people are fundamentally good and given the choice between helping someone and not, they would choose to help the person provided it doesn't harm their self-interest. Since we don't see any limits (e.g. magical exhaustion) besides knowledge on the execution of magic in canon and we see very few limits on the actual scope of what magic can accomplish, the Venn Diagram overlap of "Things that can be done with magic to help other people" and "Things that make my life worse" should be pretty damn small. In this scenario, I have trouble believing that people wouldn't act in others' interest when it really doesn't cost them anything other than time, which they have in abundance due to not needing to work in the way we do.

***** I suppose you may call it bleak. I never thought of it that way since I never thought it mattered either way. It's neither justifying things, nor denouncing them, and also not an instruction for how to act or even a limit on what is possible -- just a look at what is, without judgement. People are the way they are. Sometimes selfish, sometimes noble, sometimes thoughtless and cruel, sometimes helpful and supportive. And in the end, that's okay. By and large, we manage to make life work, and I wouldn't demand more than that from anyone.

Further, I think we also disagree on the value of time. Time is, in fact, the most precious resource on earth, since you can only spend it, but never amass it. The fact that wizards need not spend as much of it on mundane tasks does not deminish its value, since the total amount still is finite, and the best way of spending it remains doing things you like. With more time, you do more of them. So the only thing that would motivate anyone to spend it helping others is if they were already wanting to do so in the first place, which circles back to the original argument, and it makes your sentence read, for me, "... when it really doesn't cost them anything other than most dear thing they have", which naturally is self-explanatory.

I can agree that there being no cost involved, people are inclined to help. But even so, you bump into limits every day. It costs me nothing to hold a door if I exit for someone who's entering, but how many people don't even do that? What is the cost of a thanks, or a smile? And yet, it's not the default for everyone at all. Whatever their reasons, they just don't, and that's a microscopic description of who we are. Making it even easier, or making more acts as easy, doesn't increase their prevalence, it only brings into sharper relief the lack of it.

.

And honestly, that's exactly what I like, thinking up plots and painting landscapes of magical society. It's at the same time a meta-level, since it's removed from our world, and a distilled essence, making it easy to play with contrasts. Much more interesting than Hermione running for Minister and creating that magic utopia is Hermione running for Minister and failing to create that magic utopia, since there's a lesson in one, but not in the other. The greatest stories are tragedies, and the greatest tragedies are failing due to your own inescapable shadow. This is as true today as it was 2,500 years ago.

I think it's just people wanting an "easy power up" for Wizarding Britain's culture - it's the cultural equivalent of the Diagon Alley shopping trip or helpful goblins trope. The author doesn't want to take the time to think through an actually original way to improve the lifestyles of Magical Britain, so they just fall back on what they know and use author fiat to make it sound better than what Magical Britain has.

Honestly, the CORRECT answer to why Magical Britain is so backwards is probably because around the time they hit post-scarcity, society stopped developing because [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1Kju_-1sYM][there's no drive for it any more.]] An AU fic that focused on that, having Muggleborns come in and realize that wizards are just going through the motions for hundreds of years without looking forward, would be a great, valid criticism of the world. This would take a lot of vision and quality writing to be good though.

The problem is that JKR's magical culture is "Old England with quidditch and a few spells" - and by design. She wanted a familiar setting for her readers. She had her wizards and witches wear robes - not fantastic clothes full of magic. That our world is now global, not limited to a single country, doesn't help. So, the aesthetic of her Wizarding /Britain/ falls woefully short compared to the muggle /world/.

In my story "Patron", I tried to build a magical world that developed independently from the muggle one since 1692, - and there, the clothing is much more magical and varied. "Robes" cover a lot, from the classic robes (but usually layered with spells and effects to make them comfortable and impressive) to illusionary fire covering the wearer (and nothing else). (The Hogwarts school uniforms are leaning towards the former rather than the later, though).

****** Here's the link. It's a world where the Wizarding World has split 300 years ago, and where "true muggleborns" - wizards and witches born to muggles - are a tiny minority. About one is born every two years in Britain, for example. So the cultural impact of muggle Britain on wizarding Britain is very, very limited. Wizarding Britain is sometimes far more progressive than mugle Britain, and in other areas far more archaic - though always more magical than canon. Magic is used all the time.

Two caveats:

There's one thing, culturally, that muggles have which does impress wizards: Movies. Not because they are amazed at moving pictures - they have that in spares - but because a Hollywood blockbuster is something the Magical World doesn't have and can't really have. They have books, they have radio, magical music performances blow muggle music out of the water, but they don't have cinemas nor a movie industry. In theory, they could create a movie, but the odds of there being enough wizards and witches who know how to write, direct, act and cut/add music to create a good movie are slim to none - such people generally are doing something else in the Wizarding World.

The other caveat is that "The Year of Exploration" is like Hollywood Spring Break: A lot of hype, especially if you're a teenager looking forward to it. The reality isn't what a fourteen-year-old has imagined. Especially if they weren't raised in the magical world and, therefore, have only rumours and tall tales to go with.
