I'd prefer the fic to be either in their last few years of Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts. I'm particularly fond of the fic The Sum of Their Parts by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7396284/holdmybeer][holdmybeer]] and I love how Ron and Hermione more or less help Harry on his way to becoming a Dark Lord.

That doesn't mean that they have to be strictly involved, however, I'd just prefer Harry to not be "evil" and that he's still friends with Ron and Hermione, though that's not a requirement. Fics where Harry's in Slytherin and not friends with them are fine, too. I also don't want fics with Hermione as the Dark Lady or whatever. I've been recced fics like that when I wanted Harry being the Lord.

I'd appreciate it if the fics were complete, at least 20k words and actively updating, or at least 50k words if they're abandoned or on hiatus.

I'm cool with the following:

- gen fics
- canon pairings
- Harry/Theo is a favourite of mine, so is Harry/Blaise, though I don't mind Harry being paired with other guys. I just don't want him being paired with Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, or practically any other girls other than Ginny. Definitely not Hermione.
- Harry/Ron/Hermione is something I've come to look for recently
- dark magic (duh)
- the use of runes are cool
- Harry can even be a rather "grey" character than dark, I just don't want Harry to be evil (meaning, to meanless killing or torturing)
- Harry/Voldemort|Tom is fine if Harry's his equal and not a follower who gets tortured or punished

*I am not looking for Wrong Boy Who Lived. Please don't rec me those kinds of fics unless they check off a lot of the things I like.*

Some fics that I love that fall into this category are:

- linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]
- linkao3(Lord of Time) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4877764/chapters/11183125][Lord of Time]]
- I can't find the rest, sorry.

  Harry decides Dark Lordship suits him at age eleven. It's unfortunate that his predecessor just won't retire already.

Harry is sent back to the early seventies, one of it's greatest points is it's combat, it's very creative in its spell work.

might not be quite what you're looking for though, Harry is good but more than willing to kill, as in he killed a squad of death eaters in the very first chapter. oh and it doesn't have Dumbledore bashing, some philosophical debating between the two of them, but nothing i'd call bashing.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
