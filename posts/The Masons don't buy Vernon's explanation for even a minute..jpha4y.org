Harry doesn't act "disturbed". He acts downright terrified of Vernon, and Vernon himself isn't exactly discrete with his hostile behavior towards Harry. Also, hiding away a "disturbed" relative smacks of discrimination against disabled people. Even if it's just a convenient lie, it's not going to go over well with anyone with an ounce of common decency towards disadvantaged people.

Instantly realizing that Vernon is either lying through his teeth or deluded, how do the Masons react? What do they do differently, either while they're still there or after they flee the owl that Mrs. Mason was terrified of? Do they try to help Harry, do they try to call the authorities about suspected abuse? What happens next?

** The cake fell and Mrs. Mason screamed, Vernon turning a rather fascinating color while the blood drained from his wife's face. Dudley simply laughed.

Instantly Vernon turned to the two adult Masons, spewing out lines of how his nephew was disturbed and mentally ill. Mr. Mason look positively livid. Then the owl came and informed Harry of his warning for underaged magic. The boy could see Vernon's hand clenching like he wanted to strangle his nephew, while Petunia looked ready to faint, the Mason's faces had gone a disbelieving blank.

Then the words came: "Was that a Hogwarts owl?"

*** "... It's from the Ministry. It's a warning for using magic out of school, but it wasn't me! It was one of my school rivals' house elves." Harry explained; it seemed a reasonable excuse, and something Malfoy would definitely do, though Harry had no evidence. Meanwhile, the Dursleys were in s state of profound shock. The Masons seemed so normal, so mundane, even. Vernon's mouth was moving silently. Mrs. Mason produced a wand (12 inches exactly, beech and dragon heartstring) and waved it over herself, siphoning the mess off of her evening gown.

"That explains why I saw an elf vanish when I was looking at the begonias. He was probably ordered not to be seen by Muggles while he carried out a mission of mischief." Mr. Mason said, stroking his mustache in thought. "Who wrote that letter, Malfalda? Hand it here, I'll take it with me to work. The Underage Magic Office is just down the hall from my cubicle. Wait... Oh dear!" Mrs. Mason trailed off, looking at her wand in horror. Harry's face paled. "Better come with me, sonny. I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, I have to take care of my silly mistake. What's your name, son?" she asked abruptly. "Oh! My name is Harry, Harry Potter." Harry replied. A familiar flick towards his forehead was the only response, quite discrete by Wizarding standards.

"A pleasure, young man. Let's be off. Quickly now!" Mrs. Mason urged. Harry took her outstretched hand, and with a crack, they were gone. Mr. Mason observed the shocked family in front of him. "Well, that was exciting! What about that mint ice cream, eh?".

** What i appreciated about the books even as a child, is how ruthlessly true that scene was. Often when you are being abused people don't notice or care. They rationalize that they must be taking it out of context , or there's another explanation, or they really don't wanna say something and be wrong. Especially back when the books take place. Growing up you realize nobody is going to come and save you. The only person you can count on is yourself. Not a healthy lesson, but an important part of living through it.

** Somehow I'm picturing Mr. Mason Somehow accidentally knocking down the garden wall between there to properties and investing in " those new "fangled security cameras" like his brother in law has in London. Somehow Mr. Mason records s few instances of violence that Vernon Perpetrated against Harry and used it to blackmail the Dursleys. The Masons threaten to tell everyone and show the video to the neighbors during their next neighborhood block party.

So thd garden wall stays down and harry still unfortunately has to sleep at the Dursleys..which he doesn't from Dudley's old second bedroom that he gets from thd age of seven onwards and the door has a lock on the inside instead of the outside this time round . Harry can lock the Dursleys out But they can't lock him in.

And Mra. Mason insists Harry spend most of his days at the Mason residence, they buy him new school uniforms every year and he takes his meals there.... Mrs. Mason even teaches him how to bake while Mr. Mason is at work .... Harry spends his summers with Mr. Mason in the shed learn to Tinker with auto parts.He helps Mr. Mason restore a 1958 Ford truck into working order that Mr. Mason proceeds to gift to harry when he turns 15 , Harry drives the truck around Hogssmeade from fifth year on with Ron and Hermione next to him in the bench seats.. It makes Deaco Malfoy quite jealous Inexplicably.... The masons take an extended vacation to America when Harry turned 17.... They go and visit some cousins in Boston and taken colonial Williamsburg in the carolinas. They come back to British with A suitcase full of souvenirs for Harry... To find their adoptive son, tired but breathing, War weary, Mr. Mason spends most of that 1st day back with Harry in the shed repairing the engine to the old Ford pickup while he tells Harry about his service during the last great war in Europe. And Harry tells Mr. Mason everything. The two men go in to dinner when they are called and Harry repeats everything to Mr. Mason who hugs him tightly when He gets to the part about Hedwig dying. She may have been terrified of the owl but she knew how much that bird loved harry and how harry adored his pet in return.Hedwigs loss Felt like a death in the family to both the masons and to Harry.

They spent the rest of that Evening looking over pictures from Harry's childhood with Hedwig prominently featured in a few of them. And for the 1st time in his life instead of wandering back to the dursleys Harry sleeps in the bedroom The masons had given him when he was a 7 year old boy still ignorant about The existence of magic

Harry slept easy that night, safe in the home of his adoptive parents

*** I dont think they would see it as discrimination to begin with.

It wasn't seen as a bad thing to isolate disturbed people if the presence of other people make their behavior worse. You'd even apologize in that situation if you're led to think by the Dursleys that the boy acted out because of your presence.

The Dursleys would even be praise for trying to balance their life while caring for the poor boy. Other familles wouldn't have the kindness and trust to leave the boy alone and would have imposed the distressing strangers on the boy just to keep an eye on him.

The Dursleys gave him some indépendance. And it only ended with a messy prank with nobody hurt. They must do something right. Other kids like Harry could have done much worse when unsupervized.

It wasn't perfect back then, but one thing is clear; people with a disability back then were far more accepted for the most part (at least in the 80s) then they are nowadays. I have a sister with non-verbal autism, and the amount of discrimination she has gotten is ridiculous.

****** I found something on Wattpad, [[https://www.wattpad.com/278639165-being-a-black-chapter-1]]

Maybe that's it? Although they visit a lot earlier than Harry's second Hogwarts year.

********* There really are a huge number of actually *stolen* stories floating around on ffn alone. The posting dates are the giveaway as to who's the original author and who's the thief!

FFN is terrible about protecting its writers from thieves and plagiarists. I actually know one writer who had to switch over to AO3 because ffn suspended both HIS and the thief's! Good luck trying to communicate with the folks who run ffn either: There are no replies to email or Twitter and no appealing their decisions!

** The Masons are actually from some sci fi conspiracy happening simultaneously and just scoop up little Harry who's clearly a psionic. And Hedwig is clearly a shapeshifting alien so she gets to come too. Shenanigans ensue.
