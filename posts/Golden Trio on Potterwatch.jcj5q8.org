I had this idea a while ago. While Harry, Ron, and Hermione are at Shell Cottage planning their Gringot's break in, Fred, George, and Lee visit. They visit to air Potterwatch and have the golden trio on it. They explain 'Harry is not dead' and inform the listeners that they are not just sitting on their hands.

I think it's a cool idea


** Why did the Abbey Road turned up in my memory? ;)
