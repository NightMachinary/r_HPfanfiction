Basically looking for som recommendations. I am a huge fan of Bellamione (Bellatrix and Hermione) and really love this pairing. Looking for some well written fanfics, with smut


** linkffn(7755315; 8507295; 6493745; 7410369)

The first is "Those Gilded Chains We Wear". Its my favourite Bellamione.

The others are very well done to okay-ish. A matter of taste, as I've been made to understand by now.

Adding to that: Masquerade is just weird.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione has become bored with her life and needs a challenge. Bellatrix Just wants to be free again. Are either willing to pay the price for what they want, are they willing to do what needs to be done? Warning: Ron is not very nice in this one. Everyone you know and love will probably be ooc most of the time.

  Crack/Parody Fic! Hermione saves Bella. Everyone is gay. Chaos ensues! OOC, some mature language and content. For laughs only. Don't read if you can't take a joke.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

#+begin_quote
  In another world, Hermione Granger never attended Hogwarts. Orphaned at age three, she grew up supporting her low-income adoptive family who hadn't the means to pay for her education. Desperation and a chance encounter lead her into the employ of the three Black sisters. She finds herself caught in their deadly web, helplessly waiting to see who will reach her first. H/B, H/N, H/A.
