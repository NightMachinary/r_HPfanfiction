This fic was really good and I cannot find it anywhere now. I remember that in the fic, they meet at a club Sirius's band is playing & hook up there, and after that start a relationship. Remus is a professional athlete but I can't remember in which sport, and he's a trans male. I think this was a multi-chapter/ multi-part fic but maybe it was a very long single-chapter. Does anyone else remember this fic? If anyone can post a link I'd be so grateful!


** I think I remember this? Was Remus a swimmer?

*** Maybe...I don't have a specific memory of which sport Remus did. I just remember that he was famous for it, and I think closeted in the beginning, while Sirius was pretty out.
