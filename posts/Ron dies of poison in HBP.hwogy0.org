Not like those Dark!Harry ruddy things where Harry and Hermione laugh of how much better they are know without him and start snogging each other. No, I'm going for canon, Hermione is still in love but not talking to Ron. What happens with her? Or Harry? Or Draco, who is the culprit? Or Dumbledore who could have prevented it had he stopped Draco? Or Romilda Vane for that matter?

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

******** DH was meant to be this novel about an epic journey that concludes with an epic battle (Tolkien style) but the only cool scenes are the escape from the Ministry and riding a dragon, other than that they mostly sit around, bicker and have a few run-ins with Death Eaters. Not even the Battle of Hogwarts is that cool as we don't get to witness much of it, except for the final battle where we know that the fight is already won.

**** You're not misremembering. They, Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley children, sit around the infirmary trying to think of who would have wanted to poison Slughorn. Harry only starts thinking about Malfoy after Hagrid mentions the argument between Snape and Dumbledore, still not in connection to Ron, though.

** Or Slughorn who gave Ron the drink, would he have problems with the DMLE over this? Or even just feel personally responsible? Would his behavior change after it in any way? Maybe giving more focus to poison identification and cure, or urge the students to learn how to resist the imperius. And at a personal level? He could potentially help the duo a lot if he felt indebted enough.

  The loss of someone closest to Harry shows why the Hogwarts motto is apropos. He now has two missions in life, missions which would make any dragon proud; fierce care of what means the most to him and revenge against those who would do him or his harm. See how he handles the burdens of the end of 6th Year and The Hunt with these new mantras. HP/HG, NL/LL
