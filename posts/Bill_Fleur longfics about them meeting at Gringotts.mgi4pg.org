I was just wondering if you guys knew of any completed Bill/Fleur longfics, specifically ones that focus on their meeting at Gringotts and development of a relationship.

Thank you in advance. :)

**** ThurdEye1234 on AO3 has a fic, Knights in Shining Armour (Ever After Lovers), that you have to be logged in to see. It's about Fleur and why shechooses Bill. May not be exactly what you're looking for but it's the closest I can offer.
