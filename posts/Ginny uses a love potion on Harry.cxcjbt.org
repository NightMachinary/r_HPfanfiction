In this story Harry is in love with Hermione. Ginny uses a love potion (I believe created by Snape) that is brewed by Draco. The thing that is special about this potion is that it uses magnetism or something like that in its creation but it is only effective while harry is at Hogwarts.

​

Harry is caught by Hermione in the Quidditch locker room getting a BJ from Ginny (and thats how they break up).

​

When Harry has sex with Hermione it creates these lights and I remember the phrase Harmonic Convergence .

​

I know its not much but this one has been on and off of my mind for a few years now and would like to give it another read.

​

Thanks!
