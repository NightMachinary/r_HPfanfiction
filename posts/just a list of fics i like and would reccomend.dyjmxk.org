*** not really. its just that some of these i have never seen recommended before

some of them are ones where harry is either smarter or more powerful not it the he is the heir to all but in that he is magically gifted

others are just good adventure/romance fics that i like to read and in most of them the relationship builds up rather than they meet one chapter and are declaring their love the next

lastly there is fluff 'nuff said
