Permanently branding a classmate's face? Unleashing a flock of summoned birds on one of her best friends? +Being an all-around annoying character?+

She gets off way too lightly, I think.


** you know what, I am with you on this one. sometimes hermione seems like a bit of an unrealistic standard and it bothers me more the older I get.

like it reminds me of this cover of girls' life that a graphic artist redesigned: [[https://www.katherineyoungcreative.com/blog/2016/9/7/girls-life-we-need-to-do-better]]

^nobody is that perfect and there's nothing wrong with caring about hair and fashion. the slytherins are supposed to be the ambitious ones but JKR rarely shows them getting stellar grades and winning things. except for the house cup of '91-'92, still salty lol

but when hermione does do something petty it's always justified what's up with that

thank you for coming to my ted talk

She's a little psycho, isn't she? She's lucky she's in the right side of history.

** It's not really fair for Hermione to face consequences of her actions, if Draco, Snape, Fudge, and all those Death Eater scums and Ministry minions don't face theirs as well!

**** Good, don't forget to include Rita Skeeter who had likely committed hundreds of slanders and character assassinations.

Goyle who had willingly tortured perhaps dozens of fellow students with Cruciatus.

Narcissa who had been a willing accomplice and supporter of sadistic genocidal terrorists and transistors.

Pansy Parkinson who could have willingly tortured her fellow students and was definitely complicit in treason and murders.

If Hermione has to face consequences for her actions, every Snatcher, every Ministry bureaucrat, and every Voldemort sympathizer must also face the full extent of justice and punishment.

Double standard sucks.

***** Double standards suck, sure.

But then again, there are already so many fics where junior Death Eaters get put down, and as much as I like Hermione as a character, she's not someone I'd like as a friend, not as an enemy.

***** Please leave the OP alone. They didn't ask for a lesson on who deserves more punishment than Hermione. They asked for a fic that fits their personal preference which includes a version where this particular character is not treated so lightly. They were very specific with their request and it might be surprising to you but there's a lot of people in this fandom that don't care for Hermione. Why is it so important to change their mind? I like Ginny and Fleur much more than her, does that upset you?

****** That and I think the OP even indicated he was fine with the rest of them getting consequences. Inquisitor seems to be unwilling to accept that someone can wish ill for one character who deserves it and not be willing to apply it to other characters as well. It's rather illogical of inquisitor, in my opinion.
