I think it would be a much cooler way to explain why big families followed him. There's a catch, though.

Because of his upbringings, he has a twisted interpretation of this prophecy. While the fine details on how the balance should be restored are unknown, Tom decided purifying the world of muggles is the way to go.

In a last ditch attempt to stop him, a group of wizards create a ritual to manipulate fate itself. Thus creating the prophesy about the boy who stands as Voldemort's equal. Tom falls for the false prophesy and attacks the child and creates the boy who lived (Neville).

Of course, fate is not happy about this. So he goes ahead and creates yet another vessel who will restore glory to wizards (Harry). Aware how annoying Riddle became because he thought of himself as a chosen one, fate doesn't declare a prophesy. What's more the circumstances of Harry's birth is mystery. Lilly is dead, James is alive and married to someone else; yet Harry is still their child unknowingly.

So while Neville receives the spotlight, Harry will invariably walk towards his destiny nonetheless.

I know this sounds really vague, but I woke up at 3am with this swirling in my head.


** I'd definitely read that fic! Are you thinking of writing more?
