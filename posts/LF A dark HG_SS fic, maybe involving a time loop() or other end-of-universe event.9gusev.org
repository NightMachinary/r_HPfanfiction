I vaguely remember a comparatively well written fanfic focussing on HG and SS interacting during either a time loop or some other event that essentially makes them the only characters of the story. I believe it had a quite dark ending, potentially with parts of the universe dissolving/body parts disappearing. I believe it also involved warmer and warmer rain. O_o

Writing this out makes it sound really strange in my mind, so I may have jumbled some stories together?

Thanks for helping if you can, and if not---for reading about this weird, weird setup!

*** Thanks so much; you're spot on! Much less weird than my memory suggested, and a sweet alt ending, too! :-)
