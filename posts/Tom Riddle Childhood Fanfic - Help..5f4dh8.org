Hi,

I am looking for a fanfic about Tom Riddles childhood and what he went through in the orphanage to eventually make him such an angry and twisted teen/adult.

I want the dark story of his struggle through those young years and eventually the years once he got into Hogwarts.

I am NOT looking for a love story or time turner fic.

Thanks :)


** I really like this series and I know that others do too. Four years have already been written, the fifth is coming.

Then there is The Broken Victory by Kate Lynn which was written before all the books came out, so not everything canon compliant, but I still really like it.
