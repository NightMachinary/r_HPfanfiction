I'm looking for something in the vein of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] by White Squirrel, where one of the characters explores a branch of magic beyond what's shown in canon, hopefully with some science behind it! Btw I already read Methods of Rationality, thanks.


** I'm eventually going to have characters learn and explain enchanting in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824728/1/Harry-Potter-Jedi][Harry Potter Jedi]], but I didn't want them to learn everything in the first year. Too much low hanging fruit for them to explore before they create their own.

*** I thought I'd read all the good no-slash fanfics before I found yours. I'm taking my time with it and really enjoying it. Good job man.

**** Thanks, that means a lot. Still needs a bit of editing of the older chapters to clean out some of the fluff, but I'm still working on new chapters.

*** Hey just started reading it and I have to say it's really good and well written! I like that Harry isn't suddenly OP just by reading a few books. Btw why doesn't he get a letter from the Ministry when using magic at Privet Drive?

**** Well I considered that, but since students only receive a letter warning them not to practice magic at the end of the school year and Hermione mentions that she already tried a few spells before getting on the train, I'm guessing the ministry overlooks the small bit of magic they might be able to accomplish before school like they do for all the "uncontrolled" wandless magic.

Thanks for reading, it's nice hearing people's thoughts.

*** RuneMaster doesn't actually explore rune magic. It just has him study runes for 5 minutes and gives him godly powers.

***** Oh, yes.

For instance, the moment Harry gets his hands on a book on elementary principles of Alchemy, he reinvents the entire field of study and recreates the fabled Philosopher's stone over the summer of his 4th year, while doing gardening for the Dursleys and going clothes shopping with Hermione for every situation imaginable.

** This story is weird for me, I like it, but I have the same issue that Super Harry stories give me. One character shines too bright.
