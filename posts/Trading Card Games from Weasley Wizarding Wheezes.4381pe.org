I had this idea that WWW (or whoever) could make trading card games for various subjects that might actually provide some preparation for Hogwarts to incoming students. You could make battle games based on magical creatures or goblin heroes, or build games to make "potions".

For example, the potions game would have scores/hundreds of ingredient cards, a few different "cauldron temperature" cards (all potions will need an initial temperature and some might need temperature changes during the brewing), "stir" cards (direction and count), and some "spell" cards ("stasis" to block your opponent from continuing with their potion until they use a "finite" card, "vanish" to start over, etc.). You might be able to compromise on some steps (a "stir 6" card instead of a "stir 7" card) but you'll lose points on the final product or too many compromises causes the brewing to fail. When you've built a correct stack of brewing steps an image of the correct potion and its name appears above your stack and you win points based on how difficult the potion was and how well you did.

A battle game based on goblin heroes could be good for interspecies relationships. Kids who play the game would probably get invested in their favorite cards/heroes and the cards could provide additional "real-life" information about them.

If anyone ever adds this into a fanfic I'd love to hear about it (or has anyone already?).


** Haven't seen that spin... But a fic I read (can't remember the name of it for the life of me) has a game called "Muggles and Minions" where the wizards play a D&D type game where their characters are muggles and they fight muggle-style (IIRC one character was adept at karate and another character was a pilot). It introduced the wizards to the muggle world.

** Interesting ideas you have here. I'm actually working on a magical card game myself for a story, though yours are admittedly way better.

** Honestly I would love to actually create this game!

I think I am going to use it for my [[http://witchweekly.net/][blog]] that I run though :P want to be the creator of it instead of WWW? Or maybe they're your financiers

** I should have known. It turns out that there actually are a number of potion-building games IRL:
