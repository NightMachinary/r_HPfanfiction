** Ron looked on in awe at the complete cluster fuck that was arrayed before him.

Harry had gotten into some bad fire whiskey or something and gone completely off the fucking rails.

He had what he was calling his 'Defense Association' was out robbing anyone with even the slightest hint of money. Hell they had stormed Gringotts even to liberate the gold for the people.

While that hadn't worked especially well the Fiendfyre cast down their warren tunnels had.

Harry kept screaming something about something called bourgeoisie excesses leading to the elite culling the people.

Their motto was 'offense is the best defense of the commoners'.

It seems he had been sharing his bottle of insanity with Hermione as well. She had formed the Muggleborn International Liberation Front or M.I.L.F. and were fighting for M.I.L.F. rights. Weirdly enough both Narcissa Malfoy and his mother Molly were leading members.

Which meant that the Inquistoral Squad was constantly on alert as Umbridge had passed recently while trying to spy on Ron's group. He had gotten a decent following together from students in the castle as well.

It seems most students were not aware there was a giant fucking nest of man eating spiders right beside the castle. So Ron's STD, Spider Team Destruction, was out deep in some bush when the floppy pink thing burst into the area. She had tried to spew her stuff everywhere but a big hairy spider had snatched her up wrapping the pink eyesore up in white sticky grossness.

Voldemort had been forced to come out of hiding earlier then had had planned after Harry had burned half of county York to the ground after he couldn't find Riddle Manor anymore near Little Hangleton.

In fact Harry had burnt an estimated 30% or more of magical Britain estates to the ground so far.

With Riddle out in the open and Madam Bones the new minister they had gone to a war time footing. The newly formed branch of the Aurors was christened the Auror Safety Squads. The A.S.S.'s were often out and about sniffing out issues.

Which was made even more importnat when word had gotten out that Grindlewald had been freed by some group called the S.O.K.K. who had left a bizarre message stating they had done so as there simply were not enough messes to go around currently.

Nearly 60 years of isolation had done Grindlewald no favors and the man was on a warpath. His army consisted of no witches or wizards however. No, it was chock full of werewolves. The Ferocious Army of Grindlewald (Second) otherwise known as the F.A.G.S. were blowing through Europe and headed towards the stronghold of might and power that was Albus Dumbledore. Albus was ready with castle made of thick rock that stood upright and strong, pulsing with power.

Albus Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix, commonly called Adop's was filled with many youth recently. Adop's Youth could be seen proudly throwing their right arm jnto the air out to the side so all might see they were bare of the dark mark.

So concerned about being confused with evil doers they had forgone wearing black robes entirely and wore white jackets with trousers. The embroidery of silver flames on the shoulders and phoenix red arm bands really helped reassure the citizens.

The death eaters having to out themselves early, and nearly all being homeless as well as broke, had rebranded themselves to hopefully draw in new money.

The new Culturally Unified Court of Knights society C.U.C.K.'s was drawing in many supporters amazingly enough. They however having to deal with the British Unified Landowners League. The B.U.L.L.'s were blocking them hard and often from being able to penetrate the market.

Overall it was a complete clusterfuck and Ron was glad he was off doing the sensible thing, like exterminating every spider in all of Britain.

**** The last thing Zachary remembered was shoving a needle in his toes while chilling on the couch. Next thing he is here in a large white room that he is sure means he is dead. While Zachary had done a rather obscene number of drugs over his lifetime none of them had made him hallucinate this vividly.

It was the large flaming ball made of spinning wheels all covered with eyes that was the dead giveaway.

“Oh what the fuck!!!”

The large thing seemed to be equally as surprised as Zachary was.

“Of all the souls yours was the one that won the lottery for reincarnation? The creator has an incredibly unique sense of humor that is for sure.”

Zachary's mind was clear for the first time in decades of the fog of constant drug abuse and withdraw. He was not a fan of this state of mind.

“Reincarnating, that's the monk bullshit where I become a bug or some shit right? Fuck that man, I don't want to be a bug! I just want a ton of bitches and drugs man, like super drugs, some seriously magic drugs you know? Don't want to be no bug man, that would be shit bruh.”

As the angelic being contemplated turning Zachary into a dog it knew that was not an acceptable solution. Weighing Zachary's soul showed the man was clearly due to a complete soul wipe and reinsertion for another chance. However, he had lucked out on a literal cosmic scale instead.

“Do you have any world of magic in particular that you would want for your ‘magic drugs'?”

The angel already knew Zachary had not read anything voluntarily since a Hustler in 10th grade. Still he had to offer choice, that was the humans gift and curse.

“Uhhhh... Like I don't know? What is that movie with the kid who like kills a snake and shit? It had that dragon in the streets burning shit everywhere. Fucking badass man, I bet they have killer drugs.”

As the angel tried to parse how one could take three separate scenes from the Harry Potter franchise and determine that meant they had ‘killer drugs' it did as requested.

“A divergent world of Harry Potter has been selected.” Before it could continue Zachary started laughing at the old joke.

“That's right hahaha, Hairy Pothead! Fucking world class right there.”

If an angel could sigh it would have, however they could not so it did not despite its ever-growing desire to be able to.

“Truly a remarkable wit you have. Now for the background information. Would you prefer to be a muggleborn, half-blood, or pureblood?”

Zachary had no fucking clue what any of that meant except for one thing.

“I don't do that cut shit man, that will fuck you up something fierce. Pure is the way to be, except for crack, fucking love me some crack right now.”

“Pureblood, do you want to have a large loving family perhaps?”

“Fuck no! Don't need more people trying to judge me! Fuck you Ashley, nothing wrong with some cocaine for breakfast! Judgy bitch.”

“Single child pureblood. Do you have any desires for special abilities? Metamorphagus, parasel, natural occulmens, fey-kin, perhaps a prodigy in some branch of magic?”

It already had a fair guess what Zachary would want and was not surprised at all by his answer.

“I want super drug making powers! Oh, and definitely don't want to overdose again.”

“Potion prodigy and a high upper limit on drug tolerance?”

“You know for a freaky fire wheel eye thing you are pretty cool, that sounds great!”

Once again the angel sincerely wished it could sigh at the situation. It could name millions of more deserving souls than this one yet somehow Zachary had gotten this rare chance.

“You will wake up fully with incorporated into the new body under the sorting hat. I wish you luck Human Zachary.”

Zachary woke up and heard a muffled sound like from some headphones.

“Oh dear, looks like it's Hufflepuff or nothing for you. HUFFLEPUFF! That means the table over there with all the kids in yellow.”

Zachary could suddenly see and found himself in a castle surrounded by kids. He made his way over to the table and felt 11 years of memories, the first 5 were really blurry, settle.

He was still dazed as the memories settled and really was starting to hate being so sober right now. He looked up and realized this place had a nurse. Which meant drugs, probably premo magic drugs. Fuck yeah!

He faked sick and was led off to a side room were several other children were as well. A nurse was there checking over everyone and she waved her wand at him before clucking her teeth. Handing him a goblet to drink he downed the stuff. It tasted like old meat smells but it felt amazing.

He was floating in a sea of calm and suddenly didn't mind all the bullshit that was going on with him anymore.

“Fuck yeah, that's good.”

The nurse side eyed him, not that he noticed, and got back to dealing with kids who had more severe cases of bad nerves. Zachary may been deep into zen mode but he still took note of where she was getting to potions from. There was a large clear wooden cabinet that he could see stacks of various bottles in. He memorized the shape of the one she was giving all the kids to calm them down.

***** Zachary was loving this school! He had thought he would have to steal everything but it seemed his allowance was more than enough for him to buy gallons of both calming drought and cheering solution ordering them from the paper. He had taken to carrying several flasks of each at all times and the last few months had been amazing. His new parents were busy this holiday so he was stuck in the castle for the holiday.

Which was excellent as he had gotten hold of bottled moonlight essence recently. It was considered a serious waste to consume it unprocessed. However when he read about it in his potions book, man he loved that subject, he knew he had to get some.

A few drops of it were said to be enough to set the mind free and open to the wonders of magic. It sounded a lot like tripping lsd to Zachary. There was no worry about overdosing though, it just made the effect last longer so Zachary had gotten as much as he felt comfortable spending on a new drug he had never tried before.

Zachary was broke and now owned an entire wine bottle sized container of moonlight essence. Smiling to himself he popped the lid and downed the bottle. It was like drinking the softest drink possible, it literally melted down his throat.

He felt the effects immediately and knew he had made the right call. There were so many new colors and sounds and feelings and smells and senses he didn't even have words for.

He spent the better part of three years just blitzed out of his mind somehow doing passable in his homework and fucking rocking it like a rock star in his practical's. Being able to commune with magic as it happened made practical lessons a breeze. It also meant he had no practical way of processing normal human interaction.

A giant pot of magic drew his attention and focused him rather sharply. It was so fucking amazing to stare at that he side stepped the elegant jinx around it keeping him away from it. He caressed the big ass cup as his magic seeped into the cup. It was glorious!

Hunger drove him away and he soon forgot about it, though it caused some drama when he was a champion or some stuff for the school. Oh, him and that pothead kid as well. For a pothead he was super fucking anxious about shit. So, in the waiting room Zachary shoved a flask of his special brew for the kid to drink.

Shrinking charms, taste changing charms, and a few medical stabilizing charms all made his special brew actually possible to exist in 3-dimensional space, taste like something other than ozone, and it wouldn't kill you for more than a few seconds.

Seriously, the drugs would kill you for a short few seconds but then they would kick in past the initial shock and begin working. They were strong enough to be used in necromantic rituals, so strong that the initial shock was so strong it froze the body for those few seconds of death until you came back around.

About ten times the lethal dosage of caffeine, enough cocaine to kill a small town, distilled amphetamines, cheering solution, concentrated moonlight essence, re'em blood, fugu, and giant squid ink (which oddly enough was an aphrodisiac). That was per dose as well, so the swift and deep drink the pothead kid was one hell of a pull. Zachary nodded in respect to the hardcore motherfucker that could take a swig that deep. Fuck yeah, he would have to party with this kid far more often.

Taking back the flask and seeing it was half empty he felt challenged a bit so he finished it off as well. Storing it once they were both alive again he was impressed with the pothead.

“A met death and he says your still a lucky asshole Zachary. What the fuck is that about man?”

Zachary shrugged his shoulders.

“Died, won some lottery in heaven, reborn, here I am doing fuck tons of drugs, way better than being dead in some boring ass room with a creepy flaming eye that is for sure.”

Harry no longer gave a fuck about the conversation as he began to notice the smoking hot woman in the room.

“Eh cunt, you sum fuk? I got the big dick girl!”

Harry was feeling fucking amazeballs right now, and when grandpa old man headmaster was asking him nicely if he had anything to do with entering, he said the first thing that came to mind.

“Can we have a task on who fucks the best? Imma fucking wreck that broad.”

Albus frowned and began cast a quick set of detection spells he had gotten familiar with over the last few years. Well since Zachary had started creating recreational potions that could fundamentally alter your point of view to be quote unquote ‘less of a dick and more of a badass chill motherfucker'.

Harry was coming up positive for things he knew were lethal, in fact it seemed Harry had in fact fucking died recently! What the fuck! Oh, good note! Horcrux was gone, so that was nice.

“Zachary, did you share some of your personal stash with Harry?”

It took a bit for Zachary to make sense of a few facts. First that someone was in fact actually talking to him, secondly that they wanted to know something from him, and lastly exactly who the fuck Harry was.

“Oh the pothead kid, yeah, he was like a fucking suicidal squirrel or some shit, needed to focus and find some chill. So I hooked him up.”

****** Albus pinched the bridge of his nose and tried to explain the issue to Zachary.

“You understand that normal wizards cannot handle the potions you brew for personal use correct? That is why the head boy has to check your potions will not kill anyone who wants to buy from you.”

“Yeah, I remember, product safety testing, can't have customers if they are all dead.”

Moving from pinching the bridge of his nose to rubbing his temples he kept on.

“Yes that is right Zachary. Do you realize that what Harry drank was dangerous enough that it actually killed him?”

Zachary nodded his head and tried to hurry this boring conversation on. He had an incredibly intense high to enjoy.

“Of course it did, he got better though so I don't see the problem. I made a breakthrough recently. I can make my potions even stronger if I don't care if they kill you or not. I just have to make them so strong that they won't let you stay dead!”

Albus could sadly see how that would work in fact. It was no longer in the realm of potions though and was deep into alchemical theory. That Zachary had stumbled into it so he could achieve a better high from his potions Albus found both amusing and disturbing.

Well nothing he could do about it now, Harry was officially stoned out of his gourd and would likely continue to be so for at least the remainder of the school year and likely a fair bit into next year as well. At least they had the experience of handling this with Zachary.

It would be interesting to see how much this would advance Harry's ability to wield magic this year.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned and Really Trying]] has a hilarious reformed Grindelwald constantly tripping over his Dark instincts, worshipping Dumbledore the Wise, and generally overestimating or just plain misunderstanding absolutely everything (from the Burrow must have an underground facility because of the name to thinking the Weasleys were the whole point of the Order of the Phoenix because there must be some prophecy about a family with 7 children and the other members are just camouflage - useful camouflage, but not half as important).

** It's not really Harry, but Harrymort resulting from the merger between Harry and the scarcrux. There is also the Ginnymort, but she's not her own faction because she and Harrymort are a couple. The DA is now their private army, also renamed as the "Dark Army".

The Order of the Pheonix vs Voldemort vs Watcher's Council (post-canon BTVS) vs Stargate Command vs Charmed's witches.

** Ideally, Dumbledore would defeat all three of them, that too without stretching himself. In canon, Voldemort looked like a petulant child in front of Dumbledore, Grindelwald has been in prison and hasn't practiced magic for about 50 years, and even a growing Harry shouldn't be too difficult for Dumbledore.

In fact, I would say that Dumbledore could probably best one of the adult wizards + Harry at the same time. I think one of the things people overlook is how truly overpowered he was - dude has 45 years of advantage over Voldemort, 50 years of advantage over Grindelwald while he was trapped in Nurmengard, and 99 years of experience over Harry.

By the time of his death, he was probably a titan of unfathomable strength with no disturbance (no physical body or isolation) in accumulating power. And then there's the Elder Wand, and the fact that he was simply looking to capture Grindelwald and still won or that he wasn't even looking to kill Voldemort and still managed to put him on defence (imagine if he truly got serious and intended to hold nothing back!). It might sound like fangirling but I genuinely believe that we never saw what he was truly capable of.

*** That is why for this idea to work and for Dumbledore not to be ridiculously OP, I'd do several things.

1) Have Grindelwald acquire a new, young body. Voldemort did it after being blasted by an AK, so it shouldn't be too difficult for Grindelwald to just transfer his soul into a younger body or whatever. 50 years in prison solved.

2) Make Voldemort regain his sanity via some plot device. It will make him exponentially more dangerous if he is no longer an insane megalomaniac.

3) Give Harry something to compensate for his lack of knowledge compared to the others. Ridiculous power levels would work, but maybe something different idk.

**** For Harry you could go the old and tried route of having him merge with the Horcrux putting him in equal grounds with Voldemort, or even something like in Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon in which he can travel back to a specific moment in time by death or choice, or even give him some Eldrich Horror as a pet, can you imagine him walking Cthulhu around Britain and not being a serious threat?

***** Merging with Voldemort's soul is one way, it could be made that Harry's soul was far more powerful and absorbed all of Voldemort's soul's powers, ensuring that Harry gets extra magical powers, Parseltongue, without inheriting Voldemort's evilness.

The other way, is to simply make Harry powerful from birth. Voldemort has trampled upon the deepest and most sacred laws of the world, to the point where fate itself used a prophecy to try to end him - a concept introduced in Renegade by 1991Kira about how Voldemort's tampering with the laws has caused fate itself to intervene through a prophecy.

Of course it would make more sense if Harry is working his backbone off to turn his prodigious talent into skill through hardwork, so it doesn't feel like Harry has simply been gifted everything (and the story becomes boring and predictable), but I like this idea. It explains why there was a prophecy in the first place and a reason for Harry to be as powerful as Voldemort.

**** Well... personally, I didn't like it at all. The premise is very interesting, and the fic starts off ok, but then it splits into like, and not even exaggerating, 8-9 separate storylines. Which doesn't sound like a lot, but every one of those could have been an entire fic by themselves. There's sooooo many characters that it becomes impossible to remember all of them or anything about them. Language wise, it's very well written, story wise...I can only suggest giving it a try
