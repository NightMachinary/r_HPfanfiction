I've seen this a couple of times, in the form of very short drabbles or maybe at the end of a Harry-centric story (Harry sends his kids off on the Hogwarts Express and is surprised to see a terrified Dudley Dursley waving goodbye to his own set of magically inclined munchkins), and it really intrigues me. Does anyone know of some longer stories in which Dudley (lovingly) raises magical kids and slowly overcomes his fear of the magical world, perhaps with the help of Harry? Or, about those kids attending Hogwarts? The longer the better, though I've been so unsuccessful finding anything so far, even one shots would be very welcome!


** A short but good oneshot is linkffn(11185533). It's not the main topic, though.

** This is as close as I could come: linkffn (A Different Halloween by robst). It's not about Dudley's kids, but an AU where Harry wasn't raised by Vernon & Petunia. Instead, Dudley is raised by James & Lily.

Trigger warning: robst. I get that he's enormously unpopular on this sub and I'm not endorsing this fic. However, it does come close to meeting the OP's request for a story featuring Dudley Dursley in the magical world.

*** Why exactly is robst so hated? I've never come across one of his stories before, and I'm three chapters into the one you listed above, it's not bad. Not exceptional at this point, a little implausible, but seems to have the makings of a decent story once it moves past the world establishing and toddler playtime (though that's just a personal preference, I prefer reading about characters that can form full sentences). Grammar is good, characters are pretty interesting, I like the dark, manipulative Dumbledore, and you can't really complain that characters are wildly OOC, because most of the main characters at this point are either toddlers, or people without much canonically established character. Seems like it's got all the makings of a sweet little friendship fic with perhaps a bit of Harmony romance thrown in for good measure. What's to hate?

  Why exactly is robst so hated?
#+end_quote

He turns a lot of his stories into wish fulfillment for the portion of H/Hr shippers who are still extremely angry at JKR for HBP/DH and the Interview of Doom 1.0. As an example, in linkffn(In This World And the Next by Robst), the author has Harry turn Ron into a girl through surgical castration largely in response to the latter's sexual assault of Hermione in a previous 'lifetime.'

Personally, I avoid robst's fics because of his portrayal of goblins. They always show up to provide a lot of conflict destroying plot devices and inexplicably treat Harry with the utmost respect (like Native Americans in bobmin stories). It gets tiring, but IIRC they don't play much of a role in A Different Halloween.

** Well, that's certainly something to try. I don't think I've ever seen an actual hogwarts fic about dudley's kids. I've got [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5980337/1/New-Leaf-to-Turn][this one]] that's not very long, but is essentially what you're looking for. I've also got [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7211094/1/Strong-Blood][this one]] which really isn't what you're looking for at all but fleshes out Harry's family tree on both sides and has a subplot of Dudley with a divorced wife who has custody of their magical kid, though the wife who divorced Dudley to keep him from finding out about magic, not knowing that he already knew about magic. You should read it, it's really quite good.
