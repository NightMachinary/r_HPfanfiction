She plays the violin and has a mutually beneficial relationship with Petunia. Petunia gets to meet other, fancier socialites because of her skills and Harry gets more than basic necessities. I think Harry is quite cold in this fic and more pragmatic. And this was on ffn. Please and thank you!

**** She wasn't abused, although Petunia was certainly strict with her. Petunia did allow her to get into Hogwarts. There was a scene where Petunia was taming her curls and using baby powder to get rid of the shine? Sorry, I read it a few years ago so I can't quite remember.

**** “Harrington” is clearly terrible, but what's the matter with “Harriet”? If you're going for “Harry, but a girl”, why not go for the name that is “Harry, but for girls”? Unless you're going to break with the link completely and pick a name that Lily and James would be likely to pick for a girl, like Sophie or a flower name to keep up their tradition or something.

***** Naming conventions. James and Lily gave Harry a simple, common-like name for a boy because he was a boy and because James's father got ridiculed for his unusual name. Because of this, if James and Lily had a daughter instead, they'd give her a simple, common-like name for a girl, which Harriet ... isn't, not really.

Personally I don't have any problems with the name, but in a story that strives for some kind of realism it is not a name a female Harry would have gotten.

****** In the 1980s, Harry was an unusual and old-fashioned name for a boy. It has an air of upper-middle-aspiring-to-upper-class. It was a name that old men had. Harriet was restored into serious popularity in the 1990s, about the same time ‘Harry' was. They are similarly common names, but ‘Harriet' doesn't have the same air of having previously been a popular name, of being old-fashioned and slightly staid, and is less aspirationally upper class.

Something like ‘Sophie' matches ‘Harry', but given ‘Lily' and ‘Petunia' I could imagine Lily pushing for a flower name. We're a couple of decades early for ‘Poppy' and ‘Rose' and ‘Daisy' (Hermione was on trend), but maybe Lily would push for something unusual. Not ‘Jasmine' though: all the wrong class connotations.

True indeed. But it /sounded/ simple, even if I feel it's only a result of Madame Rowling reaching for a common name in the 90s after it became popular again. Considering the availability of historical data for name popularity at the time, I can't blame her for this either way.

In the end, whatever effort is put into it and whatever name gets chosen for a female Harry, some people will always say that they can't read it because of the name.

******** What's to blame? She deliberately chose a slightly old-fashioned, unusual name for Harry: she's even said this in interviews. Harry's name isn't supposed to be a complete blend-into-the-background name.

There's even irony for the reader when Petunia claims Harry is a “nasty, common name” because a) at the time of the story (1981?) it was an old-fashioned name climbing among the upper classes, but Petunia isn't in the sort of milieu that would be aware of this b) at the time Rowling was writing and the readers were reading, everyone knew that a couple of years later for Petunia the third in line to the throne was named “Harry”, and c) Dudley is a super working class name that the middle classes and aristocracy would not touch with a bargepole.
