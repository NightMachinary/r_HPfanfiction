Writer of several Harry/Nymphadora fics that I would really like to read again. Unfortunate that she took all of her stuff down.

On a binge of this particular pairing, and I would appreciate it.


** I have 21 fics by her. Drop me a PM with your email and prefered format (epub, kindle, pdf) and I'll send you them.

*** Just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]], I know the pairing isn't the main focus, but I really enjoyed how she was written.

Probably go on to read the summer of change and other well known fics.

**** Hard to tell from your reading habits, but if you enjoy the pairing, you ought to enjoy Summer of Change a lot. It is by far my favorite more-or-less-complete Harry/Tonks fic. I wish there were a sequel, but it ends in a satisfying enough place.

Sadly there aren't many good /complete/ fics of this pairing that aren't harem fics. /Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path/ (linkffn(11898648)) is fairly well written, but it goes on longer than I would like, and it is a multi pairing and has all the issues that come with that fact. /Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool/ (linkffn(8175132)) is another great one if you don't mind the gender-swap aspects. /Harry Potter & the Never Ending Summer/ (linkffn(3606379)) was a bit disappointing. Good in many ways, but sort of tapers off and ends, with a planned sequel that never happened. There are a few other lower quality shorter ones I could mention that are complete, but those are the big ones.

As far as abandoned looking fics that might still be worth reading, /From The Ashes Of Magic/ (linkffn(6720336)) is really lovely, but sort of ends before getting to the meat of the standard Voldemort arc. Plenty of character development and romance fluff though. gender-swap warning.

Incomplete but still being updated, /Son of Potter, Daughter of Black/ (linkffn(11653847)) is very good, gender-swap again. /Barefoot/ (linkffn(11364705)) of course is a lot of fun. /What's a Little Death between friends?/ (linkffn(12101842))is infrequently updated and hasn't gotten too far yet, but very well written. Lastly /Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass/ (linkffn(12188150)), from the same author as /Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path/, is quite good but no multi aspect, so yay.

Hope that keeps you flush with recommendations, assuming you haven't already come across all of them.

***** Thank you very much for the recommendations, probably my favourite pairing in the fandom.

It is a shame that there are seemingly so few well written Harry/Nymphadora stories.

Anyway thanks a lot, and have a good day :D
