So, I've seen a lot of posts about how someone thinks someone else is missing something from their interpretation of canon (Canon appearing to be such a blank slate that any interpretation of anything is at least partially valid), or has forgotten something that disproved their fanon point, or whatever else one person can say about another really needing to reread the books with a more analytical eye. :)

It got me curious. What little details in canon do people get wrong, misinterpret, or miss entirely? And what little details, little contradictions, or commonly tilted-in-perspective interpretations do you see that shows people have done so? And can you provide reference to the backing for your opinion? Not academic reference or anything, but a general referral to whatever you're using to justify that view. Any opinion is fine and interesting and what I'm looking for, but it needs to be backed with something. Opinion without support is not terribly useful here, unfortunately. I'm looking for stuff with an argument to support it.

For example: Snape was there the whole time in the Shrieking Shack. Literally, Harry and Hermione see that he's right behind Remus (which also puts doubt on him seeing Remus on the map and then running down, given that Remus' office was on the second floor) on his way into the shack when they time-travel back.

([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303265/7/Wait-What]])

Or that whole argument that Pureblood ignorance is less prevalent that fandom makes it seem - I can't find the thread that put the argument really well, but they pointed to things like Kingsley being able to blend into the PMs office really well, and the necessity of obliviators and the Magical Catastrophes peeps being aware of some Muggle stuff.

Or impermanent Transfiguration.

Canon misses stuff yes, and filling in those gaps is fine, but I'm specifically looking for things from canon that people get wrong or miss out or misinterpret. Fanon gap-fills for canon aren't what I'm looking for. And please, try to add some support for your opinion. Just "Dumbledore was a manipulative bastard" without pointing to his actions that gave you that opinion of him isn't useful here.

Finally, please be polite. I know this is a likely contention-inducing thread, but I'm just asking for opinions in a way framed to get responses from the people I want responses from. If you disagree with any opinions given, fine, just keep it civil and argue back with support and evidence.


** Very tiny nitpicky thing. Without getting into the whole "how abusive were the Dursley's" debate, the only time we see Harry cooking is him minding the bacon that his aunt has already started when she is busy with other things, which doesn't seem like an unreasonable request of a 10 year old even if she's nasty to him the way she says it. All other meals at the Dursleys seem entirely prepared by Petunia, and yet somehow fanon has decided that Harry simply must be an excellent cook because he was forced to do all the cooking by his relatives.

That's because JKR didn't come close to keeping everything consistent. The Dursleys' behavior is so wildly over the place, that in order to "normalize" them, you have to accentuate other facets, trim others, and keep some the same.

You know how they react to Dobby in book 2. Then look back at all that accidental magic he did. They already had him living in a cupboard, what else could they do to him?

Petunia once took a swing at him with a soapy skillet. That's a wild escalatio, and the casualness of it shows that it is something normal.

​

That's how I see a lot of the fics for the Dursleys that aren't wildly abusive or whatnot. The author made them consistent.

That part of the story always deranged me because I feel like I understood this scene widly differently from other people.\\
According to some people, it's almost like Petunia tried to make a touchdown with Harry's head and that he only owes his survival to his ability to dodge. To me, Petunia just tried to hit Harry a little (I think the english term is "wallop"?) with the thing she had in her hand, which happened to be pan. Even if she had managed to reach him, I don't think it would have left anything worse than a bump, let alone brain damages.

​

As for Harry accidental magic when he was young, didn't they just lock him in his cupboard? They (especially Vernon) may sometimes have been a bit rough when they put him there (like clambing on his arm, or pushing him too strongly inside the cupboard), but I don't remember them being any of the Dursley (well the parent's one) truly hitting Harry (in the sense of punshing/ kicking him with the objective to hurt him, badly).

** Ron has loads of funny one-liners and Harry has his moments of both wit and sarcasm in the books. I feel that plenty of fanfiction leaves this out for one or the other.

Sirius was never kicked out of home, he very specifically says he ran away from home. I feel that's a distinction that was important to him, and yet loads of fanfics about him changes this for some reason.

**** And yet I also think the difference between being kicked out of home and running away is important. Because in the second case, being blasted off the Family Tree was only a reaction to what he did, and, despite all their differences, it was Sirius who burned the bridges with his family, not the other way around. Would any of the Black be still alive (and able to communicate), this difference would have greatly changed their interaction with Sirius.

**** Pretty much what PlusMortgage said. I think Sirius would have felt very different about it because it was his choice to run away, his choice to go and live with James and find a new family for himself, and his choice to cut off ties with his old family. If he'd been kicked out he would likely have done the same, but it would have been less of a choice, more of an 'I have to to survive' situation. The Blacks would also have had the choice of whether or not to interact with him in future, running away means he cuts them off.

I think this is important to the way his character is written in canon, although it doesn't always show in fanon interpretation of him, where writers make him less strong and more of a sad, kicked puppy who still secretly loves all of his old family. Having said that, there are plenty of well-written kicked-puppy-Sirius stories too, it just annoys me that it's seen as canon.

** The Maraudeurs were not prankster, and probably never called themselves that.

In a lot of fics, authors make them as a kind of precursor to Fred and George, who loved to prank people. But from what we see in Canon, they were more student who did anything they wanted without caring about the rules rather than people who spent hours preparing a complicated prank. They didn't invent firework or portable swamp, their idea of a joke was more to jinx someone and then say "It's a prank bro" when caught.

Also, the Maraudeur's Map has this name because, in a sense, they were marauding in the castle when using it (while I doubt they ever stole anything, how many time was Snape found thanks to it?), they never gave a name to their group in canon and just called themselves by their nickname.

** Idk about this but I think that thanks to the movies people often forget how young Snape, the Marauders Tonks etc are. Like Snape, Sirius and Remus are in their early thirtees. Harry's parents died when they were 21. They were four years out if school and already full blown order member. Lily got pregnant when she was nineteen so over the course of one year (I think she wouldn't have fought while she was pregnant) after school they had to have already "defied the dark Lord" three times. It's not necessary interpreted the wrong way but often overlooked.

For instance, things like the Hogwarts Houses and the House Cup are (from what I understand) not uncommon for boarding school. Same with prefects and Head Boy/Girl - those are all 'normal' for that sort of fancy private (or public in the british way, I think) boarding school. But in the US, it's basically rolled into the magical aspects of Hogwarts - same with the French translation.

When putting the books into another culture or language, the boundaries between what's mundane and magical will shift - which I think is part of what made the series so popular internationally. If you don't know what a prefect is, you can still look at a magical society and think it's just one of those quaint things they decided to do.

I think I'm not alone in not finding those super British, either - if it was thought to reflect the local schooling system, Ilvermorny would not have different houses or attempts to be like Hogwarts in America.

  What little details in canon do people get wrong, misinterpret, or miss entirely?
#+end_quote

So many people believe the prophecy /needed/ to be fulfilled, and that Dumbledore thought Harry absolutely had to be the one to kill Voldemort. HBP directly contradicts this.

#+begin_quote
  “No, it doesn't!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, *“You are setting too much store by the prophecy!”*

  “But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy means ---”

  “If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! *Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?*
#+end_quote

So not every prophecy has to be fulfilled. And he says that Harry is making the same mistake of so many fanfiction writers: putting too much store by the prophecy.

#+begin_quote
  “But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, “it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or ---”

  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! *But not because of the prophecy!* Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”
#+end_quote

Dumbledore literally saying Harry doesn't need to kill Voldemort because of the prophecy.

#+begin_quote
  “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, *the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything!* But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal... *In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy!* But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you...which makes it certain, really, that ---” “That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said Harry. “Yes.”
#+end_quote

And, again, Dumbledore literally telling Harry that he can ignore the prophecy. Harry is free to turn his back on the prophecy. Won't do him much good because Voldemort still wants him dead, but Voldemort's grudge is the /only/ reason Harry must face Voldemort. Not all prophecies are fulfilled, and Harry's prophecy doesn't need to be one that is fulfilled.

** People don't like the idea of manipulative Dumbledore, but there are sooo many things wrong with how he acts its ridiculous. Here's an example, and its not one I see trotted out too often:

#+begin_quote
  Harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He also realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor.
#+end_quote

aaaaand.....

#+begin_quote
  “He said my blood would make him stronger than if he'd used someone else's,” Harry told Dumbledore. “He said the protection my --- my mother left in me --- he'd have it too. And he was right --- he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.”

  For a fleeting instant, *Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes.* But next second, Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.
#+end_quote

These two passages are from Goblet of Fire when, after a much delayed rescue from Crouch/Moody (seriously? Why did it take so goddamn long to follow an injured child and a dude with a peg leg?), Dumbledore refused to bring Harry to the hospital wing, talked Harry into talking about his very recent traumatic experience (which Sirius also objected to) and then *was happy that the blood protection wasn't working anymore*. Yes, the horcrux. It's foreshadowing, I get it. But this? This is a Dumbledore that's using a fifteen year old kid as a chess piece and was happy that he was just tortured and used in a blood magic ritual. He's not a mustache twirling villain, but yes - he's a manipulative prick.

Howerer, the tag "Manipulative!Dumbledore" in my experience, for overwhelming majority of the fics, came to mean not -more or less- canonishly manipulative Dumbledore but of a warning sign that screams mustache twirling, lemon pops addicted, MY BOIII the cartoon character Dumbledore is inside.

***** I think I would feel triumphant if I had just found out there was a way for a child to survive.

Arguably I suppose the essence would relate to his double agent Snape.

This is really nitpicky, since I understand what you were trying to say, but the court system is 100% part of law enforcement. I'd change it to say "he doesn't have anything to do with the legal investigation"

** - Kingsley being able to blend into the PMs office really well

He's an Auror. He better know how to do that. Or received training on how to do so.

Most of the so called pureblood "ignorance" is willing ignorance. They don't want to know it. You have examples of this spread through the books.

  Canon misses stuff yes, and filling in those gaps is fine
#+end_quote

I said this in a reply to someone else in this thread, but JKR is famously inconsistent. It isn't a case of "filling in the gaps", it's a case of sanding down uneven tiles, replacing some, and then adding the grout to make everything even.

The Dursleys' treatment of Harry is a prime example. You have some examples and hints of them being physically abusive, but people here say "it's not that bad". There are examples of them starving him, but they still say "it's not that bad". There are cases of locking him up in his room and starving him because of accidental magic, you know the drill... "wasn't that bad". Well, he grew up living in a cupboard, how else did they punish him for accidental magic or when he displeased them?

So fanfic authors curb down their behavior in and have them work him like a slave. IMO, that's the same level of treatment as canon. It's just consistent and actually defined.

This is same for Harry's grades. I can see them punishing Harry for getting better grades than Dudley. He's their paragon of "normal". So the abnormal freak can't do better than him at all in any category.

*** For me, I find it irritating when people add on more to what we know. What he went through was bad enough, there doesn't need to be more.

I expect he did badly in school because he was underfed and underdressed for the weather, anyway.

****** Regardless, I agree with the sentiment: it didn't need to be worse. It was bad enough.

I posted this elsewhere in this comment section, but it's just so good that I have to share it anywhere I can. The writer worked so hard on it, and it also makes the Dursley's relationship to Harry a lot clearer.

Other people's opinions are not evidence of inconsistency on Rowling's part. What even is this argument.
