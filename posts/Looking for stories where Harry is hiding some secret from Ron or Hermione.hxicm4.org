  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  Fleur came to Hogwarts to compete in the Triwizard tournament. Her mind was filled with expectations of glory and honour, instead she finds a messy haired student by the name of Harry, who is different to every other student in the derelict school. A Veela's curiosity is a dangerous beast and Fleur's demands that it is sated.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Alternate Universe. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
