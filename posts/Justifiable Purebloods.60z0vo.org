Note; not *justified* purebloods. Some fics just straight up go the 'Lord Voldemort is right, muggles are diluting the magic' route, which is lazy and stupid. Hell, I remember a dark!Hermione fic where she looked over her family tree and came to the (stupid) conclusion that just because magic was a hereditary recessive trait it meant the Deatheaters were spot on and joined up with them at the next available oppurtunity. That's kind of dumb, and honestly proves them wrong.

I'm not looking for that.

I'm looking for something more like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The well groomed mind]] where the issue is never really about 'blood' at all, but rather about culture. Muggleborns are infecting the wizarding world with their traditions and trampling all over the magical place they have been accepted into. While some of the dumber Deatheaters might think the problem is mudbloods 'stealing their magic', all of the more intelligent Purebloods, like the Malfoys or even the Longbottoms, recognize that for the nonsense it is. Blood is essentially a measure of the depth of your family history, and how committed you are to preserving the beauty.

Another great example is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][House Proud]], though it incorporates some mild AU elements. There it is implied that wizards are either a more adaptable subset of the Fae, or a related strain. When machines and development overtook the wilds most of their kind fled Under Hill never to return, and the way Muggleborns are just ignoring so much of the depth of magic causes Draco physical pain to watch. The Deatheaters are furious with the Muggleborns because in a certain sense they /are/ stealing all the magic and wonder out of the world by sitting by and letting it die, and forcing the older families to abandon their traditions and wilder magics.

The point in both of the above fics is /not/ that Voldemort and his minions are *right* but rather that they aren't mindless racists putting others down to push themselves up. They are still wrong, both in how they frame the problem and in how they address it, but their hearts are in the right place, as it were.

Anybody got some good fics that explore this angle a little more, or particularly well? We don't need Harry to join up with Voldie or anything so grotesque; mostly we just want a more mature approach to the issue than "Your are a Nazi!" or "Mudbloods am animals!", that is to say, the version presented in a children's book.


** The canon pretty much declared 'blood means magic strength' to be a nonsense. The best example is probably Voldemort himself. His mother's family was already in terminal mental and magic degeneration, then his squib like mother raped a Muggle, and suddenly the most powerful wizard in generations was born. Nothing could be more ironic.

Dumbledore's mother Kendra was a Muggleborn, and he was darn powerful.

Snape's father was a Muggle, he was both powerful and talented.

Harry's mother was a Muggleborn, he was powerful (Patronus cast at 13 years of age strong enough to repel 100+ dementors), and his mother was powerful.

Hermione was Muggleborn, she was powerful and talented.

Weasleys were looked down upon as "blood traitors", meaning they intermarried with Muggles before. But they were all fertile and powerful. Molly Weasley, supposedly a housewife, killed Voldemort's 2nd in command in single combat.

--------------

Now let's take a look at those who insisted on 'blood purity':

Bulstrodes: magically weak, mentally degenerated, but physically strong

Blacks: magically still strong, but mentally unstable (including Sirius)

Carrows: magically ok, mentally degenerated

Crabbes and Goyles: magically weak, mentally degenerated, but physically strong

Gaunts: magically weak, mentally degenerated

Lestranges: magically still strong, mentally degenerated

Malfoys: magically ok, but limping on single issue for generations

Selwyns: magically weak, physically degenerated (toad like appearance)

--------------

The Books couldn't be more obvious about where 'blood purity' leads to.

No, the Weasleys were purebloods, one of the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sacred_Twenty-Eight][Sacred Twenty-Eight]].

"Blood traitors" are specifically /purebloods/ who sympathize/associate with non-magicals. You can't be a traitor to a group if you're not originally part of it (or at least defined as part of it by others).

**** Ok, this is what JKR said about 'Purebloods': [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood]]

and specifically about the Weasleys:

#+begin_quote
  A minority of these families publicly deplored their inclusion on the list, declaring that their ancestors certainly included Muggles, a fact of which they were not ashamed. Most vocally indignant was the numerous Weasley family, which, in spite of its connections with almost every old wizarding family in Britain, was proud of its ancestral ties to many interesting Muggles. Their protests earned these families the opprobrium of advocates of the pure-blood doctrine, and the epithet 'blood traitor'. Meanwhile, a larger number of families were protesting that they were not on the pure-blood list.

I think somewhere in the Books, a Weasley said they had married Muggles several generations prior.

***** And yet they shunted off their [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Molly_Weasley's_second_cousin][squib relative]] and never mentioned him again. And, they /were/ purebloods, even though it is explicitly stated that accomplishing such a feat is sort of hard to do in the modern age.

/And/, if Arthur Weasley actually liked muggles so much, why can't he even pronounce 'plumber' correctly? The Weasleys are the white-bread, church-on-sunday, give-generously-to-the-campaign, sort of Pro-Muggleborn (Or at least the parents are); they /say/ they are all for magical equality and peace and unity, but they don't really act that way. Hell, Molly even assumes Fleur wouldn't want to marry a werewolf!

While they are clearly trying to do the right thing, they are essentially strongly heteronormative people who have been informed that gay people deserve rights, believe it, but then don't actually have any idea of what they should *do* about the problem unless someone tells them, and will default to 'traditional' /cough-pureblood-cough/ behavior if not otherwise prompted.

They would have remained neutral in both wars if that was the case, and they didn't. They openly opposed Voldemort. The parents atleast don't really have the time to go out and learn about muggles, tinkering is a hobby for Arthur, and he'd probably do it after he retired and had free time.

She doesn't like Fleur, and is grasping at whatever she can find to try and avoid it, atleast that is my interpretation. After Fleur disagrees, she realizes that she actually does love Bill.

******* Naw, I think the explanation fits. They aren't intentionally against muggles or muggleborn and are actively for them,bu their day to day life is shaped by their society which seems to be very much living in the magical world. When big opportunities to act present themselves, they take them, but the small things slip by their notice because they don't think of those things as important.

Werewolves are monsters, muggles are quaint, ekeltricity is probably important, we don't talk about squibs, etc.

******** There's no indication that the Weasleys are ashamed of having a squib relative. What we do know, is that he was rude to Mr and Mrs Weasley, which is why they didn't talk much. Reminds me of Percy's situation more than anything. And despite Percy being rude /and/ siding with the Ministry, Molly was happy to see him when he comes to visit along with Scrimgeour. I think she'd be glad to reunite with the cousin.

The statute of secrecy makes it hard for them to associate with muggles, outside of people like Hermione's parents. When it comes to electricity, they say magic interferes with it, and so Arthur Weasley(as far as we can see) is the only one to even bother trying to find a way around it. Most muggleborns seem to give up, and use magic instead.

Are the Weasleys slightly shut in and not the type to talk about squibs? Maybe, but this isn't evidence of it, and canon points the other way. It seems unlikely that squibs were hushed up in their family, considering Ron volunteers the information so freely, even when he's uncertain about it.

There's plenty of other flaws that the Weasleys have, but this isn't one of them.

As for what Rowling intended, to me if it's not in the books, her opinions on the novels holds only the same amount as the opinions of the readers. It may not be the most popular opinion, but her being the writer doesn't make her fan theories any more viable to me.

*** That might be more believable if Rowling was consistent with genetics. I could believe the whole inbreeding bad angle, except that Hagrid was born when a wizard fucked a giant, a being with limited intelligence, little to no canonic magic ability, and overly strong. Hagrid is spell-resistent, very strong and durable, reasonable intelligent(at least socially intelligent), and a decent if uneducated wizard. Yes you can argue that giants practically count as a humanoid species just like the Goblins, which lets Flitwick off the hook. You still can't however explain Blast Ended Skrewts. If we have to accept that poisonous dart throwing lions fucked burning crustaceans, to make man-sized exploding lobsters, then I am not even going to pretend that DNA has anything to do with magical trait inheritance, since it obviously doesn't.

(My gripe is with Rowling and her inconsistancy, so if I come off as harsh towards you, its just cause I'm annoyed at the message she is trying to push.)

*** I disagree on the Gaunts and Malfoys being magically weak.

Morfin and Marvolo sent a senior and (likely) extremely skilled Ministry official running for reinforcements. And even then, when Bob Odgen did bring in reinforcements, Marvolo injured a few more of them before him and his son were overpowered.

With the Malfoys, I have to disagree even more. I don't think one could get into Voldemort's inner circle being magically okay or incompetent.

Taken from the wiki article on Lucius.

/His former house elf called him a dark wizard, and Lucius was a high-ranking Death Eater, being a member of Voldemort's innermost circle. Lucius was skilled with the Imperius Curse, using it multiple times in the Ministry of Magic. As a member of the innermost circle amongst the Death Eaters, it can also be assumed that he may have taken part in murder and torture via the Cruciatus Curse. At one point, whilst overcome by rage, he attempted to use the Killing Curse on Harry Potter, only to be repelled by Dobby. Duelling: An advocate for violence and unafraid to use it himself, Lucius was a highly proficient duelist. The fact that he were second-in-command for most of the First Wizarding War and therefore had to take charge and lead several battles against both Aurors and members of the Order of the Phoenix between his graduation in 1972 and 1981, and managed to successfully evade capture until after Voldemort's fall from power, serves as a testament of his ability to handle himself in magical combat when required to do so. Being a gentleman of stature, Lucius displayed great form and elegance in his duelling style prudent for a man of his aristocratic heritage. However, he was no longer on the peak of his capabilities when he re-entered his service to Lord Voldemort. Fourteen years of absence from active usage of martial magic against the powers that be had blunted his skill, although he were still very capable in his own right. Whereas some of the other Death Eaters were forced to break their ranks early on during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries when members of Dumbledore's Army attempted to stun them, Lucius showed proficient reflexes in deflecting Harry Potter's stunning spell with relative ease. Shortly afterwards, he were able to hold his own against Remus Lupin in the Ministry of Magic. He was also the only Death Eater, apart from Severus Snape, who had enough confidence in his abilities to stand up to Bellatrix Lestrange and deflected one of her spells which had been aimed at Harry, because he was worried that she might accidentally smash the prophecy Harry was carrying. Lucius was present during the Battle of Hogwarts but did little, if any, fighting during the battle, because he was with Lord Voldemort in the Shrieking Shack for the first part of the battle and was searching for his son during the second part. Nevertheless, the fact that he was capable of running wandlessly through the midst of countless raging battles and evade being hit of numerous spells sent off by the various combatants on both sides speaks well of his reflexes, which would indeed have served him well in duelling. Potioneer: While in school at Hogwarts, Lucius was noted by Horace Slughorn to be quite talented in potions./

The article on Draco also notes various impressive feats and skills he possesses. The Malfoys, at least Lucius and Draco, do not seem to have any serious signs of inbreeding, and are additionally quite physically attractive as compared to their fellow pure-blooded peers.

  Gaunts: magically weak
#+end_quote

I would disagree. It seems fairly clear that Merope was practically a squib because of the abuse she received (verbal and otherwise). Tonks also lost magical ability while depressed. Merope proved able once Marvolo and Morfin were gone, and once again reverted to inability, very likely due to depression, after Tom Riddle left her.

Also Marvolo and Morfin themselves didn't at all seem weak. The way I read it I took

#+begin_quote
  With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand.
#+end_quote

To mean silently casting. Certainly not definite. However I do think this is noteworthy:

#+begin_quote
  Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements... Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered... and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot... Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.
#+end_quote

Meaning 1) The /Head/ of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad ran away, showing they weren't so weak as to be taken lightly. 2) Marvolo injured the /Head/ and at least 3 more Law Enforcement witches and wizards. Not bad IMO, certainly not magically weak.

You would think they could do more with their hovel magically speaking to improve it but I believe the psychological (mental, emotional or whatever) issues created that disfunction and detachment.

Lastly I have a pet theory that the Gaunts weren't educated at Hogwarts (at least recently) and felt themselves too good for the riff raff and out of derangement saw themselves carrying on Slytherin's work. This would mean they didn't have proper education, but again that's just a pet theory.

*** That's kind of the point. If you're painting the opposition party as mentally sub-normal inbreds to justify your agenda then you are /literally Nazis/.

It /is/ pretty clear in the books that magical power is basically a function of how many books you have read and spells you have practiced, but that then leaves us with a huge segment of the population who believe something which is demonstrably wrong for... reasons???

Additionally, while the Gaunts /were/ inbred hillbillies, they also were the only family who could talk to snakes, which is admittedly awesome. Breeding with a muggle once was apparently enough to ensure Tom was born with no genetic defects whatsoever (somehow), but no muggleborn is going to suddenly develop parsletongue without some freaky-deaky soul sheanigans. Metamorphmagus is a little bit trickier to lock down since Tonks was a half-blood (though it should also be noted that both of her parents /were magical/, and both of Teddy's parents were magical too (hell the Lupins were probably purebloods given their retarded naming schema which would make Teddy something like a 3/4 blood)) so it looks like another case of excessive inbreeding among the Blacks suppressing the magical ability rather than enhancing it. *But*, it is /clearly hereditary/, so any starting position which is concerned about ancestry is /explicitly/ at least somewhat valid.

***** Yes, and once you listen you actually hear a lot of explanations that, while never excusing the atrocities committed, make actual sense. As much as we'd like to think otherwise, even the most evil among us are as much humans as we are and therefore operate on reason - may it be as flawed as it wants.

I'm not sure about the communists - not enough knowledge there - but the Germans and the people flocking to ISIS (with the exception of their western fighters, who have more individual reasons) are a people torn up by war who feel slighted and forgotten in the aftermath, with the same outcome of radicalization towards a perceived (historical) enemy who they blame for their misfortune. With the Germans it was the Treaty of Versailles and the Jews, with ISIS (and most islamic radicals) it is the "crusader countries" and the Unfaithful or Infidels.

You could easily explain the Pureblood Agenda and the Death Eaters as its radical arm the same way.

However, it seems their radicalization comes more from the same reasons as, for example, the Alt-Right in the US, or the populist right-wing in Europe. Meaning a perceived threat to their culture with anecdotal evidence confirming their beliefs that even though they are still in power, discrimination and propaganda is against /them/ and /their/ beliefs. Following this reasoning they form a radicalized group led by a charismatic, radical leader who promises a swift and ultimate solution to the problem.

** You make an interesting point. I for one have not often seen fics where problems afflicting Wizarding Society are complex enough to be relatable. For example, the theoretical differences between liberalism and conservatism, in America. In theory, which is right? Do we urge fiscal responsibility, or do we support helping everybody? There is no clear answer.

There were a couple of similar fanfics out there. For instance, linkffn(8215565), Knowledge is Useful but Power is Power presents the image of a society in which the government is deeply dysfunctional, and all powerful individuals must be controlled. But what is the right thing to do? Restricting the will of all powerful people, and binding anyone in the ministry with magically enforced oaths seems dystopian. But the alternative is Riddle, who saw the problem, and felt that the only way to escape and fix it was through genocide.

The problems presented in the Wizarding World are difficult. If they were realistic, it would be too difficult to understand in their entirity, the interplay of money, cause and effect all contributing to make it too complex to be readable. Yet at the same time, dumbing it down makes everything seem too flat. It implies that there is good and bad, and that they are absolute. Dark!Harry fics are just as guilty of this as the normal ones. Claiming that the Wizarding World oppresses and censors all dark magic, and using that to excuse Harry turning "evil" (in that he just insults Dumbledore and curses training dummies with meaner spells), just achieves that exact same effect if you never make allowances, never treat both sides as being human, and therefore having real and human desires and goals and reasoning behind them. The odds that every Death Eater is a sociopath are about as low as every Order Member being a sheep. Somewhere along the line, someone made a concious choice to support a side, and that should be recognized.

Rant over.

TL;DR-If you want a realistic fanfic, make your societal problems realistic and relatable. Using issues where everything is seen from one point of view, and you are either a hero or victim is about as cringy as when people are obviously and unapologetically biased in real life.

** You can try linkao3(178070). You kinda get the Harry joins up with Voldie and I definitely had the feeling that things were slanted to paint Voldie and co in the best possible light, but I think it fits your request pretty well--muggleborns who tell their very extended families, Samhain hidden under Halloween, Dumbledore and the ministry not prepared to deal with dark creature threats, etc.

  Voldemort has made a bargain with Harry to stop killing muggles and muggle-borns (when at all possible, of course) in exchange for Harry's cooperation. While Harry thinks he's using the time to find a way to defeat the Dark Lord, he will realize that Voldemort is always one step ahead, and so long as he isn't killing anyone...what's the big deal? He has bigger things to worry about now, anyway. Includes dementors, pureblood culture, the prophecy, what exactly happened with Lily's sacrifice, magical breakthroughs, children Death Eaters, and portraits of family. Final pairing: H/D. Sequel to Black, in the Smothering Dark. Beta'd by laureen@livejournal.
