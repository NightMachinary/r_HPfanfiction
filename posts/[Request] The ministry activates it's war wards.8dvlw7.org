As much as backwards it seems the magical England is, they must have a failsafe protocol for hostile force trying to take over the powerhouse of magical Britain


** In linkffn(The One He Feared), the Ministry activates something called the Sound, which disables magical travel such as Apparition and Portkeys. Floo too, I think.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

*** Um...question, I haven't read that fic but, wouldn't blocking Apparition stop Aurors and Hit Wizards from responding to Death Eater attacks?

For that matter, wouldn't that make it much more difficult for wizards and witches to escape attacks by Death Eaters?

Although I suppose it would make it more difficult for said Death Eaters to reach targets to attack them, or vanish afterwards...unless they brought a fast broomstick.

**** Some people had rings to let them Apparate. It's really just about limiting the Death Eaters.

** linkffn(8288341)

It starts out decent enough but the second half isn't well done IMO. A few interesting ideas but none executed in a satisfying manner.

  After the war is over Harry wants to protect his godson Teddy Lupin, but he isn't sure how. Andromeda Tonks has a few interesting suggestions for him.

** Well the wizarding world lacks real territory worth calling a country, they're deeply connected at the International level (the ICW seems to be able to remove national heads of government) and rites of passage for adults include a year of world travelling... not really the kind of civilization that's going to be armed for war, hence the lack of proper militaries in any wizarding community (unless I'm mistaken).

*** Thanks for the opinion but not what this post is about. This post, hence the request flair, is looking for a fanfic with the description I described. It is not looking for people saying why the fanfic can't happen
