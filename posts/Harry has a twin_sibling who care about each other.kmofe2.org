I'm looking for completed or ongoing fics where Harry has a twin or sibling. I don't care about the siblings gender (or Harry's for that matter)

I would like the siblings to have an actual sibling bond and not some WBWL rivalry (can still be WBWL tho).

No fics where Lily/James/Dumbledore send one of them away to get abused while the other gets spoiled. (Although I have seen one were one of the twins is a squib and is send to Petunia, who actually lovingly raises her as a daughter)


** Oh do you have the link for the squib one and agreed would like some non bashing ones if possible. They are so hard to come by these daya

*** Well, she is thought to be a squib. And it's been a while since the last update (maybe abandoned?)

I find what's written to be great, it has some unique ideas I literally have not seen in any of the fics I've read.

** I like Genius Fratris. In this fic, Harry is traumatized by Voldemort killing his mom in front of him and doesn't speak. He still makes noise and can occasionally talk if he feels comfortable, but generally doesn't say anything. It's a rare WBWL in that James survived the attack and is not abusive. Also, Harry and the brother genuinely love and care for each other.

  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.

  What if a saner Voldemort, wary of a plot by Dumbledore, heard the prophecy and decided to assume a wait and see approach instead of leaping to action? Growing up as the son of two dedicated Order members who seem to care more about their war than their children, Harry becomes his sister's protector and nothing will ever stand between them. Not their parents' blind devotion to a vigilante with an overinflated sense of self importance and not a Dark Lord bent on slaughtering his way to complete dominance of Britain.  This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.
