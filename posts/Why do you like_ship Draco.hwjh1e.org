I see so many Harry/Draco, Draco/OC, or even Draco/Hermione.

I'm curious what the appeal is. I personally find him to be a racist coward with no redeeming qualities. I'm also not judging you for liking him; I'm just genuinely curious.

Are you simply attracted to Tom Felton, or do you genuinely like Draco's character?

Is there a Draco ship that doesn't make him completely OOC?

Thanks, and sorry if I offended anyone! It's just my personal opinion. :)


** Well, first think of all the male characters with prominent that are in the same year with Harry. In order of screen time , we get Ron, Draco, then probably Neville

Of those three, the one with the most interesting dynamic setup would be Draco. He's the Slytherin where Harry/Hermione are the conventional Gryffindor

He fits the antagonistic/rival setup that is popular in pairing

Now, canon Draco is a terribly unattractive character. However fanon Draco has all the right setup to create interesting dynamics. All you need to do is alter his personality and actions a bit, allow for some growth, etc

Make no mistake, fanon Draco is completely different from canon Draco. When most people read Draco ships, they're doing it knowing that the Draco they're reading has been changed.

Of course there are people who confuse canon Draco with the fanon ones

*** Right, that's makes sense. I was thinking he had to basically be an OC for those fics to work.

That's probably why they just don't appeal to me.

I think I'd rather see just a completely new character. Perhaps a brother or sister of Draco who has the same upbringing. I know people don't necessarily like those, but it would work better IMO.

Thanks for the feedback!

**** Yes, and to be fair, plenty of fics have characters that are “OC in everything but name”

Most popular is Harry. He's a collections of traits and if you have just enough, you can satisfy everyone and still have your character named Harry

Another examples are Maurauders fics and “Harry parents are alive” fics.

We don't really have a lot of info about Lily and James in comparison to Sirius and Remus. So in those stories Lily and James are basically OC with enough superficial traits that authors and readers can reliably call them Lily and James

In general, having someone be totally in character is generally hard, so most writers are okay with a superficial “close enough”

Other times they want to explore a canon character with new personality/growth or see them interact with canon in a changed manner. Slytherin!Harry and Slytherin!Hermione stories are example of this. Basically OCs but we still call them Harry and Hermione

**** I personally dont like new characters because they're usually poorly written, or just copies of the authors personality. Or when it's a brother or sister it's a clone of the original character from the books.

When it comes to draco shipping, I read the ones that take place after the war and yes Draco is different to the point that hes an OC. But the thing is, after something like a war, and the trauma of Voldemort and everything that happened, he's always GOING to be different. No one goes through something like that, has their ideals and family ripped to shreds like that without changing. Without realizing theres something very wrong with their life and beliefs.

**** I personally don't like reading about completely new characters. I much prefer taking the template of an existing character and fleshing it out a bit more than the stereotype that Rowling used.

Let's describe a character. Who is this?

- Pureblood
- Male
- Family has incredibly high expectations of him
- His father is well known in the ministry
- Strongly represents his Hogwarts house ideals
- Experiences life-threatening situations in the books

Any guesses who this is? It could be Draco, Cedric, or Neville. A lot of the canon characters are pretty basic. I tend to enjoy fanfictions where they make the characters with similar backgrounds to have distinct personalities.

My favorite fanfictions are the ones that explore the impact of the Dursley's abuse upon Harry. Harry should be slow to trust, flinch when touched, have eating disorders, and hide his abilities from authority. Living in a cupboard, constantly being scolded for asking questions, being chased by dogs, and being mistrusted by everyone should have serious effects on Harry's personality, but Rowling just makes him a normal boy once he leaves Privet Drive each year. I prefer more depth from the characters.

***** I don't think he is a normal boy, that's what makes him suitable for going on adult-less adventures. It's his friends who try to get him to talk to other people.

I also think that people can coast through life a very long time without it being obvious that they've been abused - often causing them trouble later on. We also know, from statistics, that adults report having been abused as significantly higher ratios than children are flagged for experiencing it. Even for those we do flag up, you wouldn't always know it. It just happens that it's easier to spot child abuse if there's obvious signs and no other masking explanation. (Disabled children often fly under the radar because people put it down to their needs and not what's happened to them.)

I do enjoy fics that explore different ways of him reacting, however. To be honest, I'd REALLY like to see a Harry who ends up on a SEN list for behaviour, or in a special school (BESD/SMEH) as a result and then having Hogwarts staff with it's canon level of student support absolutely flummoxed about how to manage it. (Dumbledore won't have him expelled because he's Harry. Snape's frothing at the mouth over it. McGonagal is horrified when strictness backfires and somehow the optional subject teachers get roped into it because they've got space on their timetable. Eventually, someone is forced into consulting some muggles about what to do/they work something out - whilst still not being a quick fix.) Or something like that happening when he starts out as canon but has a gradual break down a few years in.

** I cannot resist the following:

- Breaking generational cycles
- Trying to figure out early adulthood
- Redemption arcs that continue over time
- A lot of room for your own character development & headcanons

which is why I love to read and write post-war Draco/Astoria

it makes me happy and (to paraphrase Taylor Swift) I choose to focus less on the things that people say I shouldn't do and more on doing whatever the hell I want

** I like Draco because he has a lot of unfulfilled potential in canon. His canon 'redeption arc' is at best the mere beginning of one. He spends most of the books being an awful person, but the final books reveal him as a schoolyard bully who was raised to have horrible beliefs, but he doesn't have it in him to truly be a villain.

We know that he raised Scorpius to have much better ideals, so I'd be interested to see Draco's post-war journey of personal growth.

**** I agree with the poster that said the redemption arc is completely ignored; JKR just assumes that (because there were ZERO consequences for his actions), Draco became an upstanding citizen.

At the end of canon, Draco has attempted to murder people, recklessly endangered the entire student population of Hogwarts, used Unforgivable Curses, nearly killed Slughorn and Katie Bell, and unashamedly embraced genocidal beliefs.

For all of that, he.... stays super rich, gets a pureblooded wife, never goes to jail. Ahhh, that really sets up a postwar redemption arc!

For anything but a pure-evil!Draco to work, he has to show at least some remorse as a kid. Therefore, postwar redemption is totally unbelievable without him realizing he is morally repugnant /prior/ to the good guys winning.

***** It's not a redemption arc in itself, but I do see what he goes through in books 6 and 7 as a wake-up call, where he gradually realizes that he's on the wrong side. He doesn't want to identify Harry at Malfoy Manor, and in his last real scene in the Room of Requirement, he spends the whole time dithering in the background, yelling at Crabbe and Goyle not to kill the others.

I see the Malfoys' fates as a bit of cynical realism from Rowling - even with Voldemort gone, money still counts, and the world isn't perfect. But I don't think that has any bearing on whether or not Draco can become a better person. He doesn't have to be punished to be redeemed, he just has to be willing to change. Nothing in the books guarantees that he will, but it doesn't preclude it either.

****** Hahaha, kind of like how after WW2, Jewish people were like "hey, let's just forgive and forget. No need to make up for your actions, let's not dwell on the past!"

I know you were only citing how JKR pitched it, and I think you're probably dead on, bc that sounds like the kind of garbage she'd believe. It isn't redemption if someone doesn't own what they've done.

Like the OP noted, Draco didn't so much realize he was wrong as much as accept his own cowardice. He couldn't kill Dumbledore, even knowing his own parents' lives would be forfeit. He almost never fought face to face; all his plots used surrogates and third parties. He is, at heart, a weak and scared bigot whose lack of conviction and indecisiveness lucks him into survival.

That's just canon, though - i have seen several awesome Draco portrayals in fanfiction where he grows and develops in a positive way. Hell, even when Draco is unabashedly evil and goes full on death eater is preferable to canon, where he is just a loud mouthed, ineffectual nuisance.

** I think there's potential, personally I've long preferred the ones that show Draco's redemption arc, rather than just making him into a different guy. I think there's a few easy points for it - before the 6th year murder plots truly kick off and post-war.

tl;dr: I do genuinely believe that young people who fall into gangs or become radicalised should be properly rehabilitated. Punishment might feel good for the victims but it doesn't actually solve anything - research shows that genuine rehabilitation schemes significantly reduces reoffending (and therefore fewer victims) compared with punishment or 'rehabilitation' in name only. Sweden, for example, has the lowest re-offending rate in Europe. Scotland, while far from ideal, has more options than England and Wales.

I do think this perspective influences how I read fic. If you have a different perspective on crime and punishment and on people (especially young people)'s ability to change, then you'll almost certainly come to a different conclusion.

Also, Harry named his kid after Snape.

Draco didn't have it in him to murder Dumbledore and spent the best part of the year an emotional mess. He also didn't go into it wanting to be a murderer for fun - he was given that role as a punishment for his father's failure and was forced into it under threat of death. Yes, at the start of the year he probably thought it was simple, but as time goes on he realises that it's not.

Sure, he could have gone to Dumbledore but his whole life he's been raised not to trust him. He also knows that Dumbledore trusts Snape and think he's on his side, but Draco 'knows' Snape is actually with Voldemort. The consequence for getting it wrong would be his parents' lives.

Added to that, the boy who doesn't have a stomach for murder then spends a year with his home as the hub for the Death Eaters watching people be murdered in front of him. We don't see this period (except that he stalls on identifying Harry) but it seems to me that if anything was going to put seeds of doubt into his mind, it would be that. So, post war there's an opportunity to show the journey from the first seeds to

We do, also, know that JKR intended for Malfoy to sort his life out because we see it in Cursed Child. No, some people don't count it as canon but I don't see how there could have been a way of showing it given that the epilogue is a chapter about Harry seeing his kids off to school.

So, you don't really need to excuse Draco of his crimes so much as show that he's changed since he was a child. Harry is the sort of person who named his child after Snape, I don't think it's completely out there that he might forgive Draco. Or develop feelings for him while feeling conflicted about it. Harry and Draco also both experienced a number of Voldemorts meetings and while I don't imagine them sitting and chatting about it, I could see a situation where they feel less alone about it.

Draco was radicalised, but was also a victim with regard to be held hostage within his own home and I think it's possible to acknowledge that without slighting the people hunted down by Voldemort.

I don't think any post-war relationship or character change is easy to write, because it involves a long hard look at himself and everyone he's held dear, plus the trauma of the war and then actually working to change that. I think post-war Drarry works best a good decade on.

So, it's easier to find Drarry at Hogwarts, although as an adult it's very difficult to find fics that deal with a relationship without having indecent material. I don't want to read about teens getting it on so it can be worth hunting for the post-war stuff.

Other people get around it by simply changing Draco, either gradually but years before a relationship or just starting up as a different but recognisable character. Personally, I don't like the ones where Harry's perception is of canon Draco, but it turns out he's wrong because I think that sounds apologist. I also don't like it when the entire house of Slytherin is misunderstood as a geninue idea (as opposed to their perception of the situation).

Also, the pickings are far slimmer for slash. Pairing Harry off with Draco is far more simple that having to re-organise all the canon pairings since we don't actually know who Astoria Greengrass is. If you try to find decent femslash, it can be like staring into an abyss.

***** "Irredeemable" is a strong word. Sometimes it can be surprising how different things look from another person's point of view. For example, reading linkffn(The Snape Chronicles) really opened my eyes to how much of a temper Harry had, how often Snape walked in on a situation where Harry and/or Ron had just been responsible for escalating from mere words to violence.

If you want to put things strongly, how about this: Harry looking into the Pensieve during his Occlumency lessons was inexcusable, and for someone like Snape, nigh-unforgivable. Just think about why Harry was having those lessons in the first place: to keep Voldemort out of his head. So if Snape was removing a memory before exposing his mind to Harry, then presumably that memory is something that Voldemort /must not know/. And so what does Harry do? He seizes on that memory and sticks it in his own head, where Voldemort can potentially access it! If he hadn't promised to protect Harry, Snape might well have throttled him. If it weren't for the /deus ex machina/ of Voldemort being unable to read Harry's mind just because Harry is able to love people, that incident could easily have lost them the war.

#+begin_quote
  The little we know of him in canon paints a portrait of a character who is weak-willed, histrionic, dramatic, and malicious. And yet many readers see him as smart and witty--his sarcasm and running criticism in Care of Magical Creatures is hilarious, as well as being completely understandable. He gets up every time he is knocked down, and continues to exude an incredibly smug, confident attitude whenever he interacts with Harry, even when we see him humiliated time and again. He remains eerily observant about the people and events around him, and knows exactly how to get under Harry's skin. He writes lame songs with lame lyrics, makes badges, is good in school, and seems to be able to beat every other Seeker at Quidditch except for Harry. He is a talented bragger and a complete drama queen, he knows how to get attention and capitalize on it, and seems to be particularly good at uniting the sympathies of his housemates.

To that I would add: real people don't stop maturing at 17. I would have a hard time liking or reading about canon 15-year old Draco. But being a bully, coward, and racist when you're a teenager doesn't determine who you are for the rest of your life. And a contrite, non-racist, post-Hogwarts Draco could honestly be a kinda appealing guy.

unfortunately, the only times I found him worth reading, he was quite out of character. Unless you make up character traits or abilities for him, you really have to stretch to make him a likeable character, IMO. The core of his canonical character is, like you said... a racist coward who harms many innocent people with no particular positives thrown his way. It's kinda hard to build a decent character off that unless you change a lot.

...funny enough, the most plausible Draco redemption I've seen is in Blindness - he's a very minor character and his turning point is Dobby saving his life; they end up making a house elf temp agency together. Still OOC but I liked the idea.

** For me, there are several different reasons.

First reason would be niche. My favorite type of character is a snarky asshole. The only boys with really any prominence don't really fit this archetype. Harry, though he has his moments, does not exactly have a deep or compelling personality, nor is his snark a constant fixture. Ron is a loveable goofball who also has some good moments of snark. And Neville is treated as a joke for the first four books and never has any snarky moments. Draco is the first prominent male character that I could imagine fitting this archetype (excluding Snape). We never really see how he interacts with his friends (or, if JKR is to be believed, how he /would/ act if he had any), so writers are free to do whatever they want.

Secondly, he comes pre-packaged with all sorts of potential for believable drama. I'd say most people writing/shipping him want him to be on the side of the good guys. This raises many questions. Does he want to be on their side? If yes, why did he change his mind? Does his family know? What do they think? How did he leave the dark side, and what was his experience there like? How do members of the light side treat him? Will they accept him? Are there some that will never accept him? How does he deal with this? So on so forth.

Thirdly, much of his life is left blank and can thus be filled with whatever the author wants. To name of few more popular questions that get addressed: Is he academically inclined? He may have french heritage--does this play a role in his life? Does he take arithmancy or ancient runes, and why? What was his childhood like? What is his relationship with his parents like?

This next point is kinda rambly and all over the place, but I hope it makes sense.

  Objectively speaking, Jaime Lannister is a far more terrible person than Darla is, but we can come to like Jaime because we're not comparing him to Darla or any normal person. We're comparing him to: Prince Joffrey; Walder Frey; Ramsay Bolton; people who have no redeeming qualities.

This is, imo, exactly what's happening with Draco. The only other antagonists with much screen time are Voldemort, Umbridge, and Snape. There are some side villains, like Bellatrix and Lucius, but they have significantly less screen time and thus don't really register as much. We have a sea of much nicer characters, so these four stand out as the worst of the worst.

So, I guess another way of putting it is that people don't hate Draco because of what he's done, but rather that he was written to take these actions to make people hate him (if that makes any sense). This is why there's such a divide in Draco (and Snape) fans and the rest of fandom. One half says 'are you kidding? This guy is the worst!' while the other half is saying 'no listen, he did abc because of xyz!' Neither side is really wrong per se; it's a difference in how the two sides view the character. Both are an emotional reaction--one to his role in canon (I hate him because he's a shithead antagonist) and the other to the wider context of his actions (I feel sorry for him because he's an indoctrinated kid).

So taking him out of the role of shithead antagonist and showcasing the indoctrination aspect is pretty compelling to Draco fans. You're not just writing a fun little fanfic exploring what-ifs (unless that is explicitly the goal, of course :P), you're writing about /your/ interpretation of and perspective on his character.

And so with all that said... yeah, I totally understand and sympathize with the indoctrination aspect. Like, the guy spent the first eleven years of his life being fed pureblood bs, and then went to a school where his only known yearmates were also fed the same bs, and where nobody calls him on his pureblood bs or tries to change his mind. The only people that seem to do so are muggleborns like Hermione and blood traitors like Ron, and why tf would he believe them when they're exactly who he's been taught to look down on.

I also think my own personal experiences play into this--my best friend, whom I've been best friends with since middle school, held some pretty terrible beliefs as a kid. It was only until she went to college and actually experienced the world and had classes that challenged what she thought she knew that she changed. As a kid, /I/ only grew because of social media, which I mostly used for fun, but sometimes someone I followed would post about real world issues and I would go "wow, I never knew..." I can only imagine how much harder this exposure would be in a world where you have to go out of your way to search up the information in a book (or find it in an insanely biased newspaper). To him, it'd be like going "yeah, I should really read up on flat-earthers." Like. Why would he do that.

Does that make his actions okay? Hell no. But I think it at the very least makes it understandable, and I think exploring his growth is an interesting idea.

Anyways this was like an hour and half's worth of brain vomit. I guess in a way you're lucky that this is something I've been thinking on recently. I need more hobbies :/

*** This! Especially the stuff about indoctrination. Its is so incredibly hard to leave behind the life you knew as a child, the life your parents know, the life everyone around you follows and take your own path, especially when you don't even realize what you say and think and do is wrong.

** I just like the enemies to lovers trope. simple as that. and Draco is like the only enemy that would fit.

to that, I also ship Snupin or Snape/Sirius, and sometimes even Snape/James. and Draco with Ron or Neville.

I don't like Draco in the first 5 books, but his character has potential. and I can see him as a tortured soul, or ... Zuko. oh, he is a Zuko alright. the only difference is Zuko actually joined the team, while Draco didn't. I don't think he deserves so much hate from fans tbh, he isn't great, but he isn't evil either.

** I do like how Tom captured the snarky, sarcastic bits of Draco's personality as well as the angst of his failures in HBP. But Tom is not why I like Draco. I liked Draco from the books because I see a lot of him in myself and the people I grew up with. It's the same reason my favorite character is Pansy Parkinson. I was a nasty little bullying bitch, even all the way through high school. I can admit that. I grew up in a small Southern town. Racism was a way of life. Most of us knew it was wrong deep down, but it didn't stop you from laughing at jeers and jokes no matter how guilty you may or may not have felt later. So, yes, I recognized a lot of people in Draco's character, and I latched on to him because I also know what changes can happen. I craved that redemption for him and the other Slytherins because I know it can be real. And I ship him with Hermione, just like I ship Pansy with Harry. Growth is possible. Change is possible. Happily ever after is possible. You just have to put in some work, and I think that the war would make all of that possible eventually.

*** I really enjoy your perspective because I'm on the opposite side of the spectrum.

I was the kid who was bullied in school, so I tend to hate characters like Draco and Pansy.

However, I also believe everyone has the right to redemption, so I can see where you're coming from.

Thanks. :)

** The way I see it is Draco was a brat raised with shitty ideals from 11-15/16, up until Voldemort took over his house. We know in 6th year he was petrified for his life, and 7th year wasn't much better. Add in the PTSD he, along with ever other child thrown into the war, almost certainly should have had and some character growth, and it's not that difficult to build from that into a redemption arc, especially after he didn't turn Harry over at the Manor. As for the fics that occur during the hogwarts time, a lot of them involve him responding positively to making friends outside of the social circle he was brought up in and them having a positive influence on him. As for the fact that he did horrible things, Harry did horrible things too, including nearly killing Malfoy, with little to no consequences.

** In my opinion it only makes sense if something major happens early on that changes draco and Harry's perspectives and/or personalities. Like Harry being Hufflepuff and begrudgingly befriending Draco on the train and it growing or Draco hmgrowing up somewhere else

Or

Draco regrets his actions after hogwarts and it's a slow process not forced like Harry and Draco don't WANT to like each other but... they do. Then it's cool bc Harry's all snarky and Draco insults him and Harry knows he doesn't mean it he just doesn't know what else to do bc that's what he's always done. But they love each other
