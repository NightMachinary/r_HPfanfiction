#+TITLE: Looking for any story where Harry, or whoever is the MC, doesn't give a crap about anything. As in acts like a teenager would when the only real punishment is detention, which they could care less about with having no models of authority they're trying to make proud.

That's all really. I want a teenager with a devil may care attitude, and isn't afraid to call out other people's bullshit.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Gonna dig through my bookmarks. There's one where he gets ALL the houses buy Slytherin (maybe Gryffindor?) to "withdraw" from the house cup. Ravenclaws start blowing crap up, Hufflepuffs don't give a crap and hit back. The teachers are pissed.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

**** Linked two examples. There's more though. It's a lesser seen trope, but it exists.

** linkffn(5200789) is a great slice of life teenage fic, for most of it the war is muted in the background, and James is exactly a 'a teenager with a devil may care attitude, and isn't afraid to call out other people's bullshit'

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.
