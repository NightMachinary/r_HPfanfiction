Hello! I have a request for recommendations with fics that go in-depth with wizarding lore and culture, new and expanded magic, etc. Basically hit me with fics that really have expanded JKR's world-building. A couple of examples off of the top of my head include The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in the British Isles or The Lightning Sacrifices Arc. I don't care about what ships they are or if they even have ships. Thank you!


** I also like Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament. It's not complete yet but it is already very long at 525K+ words. It's again, exactly what you are looking for.

**** I'd definitely recommend this- it was amazing! Diverges from cannon quite a bit but it's very immersive and an enjoyable read.

** I feel like I'm linking this fic every single thread, but what am I supposed to do, not link to one of the GOATs? Victoria Potter by this subreddit's very own Taure has a lot of that stuff in it. Lots of extra wizard culture stuff (while steering clear of the cliches you usually get with that) and lots of really great expansion of the magic system.

Also, BrilliantLady's Perfect Normal series does this a lot in the later entries. You'll have to get through the first (very short) fic to really get into it, but by the time you get to second year the wizarding culture expansion and exposition is everywhere. If you can make it though the first fic you're in for a real treat, one of the most emotionally nuanced fics I've ever read, and I think the world building is as good or better as that in some of the more well-known stories like Prince of Slytherin.

linkffn(11591125)

I guess since I mentioned it above, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man has tons of wizard culture and tons of new magic. It's a WBWL story whose goal is to start off extremely trope-y, but then develop into this rich and sprawling world where every character has realistic motivations and nobody is all good or all bad. In my opinion it accomplishes the goal very well. A WBWL story that makes you like the WBWL and Ron, and Harry is freaking unheard of, but it is amazing. The only complaint I see from people about it is that there are a lot of info dumps, but if you're looking for expanded culture and magic I think you'll enjoy the info dumps quite a lot. I know I did/do.

** The Pureblood Pretense expands the world a lot. There was never a war; instead, there were laws passed that officially make non-pure-bloods into second class citizens, banned from Hogwarts, from government positions, and from many types of employment. As a result, the story has a lot more about blood status arguments and pure-blood culture.

Also, advanced potion brewing (canon Harry hated potions, but this Harry lives for them), exploring mindscapes, making use of a Time Turner without going insane, "free" duelling that's still not intended to maim or kill but is otherwise no-holds-barred, and lots of tricky situations that nearly expose The Ruse. Because if anyone finds out that Harry is at Hogwarts, she's looking at life in Azkaban.

** The Dangerverse which is a huge AU. It does have trope though I found them well done YMMV. Begins with linkffn(Living With Danger by Whydoyouneedtoknow)

** The Plan series by inwardtransgience and PseudoLeigha.

linkao3(15294075)

A teenage Bellatrix Black crosses universes into the canon HP world's third year. Has a /lot/ of magic lore and culture building. One of my favorites.

*** Don't know why this was downvoted, since that series has the best exploration of magic culture, society, and religion I've ever read in the fandom, and it also has some of the best writing.

Really, both of the authors go heavy on both in all of their HP fics.

  Thirteen year old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron Power. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. (Title drop.)

** One such fic I think that hits most of these parameters if not all is ACI100's Ashes of Chaos. I really don't know how to describe it without feeling like I'm getting something wrong about it. but I recommend it.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22220911][before the door of hell lamps burned]] is for sure on of the best ones I have read even if it has a tendency to assume the worst about things at times. It has a wibrant wizarding world that feels like it would fit very well within canon. there is a sequal being posted right now and a third one is being written.
