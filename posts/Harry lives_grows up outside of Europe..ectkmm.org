I've read plenty of fics where Harry is raised in France but never really outside of Europe. It doesn't have to be growing up and could be post or during the war. Please help!

  Harry winds up in Japan and lives a completely different life from the one Dumbledore planned for him. He returns to England and ... you need to read to find out.

** There's a Harry raised by Sirius fic where he's raised basically everywhere except Europe. They travel the world for most of the first part, they start in an American Town with some Native American fella that teaches Animagus-ey things, and Sirius falls for a Brazilian woman in Rio at some point. It was pretty fun, so if anyone else remembers what it was called and links it, I highly recommend it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11085295/1/Investigator-Harry-Steel]] is an interesting one. It's definitely outside of Europe. This fic is pretty Trope-filled, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine.
