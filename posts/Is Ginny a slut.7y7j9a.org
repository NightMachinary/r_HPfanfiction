** No. Sluts aren't people who date a lot. They're people who have a lot of meaningless sex with random people. So Ginny is not a slut at all

** Is there any indication in canon that she actually slept with guys?

** She dated a grand total of three guys, and one of those was her future husband. Four if you count Neville taking her to the Ball. For a teenage girl, this is hardly abnormal. Hell, it might even be way on the low side. She never had multiple boy friends, and her relationships lasted for months to years. She didn't date tons of guys, she just dated around a bit before settling on Harry.

** She dated two boys for nearly a year each before dating Harry and presumably did not date while he was away her 6th year. If we accepted the premise that someone who dates a lot is a “slut” ( which I don't as it implies there is something wrong about that) Ginny doesn't qualify. At worst, Ginny is a serial monogamist.

I actually think Rowling should've had Ginny date more, not less, because it's clear she didn't really care much for Michael or dean yet dated both boys a long time.

Also , I dont know if your use of the word “slut” is meant in a derogatory way, but if so, stop using that word to describe women who have sex a lot. There's nothing wrong with it. Apologies if not your intent.

** Jfc she's a normal teenager. When people are discovering relationships it's healthy and normal to date a lot. That's how we learn, and meet people we're compatable with.

If she /was/ it would probably make for an interesting bit of characterization. I'd read that fic.
