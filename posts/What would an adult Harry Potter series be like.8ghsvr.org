** Do you mean year 1-7 written for an adult audience or Harry as an adult? Because the first one would eventually turn into 80% sex and 20% violence (300 kids, 10 adults and one huge castle; nuff said).

As for adult Harry, either a magical cop show, a magical sports epic or a really dark action series set in a rather dystopian world.

*** Nah, more like 70% sex, 20% violence and 10% kids telling off adults because kids are /so/ smart. /s

** If you mean a harry potter series written by JK rowling about his life as an adult , most likely a detective series similar to her Comoran strike series but with Harry as an auror in the magical world. Would probably be pretty good.
