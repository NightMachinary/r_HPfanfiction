  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

*** It's definitely this one. I read the whole thing and regretted it. It's fluff that pretended to have a plot so I kept reading but it was only ever more fluff with a great big helping of “British wizards are backwards and dumb.”

** Not the one you're looking for, but "To Shape and Change" is similar.

Prettty good fic, the only thing I hate is that they didn't call it 'To Snape and Change'

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
