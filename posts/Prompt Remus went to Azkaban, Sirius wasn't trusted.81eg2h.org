So Remus was framed by Peter, and Sirius wasn't told (son of the House Black, ya know).

Bonus points for the following:

- making it crackfic material
- giving Remus the most obnoxiously conspicuous yet flawless breakout plan ever
- Azkaban wearing down Remus' self-control, basically unlocking his full prankster potential.

** Aight. Here's my best shot.

The short, fat, middle-aged man with the lime green bowler hat looked very out of place, walking down the dark dreary cell block of Azkaban. He eyed the mindless prisoners with a sort of condescending fear as he carefully moved past the particular cells whose occupants dared to reach out to him. /This/, he mused, /was the worst part of his job./

A dry, soft-spoken voice spoke out, instantly drawing the man's attention. Nobody here could possibly have the mental capacity left to speak in that tone, and yet...

"Why hello, Minister. How are you today?"

Fudge approached the cell in question. Where there was once a cot laid a twisted nest of shredded mattress and metal. A thin, hairy-faced man lay casually draped across it, giving no mind to the multitude of sharp edges and corners he was surrounded by.

"Ah," sneered Fudge. "The Werewolf of Azkaban. I hope the accommodations are to your liking?"

Lupin considered the statement for a moment. "I suppose they could be better, but I won't complain. Say, is that a newspaper?"

Fudge eyed the Daily Prophet folded up in his hand, before shrugging uncomfortably. "Today's edition. Why do you ask?"

The werewolf leaned back nonchalantly. "I do so miss the crosswords."

Unnerved, Fudge tossed the newspaper into the cell and gave a parting shot. "I suppose your cage could do with a change of lining."

(THREE MONTHS LATER)

The full moon rose above Azkaban, as an agonized howl sounded throughout the prison. There was the by now familiar acoustic of claws on stone, accompanied by a new sound. The sound of metal under great duress. After a moment, there was a crash as the cell door hit the opposite wall. In the Warden's tower, a panicked Auror mirror-called the DMLE Headquarters.

"CODE RED! THE WERE IS FREE, I REPEAT THE WERE IS FREE!"

Nymphadora Tonks, captain of the Night Shift Auror Response Team, cursed loudly. "EVERYBODY, PORTKEY TO PRISON-BOUND PORT NOW!"

Within minutes, the entire A.R.T. was piled into the one rickety boat that could go through the prison's wards. "Alright, people, remember: he is a werewolf. Silver conjurations are the name of the game here - no stunners. If needed, aim to kill." The Metamorphmagus gripped her wand grimly as the boat eerily slid across the water. The boat bumped against the dock.

"GO, GO, GO!"

The Aurors ran off the boat and onto the island. "Alright, let's search the building. The Were's cell was on the eighth floor, we'll start there and comb outwards. Go in threes, and be super careful. Jenkins, Rowan, you're with me."

With the rookies right behind her, Tonks made her way up to the eighth floor unobstructed. As she stepped into the cell of the missing werewolf, she saw a scrap of paper stuck to the wall. She stepped forwards, and suddenly a circle of runes lit up around her. Music started playing.

Auror Rowan tensed up. "No way..."

Tonks turned to her. "What is it, rookie?"

Rowan giggled disbelievingly as a deep voice echoed through the prison.

#+begin_quote
  Never gonna give you up,

  Never gonna let you down,

  Never gonna run around and desert you
#+end_quote

As the next verse of the unfamiliar song began playing, their comms went live. "/We have a visual on the Were, he's on the outer wall - DAMN, he can jump - Oh Merlin, he stole our boat!/"

#+begin_quote
  Never gonna make you cry,

  Never gonna say goodbye,

  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
#+end_quote

Tonks groaned and spoke into her badge. "/I think we triggered some sort of audio-based runic array? The music must've been his signal that we were in the prison."/

Rowan fought through her laughter to ask a question. "Was Lupin muggle-born or raised?"

Tonks shrugged. "I dunno, why?"

Rowan giggled again.

"We... " she dissolved into laughter.

"What is it?"

"We... we just..."

"SPIT IT OUT, ROOKIE!"

"/We just got Rick Rolled!/"

** That sounds kinda like linkffn(2156084) - I haven't really read much of it, so I can't vouch for its quality; really, the only reason I even found it was because I googled "site:fanfiction.net Astrophil".

*** I read most of it.

A few interesting ideas--I definitely liked Sirius putting Malfoy in his place ten seconds after meeting him. But for the most part rather forgettable.
