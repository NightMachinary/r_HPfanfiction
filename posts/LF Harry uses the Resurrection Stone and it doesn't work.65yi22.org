Hey guys,

got another request:

I'd like fanfictions where Harry uses the Ressurection Stone (who wouldn't while hunting horcruxes and needing some help and/or insight into Voldemort and the Deatheaters)?) and it doesn't work! Which tipps Harry of that certain people aren't really dead!

Bonus Points: If he tries Dumbledore and his parents and neither of those show up as ghosts!

Additional Bonus: If Harry finds out that the Flammels only faked their death and cooked up another Sorcerers Stone to continue living :)

Thanks in advance - almost forgot the ground-rules:

- no main character slash (so no Harry/Draco or Lucius or Voldemort or Snape etc.)
- at best no Harry/Ginny
- no putting Hermione on any pedestals (no Hermione worship - she's smart, I get that, but she's not the second comming of Merlin!)

So, stage is yours - maybe you've found something like this? :)

Thanks again, bye (for now!)


** "The stage is yours.... /except for this, this, this and this!"/ ;)

But seriously, I would also be interesting in a fic like that!

*** Well, I am sorry but I just don't like slash, H/G (I prefer Harry/Hermione if the ship has to be someone close to Harry, I think their similar backgrounds would make them a greater couple, especially since they don't fight about every little thing! On the other hand: I prefer ships that pair Harry with girls/women he was/is not especially close to in canon, from Daphne Greengrass to Fleur Delacour and everything in between...Hell, well done OCs (female OCs) are something I love, too at least if it's not a character that's added to the "golden trio"...some deatheater's daughter or a magical creature (werewolf - I mean Harry is not biased! - etc.) works well, too) and Hermione worship (where she only has positive qualities and can't do wrong - I mean canon is already borderline Hermione worship IMHO! - is just grating and unless Hermione really takes a pro-active role in the fight (it normally is Harry who does that, the super-intelligent Hermione usually still just follows his lead or tells him to trust the adults...hell, even in canon she dismisses his claim about Malfoy, despite the fact that Malfoy really is the type to think becoming a deatheater is great...well done "brightest witch of your age"...if she was so bright then she'd have helped Harry with Malfoy))

Damned, sorry for the rant :) - yeah, I'd like such a fic, too (thus the request :D)

**** I don't like slash either. I have nothing against gay/lesbian characters, but pairings like Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Lucius, Harry/Tom or Voldemort make me violently ill. Or even Harry/Ron... That has nothing to do with the romantics, but mostly with the characters themselves. The 'turning characters gay'-trope in fanfiction has nothing to do with promoting LGBT, it's just children fangirling about Tom Felton, Alann Rickman or whoever played young Riddle.

I have grown to either like or dislike Hermione in fanfiction. "Brightest witch of blablabla" is a fanon thing that has been taken way out of proportions. I don't even remember it being said in canon by anyone else than Ron or Harry when they need help with homework. Is she clever? Undoubtedly, but since the movies Hermione has become some sort of goddess of knowledge that can't do nothing wrong and is always right.

And while I don't have anything against the Harmony-pairing, I can't stand when her parents are called 'Emma' or 'Dan'.

** I /really/ want to read that, it sums up a lot of wishful-headcannon... these are the days that I wish I could be a good writer for more than 5 minutes of angry-rambling at a time so that, at the least, I could share with you the AU where /Hermione is the second coming of Merlin./

*** I don't think I'd like to read a "Hermione is Merlin 2.0" fanfiction (especially since men and boys are too often portrayed as hormonal/dick-controlled idiots who are nothing without their girlfriends/wives (best example of this would probably that "Family Guy" show...have never seen an episode, but that husband guy gives me an idiot-vibe, more so than Homer Simpson ever did!)...I guess that's revenge for inventing the damsel in distress cliche that dominated western media in the past (a stupid cliche IMHO...I'd love to hit the guy who invented it!))

Yeah, I'd like my resurrection stone fiction, too (I could probably write one, but I've never finished any fanfiction I've started to this date)...especially because I think canon Harry is a baffoon for disposing of the DHs (I'd have kept them all, I might not actually use the wand - or only in my own home so nobody knows I have it - and stone, but I'd keep them save, throwing them away so everybody can steal/find them? Come on, that's a daft idea!)

**** It was a complex fic in which she was the resurrected form of the non-human shapeshifting version of Merlin. I meant it literally not figuratively and I don't think there where any damsel in distress scenes. What you are imagining is probably not what I was imagining. The fact it was a Severus Snape (who would have been Morgana Le'Fey - the dark dabbler with a decent heart) x Hermione fic probably means you wouldn't have read it. Granted, by the time they would have gotten together Hermione would have had the memories of hundreds of years of life... and now I'm rambling and I'm not even sure I make sense to myself but I'll post it anyways.
