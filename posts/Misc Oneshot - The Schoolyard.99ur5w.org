"I suppose I'll bloody well give as good as I get."

So he postured a bit and punched a few in the face. Mostly young Harry got his "ass kicked" and though that did occur, he was quite sure the punches to the abdomen and face were much worse. A couple of weeks later he threw his first head butt.

--------------

A much older boy named Wesley went after Harry right in the foot path out of school. He was eleven to Harry's seven but Harry found it easy to hurt the bully; he punched him in the throat, yanked hard on his ear and ran like hell.

--------------

He grabbed a kid by the hair and caught Piers in the throat. Dudley only just managed to avoid the straight left and gather his friend off the ground. It was the last time Harry had problems with Harry Hunting.

He had to blow the blood out of his nose and gather himself after a low blow but Dudley and Piers had left a friend behind. Harry proceeded to kick the prone boy in the stomach. Not too hard, but a bit too hard.

Harry could run, Harry could fight, and soon enough Harry had a library card. Two years of serenity then until being unceremoniously thrust into Slytherin.

Not two weeks into term, on the way back from dinner, Crabbe and Goyle grabbed Harry as he came into the common room and Malfoy rounded in front to deliver the beating. But he just started talking. Crabbe and Goyle weren't even holding him that well, Harry mused as he changed levels and thrust the thick part of his skull into Goyle's face.

These guys can't even fight Harry realised fully. Crabbe tried to hold him but Harry just used his free arm to beat the boy senseless.

Malfoy didn't make it two steps as Harry jumped on him, crawled up the blond boy 's chest and sat on his stomach. Other housemates began to raise a din in the periphery and someone called Harry a queer even as the blows began to rain down on Malfoy.

Harry stopped quickly, stood quickly. Someone had alerted Professor Snape. His face and hands were sticky with blood, and he bit out, as a sallow-faced adult ducked into the commons, "Stop bleeding on the floor you poncy gits."

They whimpered mightily and Harry kicked Malfoy while he was down.

Harry hooted with excitement as the disarming charm took him, flung him, yet had nothing to take from him. He came up with a smile and a new lease.

"What in the actual fuck Potter? What have you to say for yourself?" Shape said wide eyed.

"Fuck you, I'm Millwall. Professor."

Snape backed up a tic, with wider eyes than before.
