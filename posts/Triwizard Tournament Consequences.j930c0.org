So, is there any conclusive evidence about what happens if a champion were to simply not show up to a task?

Since it states that it is a 'Binding Magical Contract', are there any consequences for a champion to not show up for the task at all?

From what I have seen from the majority of the answers on many forums, people are agreeing upon that the punishment is death.

However, from my perspective, and possibly many others, that is not exactly... a punishment for simply choosing to not participate. Since the tournament itself is deadly and has caused many deaths in the past.

I really don't know what to do. I am trying to get about this, as I am writing something that involves Harry being taken away after the first task, thus not participating in the following tasks.

Will it be too farfetched for me to punish Barty Crouch Jnr to be punished, since he was the one to enter Harry's name in the goblet in the first place?


** Considering the Goblet is supposedly incredibly old and not well understood, or that's the impression I got... I think it's totally fine to have it actually punish Barty Crouch Jr.

It's implied that magic is about focus and will in the books, which fanfiction often attributes to 'intent', as it were.

Harry never intended to be a Champion, didn't put his name in. Barty Crouch Jr did. So the goblet latched onto him, then.

*** I had a theory that powerful magical artifacts can sort of develope a state of semi sentience or personality beyond their original enchantments.

The Sword of Gryffindor was originally enchanted to appear to Godric when needed. But the Sword got bored and decided to appear to any Griffindor in need. It 'wants' to be used by worthy individuals.

The Goblet has been selecting worthy champions for centuries. It's dealt with cheating kids and professors alike. It's not going to be defeated by an overpowered cunfundus charm. But, the Goblet also saw Harry was a worthy Champions and decided to spit his name out anyway, 'Let's see what the kid can do'.

**** that's an interesting take. It's certainly believable that it might still punish Barty jr for his audacity in some way while still spitting out Harry's name

***** Barty's dead and Harry's the TriWizard Champion. Goblet of Fire claims another.

*** Which could be why Crouch Sr insisted Harry took part even.

Was he already imperiused or simply didn't want his child to die? Could be either one, honestly. (The first one, it was the first one and he was already cursed.)

** Much more likely that the consequences were *legal* rather than magical or mortal, or the Goblet, or other magical objects like it would have been used as weapons by wizards to force their enemies into magical contracts against their will and get them killed. It is the only thing that makes sense in-universe.

Harry was being used as bait to draw out whoever entered his name and as a patsy to divert negative attention away from the Ministries and the organizers.

** Relevant passages are Dumbledore's speech in chapter 16 and the following conversation in chapter 17.

IMO the idea of some punishment is a misconstruction. It's never directly stated there is any. It's at most implied by everyone saying the champions are magically bound to "see the Tournament through to the end. [...] There can be no change of heart". Even that is a stretch.

Moody/Crouch speculates "knowing he'd have to compete [...] Maybe someone's hoping Potter /is/ going to die for it". It's more likely he meant in the course of the challenges, not through some punishment. The tournament is already life-threatening. The punishment has to be more severe, else it's not really effective. Anything short of (more) certain death makes competing the obvious choice. Hoping someone dies cause they don't is a ridiculous plan.

Side note: Losing your magic is fanon. Ron mentions only death when discussing unbreakable vows and wand snapping doesn't sound like the consequence of a magically binding contract, unless is happens spontaneously.

Nobody shows any regard for Harry's health in case of him not participating. The two other headmasters bemoan Hogwarts having two champions and McGonagall is only angry about them accusing Dumbledore of cheating. Moody/Crouch calls Karkaroff's threats to leave empty, saying "can't leave your champion now". Nobody seems to consider consequences of backing out of the tournament, they just frame it as impossible.

Also the very next question after calmly asking whether Harry put his name in the goblet is "Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?" If that's such an obvious idea and there's a punishment, then someone like Karkaroff uses a fall guy to enter Krums name, just in case. Probably a similar situation would've come up in more than 100 tournaments held over 700 years.

In the end Dumbledore and Harry agree the later has to compete because he'd "want Hogwarts to win [...] want to do it [himself]".

The most sensible interpretation is some behavior altering effect. The allure, compulsion spells, Imperio, Felix Felicis and love potions are various canon examples. Or make it something as simple as the magical equivalent to shock therapy to give it a more physical manifestation.

Pretty easy to use to create conflict between Harry and those who want to keep him away from the tournament. Or those people are in conflict with themselves, having to indirectly torture Harry to ensure his survival. The lighter variant is Harry having to occasionally catching himself, causing some worry and wholesome conversations with those near him. Having Crouch suffer the consequences sounds like a cheap convenience barely working in a parody, because it avoids conflict instead of resolving it.

** Legal consequences. It seems to be magically binding in that three countries entered a legal agreement which is binding. Crouch continually refers to the rules. I doubt he would have done so if a quasi-sentient object had compelled Harry to compete. There are definitely ways to identify those jinxes.

** I'm no canon expert, but from what I've seen of these arguments, the usual conclusion is that canon doesn't state anything, but the punishment being strict and dangerous to encourage participation in a strictly dangerous tournament makes sense. If the punishment for not going through with something is less dire than going through with it, there's not much point to the punishment, no?

Sometimes those punishments are levied on the person who put the name in, sometimes they're levied on the named person. It varies, but I've not seen any definitive arguments for why it should be one way or the other myself.

I don't really have an opinion either way myself, that's just one consensus I've seen.

The only real remark that I mull over myself is the 'did you get someone else to put your name in?' question. Because that being asked means it probably would've worked, and levying punishment on the named person when anybody could've put the name in seems a little illogical, even for the nonsensical society that Magicals seem to have.

** In most of the fanfics I've read that occur at the time of the Tournament, the punishments serms to be losing one's magic (be it the one who entered tha name or the one whose name was entered).

** No, it's never clarified. Any definite answers are speculation and Fanon.

It is, in that sense, one of the few Canon plotholes (as opposed to all the other imagined ones): From everything we know about consequences of magical contracts, they range from no consequences to death. Thus, for the reader, it's unclear what the result of breaking the contract in this case is -- but still it's never clarified. The mismatch between what we know, and how the characters react (Crouch says he's "bound to participate", and everyone accepts this at once -- even given strong motivation to the contrary, e.g. Mme Maxime, who thinks it's highly unfair --, implying the alternative to not participating is a non-starter) is what makes this one of the weakest points in the book.

As for what to do: Whatever you want. Personally, I would throw out the entire GoF-Voldemort plot. There are only advantages to that.

** I've seen it done that way before and I honestly think it's a valid consequence. Though I've mostly seen loss of magic as a consequence, to the thought that I thought that was canon (it can be hard to remember sometimes)

** Not stated but my headcanon is that you simply cannot avoid not participating. If you try to run or not show up, the Goblet would summon you.
