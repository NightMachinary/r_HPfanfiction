I have been trying to find anywhere to listen to the song Too Much Butterbeer by Stubby Boardman, the lead singer of The Hobgoblins. It was on the Magical Christmas of Magic album Harry and the Potters put out. I can't find it listen-able anywhere even to download. Please help me find this adorable song so I can share it with my partner!
