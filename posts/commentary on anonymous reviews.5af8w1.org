Found this in the bio of an author. it seems appropriate

Please use the reviews and personal messaging to demonstrate your own ignorance, unfamiliarity with empirical data and lack of respect for scientific knowledge-or your inability to suspend disbelief. Be sure to create straw men and argue against things I have neither said nor implied. If you could repeat previously discredited memes or steer the conversation into irrelevant, off topic discussions, it would be appreciated. Lastly, kindly forgo all civility in your discourse . . . you are, after all, anonymous.


** I may be a special case, but I've received plenty of valuable, meaningful reviews from anonymous readers. I'm particularly amused when they sign their reviews with a net name.

The only case where anon reviews grates me is when one has a really good question that I'd like to answer, but can't. If it's a finished story, I'm not likely to add the reply to the next or last chapter or anything.

** ...That just makes me roll my eyes to be honest.

That said, anonymous reviews are stupid and I wish they could be disabled. If you're too lazy to login, you're probably not going to leave a review of any real value either.

*** Yeah, I can honestly say that if I were to bother even reading the profile and happened to stumble across this screed, I wouldn't proceed to a story. I'm here as an escape from the annoyances of everyday life, not to find more of them.

*** I've had anonymous reviews - signed though - which were quite insightful. Sadly, I can't reply to them.

**** I've had some which were nice enough reviews, but none particularly helpful. But yes, I've had loads asking questions or challenging me on things they believe I've got wrong and I just can't respond to them. What's the point? Just sign in, it takes 10 seconds.

***** I've gotten updates on stories and clicking through on my phone, I'm not logged in. These are people I know; I will sign my reviews with my fanfiction name, and they know it's me, etc.

Why not take the ten seconds? It's probably more like thirty for me to go out and in, and I choose to only be industrious and dutiful when I beta. I am unapologetically lazy with the rest of it. That thirty seconds is exhausting. :)

****** But surely any review worth leaving is going to take a while to write out anyway? Or you could come back later. It's not too bad when you leave your proper screen name, but I had someone who just called themselves me that has left a guest review under almost every chapter I've ever written. I appreciate that they're a loyal reader but they ask me questions, accuse me of getting the timeline wrong, and try to engage me in conversation. I guess they want me to mention them in an authors note or something, but I don't understand why they don't just get anew account.

******* But if they know who I am---I'm using my fanfic name, why on earth does it matter if I run a guest review? I also don't really care if I get guest reviews, though. If someone were to write something problematic, I don't feel the need to engage anyway, and if they write something kind, they've just waved a thank you. And if they ask a question, they just won't get it answered.

******** That's great if they know who you are, though it still slows them down responding directly to you, but that is not the case for most guest reviewers. I think certain questions and criticisms do need the author to be able to engage - there needs to be a dialogue for them to improve, or it could be a simple misunderstanding/missed a small moment on the basis of the reader.

I guess I just don't think it's a big deal to login or make an account. It's free and takes very little time and helps the author. Yes, there are some cases where it's fine, but in general guest reviews are just unhelpful at best.

********* I suppose it comes down to an individual vision of the author/reader relationship. If someone takes the time to write a kind, thoughtful review, I feel I owe it to the reviewer to thank them for taking the time to do that, because social niceties keep us from devolving into savages, I suppose. But I do not owe my readers anything else, nor do I think they owe me anything at all. There are loads of people who would argue otherwise, I'm aware.

********** That's the point though. I can't thank them if it's a guest review. I can't create that relationship with them. I would love to thank them, or answer their question.

************* It could be that they don't know any better, in which case being upset they didn't log in is sort of moot, or it could be like people who go on social media and ask for someone to explain something that could be more easily Googled. I just can't imagine wasting energy being upset or disappointed these people don't follow through. I have zero interest in justifying my writing to anyone. If they like it, fantastic. If not, welp, we all have those moments we can't get back, I reckon; I guess I get to be part of someone's lost time. Ask a question, and they better let me get back to them, or else it wasn't really meant to be. Ruminating about it seems like energy misspent.

************** ?? I'm not upset, we're just having a discussion. I certainly don't feel like I've wasted any energy. I stand by my initial thoughts that it really doesn't take that long to log in, and that a useful review is unlikely to come from an anonymous account. I don't see the point of the function. Other sites don't have the function and I can't say I miss it.

*************** There are a lot of recommended stories that I don't read because I can't be bothered to create an account and log in; when I only have a few minutes to read and thus gravitate toward a short fanfic, I don't want to have to jump through hurdles. I can only speak to my writing when I say it's not worth password protection to view it. :)

*** I agree. when I was writing I didn't look at guest reviews at all. as to the rest I tried to taake them in the intent written, Very few did I block, other than Jeremy Crawford. When someone flamed me I backtracked them to see what they had written and published. In almost every case, not a single word.
