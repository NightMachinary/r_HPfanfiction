** linkffn(Blood Bound: A Vampire Story by dementor149; Harry Potter and the Curse of V'Ardian) are both completed, but neither is really new either. In fact, they're both quite old.

Blood Bound I would say is the better of the two despite its age, but the prose tends to run a little dry for my taste, and the tone is quite depressing throughout. YMMV.

Curse of V'Ardian is a bit difficult to read right at the start but straightens out after a few chapters and is somewhat easier to read. It does have a few unfortunate tropes I won't mention but it's old enough they were frankly new when it was written so it can't really be discounted because of them.

Anyways, cheers.

  Harry Potter becomes a vampire. Which struggle will be the most difficult? The war with Voldemort, or the struggle to hold onto his own failing humanity? Takes place right after HBP and makes an immediate detour into the Twilight Zone. Beware a HHr story.

  Harry becomes a vampire and in doing so sets out on the path to fulfilling a second prophecy that carries far darker consequences than the first. Secrets, lies and changing alliances force Harry to trust those he never wanted to. Snape backstory. HarryOC.

** !linkffn(Memories in My Blood) isn't bad, especially for a Harmony fic. The author did gloss over one of the horcruxes, though, as the Deathly Hallows was released in the middle of the fic.

  Hermione helps Harry to adjust after he is turned into a vampire. But as they hunt Horcruxes and dodge both the Ministry and the Death eaters, can Harry defeat Voldemort when he is losing control over his own humanity? Vamp!Harry, HHr. Minor DH spoilers!

** Two of them linked here already, Blood Bound and Memories in My Blood, are still some of the better ones out there. They're kinda what got me into the genre 10 years ago, and I haven't really found anything better in all that time. Not perfect by any means.

** Linkffn(Twists of Fate)

It's hilarious and one of my all time favourites although I don't know if it's finished.

  Harry's parents didn't die that Halloween night, they even had a daughter just after going into hiding, and the Weasleys took care of Harry and his sister after the attack by Voldemort. Now what?
