*********** There is a fun, crack-ish, unfinished DogbartCarroll story (how many redundancies are in that description?) where time-travelling Harry ends up in his infant body on Halloween 1981 with his "twin" Dumbledore (whom MoD Harry has condemned to living the life he'd planned for Harry). Voldie playfully says "peek a boo" when coming up to the cot to kill the children. When Voldie's body is destroyed, not-really-a-baby Harry says, "Got your nose."
