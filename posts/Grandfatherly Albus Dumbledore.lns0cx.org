I've had enough of manipulative, old coot Dumbledore and would like the read something positive.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29158347/chapters/71584359][Hold the Line]] has amazingly written Minerva & Albus friendship. It's the best unexpected fic of 2021 I read so far. Absolutely gorgeous. I recommended this before in the What are you reading post. Minerva centric. Albus seen through her eyes is great.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29439321][The Ballad of the Sugar Plum Fairy]] is a full Albus fic. Funny, angsty, AU. I didn't like it as much as the first fic but it's written well and doesn't have any of the manipulative bashing tropes.

OP if you liked a specific fic in the past, I can see if there's anything in my bookmarks matching your tastes.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** One Fanfic that i can highly recommend is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13438181/1/The-Arcanist-Unspeakable-Mysteries][The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries]]

WARNING! This Fanfic is in no way what you might expect from a Harry potter Fanfic. for example while we might return to Hogwards in the future we have only seen it in the first chapter, after which this story goes Completly on its own track.

In this Fanfic we have demons of different planes, gods, the different worlds of Nordic religion, Elfs, Dwarves and Mindflayers. with harry and Albus in the middle of it all.

​

as for the relationship between Harry and Albus - they start of as more or less a mentor student relationship, although Harry does already have a great amount of knowledge, in some areas even more so than Dumbledore.\\
Throughout the story the relationship between harry and albus changes to a pretty great friendship.

​

another plus for this story is that the author is really inventive in what he portrays and even includes some really great Original Characters, of which some are the support cast for the journey that Harry and Albus take to reach the realm of the elves.

*** This sounds interesting. Can you say what's the central plot of the fic without spoiling anything and how did Harry come to be that knowledgeable?

**** WARNING WALL OF TEXT INCOMING

​

As for how did harry get so knowledgeable... well his parents are alive and he lives with them in potter manor and for old families like the potters its normal that when you gain special knowledge it is put in the family pensive.For some reason that i cant remember lily and james didnt really care much about what harry did so he spend most of his time in the lnbrary where the pensive is stored and he did go through the memories on magic of most of his ancestors and read a great many books.in this story there are "unspeakable mysteries/secrets" for example the reality that demons exist and could tear down the world on a whim.

a long time in the past midgard/earth was cut of from all the other realms besides some special secret passages as to protect the humans from demons.Problem with the demons is that if you do not have special sigils inscribed to your soul you will just go mad and lose your soul should you even see a demon.

because of the pensive memories harry learned of these unspeakable mysteries and learned how to inscribe sigils in his soul to protect him/ strengthen his magic/body/mind and so on.

chapter one, enter riddle possesing someone and summoning a demon and by doing that punch a hole in the protection around midgard.

harry and dumbledore somehow manage to kill the demon (enormously strong by human standards jet still a small fry of only the 4th (?) cycle of hell).

Doing that marks their souls for all of demon kind. now they want to kill them for the insult of an ant killing a god.

​

in hope of getting the inscription on their souls removed and to gain allies now that demons will gradually be able to gain entrance to earth, harry and dumbledore try to find their way to the elves in Alfheim, as they are known to hunt and kill demons for sports.

** You may like I Open at the Close, it shows Dumbledore in the summer between fifth and sixth year, it's a one shot from his perspective, and it shows his feelings towards Harry and some of the staff.

It's a Fleur & Harry story, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6194118/WardenInTheNorth][WardenInTheNorth]]'s take on Dumbledore shines through as its greatest star.
