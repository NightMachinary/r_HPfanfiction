My preferred pairing is HG with almost anyone besides Percy or Ron and I have read a lot of fics where HG/RW tried and failed, or never tried because of another girl or whatever but I don't think I've read one where they weren't together because of Ron's orientation. While I don't care for main pairing slash, as a background I think it could be an interesting dynamic.


** I would love to see a fic where Harry knows and while he isn't gay he covers for Ron as much as he can it'd be awesome.

** Last Christmas by Kittenshift17\\

​

It's a (long) one-shot of Charlie and Hermione, where Ron is gay. It's a great story, especially if you're into the Charlie/Hermione pairing.

  *ONE-SHOT* There's nothing like getting the family together for Christmas, but this year Hermione is nervous. Nervous to see Charlie Weasley, that is. It's been a year since she last saw him and she's not at all sure she's ready for what might happen when she lays eyes on him again. Especially after what happened last Christmas.

** There's a pretty sizable Draco/Ron and Ron/Harry fandom on AO3 that likely has what you're looking for.

I'm partial the the Draco/Ron dynamic personally.

linkao3(8559040) is a cute, short three shot with Draco/Ron.

  There is no time to waste and Draco Malfoy cannot find his shirt - although dating Ronald Weasley had had its advantages, there were also some really big negatives not to be overlooked, for example, he was rapidly running out of shirts that the redhead had not completely ruined in his conquest of Draco's body.Life is hard, but when your friend is Blaise Zabini - self-proclaimed fashion King and the proverbial cat that curiosity murdered - and you're trying to hide your love-life, life gets that much harder.

**** You could say that about literally every pairing Draco is usually coupled with outside of Astoria and maybe Pansy though.

There's a lot of fantastic AUs out there that do a good job of organically making the Ron/Draco relationship go from antagonistic to romantic.

  People say there a lot to say about about how you were raised. For most people, that's true. For example, Jean is a rich snob who was spoiled by his parents. Also, Armin would read dictionaries with his grandpa for fun, and now he's a genius. They also say you always turn into your parents, whether you want to or not. Let's just say I really hope that's not true. _____________________________ The High School AU in which Eren is a damaged sweetheart in hiding and Levi is the only one who see's it.
