  “I don't care what sort of blood you've got!” said Harry fiercely. “Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?”

  “I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with,” said Ernie swiftly.

  “It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,” said Harry. “I'd like to see you try it.”

Page 200 of /Chamber of Secrets/, in the chapter /The Duelling Club/

How did Ernie know about how Harry felt about the Dursleys if Ron and Hermione are his only friends?


** He actually says things pretty often in the early books, without paying attention to whomever might be around to overhear.

The one that springs to mind is on the way home after second year (at the very end---the last three paragraphs---of CoS). They have already left the train and are *in the crowd* on the way to the exit. Harry comments that the Dursleys will be /furious/ that he had multiple chances to die and didn't manage it.

Edited to add: and I see this happens AFTER the scene you mentioned. But it's likely there was another similar one somewhere.

*** The incident you mentioned took place after the quote OP mentioned, but you're absolutely right, Harry almost certainly makes comments in public. At a bare minimum, most of Gryffindor probably knows since he doesn't have any stuff in his room like Ron's Quidditch fan stuff and Dean's football poster. I'd imagine they'd have had off-screen conversations where they talk about where in the Muggle world they're from, too.

  Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.

JK Rowling once said that it had like 1000 students but there's no way that's logistically possible and JK Rowling has the math and logistics skills of a six year old caveman trying to do calculations with tally marks. Harry's year has only 40 students that he's interacting with pretty regularly for /years/ and when you're in a small school environment like that it isn't implausible that you would get a decent familiarity with people.

However, to argue against myself, Harry was hated/ostracized by a significant portion of the school for large chunks of 2nd and 4th years. This could certainly impede making friends. (Hogwarts staff and, more generally, adults in Harry's life failed him on so many levels. You can see how Dumbledore bashing is plausible)

***** It's part of JK Rowling's larger worldbuilding/adaptation issue where she wanted to have a larger and more complex world than she wanted to write or could actually keep track of. It also tracks with the tonal issues, having a world that was fantastical and logistically off is fine in a children's book but less fine if we're expected to take it seriously.

An adjacent issue: Hogwarts just point blank doesn't have enough teachers for the amount of classes that need to be taught and all of the heads of houses are also core subject teachers and sometimes have other jobs on top of that.

Hot take that shouldn't be a hot take but I rarely see: Hogwarts is a /terrible/ school even /without/ the yearly Voldemort attacks.

#+end_quote

I kinda have the headcanon that Remus wasn't allowed by Dumbledore to see Harry when he was a child and then at Hogwarts, Dumbledore asked (ordered) him not reach out for Harry, because we all know that he wanted Harry to feel alone and unprotected so he would sacrifice when the time came.

Also, consider the fact that Remus has a lot of issues with self-esteem and he considers himself a monster. Also the wizarding world is extremely prejudiced against "half-breeds" and Remus wouldn't be able to raise a small child because for starters, he barely managed to get a job. Also, when he WAS there in POA he tried to help Harry the most (everyone knew abt his problem with dementors) and when he found out he and the others were with Sirius, he went to aid them.

Now, Mcgonagall is just a stern professor, distant. To her credit, in GOB she was the most vocal about not letting him compete in the tournament AND she was adamant (albeit not going against Dumbledore in the end) not to let Harry with the Dursleys.

Dumbledore is just a disappointment. Honestly, I adored him as a kid, but now at 21 I just can't understand how ppl still think he's the greatest man. He KNEW Harry was being abused by the Dursleys, let him there, didn't explore ANY other options, let Sirius rot in Azkaban despite being Chief Supreme of the Wizengamot. I mean, even if Sirius WAS guilty, he got SNAPE a trial, but didn't do it for a man he KNEW, who fought by his side. And the amount of times he let Harry face unbelievable danger?? And leading him to believe bhe SHOULD die? Thats a big no no

***** I've never actually gotten anywhere in terms of writing fanfic and a big part of that is that I'm so neurotic that during one of my many failed attempts I decided to take on the maddening task of creating class schedules for all of Hogwarts before I actually even started writing.

If I remember correctly I started out with the high estimation and then pared it down to as low an estimate as I could get and it was still nearly impossible for all the classes to get taught because Hogwarts has criminally low staffing levels. Unless the staff are secretly using time turners to get more teaching time in, Hogwarts had been operating at /beyond/ a skeleton crew for basically all of canon that we see. And that's not even touching on their other duties.

Harry's year canonically has 40 students though I think --- 10 for each house. How convenient that they just happened to be personality sorted into even groups!

******* I've always wonder anyway what their class table is. They are always taught with another house so they would have 14 classes at a time. But there are only 13 subjects. So two houses would always have a free hour. 2 actually if we go with, how I know it, 15 classes in a week. Not to forget that usually they only pick two of the selected subjects so the majority has only 10 subjects a week. And Astronomy is taught in the evening/night so that makes it 7 subjects at day time for the 1./2. years and 9 for the rest. Also since a week has 7 days it's the entire year in one class

5 subjects are only taught from 3rd year so 1st and 2nd years only have 7 day-time subjects a week and, if we go with how I know it, having 3 classes a day they would have had every class in 2 and 1/3 days. Of course, in our world, we have some classes 2 times a week but what about the later years? They can't all have the selected subjects at the same time after all. And it would be idiotic if only the first 2 years had all subjects 2times a week but not the others.

The most obvious solution is afternoon classes so that is the only way I think it could work not having to use a time turner.

I stopped paying attention to the things JK Rowling said even way before her current role as TERF twitter goblin precisely because of things like this, you can use the things that she's said as a general guideline and the Harry Potter world is well poised to explore a lot of really interesting themes but if you take a serious and cohesive look at her world building (especially the math/logistics parts) for more than about ten seconds it starts falling apart at the seams.

She's like my DM who last session (in D&D) was like “oh you know how you got a bunch of money from that boss you just beat and now you obviously want to buy a ton of healing potions? Well I'm now realizing that full heal potions are kind of OP and so for balance purposes healing potions are now 15x as expensive”

** Maybe the Golden Trio are not the only people who have tea with Hagrid. I'm guessing most of the school gossip starts with the giant man who can't keep secrets...

How else do you think everyone in the Wizarding world knows Harry has a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt? After bringing Harry to Dumbles, Hagrid probably went to join all the festivities for the fall of the Dark Lord and after his 4th barrel of ale, started talking about taking Harry from the destroyed cottage.

I could see Lavender Brown and others having tea with Hagrid and chatting him up for the latest gossip about the teachers and things happening in Hogsmede... Or just stuff about Harry and Ron.

** Ron and Hermione are presumably not his only friends, they're just his best friends and the only ones that are part of his adventures at that point. I think it's safe to assume that he speaks to many other students regularly and there's no reason to think he hides that he lives with muggles or that he dislikes them. Even if he doesn't talk to anyone besides Hermione and the Weasley's, it's reasonable to think that they talk to other people and that Harry would come up.

I prefer to think he's joking and actually there are only made-up stories, because literally the only two people alive knowing this are Dumbledore and Harry and Harry just woke up. Then again, maybe Dumbledore is terrible gossip =D

Anyway, yours at least has the potential way of Ron having told someone, or Harry having told someone off-screen. I don't see why he would, but that's more accurately to say, I don't see why /I/ would do that, and maybe, for Canon!Harry, the question is why he /wouldn't/.

**** There is that, but they'd have to know from somewhere, too -- there were no ghosts, portraits or other semi-alive things in the chamber with the mirror. It must come down to Dumbledore talking about it, in the end. And then either someone or something overheard, or whoever Dumbledore told spread it.

If Dumbledore told no one, I don't see how anyone could know. Which I'd assume is the case, given he declares it a "complete secret".

Of course, Dumbledore needn't have been serious. But on the face of it, his statement doesn't make sense. Then again, maybe that was the point, this /is/ in the context of the Fred and George sending toilet seats.

***** I think "complete secret" doesn't necessarily mean he told no one. Secrets can be held by groups as well as individuals. Rather it implies he hasn't told anyone outside the group of people who should be told.

I expect he told the staff (who were all involved in protecting the stone) and then that conversation led to the spread.

My definition of "complete secret" doesn't involve the entire staff. Three may keep a secret if two of them are dead etc., but yes, that aside, that is probably how it worked, if we assume people /do/ know.

It's semantics at this point, but for me, either the "complete secret" is tongue-in-cheek, or "the whole school knows" (as in, anyone knows anything that is true) is.

** Even if he never told anyone but Ron/Hermione about it, it only takes one person to overhear that conversation and a day later everyone might hear about it.

If there's one thing I remember from school, it's that kids will either chatter endlessly about something until they've dissected it for all it's worth or never ever say even a single word about it for whatever reason.

And saying stuff in corridors can make it echo real good. There's a reason "Don't discuss personal shit outside closed offices" (paraphrased, of course) is usually an element of confidentiality or safeguarding policy in mental health services.

- Fred and George saved him with a flying car and he had bars on his windows. Not saying they'd blab out Harry's awful home life but I imagine they'd told the story of getting Harry from his muggle house with the flying car a few times.

- Percy knows. And with all his love notes to Penelope that summer, I'm sure he dropped a mention of Harry Potter arriving on their doorsteps.

- He stays at Hogwarts for Christmas. He wasn't rare in that regard since the Weasleys stay with him but still could be another point of enforcing that rumor.

I'd be sure to punish myself by locking myself back into my cupboard after the fact, though. Freaks need to sleep in their rooms. A few days without food will not have been the worst I've had, by that point.
