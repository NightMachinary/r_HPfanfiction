Guys, this story series is AMAZING. It has so little attention and it break's my heart, because it's quality writing.

So I'm taking it upon me to advertise it. You're welcome!

** In my opinion the hook isn't great and the story/sentence structure reads really awkwardly, it probably gets better but I couldn't get past the first chapter (again, just my own opinion)

*** I see your point, and hey, your opinion is 100% valid!

I was immediately pulled in because the first story in the series I've read was Gadding With Ghouls, which is very amazing, and has great pull. Afterwards, I've found the first ones, and reading them as a "prequel" kind of feeling was entertaining. But I guess I can see how beginning chronologically can tire a person out... The "action and excitement" sorta begins in Gadding With Ghouls.

Thanks for commenting.
