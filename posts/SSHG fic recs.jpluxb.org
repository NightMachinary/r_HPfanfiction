** Hayseed has written [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/07/01/master-fic-list-harry-potter/#more-666][a number of SS/HG stories]]. It's not my favorite genre, but I did enjoy Ordinary People. Hayseed also recommends [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com][Ashwinder]] and [[https://sshg-exchange.livejournal.com][sshg-exchange]] as sources, but I know nothing about them.

** I am so happy that you posted this. I am in the exact same situation. So, I hope I will learn many gems from his thread. I would suggest Unwritten Future by Aurette.

Here is the link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8455295/11/][Unwritten Future]]

*** All three looks like great suggestions. Read “The Poison Garden” and it was my favorite SSHG ever! Do you have any other recs specifically like this one?

I will be reading the first two recs starting now. Thanks soo much!

**** There are a few SSxOC fics I also like quite a lot but I'm not sure if you'd be interested in those? As for SSHG, I'm a really picky reader and most of the others I read felt either a bit rushed (they were immediately in love, no build whatsoever) or they were a bit too slow for my taste. I'm a fic snob, haha! But I'll dig a bit and see if there are others I can recommend.

**** linkffn(Darling Death Eater by Recreational Potions)

linkffn(Letters to the Dead by YesItsAWorkDay)

linkffn(Letters to the Living by YesItsAWorkDay)

linkao3(Second Life by Lariope)

linkao3(Do Not Go Gentle by senlinyu)

The second one is more of a sequel to the third one, which is still in progress. But it's superbly written. (EDIT: added one last fic. Now I'm done, lol)

Hermione is an adult in all of these. I would never read nor rec anything where this isn't the case.

***** Amazing list! Thank you so so so much. Cannot wait to read all of them. Ah, I know what you mean. I also definitely prefer the ones in which she is an adult. I do not like unequal power dynamics.

  Hermione is forced to lead a double life when she agrees to Dumbledore's plan to protect Professor Snape. Follows a (mostly) canonical timeline through books 6 and 7. Warning for student/teacher relationship, though Hermione is of age.

  After Hermione finished explaining, there was a long silence while Harry tried to think of what to say. Unfortunately, Ron spoke first. "But isn't he like...old enough to be your grandad?" Ron asked. "Ronald! Don't be ridiculous! Severus is ten years younger than your parents." "And the same year as my parents," Harry offered, "so he's old enough to be her dad, not her grandpa."

  The war is over. The light won. But it isn't happily every after for everyone. Hermione is struggling to come to terms with "after," and her grief over the death of a certain snarky potions master... who may or may not be dead. Dark tone/themes. Non-canon. Please R&R. All characters belong to the lovely JK Rowling. COMPLETE

#+begin_quote
  A marriage law is in the works, but Hermione has no intention of complying. There are just a few loose ends she wants to tie up, and then she's prepared to leave everyone she knows behind. For good if necessary. Of course things don't go according to plan, especially when it comes to a certain snarky potions master. Sequel to Letters to the Dead. Rated M. I (sadly) own nothing.
