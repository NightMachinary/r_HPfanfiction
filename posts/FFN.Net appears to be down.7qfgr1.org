Does anyone know what's going on? I tried to load up my next chapter, and suddenly it isn't working for me. All other websites load fine.

**** Sorry but I was happy the Steelers lost. Although it sucks even more in that it looks like the Patriots will win again this year. Oh well. I guess when you pay off the refs...

** For all who have been trouble with this, it's been sort of random with how it's working for me. I like to make 3 or 4 tabs with the same link and make a game out of which one loads first so that I can actually read the story.

**** Okay good! Because my best friend Achille works /very hard/ on his Parselmouth of Gryffindor story, and it is a very /good story/ and I love to read it, so yes he would be upset if it went away and so would I! :(
