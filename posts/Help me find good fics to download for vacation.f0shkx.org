Seeking recommendations for fics I can download and read on vacation! Some stuff I've read and liked lately includes Changeling, Tea and No Sympathy, This Calls for a Toast, etc. I'm open to F/F and M/M, with some exceptions, below.

Some of the things I'm interested and not interested in are below. Thanks in advance!

Likes:

-Well-written, literary/novelistic style

-AUs with interesting premises

-Women being awesome, focus on female characters

-Time travel

-Interesting pairings

-Interesting plot that's not all about romance or smut

-Luna

-Ginny

-Tonks (not paired with Harry)

-Non-canon compliant or mostly canon compliant in interesting ways

-Founders

Please don't recommend:

-adult/minor relationships

-rape/non-con (mentions of off-screen okay, but no rape scenes)

-power trips/wanky power fantasies

-sexism/racism/bigotry

-Greengrass sisters

-Snape as protagonist


** I was just rereading [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]] and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War by Mrs_Granger]] and I have been enjoying it tremendously. It is probably too canonical for your taste, but I would still recommended it to your attention.

** Here's a random selection of fics I've enjoyed. And when I say random, I mean random.

linkao3(2352896; 12424344; 1124404; 7944847; 15068012)

linkffn(12005496; 10216252, 8148717, 3124159, 11027125; 12005755; 2857962)

I'd like to add [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/755028][this series right here]] but it violates the Snape as a protagonist rule. I also dislike him, and hate that he's part of the primary pairing (even if the pairing isn't a huge part of the story)... but the series itself is goddamn amazing so I deal with it.

  Caught in the backlash of Voldemort's Killing Curse, Harry is thrown through time to a world so very different from his own.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** Girl, you had me hooked on Time travel. There's this one series it starts off with.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10021610][Draco Malfoy and the Resurrection Stone]]

by YouAreMyHappilyEverAfter on Ao3

Idk how to work the bot- Draco travels back to first year and befriends Harry. The second book has this really interesting premise where Draco gets possessed by the Diary instead of Ginny, I really liked that.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1342282][Draco Does it All Again]]

by Emma_with_her_head_in_the_clouds on Ao3

Another time travel fic and another series fic where Draco goes back to first year yet again, this time he's sent back by the centaurs to ‘fix everything'

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4304088][History Repeats Itself]]

By tragicomic_relief on Ao3

I really like this one where Draco travels back in time, it's got Harry/Draco slash and Draco gets sorted into Ravenclaw this time. The actual slash doesn't start until a tad bit later into their third year or maybe fourth, featured Pinning!Harry, Oblivious!Draco and Draco's actually on Ron's good side!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13094601][The Night We Met]]

By aforallyyyyyyx on Ao3

Draco goes back in time to first year, gets sorted into Gryffindor all whilst trying not to be a dick about it.

I have a problem with Draco and time travel.

By DracoWillHearAboutThis on Ao3

Okay this ones pretty different with a good premise. Draco gets a letter from the future basically telling him not to be a prick and be nice to Harry in the robeshop, which results in everything going differently, Draco befriends the golden trio and it does feature some beautifully written Pinning!Draco with some Pinning!Harry.
