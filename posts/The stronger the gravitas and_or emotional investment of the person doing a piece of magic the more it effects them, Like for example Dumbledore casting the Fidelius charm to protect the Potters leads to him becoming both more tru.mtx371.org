Casting the Patronus charm leading to a Person become More cheerful and Protective.(thinking about both harry at the end of the year and Dumbledore casting it at the Quidditch match to Protect his Students, Something that he has been show to feel very strongly about,I know Dumbledore has been casting the spell for decades before this but I have trouble thinking of a Time he could have been more Emotional invested Casting the Spell.)


** I love this, and it's my personal headcannon that this sort of thing is what makes the unforgivables unforgivable. They warp the user so they are quicker to kill, torture, and impose control on others.

*** That's not headcanon. Or rather, it's headcanon that this is what makes them so Unforgivable, we know what makes them Unforgivable and it's not that, but the part where they warp you is very true.

Snape outright confirmed in HBP when he was teaching defense that the Dark Arts are a mutating and everchanging thing, the nature of the magic changes and it in turn changes the people who wield that magic. Those who touch the Dark Arts become stained by them.

As for why the Unforgivables are "unforgivable," Crouch!Moody told us that, or inferred it very strongly. It's an automatic life sentence because to even cast an Unforgivable is impossible unless you truly mean it and would experience joy and pleasure in inflicting that spell on your target. It's not like a sword, or a knife, or a gun, or even most other types of magic, where you could "accidentally" hit someone with it. There are no accidents with the Unforgivables. To successfully cast the killing curse de-facto means you are guilty of murder. You have proven your own guilt by being able to cast the spell at all: thus, under traditional English common law (right to a trial, right to a jury of your peers, right to representation, innocent until proven guilty), there's no need to even try you. You convicted yourself.

There is some inconsistency here: if we take what Moody claims at face-value, it explains a great deal about the curses and why magical Britain considers them unforgivable. Especially if we combine it with Snape's own explanations of the dark arts. But the problem is that we see dark wizards like Voldemort freely throwing these spells around, which seems to be impossible. It would be impossible to conjure forth real and genuine hatred of every random person you met.

I have seen many fanfiction writers get around this by using Moody's explanation and inferring a loophole in the rules: you can use the killing curse (as an example) on anyone as long as you hate at least one person enough to take true pleasure from murdering them. In other words, Sirius or Lupin could cast the Avada at anybody as long as they were thinking of Pettigrew when they did it.

And that's fair. That's a fair assumption of how it might work. I don't disagree with that or have a problem with it. But, a long time ago, after thinking it through, I came up with an alternate idea. And it comes from something Dumbledore said about Voldemort. Because Dumbledore claimed that Riddle had undergone "numerous dark and dangerous transformations" to become what people know as Voldemort. What dark transformations were those? What did they do, why were they dangerous, and if they were dangerous, why would Riddle risk doing them if his goal was to live forever?

I have what I think is an educated guess. We know that power levels aren't real in Harry Potter: the magical core stuff isn't real, that's just fanon. A perfectly cast Stupify by Lavender Brown is just as strong as a perfectly cast Stupify by Dumbledore. So it's not like Voldemort did rituals to make himself stronger. So what did he do?

I suspect there are dark rituals or transformative spells that you can do that allow you to "jailbreak" your mind, and allow you to use certain dark arts like the Unforgivables freely. They modify your mind so you always meet the criteria for them. Think about it. If what Moody told us is true, and what Snape told us is also true, and we take that together, it makes a disturbing amount of sense, doesn't it? It's even relevant to the OP topic. It's a ritual or spell you can cast on yourself to give yourself a stronger affinity for certain kinds of spells, /for a price./ It's like ritually scarring yourself, or trepanning where you cut a hole in the top of your head. The Dark Arts mutate and change, so you mutate and change yourself to match them.

This is why Bellatrix can throw around the Cruciatus so freely: she jailbroke her mind so she will always enjoy the suffering of anyone she comes across. Voldemort can use all three freely, so he must have broken jailbroken his mind three times, each time changing it so he can meet the requirements to cast each of the Unforgivables on any particular person he happens to meet. It's why the people who can freely use the Unforgivables are all so unhinged; they unhinged /themselves/ in a deliberate and controlled manner.

That would most definitely qualify as a dark and dangerous transformation. It is dark, the very nature of it is dark according to Snape: you're changing yourself to be more like the dark arts you practice, deliberately stepping towards them and making your own mind more mutable and shifting. And it would be very, very dangerous. One mistake, and you're a lunatic or braindead.

Like I said, I can't prove this. It's supposition. We are never given a real explanation for how certain dark witches and wizards can freely use the Unforgivables. But it makes sense. It is canon /compliant/, I think. At the end of the day, that's honestly the best we can probably hope for with a lot of things.

Plus, I think it's really cool. It's a cool idea and I like it. And it's relevant to the topic at hand, the idea of using magic to modify yourself so you can more freely or easily use certain kinds of magic.

**** That's a pretty great explanation. Honestly it's been so long since I read the actual books that I find I'm losing the line between actual cannon and FanFiction.

I think it's particularly tragic too, that repeated use can and will always urge greater and greater indulgence in the dark arts. For example, Sirius AKs Peter, and thinks it's fine because it was only that one person he hated enough to make it work. But it's insidious enough that very slowly he finds it within him to hate others as well. And that's what I think Voldemort signifies, unchecked dark arts usage to its natural conclusion.

Although I wonder what sort of effect along those lines the hot crux would have had? I think it was in Prince of Slytherin where a necessary component to keeping a horcrux in existence for yourself, was that at any given moment you had to fully believe that of every other person was worth murdering if it kept you alive for even one more second. Something that perhaps only a sociopath like Voldemort would be truly capable of.

**** I've seen it in a lot of Fanfics that hatred is for the KC and after a while when you can no longer summon hatred against "just another person" you can cast it with apathy. This might be because the KC neuters empathy. Additionally the imperious presumably doesn't have a required state of mind to cast since Harry could in Gringotts at his first attempt, but could, in addition to being the most powerful mind control magic, also increase your desire to dominate everything around you.
