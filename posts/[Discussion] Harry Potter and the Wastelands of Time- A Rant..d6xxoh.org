** I remember reading the first few chapters and being intrigued by the narrative style but also thinking they had set themselves with a super low margin for error based on how they were telling their story and the stakes they had established.

I bailed out after six or seven chapters where it already felt (to me) like it was dragging and I saw it was over 260k+ words.

It reminded me a lot of the movie /Edge of Tomorrow/ in the tone it was trying to set. The movie succeeded because (for the most part) it stuck to the task and avoided pretension. The narrative style of the story (for me) seemed to revel in it's pretentiousness and delaying.

**** Yeah, that's a shame because it is possible to develop a relationship/romance within the context of the story and the tasks the characters are trying to accomplish. Edge of Tomorrow did a great job of bringing the two main characters 'together' within the context of the main narrative, not in spite of it.

** Everyone usually loves this fic but I find it as his weakest. Now, his Hero trilogy, holy fuck it's epic. If you have the patience, I would recommend it. It's a journey that isn't bogged down by romance for the most part and just gets nuts towards the end of the second book.

**** Book 1 is definitely slow up until the end. Its basically a story to set up characters and power scales to be honest. The kinda crazy stuff starts at the end of Book 1 and just gets absolutely bananas halfway in Book 2. Book 3 just basically sets up almost Stephen King/Dragonball mashup that gets absurd in the best way possible.

The writing is much better in this than his other work too. It never gets tropey too badly either.

** It's one of those that I think is going to be incredibly dependent on the reader. I found it a lot of fun to read - it helps that I found it well written, and there's a balance of stuff happening and more mundane elements.

However, I don't mind not knowing everything. I found going along with the ride a fun one - in your case, you didn't. It'll happen.

I've had to give up on a lot of recommended fics that I've seen on here because of things that I just couldn't stomach that day - usually unexplained/badly explained character change from Harry, fairly bad descriptions of certain characters, creepy/cringey writing, etc.

But this is where I'm going to heavily disagree with you - the categorization of it as /awful/. Wastelands of time is a /great/ fic... for those who enjoy the way it's written. I'm not going to call fics like linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) or linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) or linkffn(Hail Odysseus) /awful/ fics... because a lot of people enjoy them for the fact that they're good /for them/. The elements that make me unable to enjoy/continue them are not ones that make them objectively awful for everyone - and if some people don't find those dealbreakers, that doesn't mean that they're wrong for enjoying the fic. I'd reserve /awful/ for those that are, well, more objectively awful - terrible writing, falls on its face, inconsistent, disgusting, whatever. It takes something more special for me to call something awful :P

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

short summary for those fics is that what happened in the first Thor movie wasn't Odin's first attempt to humble his son. that James Potter was Thor. and Odin was forced to remove his memories of that life when he went insane with rage after his and lily's deaths. to keep him from basically destroying earth. later, Loki restores his memories and a bunch of stuff happens.

also, Scarlet Witch is Harry's godmother. and the biological mother of Hermione (with John Constantine as the father) who was given up for adoption. and Harry Dresden is one of the secondary characters due to dating and being the apprentice of the new Sorceress Supreme.

oh, and the Phoenix Force is one of the Endless, also known as Destruction.

** Wastelands of Time is an amazing, brilliant story in all of the ways that stories can /be/ amazing and brilliant. It's easily one of the top Harry Potter fanfics. In worldbuilding, characterization, grammar, plot, and sheer quality of the English language it stands above all but a very few stories in the entire fandom.

If you can't overlook Harry Potter having the charm of a James Bond? Too bad, this isn't a canon-compliant story, go find something else to read.

Heartlands of time, which your piss-poor review somehow managed to encapsulate, is admittedly a far weaker story. The author stopped regular updates and somehow managed to lose the yarn of what made for a good story. Oh well! But that has no bearing on Wastelands.

  Such as Harry constantly monologuing about having so little time to save the world, then going on a long ass vacation with Fleur all over France. I mean, you keep bitching about how every single second is important, yet you're hanging out with Fleur for several days on end while Voldemort makes progress in finding the "Most Powerful Society to Ever Exist".
#+end_quote

You seem to have missed the part of the fic that covers Harry's backstory, i.e. the accumulation of lifetimes worth of previous attempts that at one point drove him to despair. The plot shows that Harry dwells on the good moments with the people he loves because he knows from experience that otherwise he risks losing hope and/or losing even more of his fraying sanity.

Also, the fic makes it clear that Harry knows from experience the exact time frame when certain crucially important things need to happen. Some periods require Harry to accomplish a lot very quickly, and in other periods Harry has to just mark time until events line up in such a way that he can act again. During those down-times Harry makes the most of the little time he has with the people he loves.

#+begin_quote
  Cronos and Rhea? Still no clue who/what the fuck they are.
#+end_quote

Actually, the plot gives you plenty of clues to figure this out by the end of the first fic. Similarly, the backstory of Atlantis is mostly covered in the first fic, along with most of the answers to the mysteries that were built up over the course of the plot. The final moments introduce a few new mysteries, but the climax mostly resolved all of the previous ones.

The partial resolution and hold-over of a few unresolved problems is fairly standard for fiction, even published novels, so it's not like the author has committed some horrific writing crime the way you describe.

Why did an army, which supposedly destroyed a society so much more powerful than our own succumb so easily to Harry?

All explained (or, in the case of -edit, corrected names- Chronos and Saturnia, at least heavily hinted at) in the fic.

  Everyone has their own tastes. Reading reviews about this story, I was stoked because it seemed to be brilliant. I was expecting a nonstop ride through ancient ruins, a desperate fight against an unstoppable evil. I wasn't expecting countless chapters of Fleur and Harry hanging out.

That's fair. It makes sense to be disappointed in the romance if that's not your cup of tea, and/or the romantic bits slowed down the pacing of the action. Other time-travel fics in this fandom maintain a faster pace throughout (for example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12820671/1/][All Our Yesterdays]]). I ended up liking the non-action parts of this fic because those scenes explore the heavy mental and emotional toll on the time traveler in a way I haven't seen done in any other story.

I can understand why people dislike the Fleur/Harry or Harry/Tonks bits because in the beginning I didn't care for those parts either. It's easy for Harry to come across as a creepy ladies' man because he is so familiar with them at a time when they have no memories of knowing him that well. Early on those parts don't seem to tie into the broader plot, so it can feel like a pointless detour, but as the story progressed I enjoyed seeing the character development and hints about Harry's history in those more peaceful scenes.

****** Chronos:

Chronos /is/ Harry from the future who traveled to the past at some point after he was cursed with godlike time-related abilities by the petal shard. This was pretty obvious to me near the end of the fic after the various conversations between Harry and Chronos show how similar they are, and especially the scene in which Chronos tries to save Fleur. In the final few chapters even Harry keeps thinking to himself about the similarities between them, as if he is beginning to suspect the truth but trying to suppress it. Both are ancient and mad yet appear young, same smile, similar humor, they occasionally complete each-other's thoughts, etc.

  It's one of the most absolutely awful fics I've ever read. It's boring, unnecessarily long, suffers from poor pacing, and an insane narrator.

Wow I think you also perfectly described HPMOR!

** I'm one of those weirdos that refuses to read any story over 250k words. My theory is, if they haven't ended it by then, they don't get the concept of pacing and don't know how to write endings. For reference, the average novel is 80k-100k words long, so 250k is nearly long enough for a standard trilogy.

*** I take two issues with this.

1) Just because a story is long doesn't mean it's meant to be one book. Fanfiction, by its nature, allows for everything to be posted under one title if the author desires. This means that authors oftentimes do post a series of novels they themselves acknowledge to be separate to the same single title. Two examples off the top of my head being Prince of the Dark Kingdom and Antithesis. Further, because of this aspect of fanfiction, there's no general need to separate a story into individual books. If the author wants to write everything as one continuous block there's no reason they can't if it works for their story.

2) I don't think it's fair in this case to use the standards of professionally published works when judging fanfiction. Publishing companies are out to make a profit and that is going to affect what is written and published. The size of the average novel that is published doesn't necessarily tell you anything about what the ideal size is of a high quality novel, it tells you publishing companies' preferred novel length. If anything, we should assume that the ideal length would be longer than the average published length and that the distribution of good lengths is likely wider than what we see published, as publishing companies' will obviously prefer shorter novels to cut costs.

*** I agree. Honestly I'm super suspicious of any fic over 100k. Much higher than that and its probably a long snoozefest with nothing actually happening. Bonus points if its abandoned at half a mil because the author realized there was absolutely no way it would ever end.

**** It's kind of funny, but I'm the exact opposite. Anything under 100k and I'm rarely interested. There isn't enough time to get invested in the story if the whole thing is less than 300 pages. I guess it just depends on the type of reader you are. I read a lot of fantasy, so I tend to enjoy long series.
