I've just finished reading nonjon's A Black Comedy and Browncoat, Green Eyes and have realized I much prefer stories where the main character is actually happy. Many of the other fics I've read have the main characters angry, vengeful, depressed or confused and it just gets me down. Anyone have recommendations of other stories where the main character enjoys themself?

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/][Harry the Hufflepuff]], by BajaB ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7330591/1/][Sequel]])

*Summary:* Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/thetreacletart/ISWAST01.html][It Started with a Simple Tonic]], by TheTreacleTart

*Summary:* There's a young girl knocking on Severus Snape's door. She's got black hair tied in a tight bun at the nape of her neck, squarish glasses sitting on her nose, and a bit of a problem.

Also, do you object to slash? Because I know an excellent AU James/Sirius fic that's like happiness bottled. One chapter had me grinning so hard it brought tears to my eyes, and it was with happiness for the characters and their situation rather than particular humour.

**** Heh, alright then. It's actually part of a [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/48782][series]] and the first two are a little (honestly just a little) sad because of unrequited love, but they're only short one-shots and the third one is the bottled happiness.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations]] has this sort of vibe. There are still difficulties and tension, of course, but by and large I get the impression that these are kids being kids.

#+begin_quote
  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year.
