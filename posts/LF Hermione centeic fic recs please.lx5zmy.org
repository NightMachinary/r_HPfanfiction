Hi. First and foremost id like to thank everyone for what help is able to be given. In relatively new to posting on reddit so forgive me if i titled this wrong or am posting in the wrong place.

I'm looking for some fic recs and am simply overwhelmed by the sheer number available to me. Its been a while since ive read for the HP fandom and I'm looking to dive back in. Currently im in the mood to read some Hermione centric fics...with a few specific caveats. The tropes im looking for are:

Hermione is sorted into slytherin. Preferably without going dark. I've read all the major ones that get reced all the time so if anyone knows of any hidden gems id love to try them.

Hermione cemtricnfics that focus on worldbuilding. In example, politics, family magics, etc. Again any hidden gems that dont get recd often would be appreciated, but also the major players in this category too. I havent read many alongvthese lines sonthere might be ones ive missed.

Adopted Hermione. Now this one id prefer stories where she is raised from a young age by either one of the mauraders, mcgonagall or snape, or any family really so long as she doesnt go dark. Speaking of dark id rather not have any fic recs where she is Bellatrix's daughter or Voldemort's. Most of those I've come across are not to my taste. Though i would consider making an exception if its especially well written. The age stipulation is also negotiable.

Finally I'd like to find some inheritance fics. Well written ones. Please spare me the long detailed lists of monies and powers and properties that only serve to increase word count and chapter length. I do not care for those types but instead am searching for ones where the inheritance bits are more nuanced. I like the idea behind the trope i just want to see it better written. If any such fics exist.

Oh! Pairings! No slash please and no Harry or Ron. Unless its Harry and Ron. My main pairings that I read for Hermione are with Draco, snape, sirius, remus. Not necessarily in that order. I also read for victor, Neville and cedric.

The tropes of course dont all have to be present in each fic, im just trying to cast a wider net so to speak. Thanks once again for any help you can give.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.
