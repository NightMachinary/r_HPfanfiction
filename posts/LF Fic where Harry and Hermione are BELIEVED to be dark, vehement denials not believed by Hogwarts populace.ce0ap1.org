** Hmm...I just got a mental image of a fic where, believing that Harry has gone dark, the denizens of Hogwarts all line up to try and redeem him and turn him good.\\
Countless girls and boys trying to seduce him, upper-year students and teachers talking about ethical philosophy, and Slytherins teaming up to undermine Harry's rivals to curry favour with the 'rising dark lord'.\\
Special credit to Ron Weasley who, to try and stop his best friend from losing his light, orchestrates his own philanthropic organisation to right all the wrongs of the wizarding world he can and prove that good is superior to evil.

"Hermione?"\\
"Yes, Harry?"\\
"I never should have doubted you, going as Herpo the Foul for Halloween was a great idea."

This is a one-shot with the school being thoroughly shamed after beating up on a supposed dark Harry.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

** Unfortunately incomplete but still one of my favorites [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922890/1/][Harry and Hermione Starring in The Digital-Revolution]] Has some of this in it, though in some ways it's Internal in this fic, Harry is super afraid he's going to go dark.

I have seen it in a bunch of Manipulative Dumbledore fics where he tries to make it seem like Harry is dark so he can have more control but the only one I can currently remember is [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Bobmin's Sunset Over Britain]]

  Being petrified and having one's absurdly lucky best friend kill a big snake really gets a girl thinking. Where could they go from there? A midnight conversation leads to a promise to do better, regardless of breaking one, two, or a dozen laws along the way. With a definitely safe wand, allies expecting her to be the next dark lady, and a free summer, what is a girl to do?

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals on another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
