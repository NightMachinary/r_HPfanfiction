No slash please.

I'm thinking something along the lines of The Merging by Shaydrall (my favorite story of all time).

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** The Refiner's Fire, by Abraxan: linksiye([[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=8104&textsize=0]])

Harry comes down with a "disease" that purifies and strengthens the magic of any who survive it. He's still Harry. Dursley-abuse is, really, no more than canon - making the world think he's a delinquent and just kinda not caring. Canon ships, written pre-Deathly-Hallows.

--------------

This Means War, by Jeconais: [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/]] (no bot-friendly link possible, sorry)

Unabashed crackfic that takes "Harry is ridiculously powerful" and kinda runs with it. Harry can literally do anything as long as he thinks it should be possible. Heavily Harry/Ginny shipping (even heavier than my first rec, and that one's on /SIYE/). Written pre-HBP, with some downright AU elements (such as Sirius not falling through the veil. The Dursleys barely show up at all, and when they do it's to give Dudley some much-needed character growth.

** Hmm... Harry and Ginny together are uniquely powerful in The Meaning of One, linksiye([[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833]]). I really like it for giving depth to each of the Weasleys as they react in different ways to the bond between Harry and Ginny; none of them is a caricature, they each have both strengths and mistakes. (The Dursleys don't feature for very long before Harry gets pulled out, pretty much literally.)
