So the details I do remember are pretty vague and I tried searching but was bombarded with every story of Harry in Slytherin on the internet.

What I remember of the fic was that there were spells in the Slytherin dorms that kept the water from the lake out. Whoever was the head of Slytherin (I don't think it was Snape) had not been maintaining these spells and in fact was weakening them IIRC. Eventually someone (Snape I think) noticed that the students had a moldy/musty smell and wet books however it was too late and the dorm collapsed and there was a flood in Slytherin.

Does anyone remember this story? I know this is a smaller subplot but I can't remember what the main story was about as they all blur together.


** I don't know of this fic, but I could totally see a twist ending, where it turns out to be Moaning Myrtle's revenge on Slytherin for her murder. (Remember, Myrtle is capable of hydrokinesis.)
