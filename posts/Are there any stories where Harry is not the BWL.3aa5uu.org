And I don't mean where there is a twin who is supposedly the BWL. I mean Harry really isn't the BWL.


** There's Kwan Li's story, where Neville was marked instead of Harry:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]].

Other than that there's very few completed ones, but a lot of WIPs that can be recommended. For example:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by The Santi.

They're two of my favourites and the first ones that spring to mind where Harry isn't the BWL.

*** Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is my favorite fic. Do you know if it's abandoned, or does the author usually take this long to upload?

**** And yes, after 3 year hiatus he updates adn goes into an (ongoing) half year hiatus. So yeah, what we suffer for the sake of quality. I check my DLP booklink to his story every time I'm bored, sometimes several times a day.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** There are stories where Voldemort never rose to power, which would keep anyone from being the BWL. I don't know of any that are Harry-centric though so I'm not sure if those would interest you.

** I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10511318/1/Just-Another-Orphan][Just Another Orphan by ValwithV]].

#+begin_quote
  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

Hasn't been updated in a while, but the author told me in a PM it's not abandoned, so I'm hopeful. It's a Neville BWL, where Harry is sorted into Slytherin.
