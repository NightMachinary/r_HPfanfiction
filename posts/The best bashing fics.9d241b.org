What are the best, well-written bashing fics you've ever read?


** Well written bashing fics don't really exist. The whole bashing thing leads to wildly OOC people and attracts tropes like maggots to rotting meat.

However Sinyk does tend to write some halfway decent fics where there is some massive bashing.

*** Good bashing stories are definitely possible. There's a ten year old German YouTube parody of the first two movies where Dumbledore is a rapper who calls himself Fresh Dumbledore, the Weasleys are inbread, the entirety of Slytherin is gay, Hermione is hardcore lesbian, the poly juice incident is Harry and Ron trying to turn into girls to sleep with Hermione, Snape teaches advanced BDSM, Quidditch is telemarketing and Hogwarts is financed by child pornography.

The trick is simply to not take the thing seriously and have the narrator deliver the jokes without judgement.

** Unfortunately you may need to specify a bit more then that on what you want. Bashing is very difficult to write well with many writers making the antagonist unbelievably cruel or just plain unrealistic (or more specifically psychopathic) I can think of well over a dozen stories that contain bashing off the top of head that are decent, but with bashing it really is hit and miss with what you might enjoy. Honestly i would suggest just searching "bashing" on your preferred fanfiction site, select the harry potter fandom, and probably the humor genre if its available as it is a good way to waste time and if you happen to get a chuckle out of it then it was time well wasted

** My personal fav bashing fic is Junior Inquisitor. It went a bit of the rails before it stopped updating but it was just great.
