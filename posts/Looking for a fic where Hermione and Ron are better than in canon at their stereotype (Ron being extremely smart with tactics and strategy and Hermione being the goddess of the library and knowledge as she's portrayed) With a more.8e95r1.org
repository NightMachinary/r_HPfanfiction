  Sequel to The Chessmaster: Black Pawn. AU. Tensions continue to rise both inside and outside Hogwarts with the announcement of the International Scholastic Quidditch Tournament. As international influences begin to creep into British politics, Dumbledore isn't the only one worried for the future. Thomas Gaunt is concerned as well, but for very different reasons...

*** I've seen this being suggested over the last few weeks... is it that good or just got hyped for some reason ? It did intrigue me by its description, but never went ahead and read.

**** It's an interesting AU, with the perspective shifting between each of the main trio with other perspectives being shown as well.

**** It's one of the few reliably updating fics of this year, with solid writing and no bashing/bullshit. Worth checking out just to support an author doing good work.
