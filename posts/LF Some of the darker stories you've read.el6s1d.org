Please list the warnings (in a spoiler tag, if you'd like); just looking to read some dark stories.

It can have a happy ending, or not; I don't care either way.

Normally I don't want to read too dark stories, but have been wanting to recently.

Any kind of dark is fine, but again maybe list any warnings, if you can?

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have character bashing, if it can be helped.

I'd rather not have OP Harry, if it can be helped. Slightly smarter, or slightly more powerful is fine, but not OP.

Can be threesomes or moresomes.

Can be on any site as well.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380][Diablerie]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Oceanbreeze7/pseuds/Oceanbreeze7][Oceanbreeze7]]) is about Tom Riddle and it's probably a really good idea to read content warnings first. A few things it deals with is war, addiction, sexual abuse, and cannibalism.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663][Blackpool]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]]) is about the Black family and has child abuse and child death. Deals heavily with gas-lighting.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18456680][Styx]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]]) is also on the Black family, with child abuse and a fear of drowning.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

** Linkffn(imprisoned realm by lovehp)

Canon Harry is transported to another dimension where war has raged for 28 years. His counterpart is a Death Eater but his parents are alive with a family. Basically, canon!Harry needs to picks Au!Harry's brain and find out why he became bad and if he could help him turn again.

Warnings: is very dark and grim in parts. Murder, Fraticide, abduction, infidelity, betrayals, drug use, suicide, PTSD, a lot of swearing. There is with rape, torture, systematic capture of children and brainwashing them to become soldiers/spies. Nothing is explicit, although, the injuries are horrendous. The ministry is evil, and Dumbledore is pretty grey. Harry is a little OP, but hopefully in a believable way.

But it's war and shit happens.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

** Linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian) - From the text: Brief trigger warning just to be courteous: CR deals with disturbing and upsetting topics. There will be scenes including, but not limited to: gore, torture, rape, murder, PTSD, addiction, cannibalism, and brief mentions of necrophilia.

Harry is probably a little OP, but so are all the other main characters so I think it's okay.

Linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin) - tamer (Violence, Murder, etc.) than Circular Reasoning, but it probably made me feel more uncomfortable.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

  Ten years later. All was well ... until Harry's wife dies under suspicious circumstances. Harry will not rest until he has vengeance. Neville is tasked by the Ministry with uncovering the truth before the Chosen One does something he will regret ...
