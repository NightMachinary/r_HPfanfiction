Trying to figure out who attended school with the Marauders (besides the obvious) Any ideas????


** From SWM we know there was someone named Stebbins.

#+begin_quote
  “Quills down, please!” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “That means you too, *Stebbins*! Please remain seated while I collect your parchment! Acciol”
#+end_quote

Also, Bertram Aubrey:

#+begin_quote
  He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, “ ‘James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram *Aubrey*.
#+end_quote

Also, Mary MacDonald, Mulciber, Lucius Malfoy(older), Narcissa(older), Barty Crouch Jr. (younger), Regulus Black (younger).

I think those are all the names we can be sure of.

Then, Kingsley was probably around that time since he knows how James looked like. Maybe Fabian and Gideon Prewett since they are younger than Molly who was born in 1950 (depends how much younger), Frank and Alice Longbottom were a few years older than the Marauders.

Most fics use the names of the people from the First Order of the Phoenix - Dorcas Meadowes, Marlene McKinnon, Edgar Bones, Cardoc Dearborn.

In my opinion, it would be stupid of Dumbledore to build the order from a group of people who had barely graduated. I always imagined the Marauders and Lily being the youngest in the group.

** We don't know too many. Rosier, Mulciber, at least one Lestrange, and BCJ. Lucius and Narcissa. Andromeda was either a 7th year or has just left. Dirk Cresswell, Lockhart, and Kingsley are probables. And a case can be made for Quirrell being a 1st-3rd year in their 6th/7th.

**** BCJ maybe, I'm not doing the math, but Regulus, depending on his birthday, was a 5th/6th in their 7th.

** I think Kingsley is supposed to be older...

you also have Marlene McKinnon, Frank and Alice Longbottom to whatever degree (usually a year or two above). Most people pick the parents of Harry's generation - Crabbe, Goyle, Parkinson, Davis, Diggory, Lovegood, Smith, Macmillan, MacDougal, Etc.

Look at the quidditch players (professional) on the HP Wiki! I got some OCs there because of their ages.
