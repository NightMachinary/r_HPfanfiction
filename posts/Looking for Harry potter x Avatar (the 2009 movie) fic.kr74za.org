:END:
Hi, I was wondering if anyone knows what fic it was that had Harry go to Pandora because Earth (gaia ) was dying. I think it was mentioned Gaia was dying so it even tried to harm/hurt Harry as a last attempt at survival. Also another thing was Harry was in his human body but towards the end/middle of story , it is said that he started to developed the antennae connection thingy behind his head and thus would have a chance to connect with and form a relationship in Pandora. Thanks in advance.


** Glad you specified. The single word Avatar should default to the last airbender.

*** Thanks so much. It had disappeared from fanfiction.net so I was confused if I was imagining the fanatic or not.
