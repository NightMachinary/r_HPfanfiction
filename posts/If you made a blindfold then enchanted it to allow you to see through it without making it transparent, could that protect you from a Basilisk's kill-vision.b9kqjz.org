*** At what point could you frost a mirror enough that it would be considered non-reflective enough to /not/ count when it comes to reflecting the basilisk's glare?

Because technically all matte materials - like the Hogwarts castle walls - are reflective. Diffuse, but still reflective - that's why they're visible. Most students in the castle were probably subject to the Basilisk's glare at some point.

Side note: could you get petrified if you're blind?

Could the basilisk petrify itself by looking in a mirror?

** It's indirect viewing. If using a camera, a mirror, or a ghost would get you petrified, a blindfold that let you see the world accurately would probably be too much of a risk.

A fanwanky solution would be to enchant the blindfold to be infrared or use magical echolocation.

** You would still be petrified. The sight of the eyes causes petrification, at least in every instance of the books. Also, its likely that the spell would be overloaded, if the vision properties are anything like its venom properties. A support of that is it destroys that one boys film out of his camera.

In every instance of a character seeing some form of the eyes, they are petrified. We know it has to be the eyes because Harry could watch its shadow without harm and Fawks took out the eyes.

So, that means an enchanted blindfold that allows you to see through it, would still petrify you. At that point, it is a glorified mirror around a corner or seeing through something like a camera or a ghost.

How are you approaching Harry Potters ridiculous soft magic system? Are the power cores and levels or is it a matter of will, intent, and emotion?

Enchanting is pretty high level and the purposed blindfold would need to hold the magic and be capable of surviving the murder haze of a creature stepped in magic with one goal/intent.

****** Your solution is simple then. Dont go down there like that. An intelligent driven magic user would not face a Basilisk alone without a 100% sure fire way to kill it before it killed you. Its possible even a transfigured rooster wouldnt work as the magic would know that its not real.

The solution to forcing the situation though could be to use the curse krum used on the dragon at its eyes by knowing general snake biology. You could levitate boulders above its head, dropping them, as snakes have been rendered blind IRL like that, and if you do it that way, you could argue that it cant see you therefore it cant kill you with its gaze.

To kill it though, id go with its own venom route. No snake is immune to its own venom (exempt for certain species) and i dont think a Basilisk is immune. When it goes to bite, blast a fang off center, get out of the way. Done. It just stabbed itself with its own fangs and killed itself.

Basically study snakes, and figure out how to do that blind before hunting down a giant snake that kills you by looking.

******* I'm not willingly facing the Basilisk, I'm getting stunned in the back by a possessed Ginny and waking up in the Chamber with Riddle getting ready to do his big monologue.

The specifics of how I intend to kill the snake involves transfiguring a sufficiently large rock into a spear, then banishing it into the beast's mouth when it's open. I figure that only the scaly parts of it are highly resistant to damage, and the roof of it's mouth should be vulnerable enough for a heavy, pointy rock launched at speed to pierce it.

** I feel like it requires mutual eye contact. You have to meet its eye with your own. Two way mirror, enchanted blindfold, things like that? I'd say you're fine- you know, except for the fact that you're standing in front of a basilisk.

The more interesting thing to me is the question of glasses. There is a glass barrier between your eyes and its own. Same basic concept as Colin's camera and the Hermione's mirror. Is there a minimum prescription that would change it from Kill to Petrify? Or is there something more to it?
