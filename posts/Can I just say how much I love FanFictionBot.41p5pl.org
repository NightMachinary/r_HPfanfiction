Seriously, I can't think of a single other sub that has such a useful, purpose-made bot. It's quickly became an invaluable tool for this sub, and has made sharing and recommending fics VASTLY easier.

So, cheers to you, [[/u/FanfictionBot][u/FanfictionBot]] ! And its creator, of course, [[/u/tusing]]

Edit- AND [[/u/stuxcrystal]]


** Thanks! Don't forget to give [[/u/stuxcrystal]] a lot of credit, too, he has contributed a great deal to the bot!

** [[/u/tusing]] will you allow other subreddits to use Fanfictionbot? Like [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] would benifit from it greatly. just curious.

*** Right now, probably not. While the bot is capable of multiple subs, I think introducing multiple subs would add too much time overhead to every reply.

Bot v1.4.0 which we tried to deploy a couple of days ago would work fine, I think, but that's quite buggy right now! Combine that with the fact that [[/r/fanfiction]] has half the activity of our sub and fewer users, it might be best to wait until the bot updates to handle that.

***** I know this isn't a perfect solution but with calibre you can change an EPUB to a MOBI very easily and it's a good library manager.
