Having spent a fair bit of time on this sub I am well aware of the general consensus of magical cores, but it serves a purpose, even if it is done horribly most of the time. So my question is what is a better way to show a magic scale, is it a muscle, can cores be done well, or is it something completely different, would love to hear from the great people of this sub. Also, sorry for the ramble.


** I don't mind cores, or even just a vague explanation of "Magical Strength". I think numerical ranking is dumb and adds a sense of campy b-grade Sci-Fi, which is fine, if that's the aim of the story.

I prefer my fantasy magic rules to be defined but the source, reason, origin of magic to be vague and mysterious. If you have a number system I'd prefer if it was more of a vague, inaccurate, thing that isn't widely accepted. If that makes sense.

** I think cores, like all tropes and clichés, can be done well - tropes and clichés become that way because the ideas are used often, not because each realization of the idea is badly written.

To me, I would see different types of magic to be like different skills. Some people are naturally gifted when it comes to one or the other. Anyone can put in the effort to improve, but at some point you ask how does that square up with varying levels of natural talent. I guess that's why having magical cores with different strengths/sizes didn't bother me - because it feels like real-life. I played basketball - I could get in shape and become a great player for my size. But I would never match Lebron James's raw talent. But there are other things I could do that he couldn't. That's life. And I like my fics to be somewhat realistic in how the rules of magic work - that the suspension of disbelief comes from the fact that magic works at all, not from the rules governing how it works. But that's just me.

** How to do we measure intelligence? I feel like magical ability would be more akin to that than to a muscle. Our measures are imperfect (you can probably base the issues with a magical test on criticisms of IQ), and there's a certain disconnect between potential and achievement. Also, some people are skilled in all areas, and others are rather less well rounded.

This fits fairly well in general, actually. Harry Potter characters never seem to experience "magical exhaustion", the way one would if magical ability were a muscle. Rather, doing a lot of magic can be tiring. Most of us are familiar with that feeling after a particularly grueling test or interview, so it's not really a stretch to think that magic could do the same, particularly give that it requires focus.

That said, I do read fics that mention cores sometimes. I don't think the concept makes sense with HP style magic, but it doesn't put me off unless it's emphasized. I'd love to see a fic where everyone was obsessed with some measure of magical power that turned out to be complete bogus, actually.

*** I think the "exhaustion" or some other strong limitation can be implied. Otherwise, why would canon characters (especially adults) ever stop doing magic? Why would anyone? If I had magical abilities, I'd just keep doing things with magic if it was effortless. Endlessly casting spells all day. Over and over again.

The way magic is used in canon stories implies that it is difficult to constantly employ. Otherwise, no one would lift a fork with their hands. Or walk. Or speak out loud. Or physically send a letter.

No, if wizards and witches are at all human, obviously useful magic is so troublesome that it's less difficult just to carry your books rather than float them along with a first year spell. Or to leave some of your stuff not in your pockets, rather than enchant them and everything you own to be lighter, smaller, and more inside other things than those things should hold. And be like that all the time, even if it means casting the spell every hour or so. Parents would do this for kids, and kids would strive to learn how early and be eager to learn how to do so after seeing how useful it is.

The world of Harry Potter is one in which magic costs something, a lot of something, otherwise everyone would use it all the time. Casually, and without ceasing. To the point where their behavior would be almost inhuman.

**** To me, the way magic is used in canon implies that there is no 'cost' involved with employing it. The question is what's easier and faster. Is it easier to charm a fork to do as you want, and concentrate on eating and the spell, or is it easier to just simply eat. (In my opinion, eating while not doing something else at the same time is easier...).

If you look at Fred and George in OoTP, once they are allowed to use magic they do it all the time. They apparate to each room, and use it for every other little thing:

#+begin_quote
  „Fred -- George -- NO, JUST CARRY THEM!' Mrs Weasley shrieked. Harry, Sirius and Mundungus looked round and, within a split second, they had dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of Butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air towards them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface; the flagon of Butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere; the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before. ‘FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!' screamed Mrs Weasley. ‘THERE WAS NO NEED -- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS -- JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!' ‘We were just trying to save a bit of time!' said Fred, hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table. ‘Sorry, Sirius, mate -- didn't mean to --' Harry and Sirius were both laughing; Mundungus, who had toppled backwards off his chair, was swearing[...] „Boys,' Mr Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, ‘your mother's right, you're supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you've come of age --“
#+end_quote

Note how Arthur and Molly talk about responsibility that comes with age, and are not warning them about any cost or exhaustion or whatever.

In my opinion, it's about what's more convenient at the time, what's faster and does a job more precisely.

At Hogwarts teacher give their students homework, tell them to practice spells etc. and never say anything along the lines of "but make sure not to use too much magic." or something similar.

Magic in the corridors at Hogwarts is not allowed, so that might be why students carry their books, rather than have them float.

At the Ministry memos are enchanted to fly around, pictures in newspapers and photos people take move, there are magical sweets like jumping chocolate frogs...

If magic cost its user something, why would it be used for little, everyday things like that?

In all 7 HP books, there was never any mention of "magical fatigue/exhaustion" or magic costing anything. I think that if JKR intended that to be the case, she would have mentioned it somewhere.

***** That's a bad example. It is dangerous, canonically, to teleport. Also, they're annoying their parents, who would say anything to get them to stop.

The teleports are short distances, and you'll note that they do stop, even though it would be more annoying not to do so.

I'm not saying it's dangerous or something, using lots of magic in canon--not more so than over exerting yourself physically is. And kids aren't warned /endlessly/ about that in real life school. Rather the opposite nowadays.

But we're shown even people in combat using their wands more like six shooters than machineguns, in the books as well as the movies. Even Dumbledore is like that. There is something that's limiting people's use of magic in the Harry Potter 'verse, or at least /some/ magicals would just use it all the time. I'd expect a large percentage of people just to use it a lot to show off, in fact, unless there is a inhibitory element. Even mental strain could affect this, and willpower (which is a chemically limited resource in the brain--a willpower core, if you will) runs out when mundane people do mundane things that require decision making.

Maybe that's all you need. Using magic requires focus and willpower, both of which are limited resources. Even world class mathematicians don't do higher maths literally /all/ the time. Just in spurts and sprints, and at odd moments perhaps, but not all the time at the best level of which they're capable. That's just exhausting. Magic should be the same way, or it isn't being treated realistically compared to the rest of human experience.

******* Perhaps. But we do have the problem that people act like it isn't just physically or mentally exhausting. Magic is conserved, not just effort. People aren't shown being exhausted in any way /after/ using magic, yet they limit their use of magic, even in combat, *severely*.

Also, it doesn't seem to exist as an educational consideration. Kids aren't taught mental strengthening techniques, like in say martial arts, and they aren't /ever/ given physical education even to make their arms stronger and have more dexterity and stamina.

Even Harry never has the DA do wind sprints or lift weights, which implies that's not a major factor in combat success /for magic/. Stories that go this route quickly get weirdly non-canon, and I hate the "Get Swole" stories as much as many others seem to hate magical cores.

******** I don't really see any evidence for magic being conserved. What I see instead is spells being too difficult for people in various ways, cultural and learned bias for doing things a certain way, people /not/ being trained soldiers and thus being uncertain how to handle situations or coming up with the right spell for the moment.

Where people are confident in their abilities and free to use magic they are shown to do so abundantly.

As for not having any physical education - that's cultural bias at work, disdain towards all things muggle and plain old pre-scientific mindset. Wizards are /not/ logical, they have no common sense and next to no analytical ability. With regards to Harry and teaching, he is a child repeating the method he learned by (admittedly, he is talented in that) but he never goes beyond that, he is not creative and he frankly is too young and inexperienced to be a competent teacher were it not for his raw talent in conveying these skills and inspiring people.

If a magical person had one favorite spell that they used all the time, even when it wasn't logical for a specific combat situation, that would make sense. That's how humans work. But people don't do that. They fight slowly, carefully, choosing their shots even in the heat of battle. They cast far slower than the books (or even movies) lead us to believe is possible. Even Voldemort and Dumbledore are like that.

If it was free and nearly effortless to summon water, fire, wind, rocks, teleport, float arbitrary objects, and blow holes in walls, than combat and magical society itself would look a lot different than is depicted in the books

But as it has been pointed out to you before that it is /not/ effortless that's a strawman argument. So even you'll ignore it again I'll repeat - we have seen that it takes metal effort, will, precision and on occasion particular strong emotions to cast spells and that those can be tiring the user. We have no indication that there is a magic reservoir that runs dry if you cast too many spells.

Thinking is freer and more effortless than doing magic and look how often people do that.

--------------

I'm in combat with overwhelming odds. I find a dead end room and cast stunners blindly through the doorway. I never stop.

I'm going to be in combat soon in an office. I start animating all the furniture around me and turning random knicknacks and office supplies into animals. I never stop.

I'm at the top of a set of stairs. I start conjuring random things and dropping them down the stairs. I never stop.

It's a tough fight. Everything is now on fire, covered in ice, or is shaped like a hungry housecat that thinks the Death Eater's face is a num num. I'm still making more housecats. I never stop.

It's a really tough fight. There is no longer a building standing in the area. There is a hole in the ground, which is on fire, also covered in ice somehow, whipped by gale-force winds, and populated by some very confused woodland creatures that used to be bushes where my foes were foolish enough to stand still. I'm sitting three miles underground surrounded by stone and breathing through air-freshening charms. I keep teleporting in and out of my pre-prepared custom cavern, sniping at my foes then retreating. Over and over again.

--------------

That none of that happens, all from canon Hogwarts level spells, means people don't pull out all the stops because they can't. Even Dumbledore and Voldemort fighting was a slow deal. They cast more spells than most, but not that many overall. Even in the action-stupefied, laser magic of the movies, they just plink at each other.

There isn't an endless barrage of magic but a careful back and forth. Modern gunfights don't work like that. It feels more like they've got limited ammo, somehow, and are aiming for the best possible shots. Which doesn't make sense if casting is free and you're in a life and death situation. Then, wands would move more like swords--always in motion and casting, all the time.

Every Apparation and Disapparation produces a distinct sound. And, furthermore, every time you apparate in, it may well be in front of an opponent with your back to them. And even if not, after one or two rounds, you might well find yourself running into the Anti-Apparation Jinx.

Modern gunfits with fully automatic weapons are a very poor analogy. Even if everyone involved is comfortable casting nonverbally, the rate of fire is still going to be slower than a revolver, and considering that many spells have specific counters, whereas guns only fire one kind of a projectile, two at most, yes, one might want to be more choosy about what spells one casts.

I don't think that's accurate. I haven't seen the movies, but in the books, our protagonist and point-of-view character isn't very good at nonverbal casting, and neither are his age-appropriate opponents, so most of the duels we see in any detail are all verbal --- which limits the rate of fire.

On the other hand, one of the few skilled adult vs. skilled adult fights that we do get to see --- Molly versus Bellatrix --- does, in fact, suggest a rapid-firing style. From DH,

#+begin_quote
  ‘OUT OF MY WAY!' shouted Mrs Weasley to the three girls, and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered, and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the witches' feet became hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore's style against Voldemort is on a completely different level, less about discrete spells and more about conjuring and transfiguring things to protect yourself and hurt your opponent: not a machine gun but a flamethrower, in other words.

Why aren't legions of wounded students who lost in earlier fights now sleeper agents, mind controlled to swarm the rest when they start fighting again? Why doesn't Bellatrix use the killing curse around a door or over a conjured wall, just blind firing into the room until everything else is dead?

Bellatrix wasn't playing with Molly. That's clear from the start. Remember the line you quoted? That wasn't how Sirius' battle went. Molly clearly isn't Dumbledore or even Auror level. She just got in a lucky shot while fighting all out.

--------------

No one brings enchanted goodies to a fight. No one preps the field, not even the evil terrorists. No one uses mind-controlled suicide troops, except for one 17 year old student.

No automated weapons. No poisons or cursed weapons in actual battles, just for down-time torture and threats.

The movies are worse about this than the books, but at least people cast /more/ of those pew pew spells in the movies. In the books, it's a lot slower and less logical. Which is saying a lot when you're comparing it to a wooden stick acting as a laser gun.

Magical battles should be insanely fast, and instantly fatal between people trying to kill each other. Tom and Dumbledore are flukes, trying to do some stupid samurai duel thing, and even they didn't last that long on the page. That fight is probably still best explained by Dumbledore being stupidly good at defense, having to protect Harry, and still being unwilling to strike a killing blow against Tom--one he knows would be useless anyway.

Bellatrix's fight has none of that. It should have been over very, very quickly. It wasn't, and it isn't shown that Bellatrix is playing around after Molly steps up; which implies something made Bellatrix less effective after a long day's fighting. That's what I'm trying to find explanations regarding. Why Bellatrix was less battle ready, if magic is truly "free" in canon.

Explaining that sort of thing is important if someone wants to write fanfiction about HP magic, not just have a story where magic happens in the background sometimes. Canon Harry Potter stories just push magic to the background, and thus can sorta get away with not explaining or examining anything.

  Conjurations can and do last a significant time; but who says such things are conjured? Any way would timeframe matter for a few minutes of battle?

Oh, so you're suggesting they bring caltrops with them? That makes more sense, but it has no bearing whatsoever on the question of whether wizards run out of magic.

#+begin_quote
  Who are Bellatrix's friends, exactly, who she cares so much about in the final battle?
#+end_quote

So you're saying that she should have just Fiendfyred the place?

#+begin_quote
  "Bombarda Maxima"
#+end_quote

So it's a spell that can breach a wall and possibly produce some shrapnel, which, even if it has sufficient mass and velocity to injure wizards --- who are a bit hardier than Muggles --- can be blocked with a Shield Charm.

#+begin_quote
  Unproven. People claimed to have been under it for years--that's the 1983 Death Eaters excuse du jour. Draco used it to make someone else use it, all in the course of a school outing. It couldn't have taken that long, and lasted at least half an hour on the second person in the chain, as they had time to get started back to the castle.
#+end_quote

The burden of proof is on you. You're arguing --- and please correct me if I am wrong --- that in a universe where wizards don't run out of magic, mass Imperius would be used as you described, and since it wasn't, that's evidence that they were in the universe where they do run out. My response is that Imperius has at least some known limitations and is nontrivial to cast well, so the specific use scenario wouldn't work well in either universe.

Oh, and while Draco's Imperius on Rosmerta went undetected for months, Rosmerta's and Harry's weren't nearly as unnoticeable, IIRC.

#+begin_quote
  Wait. Did you just give a spell that could blow up a room? Why did you ask me for one, if you're arguing this? That spell, by the way, doesn't do that--but whatever.
#+end_quote

Sorry, wrong spell: Expulso is the one I meant. It's not really an area-of-effect spell, since it's only particularly dangerous to someone standing right next to the door --- which Bellatrix would be in your scenario.

#+begin_quote
  If it can destroy a wall, it can destroy the floor or ceiling.
#+end_quote

I think Hogwarts's ancient walls might be a bit more resilient than that, and even if they weren't, I think that all sides in that battle were at least a little sentimental about damaging their alma mater too much.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix wasn't playing with Molly. That's clear from the start. Remember the line you quoted? That wasn't how Sirius' battle went.
#+end_quote

I didn't say she was or how it did. I was referring to this line:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Bellatrix laughed, /the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backwards through the veil/, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

So, yes, there is a good case that she was distracted on some level.

#+begin_quote
  Molly clearly isn't Dumbledore or even Auror level. She just got in a lucky shot while fighting all out.
#+end_quote

You seem to know quite a lot about Molly's capabilities. Did you see some battles involving Molly (that she lost) that the rest of us didn't?

In order to get this alleged "lucky shot", she had to have survived the preceding rapid exchange of spells with Bellatrix.

Look, I, myself, would have liked it much better if Hermione were the one to kill Bellatrix (and with her own wand) using some clever indirect attack --- maybe some Transfiguration or something that only a Muggleborn would have thought of --- but what happened was a pitched battle between Molly and Bellatrix that involved a rapid exchange of nonverbal spells, with Bellatrix, while not outright playing, appeared to have been at the very least overconfident and perhaps distracted (see Evil Overlord List Rule #20) towards the end.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

False. Animated objects (knight armors, statues) were used for attack and defense.

#+begin_quote
  No poisons or cursed weapons in actual battles, just for down-time torture and threats.
#+end_quote

Do any exist that are more effective than a wand and a Dark curse?

#+begin_quote
  The movies are worse about this than the books, but at least people cast more of those pew pew spells in the movies. In the books, it's a lot slower and less logical. Which is saying a lot when you're comparing it to a wooden stick acting as a laser gun.
#+end_quote

Unless one is good enough at nonverbal casting to use it under fire, one's firing rate is going to be slower than a revolver, and while Hermione masters nonverbal casting for everyday magic, not even she seems to use it in battle in DH. Add to that that fought from ambush, Disarming or Petrification Charm or the Stunning Spell can end a fight. Our protagonist is a somewhat above-average adolescent and his antics don't lead him to witness many pitched battles between skilled adults that are described in any detail.

#+begin_quote
  Magical battles should be insanely fast, and instantly fatal between people trying to kill each other.
#+end_quote

A good chunk of them are decided by ambush. For the rest, between evasion, shielding, and conjuring and animating obstacles, there is a lot more room for complexity.

#+begin_quote
  Tom and Dumbledore are flukes, trying to do some stupid samurai duel thing, and even they didn't last that long on the page. That fight is probably still best explained by Dumbledore being stupidly good at defense, having to protect Harry, and still being unwilling to strike a killing blow against Tom--one he knows would be useless anyway.
#+end_quote

Also, at one point, Fawkes had to fly into the path of a Killing Curse.

#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix's fight has none of that. It should have been over very, very quickly. It wasn't, and it isn't shown that Bellatrix is playing around after Molly steps up; which implies something made Bellatrix less effective after a long day's fighting. That's what I'm trying to find explanations regarding. Why Bellatrix was less battle ready, if magic is truly "free" in canon.
#+end_quote

Just like in real life, soldiers never get tired or distracted as long as they have any ammo left. :P

#+begin_quote
  Explaining that sort of thing is important if someone wants to write fanfiction about HP magic, not just have a story where magic happens in the background sometimes. Canon Harry Potter stories just push magic to the background, and thus can sorta get away with not explaining or examining anything.
#+end_quote

I agree that a fanfic writer needs to fill in some gaps. HP:WQ's premise, in particular, /requires/ that it be possible to run out of magic, or Harry wouldn't be in his predicament. (How's that coming, by the way?)

However, what I am seeing is a limitation on magic being shoehorned into a setting where there is no direct evidence of it, and very weak circumstantial evidence with better explanations. And, while absence of evidence is not always evidence of absence, in this case, nobody unambiguously ran out of magic /once/ in all 7 action-packed (sorta) books, so yes, it is.

** Keep it abstract, do not assign numbers or have any way of ranking magical prowess. That is an instant tab-closer. There are plenty of stories with a magic-core that are good. But even those stories earn an eyeroll at the ridiculousness of it. I don't know if I've ever seen a fic where it was actually important and couldn't just be removed.

My head-canon is that magical strength is about how easily magic flows through someone. This can be learned, and strengthened through experience. Some people take to magic much easier. Think young Tom Riddle and his control of magic before Hogwarts. With this idea every magic user is equal in potential, which is a core theme of the books. Having some people being inherently stronger than others goes against the nature of Harry Potter.

If someone has developed the mental acuity and discipline to regularly tackle more difficult spells then that could certainly giving them an advantage in trying to add another one to their repertoire. There are examples, though, of Harry being unable to cast intermediate level spells (Summoning Charm) even after learning extremely complicated ones (Patronus Charm).

I think the only /real/ rule in JKR's universe is that spells do what the author wants when the author wants to do it. Anything else is up for grabs.

*** Magical cores causing trouble is a plot point in the Ambiguous Artifice linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10041727/1/The-Ambiguous-Artifice]]). Essentially fem!Harry's magical core is so chaotic that she starts wearing a partial suppressor at 13 so she can still use magic without subconsciously doing dangerous things. After her thirteenth birthday, her core just gets out of control. Her mentor (Snape) vehemently disagrees with her choice to use a suppressor, but her mother Lily has been wearing a partial suppressor for years to deal with her own uncontrollable magic and encourages it.

The representations of magical cores in the story are interesting and not at all like HP points in a video game. The end of the first story, the Pureblood Pretense linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]), has a plot centering around an illness attacking magical cores and fem!Harry explores a lot of different cores while helping to heal it.

Anyway this is all created for the story, but the story couldn't play out without internal, centralized magical centers in people, and the author called those magical cores. So for the first story, magical cores are actually essential to the plot. And they don't vanish after that story.

But never measured scientifically? Literally that's impossible? Not even, how fast and how many times can you heat a liter of water with a standard spell? That's not how reality works.

You're really just saying you hate the words "magical core" and "1.21 gigga-thuams" and such, as used in bad fanfic. But don't turn around and say magical ability can't be measured.

It's like this. Everyone uses the same proteins in their body's muscles, but some people just have different arrangements and different levels of development with those same building blocks. And that can be measured, if in no other way than by the practical results.

Measuring things isn't outside the reach of the magical world. In fact, for the Victorian/Regency time it seems stuck in canonically, it would be very appropriate see all things about both the natural and supernatural world measured and labeled by wizards. Even if their labels are very scientific or well-grounded.

You're dodging the question OP asked about what magical scales make sense by saying, just don't. That's not really very helpful or interesting.

#+end_quote

Making it unlike literally anything else about how people actually are, and also in direct contradiction with the books where Voldemort had unreachable dark powers--just the same way Harry had unreachable fate powers.

Some people will be able to concentrate or have helpful emotions better than other people. Some will be able to wave a wand physically longer than others or be more dexterous with it. Some will never mispronounce words (even in their own heads too, I guess) and have less trouble studying and learning in general.

This is just taking that one step further, and saying there is something inherently different relating only to magic that can let that magic work better for some people than for others.

Even if you assume it is all environmental differences that let Tom Riddle control minds at age 10 there are still problems with that stance when it comes to logical world building. If all it takes to be stronger is surviving an unfortunate childhood, then logically all you'd need to do to have a more magically powerful population in general is send your kids off at a young age to a scary, lonely, apparently dangerous place to...oh. Hmm.

Further, if everyone can gain this knowledge and with it this power, why do so very, very few ever achieve it? They might shy away from following Voldemort's path, but what about Dumbledore? Are wizards so lazy? Even in the face of threats from the likes of Voldemort?

** If we wanna say it as blunt as possible, canon HP magic has only one limitations and that is knowledge. If you know the spell, you can cast it - in theory. Then again we have wand movements, incantations and for some spells even your emotional and mental state to consider. However, that is all secondary to the fact that if you know the spell, you can cast it.

I always refused the idea of magical cores. In the best case it was simply to put a limitation on our hero, while in the worst case it became an anime-esque powerlevel that more often than not was over 9000 for Harry. In all fanfics it steals away some of the mysticism behind magic. Its an explanation, like the midichlorians in Star Wars - a way to make lists of "Whos the strongest". And when something got a list, you know the mysticism is gone.

** I feel like the different magical fields of study (Charms, Transfiguration, etc.) are poorly connected in canon. In real life, chemistry is similar to biology is connected to math is related to physics and psychology is deployed in English, etc. Unifying theories of magical education go along well with magical cores because someone's core strengths should be applicable in several different subjects. I do think magic overall, like learning, comes more easily to some people, but if there's an innate core of magic in everyone it shouldn't be equally great at all fields of magic, imo.

Also since bits of souls can be stored in objects in canon, as well as bits of memories, I feel like cores should be separable as well, or at least there should be some artifacts that can store personal energy if you charge it long enough.

** I personally prefer to discard cores, though I don't avoid stories with them. Sometimes your story may need a reason to limit the scale of power a character can wield. Personally, I think having them get tired, a sore wrist, or have them lose concentration can work better in most cases though. And that's only to explain why they lose a fight they /should/ win. If they should lose anyway (less experienced, less spells known, outnumbered), there isn't a necessarily need for it.

As far a my theory of magical scale: I see magic as a set of different skills to master for each of the branches of magic. Each branch requires different skills to become capable of, or a master of that magic. Charms may require precise wandwork, where the swishes and flicks being sloppy won't cut it. Transfiguration may require a great imagination, Or an ability to accurately visualise the transformations. Potions may require rigid following of rules and preparations. DADA hexes and curses may require strong will or intent.

These different skills required means that although everyone can learn every branch of magic, some people will only ever be okay at that magic, providing the baseline witch or wizard. Some outliers will be naturally great at everything, such as Dumbledore. Academically minded witches and wizards will seem like they can do more magic than most since they apply themselves better. But most people will have one or two areas where they excel. Hermione and her academic skills allow her to succeed at most magic, but her attention to detail allows her to excel at charms (precise wandwork) and potions (following exact instructions). Harry is a protege in DADA, due to his inate willpower. If someone was an artist, they may find Transfiguration easier, since they can already visualize things well.

It gives a reason for everyone to be able to do "everything" of magic if they try, and explains why some people are better at some branches then others. And as always, there are the dumbledores to make you feel inadequate.

** In canon, the most powerful wizards are also the most intelligent ones, the ones who can think on their feet and use magic creatively. Also the ambitious ones. I think how powerful a witch/wizard is depends on a combination of talent and hard work, and not on the size of a magical core they were born with. I think of magic just like any other talent a person can have.

Some people are great at playing the piano, they have a feeling for the right notes, find it easy to play sheet music etc. Someone else might be great at playing sheet music, but have more difficulty with creating their own melodies.

Then let's take writing. One talent could be to have excellent grammar and spelling, a feeling for it. Other's might be more talented in making describing something in words that touch the reader.

I'd say magic is a bit like that. Take Potions. Some people can do a good job at following the recipe, others have a deeper understanding and create their own potions.

Or Transfiguration. Every witch or wizard is capable of it to some degree, but while some have to put a lot of work into getting acceptable results, other's just have a knack for the subject. (Like McGonagall was said to have). And this talent plus their willingness to work hard makes them capable and thus powerful in this field.

So in my mind, HP magic is a lot like every other talent. Some have talents for a particular area, some don't, everybody has to work on it. And if you have talent and work hard, if you are interested and keep studying, then you can become great at the subject of your choice.

Voldemort was said to have travelled after school, done a lot of research, delved into some magics deeper than anybody before him. He wasn't just exercising some 'muscle', he was getting to understand the topics of his choice on an academic level.

Then there's Dumbledore, a great wizard, famous for his magical and /academic/ prowess.

Grindelwald, another powerful wizard, was thrown out of school for the stuff he did with magic, the areas he explored. He was interested, trying to expand his knowledge, so much that he didn't restrict himself to the knowledge the Durmstrang curriculum dictated.

Edit: *Tl;dr*: For me what makes a powerful wizard are talent, willingness to work hard, curiosity, interest in exploring magic, intelligence, creativity to apply what they studied and use it in new ways or ways others don't expect. I compare it to other talents. If someone is talented in science that doesn't mean they will do anything with it. If they are working hard, are curious about the subject, explore it, and are creative, chances are they will be knowledgable/powerful in their field.

** I prefer it be a mindset more than a muscle. Someone can't perform good offensive spells if they have a problem hurting others. They're not empathetic enough for healing spells. Not creative enough for transfiguration. Too grounded and literal for Divination.

I think that fits in canon too. You have to want to cause pain to perform the Cruciatus. A Patronus needs a happy memory to put you in the right mindset. Harry was able to control priori incatatem even though, if we thought of it as a muscle, Voldemort should have been stronger. The Imperius can be broken by a strong mind. Neville improves as a wizard when he becomes more confident. The most powerful youths in the books (Tom Riddle, Albus Dumbledore) were smart, creative, and arrogant. Hermione is a smart girl, but she's a limited by a closed mind. Harry's no genius, but he's empowered by a strong personality and reckless problem-solving.

Personality and strength of mind matter even more than knowledge, and all three of them determine how powerful a wizard or witch is. Magical ability is just the tool they use to display their brilliance.

** Characters are more interesting because of their limitations, not because of their lovingly described powers and abilities. This is what bad fanfic authors usually forget--or don't care about in the first place.

Magical cores and measured magical powers in general, if included in a story, should be about how magic is limited, not about how Harry can totes blow away Tom and Dumbledore both with a single wave of his magical pinky. Like most character attributes, magical cores should show how not everything is easy or even possible, and how those limitations hurt the hero at least as much as they do the villains.

Otherwise, it is just mindless, pointless power fantasy, without subtlety or nuance, and the story would be better without it or any measurement of magical ability.

** I don't have a problem with them, but they don't fit my personal view of magic in the HP world.

I see magic as the ability to exert one's will on the physical world directly. Ways someone would be stronger is if they either have a strong force of will (which can be practiced) or if they just have a stronger bond to their magic (which is usually a natural variance, but I have a plot bunny of Morgana having figured out what defines it and how to alter it).

Also, if you're continually applying your will to something you will eventually get fatigued, which solves the problem of magic not having any cost at all which cores often try to solve.

** Overall, it is a rare fic that postulates a meaningful Magical Strength Stat (MSS) by any name and then does something good with it, as opposed to doing nothing or worse. (By "meaningful MSS", I mean one that is that is distinct from other character attributes and varies to a significant extent from person to person (except, possibly, for growing with age.)

The reason, I think, is that MSS can't help but feel like something that the author arbitrarily set to give a particular character an advantage or a disadvantage, rather than integrating smoothly with the rest of the character. This is exacerbated by the fact that pretty much the only scenario where a small difference in MSS would make a difference in the outcome, rather than being drowned out by other factors, would be a direct contest of such strength, such as whose Levitation Charm can lift a larger weight. Given what we see of HP fights, a duel between two wizards with a 20% difference in MSS between them would probably be determined by tactics, dexterity, terrain, and blind luck, with MSS being a distant tiebreaker. The upshot of this is that when writers have MSS affect things, they pretty much have to make MSS differences very big, which makes the whole thing come off as an even more arbitrary powerup.

This creates a Catch-22 of sorts: if MSS is postulated, and its variability (within age group) is small, then it has virtually no effect on the story, so there's no point to postulating it; but, if its variability is big enough to make a difference, then it feels like an arbitrary powerup disconnected from the rest of the character.

Contrast this with one of the other "models" for magical capabilities, where how good one can be is determined by (among other things) general intelligence. Then, a character's magic is no longer something separate from them: it is associated with how they act, what nonmagical things they are good and bad at, and what mistakes they make. (Yes, mistakes. For example, Greater Good and SPEW were smart-people mistakes: they were the sorts of mistakes made by people intelligent and curious enough to consider the big picture, question the way things are done, formulate how things should be different, and how to make them so.)

Add to that that magical talent --- to the extent canon characters talk about it --- is not a unidimensional measure like the MSS would make it: different people are better at different aspects of magic. For example,

- Harry is great at the Patronus, which represents capacity for joy, hope in the face of overwhelming odds, as well as self-sacrifice, all traits of his character; and resists the Imperius, which flows from his instinctive rejection of authority, which gets him in trouble as often as not. But, other magic, including Summoning Charm and nonverbal casting don't come to him as easily as they come to quite a few others.

- Gilderoy Lockhart is the ultimate shallow character, who has little substance and wants only to be admired by those around him. Appropriately enough, the magic designed for affecting others' impression of him --- Memory Charms first or foremost, but also what cosmetic magic there is --- work well for him, but other magic doesn't.

To summarize, I think that using MSS in a story is, with rare exceptions, a bad idea. It reduces what could have been interesting, character-defining traits, to one dimension, disconnected from the rest of the character; and if it's introduced, it's either pointless or arbitrary.

The exceptions where MSS helps tend to be stories where a protagonist is given a /low/ MSS rather than a high one, which is the common practice. Then, that's a challenge for the character to overcome, which can drive conflict, rather than confer an arbitrary advantage. (linkffn(Almost a Squib by BajaB) is a classic example of that. [[/spoiler][Hermione in /Hogwarts Battle School/ by Kwan Li]] (not linked to avoid spoilers) might qualify as another.)

** I think HP benefits if a spell's effect is not just based on skill, but if "magical power" or "talent" plays a role as well. In a fight, dodging, moving and aiming would be important too, as would be sheer (combat) experience. Basically, I like to have more ways to have different strengths for different characters. You can have a similar effect if you simply assume that each character has some spells they have a talent for, and spells they struggle more with.

In the same vein, the idea that there is no fatigue that would stop a wizard from casting, or at least make casting harder over time, has implications for world building ("Energizer Bunny Wizards") that I don't like.

I mean, you're taking about people that are basically conditioned from 11 on up to be able to cast large amounts of magic.

** I included a sort-of magic scale in my AU fic. The number a magical Being (dragons, goblins etc. in addition to wizards) is assigned is more a representation of a number of factors (physiological, mental, both inherited and environmentally caused), and it is used as a gauge to estimate how well they can use/interact with magic. It can vary /dramatically/ in one's lifetime.

It's less about "magical strength" (as dragons score far lower than wizards) and more about utility. In the grand scheme of things, it's not the most useful test, but it is employed for the purposes of discrimination, confirmation bias and misplaced hero-worship (much like IQ tests), which is partially why I incorporated it into the plot.

EDIT: Probably should also mention that this is all separate from magical exhaustion, which is non-existent.
