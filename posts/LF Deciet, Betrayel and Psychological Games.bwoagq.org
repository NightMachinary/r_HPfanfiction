Bit obscure but I recently read Bloody Monday Manga and it was filled with constant suspicion and traitors. Loyalties were divided and there were quite some "factions". Even when someone was more or less revealed to be a ally you still couldn't be too sure. Maybe their loyalty wasn't divided before but maybe now you are an obstruction to their plans. It isn't exactly like a "no one is safe" but more of a "safety isn't eternal or guaranteed"


** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has multiple factions (Voldemort's Death Eaters, Ministry aurors, Dumbledore's Order, Hermione's Resistance, Draco's group of Slytherins/Death Eater recruits, the Avengers, the French and the Jamaicans), there's backstabbing, betrayal, undercover spying, brutal battle, et cetera.

The Avengers that want to join the Resistance are actually undercover aurors, one of the aurors that came up with the plan is an undercover Death Eater, Daphne and Tracy do multiple undercover missions for multiple sides, and there's a traitor in the Resistance.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
