In my newest fanfiction, I'm planning on changing a few things and want to know how much you guys like changes.

The changes I'm planning are the user of the diary in Chamber of Secrets, and who Crouch Jr is impersonating in Goblet of Fire.

Would you guys enjoy these changes? What other changes do you like to read?


** Anything that isn't canon. Basically: Tell me a good story, and please don't only retell canon.

Be creative!

And also: Try to make changes that make sense: If you have a bookish Harry he would probably have read that Voldemort was a parselmouth (which, in my understanding, was widely known) and wouldn't use parseltongue in the duel in CoS. He also might not go to the deathday-party, and might not go to detention in 1st year.

The actions your characters take must have believable consequences, and if you at least try to follow that rules, you will peobably get quite some fans on this sub.

On the other hand: Your changes must make sense, too. Why would Lucius Malfoy give his son the diary? And: Will it actually effect the outcome? Why is the story better with the change, than without?

*** This is probably the best response I've heard. The only time I don't mind canon rehash, is when it's missing moments, or off-screen stuff. Tell me canon from the point of view of someone in Slytherin. Maybe talk about Hermione and Neville's offscreen friendship. The two outcasts in their year (to begin with) and how they bonded. I think the gist of it is this: Tell a story that no one's told well.

**** Two of the best fanfics I know are stories told from the point of view of someone else.

"Not From Others" tells the story of Ginny's year during /Deathly Hallows/ (and is infinitely superior to "Year of Darkness")

Linkffn(11419408)

And "Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection" is Luna's story during /Order of the Phoenix./ And it may be my favorite fanfic.

** This seemed to turn into a bitching session about what NOT to do. I suspect ptsd personally. As for what changes I like to see in canon? Personally I've sort of grown past the 'Harry goes through school and things happen somewhat differently' story line that 99% of fanfic authors choose to take. If you want to suck in someone like me, you need to do a post Hogwarts story where the changes happened in the past, and we learn about some of them over the course of a completely different narrative, with new villains, new plot, new macguffins, the lot. If all you do is change a couple of things in the well trod path of Hogwarts life, I'm unlikely to ever read your story.

** I enjoy fics that try to keep the wonder about magic alive. Everything becomes very methodical in some fics where a character just monotonously trains with a spell until they're competent with it - like /maaaateee/, if you have a "go-to" spell, people arraying themselves against you will just use the best defence against that tactic. If your character just yells out "Defodio" in more than one fight, you /immediately/ need to make an opponent silence him.

And also: Ron isn't a tactician - he's an amateur chess player. In military leadership training they don't force officers to play chess as some shortcut to mastery. They knuckle down with theory and develop practical leadership experience. Ron needs to head up the DA or something similar as a stepping stone to become a leader, then he needs to read up on theory and history to develop wisdom and intuition. But Ron is lazy af so he's just not going to reach those echelons unless you tear down his weaknesses and do it brutally.

** No canon rehashes, we have seen them hundreds of times and they are getting nauseous.

If you absolutely have to redo the CoS plot, make the Basilisk kill because Petrifications were ALL caused by exceptional circumstances.

The ability to develop credible, original plots sets apart good and bad writers. Of course, some good writers may intentionally rehash Canon plots to appeal to new fanfic readers, such as the case of Arithmancer Series by White Squirrel.

**** Dumbledore would be removed as Headmaster- he might even step down voluntarily in remorse, once the Basilisk is dealt with. If Harry publically discovers the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, there may be other political fallout. Imagine if the Ministry stepped in after all that and discovered Harry's home life? He might be fostered to a trustworthy family [e.g.: Malfoy or Crouch or even Bones so long as it isn't Weasley, given that their daughter released the beast] who could contine his education while Hogwarts is shut down for restructuring.

Whenever conceptualizing plot consequences, take another pass and ask 'what would be worse, yet still likely?'

It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]], linkffn(3571753), a dimensional travel and really grim-dark at places. It was written before DH was published, and the author guessed right about Snape. In that other world, Ginny still got the Diary, 4 students were killed, and she was caught in the act and sentenced to Azkaban.

*** Opinions may differ. I love me my canon rehashes. There's always room in my reading list for yet another one. I was reading the books as published and I've been following HP fanfiction for a long time. I just don't get tired of it.

Every time, there's some new flavour. It's just whether the writing can support the story.

** I want to start off by pointing out that "changes" is an extremely broad term since literally any deviation from canon qualifies. It could be massive or minor, far reaching or very limited. So it is tough to answer your query.

So I will give you 5 but just keep in mind they may be grander than what you were thinking when asking such a question.

- 1: Harry paired with underdeveloped canon characters beyond the norm. I am not talking complete OC, but known characters who were underdeveloped or not developed in canon. Daphne, for example, has been commonly used as an unknown canon character who can be developed out. But there are tons more like Katie for example who need more love by fan fic authors.

- 2: Harry attending one of the other Tri-Wizard schools (Beauxbatons for example). This is hard to find because it's a lot of effort to completely develop a new school world. It's like writing Harry Potter all over again.

- 3: Removal of horcruxes from the story. Basically no horcruxes plain and simple. Other reasons can be found for Voldemort or perhaps Voldemort IS vanquished and a new dark lord appears.

- 4: Removal of the Weasleys as major plot devices or characters. So, in essence, Ron would not be part of the Golden trio and he, and the other Weasleys, Ginny included, would be background characters with no major role.

-and finally the one I have been looking for but struggle to ever find-

- 5: New interpretations of the prophecy, or perhaps new prophecies altogether. Maybe Dumbledore is the dark lord for example. Or maybe Harry is, or perhaps the prophecy was miss interpreted and there is no dark lord but rather he must vanquish his inner demons. Who knows. The point is, a reinterpretation of the prophecy or even a complete re-write could make things very interesting.

*** Not sure why you were sitting at zero points. You make a good point in the first bullet. I've been interested in reading Harry/Katie fics and there's a real lack of them.

** Actually develop the personalities into something realistic. Often we get Weasley bashes that begin immediately, with no character development to that point. I want a reason within the plot of your story as to why someone should be hated. Not just because they are an all of a sudden asshole, ya know? I see this with Dumbledore (where Harry/Hermione/OotP people hate him outright) and with Snape. Even Harry didn't hate Snape outright, it was earned.

** I would enjoy those changes!

I like effects to follow changes in a story. I like it when the author has clearly gone through all the players in the story, and seen how their one change might have made even minor characters act differently. The end result is usually a snowball effect, where one change at the start makes massive differences a few years later.

I especially like it when the change resulting from a previous change is surprising, but logical on examination.

For example, will Moody not being kidnapped make a difference to any of his fellow aurors, in or out of the Order? (I.e. did his being kidnapped possibly lead to some of what we saw in original canon? Will he be more effective in overseeing security for the tournament? Will he help Harry?)

How will /not/ being the diary user change Ginny's entire life? Will she make new friends? Will she be better placed to help Luna (who she grew up next to and knew before school), or will she become part of the bullying problem herself?

BTW, don't actually answer these! I look forward to discovering the fic one day, and finding out.

** Now note these aren't attacks on you, merely things you should question yourself on what you want to do with your story. How much you want to put in your story, and still make it make sense.

1: The user of the diary. Why are you going to make the changes? How differently will Ginny be affected by not being controlled by the diary? Who will be the owner of the diary? Draco? Luna? Colin? Someone else? If it's Draco will he change sides after it's revealed that it's him? If it's someone else how differently will their behavior be changed from the experience?

2: In not having it be Alastor Moody that Crouch Jr impersonates who will it be? Why is it that person? How did Crouch Jr get the person defenseless enough to be able to impersonate them?

I seriously don't think that Crouch Jr can impersonate Snape, Snape is a very tricky character to act in such a manner, it has to be someone else if it isn't Moody. Make sure the person you decide makes sense, and make sure that they were taken down in a believable way.

3: What other changes do you want to use? (Don't answer this, this is theoretical). Will Harry use his ability to speak to snakes more? That could be cool to see, what about the D.A. Will that still be around if it's in your story? Depending on how far you want to go with your story of course.

Will Cedric Diggory die? Will he life? What happens differently in the cemetery then what happened in canon?

Pairings if any. Who do you want to get paired with? I personally think that Harry/Hermione is way overused. If you want to stick with canon ships you have to develop Ginny's character more. And how will you do that if Ginny isn't the owner of the diary? Because again by not being the owner of the diary Ginny's personality will change because of it and you have to make the change of Ginny's personality believable.

How about other characters? How much do you want characters like Neville, Draco, Ron, the twins, Lavender, Padma and Parvati or whoever else. How much do you want to get them involved? It would be great to see Neville become more confident in himself, but it would also be cool to see other characters helping out in your story.

And other similar questions that you need to ask yourself. Why are the changes you want to do good? How differently will they affect the characters? The main and minor characters each?

How involved will Dumbledore be? Will he be dark character? Morally grey? Grandfatherly character? Will he help Harry and the others more then he did in canon? What about Minerva, the Order of the Phoenix and other Professors? How much do you want them to help out in Harry's life. Make it make sense as I said previously.

Again these notes aren't to attack you, merely to inform you on what you should be thinking of as a writer. I hope the story goes well
