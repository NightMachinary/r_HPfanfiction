I don't mind if she's just a side/background character. I'm just sick of seeing her treated like a bimbo.

Thanks!


** I'd like to introduce you to the only good Ron/Lavender story ever written. [[https://windschildfanfictionwriter.tumblr.com/post/182811252478/nice-things][It's short, but sweet]]

She's also very nicely written in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725072/1/Harry-and-Luna-Against-the-High-Inquisitor][Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor]], though she's more of a background character here.

** So, this is a series over 1 million words long and I don't precisely remember which parts are Lavender centered, but linkao3(103340) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond]] version of Lavender is just great.

*** iirc, one of the stories revolves around Harry hunting down the last Death Eater and he has to investigate a werewolf village. Lavender shows up (survived Greyback, but heavily affected by attack) and helps Harry, goes through a serious act. Don't want to spoil too much but it's definitely one of the more heroic portrayals of her while maintaining true to her character

Pretty sure it is "Hunters and Prey"

**** I like Northumbrian's portrayal of Lavender in his stories. She appears mostly in the Muggle Interface Team stories but has cameos in the others.

** linkao3(2218554)

It's not Lavender-centric but it does have Parvati remembering Lavender. It has a realistic, not overly romanticised or bimbo-fied depiction of her. It's part of a popular series by a popular author, that's about the different female characters in HP and gives them the character development the books weren't able to cover

** Lavender Brown is a Healer in this fic, which isn't finished. She's a side character who if I remember correctly shows up in like chapter 6? Anyway the fic is rated M and does have smut.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
