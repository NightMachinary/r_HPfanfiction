#+TITLE: [Prompt] Ron Weasley fancies himself a genius, but really, he just always inevitably falls ass-backwards into success. Nobody takes him seriously, but nobody can argue with the results, and thus, he spends his entire life failing upwards. Harry Potter is his long-suffering hetero life partner.

Basically, focus on Ron just somehow lucking his way into all the success, and Harry just being dragged along, despite wanting things to be fairly normal.
