Honestly I have never thought of this trio till I red a story about them boding with a werewolf blood bond. Lupa something. It was really good and I am looking for anymore that is just as good if not better.


** The Draco Dormiens series was the first and last Harry/Hermione/Draco series I've ever read.

** [[http://keiramarcos.com/2016/02/evil-author-day-2016/][The Unspeakable Plot]]. Second story on the page, must join LJ community to read. WIP. Summary: Magic is dying. Six people will sacrifice themselves in hopes they will be able to go back far enough to fix it.

She has another WIP with that pairing (Darkly Loyal) that was on a challenge site but has been taken down until she finishes it. She usually only posts finished stuff, except on Evil Author Day. That one is also time travel, but a completely different plot. I have a copy saved, if you want to PM me.

She makes the trio seem really believable - especially in Darkly Loyal, which has lots of references to the rough spots in establishing the relationship.

** For a triad that includes three popular pairings (Harry/Draco, Draco/Hermione and Harry/Hermione), there really isn't much on the three of them together which is a shame because I love this trio.

Some stories I enjoyed were:

*Raging Sensations Series*. Start with the fic, Raging Sensations and there are 3 sequels (about 19k words total so it's pretty short).

*Running from Lions* and 2 sequels (about 17k, so another short one)

*Soul of the Wolves*. This is probably from the same writing challenge as the story you read as it also features a werewolf bond.

*Bound by Duty* also features Ron (so it's a foursome), but there are some good H/Hr, H/D, D/Hr interactions in the story.

Fics I haven't personally read yet but are on my list to check out, so I can't speak on their quality:

*The Trouble with Marriage Laws* (WIP)

*To Earn Hermione Jane* (possibly abandoned)

*Tempting Fate* (WIP but updating slowly)

*The Invitation* (WIP and updating very slowly)

  The war is done and his parents are gone, and Draco decides it is time to rebuild the Malfoy name. But in reaching out to the Ministry for one simple project of cataloging artifacts, Draco gets more than he bargained for. Much more. Wishes aren't simple things, it turns out.
