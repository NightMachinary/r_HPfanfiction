Looking for two Harry/Hermione fics.

The first -- Hermione finds a spell that is like a reverse obliviation or something, and uses it on herself and Harry. Then they run away.

The second -- the very start of the story begins with a confrontation Dumbledore's Office between two sides -- Dumbledore, Molly, Ron and Ginny... and Harry and Hermione. I think the argument is talking about how Harry should accept being controlled by the Weasleys?

#+begin_quote
  Harry is hit by a misfired undoing spell in third year and starts to remember things causing him to flee together with Hermione and a few others, including a godfather he didn't know he had. For Wizarding Britain and Dumbledore in particular old oaths and secrets are now brought to light. Dumbledore bashing, AU. Story ends at the end of the year, continued in a sequel (not yet up)

******** You did nothing whatsoever to indicate that that specific fic was bad. All you said was 'i regret clicking that link' and from this statement one would infer that you most likely did not enjoy that fic. in saying so, such a statement does in fact indicate your taste, as you practically revealed your dislike for that fic. I'm not sure about you, but i believe i would be correct in saying that i and most others would be right to assume we would be able to, to a minimal degree, deduce what your taste in fanfiction is. For example, if I said i did not like fruit, it would be fair to assume I might possibly be on the unhealthy side. if you still don't understand why you were wrong, THEN REPLY REPLY REPLY TO ME

** Might be another one where Harry comes out from under a love potion and has to learn the spells to detect and dispell the effects so he can use it on Hermione before the Weasleys realize he's free. He succeeds and they book it.

  This is my take on the Manip!Dumbledore vs. sophisticated Harry idea. The story takes place just after the Tri-Wizard Tournament and will extend through Harry's 6th year. This is most definitely a Harry/Hermione/other story. Starts HHr.
