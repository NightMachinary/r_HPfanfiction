I was heavily involved in the HP fandom many years ago. My absolute favorite fanfic of all time is Lady Jaida and Dorkorific's "The Shoebox Project," which was marauder-era RL/SB. It remains one of my favorite things I've ever read.

I would love to read a similarly well-written, in-character story featuring an adult Harry falling in love/being in a relationship with either Ginny or Draco. I would particularly love something with action/adventure/mystery (maybe having to do with Auror training). In other words, I like a heavy dose of plot with my romance (or a heavy dose of romance with my plot).

My main criteria is that it be well-written. Back in my HP fandom days, all the best stories seemed to be posted on LiveJournal. (This was ten years ago.) I don't know who the best authors, stories, or sites are any more.

Any and all help is appreciated! I miss the HP fandom, and would love to discover some great stories.


** While tusing is correct about one of the best epic action fics in the fandom, i would argue it is not a good representation of the best /writing/ in the fandom. The author has written stories after, and as it was his first foray into writing at that scale, its not the best work (please don't take this the wrong way, it is still great for fanfiction writing, but its just not the best you can find).

One problem with half of your request is hp/gw is a heavily avoided ship in the fandom since the movies came out, by readers and writers. So, as there are less authors writing it, there will be less cream rising to the top. That and my lack of reading main-ship-slash fics will lead me to recommend around the edges of your request. Many of my recs will be to show you what I feel is the some of the best writing around.

Best writing: Overall

linkffn(4152700) Cauterize: one shot, artistic and moving. No other fic says as much in as few words.

linkffn(4798208) An Interview with Justin FinchFletchley: Written in interview format, it really feels like you are listening to a postwar expose, where secrets that were kept during the aftermath of the 2nd war finally are revealed to the general public. Fun personal snippets are woven in, which makes a fic that is 100% dialogue still feel like a story.

linkffn(6892925) Stages of Hope: Novella length, this story follows a broken HP/HG/NL/LL as they fall from a war torn world into a different dimension. The author does a great job of mixing PoV to show these 4 weary travellers doing everything they can to keep themselves and each other alive on their quest to defeat Voldemort. Short chapters keep energy and intensity up, so once you start reading you will be hard pressed to stop.

Best HP/GW:

linkffn(4101650; 4337434; 5053251) Backward With Purpose dualogy (third book is an incomplete epilogue): Arguably the best time travel do over fic. It follows Harry, Ginny and Ron on a last ditch quest to save their family and friends from death during the second war. But all is not as it seems, and travelling back in time may have caused unexpected changes that cannot be overcome. Noteworthy over others in this genre due to a very well planned and consistent timeline, which reacts in expected and unexpected ways to the changes our travellers incite.

linkffn(3571753) The World As We Knew It: novel length, this fic follows Harry as he wakes up in a different world. He (and others that were drawn there with him) struggle with the helping this new world and making it back to their own. With a background H/G ship the romance is not very central to the plot, but the writing is very good. A perfect storm of good writing, good plot, and good OCs make this fic well worth reading.

Best HP/DM: Non-slash, friendship

linkffn(6257522) A Fine Spot of Trouble: Well written, with snappy riposte between characters. A story that highlights the banter between former enemies which leads to an unlikely friendship.

Best In-Progress: (with regular updates)

linkffn(11111990) Grow Young With Me: a heartwarming story of a burgeoning romance between Harry and a muggle OC as Harry struggles to be a good single father to his three kids. The writing is great, and shows good characterizations a development. While the pace is slow, if you want some romance and actual descriptions of young kids as characters (although overall a bit too well behaved), this is the fic for you.

linkffn(10937871) Blindness: Very well written, this fic takes you into a world where harry has a disability; he is blind. As a semi-super harry fic with an interesting exploration of magic, you will come for the unique idea and stay for the guilty pleasure.

linkffn(11160991) 0800-Rent-A-Hero: A satiric comedy, this fic has a goal of using lots of cliches and coming out as a good story regardless. With great writing so far, and an interesting storyline, the author is currently succeeding. It follows Harry as he was drawn to another dimension against his will, and to spite his captors tells the truth in a misleading way - leading to a post as...divination professor?

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** linkffn(Sword of the Hero; Defiance of the Hero; Soul of the Hero) is one the best you'll find in the /entire fandom/ (read: not just HP/GW) when it comes to action and adventure, bar none. While there's an overarching HP/GW, it's not expanded on much, but I still highly recommend this trilogy to anyone new or returning to the fandom just to show what fanfiction is capable of when it comes to well written, jaw-dropping, epic-scale action (which you'll find in the second book of the trilogy).

** Ah ha! Let me link you my favorite Harry/Draco! Linkffn(4109630)

Also by the same author (who I recommend you look through): Linkffn(4359350)

Edit to add: An epic, multi-book adventure for Harry/Draco goodness, but the romance blooms latter in the series and can get rather depressing at times. Linkffn(2580283)

  HPDM slash. Nothing in Harry's life has gone the way he expected, and that includes being the mediwizard assigned to treat Lucius Malfoy. But he's Harry; he can deal with this. And he can deal with Draco Malfoy's nonsensical flirting, too.
