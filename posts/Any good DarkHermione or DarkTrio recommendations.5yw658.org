Hey all,

As the title suggests, I'm looking for a good dark!Hermione or dark!Trio fic. I primarily read on ff.net or AO3.

Thanks!


** I'll start with the classic that gets posted in half of the requests on this sub: linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts)

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

As a note, don't let Snape as a main character throw you off -- he's not paired with Hermione.

**** The author is currently writing a Game of Thrones self insert (as the Blackfish, who becomes a pirate king). He has returned to post ACA chapters after pretty long breaks before though. I guess you could always pm him on [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/jacobk.74864/][Spacebattles]] and ask if he has any future plans for the story.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Hermione is a sister to Harry, a mother to Rose and Hugo, a wife to Ron, and a Legilimens and Unspeakable. She is also very, very angry. A look at a Hermione who developed the instincts she evidenced with Marietta Egdecombe and Dolores Umbridge. AU, though canon compliant. *Drama/horror. COMPLETE.*

** linkao3(The Two Body Problem by Tozette) is supposed to be the origin story for a dark lord!Hermione. It mainly stars Hermione and diary!Tom and touches on the nature of dark magic. I like it a lot and it's not very long either, but Hermione doesn't really do much evil in the story itself beyond torturing Tom.

  Ginny made a thin, distressed sound. “I ... Look, I promised Tom I wouldn't let him be handed in,” she said in a small voice.“Well, if he's going to go around petrifying people, I don't see much reason why people ought to keep their promises to him,” said Hermione crossly. [Hermione gets the diary. Things go differently from there. AU.]
