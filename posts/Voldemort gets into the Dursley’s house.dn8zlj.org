He found it somehow and was able to get in using whatever excuse you want (blood wards don't apply cause he has Harry's blood, Harry or the Dursley's renounce the other party as family, etc.). As Voldemort enters he sees Vernon going up the stairs and kills him because screw muggles that's why. What Voldemort didn't know is that Vernon was going up the stairs to Harry's room with the intention of killing Harry. Magic somehow recognizes this as Voldemort saving Harry's life. A very unwilling Harry now owes Voldemort a life debt which he is forced to repay.


** you know this gave me an idea for a twisted story and prompt.

There is currently another bot called [[/u/kzreminderbot][u/kzreminderbot]] that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [[https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot][this link]] to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
