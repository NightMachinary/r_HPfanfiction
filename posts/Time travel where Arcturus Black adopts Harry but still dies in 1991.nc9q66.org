It has been a while since I read the story, and I just can't seem to find it!

Other details I remember:

- Harry came back a few years before he should have gotten his Hogwarts letter
- He convinced Arcturus to adopt him because there was no other Heir available
- Harry took a different name and faked his birth date so that he went to Hogwarts one or two years earlier
- He was sorted into Slytherin
- Whe Dumbledore realized he was missing, he kidnapped another boy and memory-charmed him to believe that he is Harry Potter
- The true Harry helped the other boy recover his memories

I hope anyone else remembers this story! Thanks!


** Sounds like The Dead Master by Falconlux.
