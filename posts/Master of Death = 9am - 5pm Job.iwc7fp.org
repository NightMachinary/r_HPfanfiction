Unbeknownst to all but the "Masters of Death", the gathering of thw Hallows isn't a gateway to incredible magical power or mastery over life and death.

It is a job application.

When Harry arrives at the mystical version of Kings Cross, Dumbledore explained he'd just come out of probation and was supposed to guide Harry through orientation.

The goal of the job is simple, the force of Death seperates the soul from the body at the point of Death, their job is to guide that soul on to the afterlife.

Due to Harry's unique circumstances (being the Horcrux) he has the job but is also able to interact with the physical/living world as if he hadn't died. Making Harry this immortal figure who goes travelling around the world to help souls passover.

▪︎▪︎▪︎

Would love it to include cute/bittersweet moments where Harry helps his friends pass on to the afterlife.


** So, sort of like the grim reapers from the show /Dead Like Me/?

** I almost skipped over this but I did a double take because I thought it said 9 PM - 5 AM.

Now a really want a story where MoD Harry has to juggle his insane night job with his schooling or his social life or something.

** Well, crap. There is one and I can't for the life of me find it again.

It's a series of little snippets of Harry showing up when people die after he had vanished with the death of Voldemort.

The summary includes something to the effect of "the next time Colin saw harry was..." I don't remember if it was actually Colin, but it absolutely has him acting as a psychopomp to a whole list of canon characters and their relatives.
