Browsing the sidebar, I discovered a subreddit for this AQ thing. Anyone mind enlightening me as to what that is? I can't make head nor tails of it.


** It's a fanfic series set in the American wizarding world about 10 years or so after the end of the HP series. Almost no crossover with the Rowling universe but it's an inventive, complex look at an exploration of themes not dissimilar to those considered in the Harry potter series proper.

It's quite polarizing, some love it, some hate it, rather fewer are meh about it. I personally think it's brilliant.

It's not finished, only 4 or 5 books have been published but they're all great.

I feel like if the original HP hadn't existed it would be popular, but it's kind of just a rehash of canon in a lot of ways. It's really not all that enjoyable to me.

**** Rehashing canon? Demons, underworlds, actual Death manifested, child-sacrificing societies, murder plots and the whole shebang is like the original books? I don't know what the hell you read but the original series is full of a million horrible plot holes and unexplained yet needed details especially later on in the series, with almost no tension even reading it as a child. I haven't been able to read past the first 4 books ever since late elementary school. Rowling's Creativity: 10/10. World-building and Structure: even Twilight was better.

Main character encounters villain/bad thing and struggles to defeat it each school year doesn't making it a freaking rehash of canon.

** The bit I've read didn't seem like fanfiction to me. It seems a wasted opportunity to post it as fanfiction when it could probably have been a very saleable original novel.

*** A lot of the plot (especially in later books) is firmly tied into some of Rowling's world building so I don't know if it could have ever been taken out of context completely.

** It's basically a series of original novels disguised as Harry Potter fanfiction. It's set in America 10 years after Harry Potter and is pretty much only connected by the world/magic system and a couple of throwaway references to Voldement (as a historical figure). Other than that it's mostly original. Original characters, original story, tonnes of original worldbuilding.

It's also very professionally written. The books are written as a single unit and then published chapter by chapter once they are finished, so the prose and editing are top notch, for a fanfic at least. The original characters are somewhat divisive, especially the protagonist Alexandra. They are interesting and well written, but can come across as unlikeable to some people, especially in the earlier books.

The series is unfinished unfortunately. Currently the first 4 of 7 books have been published. The author is allegedly still working on the 5th, though it's been 6 years since the 4th book was published, so who knows if or when that will happen.

** I think its pretty good, but the main character is pretty unlikable in the first chapter so I think that turns people off. I think she gets better, but there's always a problem where she's a bit bitchy. The world building, plotting, and generally excellent writing make up for it.

*** Yeah, she's definitely a flawed main character. It gives her a good deal of depth though!

**** Ditto. Read the first several chapters, but it never hooked me, & I gave up after chapter 11. Much better quality of writing than most fanfics, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.
