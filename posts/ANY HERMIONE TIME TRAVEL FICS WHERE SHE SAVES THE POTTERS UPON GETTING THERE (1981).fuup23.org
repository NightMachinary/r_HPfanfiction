  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13013582/1/In-the-Bleak-Midwinter][In the Bleak Midwinter]] isn't exactly what you're asking for, but it's awesome.

Hermione goes back in time to live with Tom Sr. and raise Tom Riddle Jr. to not be evil. Tom Sr. is delighted that his son is a wizard and decides to go all in on wizarding society to make sure Tom Jr. has nothing but the best, so with the help of a house elf, Tom fakes being a wizard and actively participates in the WW, while at the same time trying to revolutionize it with muggle knowledge.

One of my favorite fics. It's incomplete but the author is still updating it periodically.

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.
