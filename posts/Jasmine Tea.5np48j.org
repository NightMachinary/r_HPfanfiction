** I think I've never read any smut that deserved the attribute "solid" as much as this one.

Nothing overly fancy, nothing too dirty... just very solid.

** I concur with [[/u/UndeadBBQ][u/UndeadBBQ]] in his assessment; a well-expressed and artful bit of erotica. The dialogue towards the end was a little stilted, but it wasn't mood-breaking.

To OP: a little more info about the story than just a blind link would be appreciated in future.

** I'll be honest, it was just okay. Not good, not bad, a bit boring, just okay. It's probably personal preference, judging from other responses to the thread, so don't take this negatively.

** Hey guys sorry for not giving context on this one. This story fell in my lap and I learned it was written by a friend of a friend of a friend. I really enjoyed it and thought I would share with others. I do agree with [[/u/wordhammer][u/wordhammer]] about the last bit.
