Read it once and can't find it, it ends up Harry/Hermione.

Basically instead of the whole series based in the 1990's its is pushed back 100 years or so. Voldemort was killed and a ball is being held. An older lady of the court or such reveals that Hermione had slept in the same room as Ron and Harry during the war which is a no no. That damages Hermione's reputation and Harry steps up as Ron backs out. Harry and Hermione marry and its a story of their marriage.

It is very well told and sticks true to a lot of that time era.

Is it this one? Not sure if it's also hosted on FFN, I always read it at Portkey.

A nice fluffy fic. I keep it bookmarked for rereads every now and then! (:
