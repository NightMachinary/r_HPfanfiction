** Fred and George are pretty popular in fanfics, but seldom the main characters in them. Most decent-sized Weasley Twin fics I've found tend to be about some female OC who's probably a self-insert, who befriends the twins and most often gets romantically involved with one or both of them.

I did find one story that's okay, though. Not GREAT, but okay.

"George Weasley and the Computational Error" is a twist on the classic "travel back to relive your Hogwarts days and make the war less horrible" story. This time an adult George is the time-traveller, and his goal is to save Fred... except he actually does physically travel back in time, body and all, and needs to make up a new identity for himself in the past. It's made more complicated by the fact that whenever Fred drinks pumpkin juice, the older George ends up possessing his younger self.

  George Weasley may be 40 years old now, but he still misses his twin dearly. And when he has the chance to go back to 1989 and see Fred alive again and stop everything from happening, he can't resist. George's relationship with everyone he loves, however, will change in the process. Canon (mostly) and Time Travel. NoSlash. COMPLETE

** Seriously. Despite the Twins' popularity, these fics are insanely hard to find.

Anyways, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines][Crossing Lines]] by plutoplex is one that I vouch that has decent writing and storyline. I really love how the author emphasizes the Twins differences but still kept the Twins' bond.

Basically, they are in their 6th year attempting to get their names into the Goblet of Fire since they are not of age yet. Fred and George tried creating something that would age them, however they instead ended up in the Marauder's era.

***** Finished and I have to say it was a very interesting fic, but it was kind of confusing at times. I had trouble figuring out what characters knew and what character's motives were. Overall I sincerely hope more Fred and George fics come out in the future. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

****** To you as well.

I think I like a bit of mystery in a fic. It gives a bit of suspense. Anyways, I spent the past couple of days looking or more Fred and George fics since I'm intrigued by these two characters as well and I think I found two more.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7104912/1/Beware-of-Potions][Beware of Potions]] by SerenaRiis seems really on the stressful end of the spectrum. Which means a lot of cliffhangers. Luckily the story is complete so it's fine. A good read overall I think. linkffn(7104912)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4277165/1/The-Only-Difference][The Only Difference]] by Cerulean Musings is another promising fic I found. I just started this one myself and did not finish reading it yet, but it seems like an interesting read so far. linkffn(4277165)

  Fred and George create a new product in the summer before their 6th year, but when one of them samples it, they find that it has far different effects than they'd hoped for. Slightly AU after GoF, centered mostly on the twins. No slash.

  -Set during OotP- No one can see the difference between Fred and George. George is the only one who sees it and he's the only one who can do something about it. Warning: anorexia, bulimia. Complete.

******* The only difference seems interesting. I'm not usually into that eating disorder or real life crisis kinds of things, I usually prefer to escape from those issues when I read. However, I really enjoyed that Netflix movie with Keanu Reeves and Lily Collins. I'm going to give that one a try , thank you so much.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.
