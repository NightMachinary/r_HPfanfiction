:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think the fic is on ff. It's start's on the graveyard with Voldemort newly resurrected and then Harry somehow end in this alternate realm where people from all over land.

There are 2 kinda factions. Harry is of the light faction and has to kill people from the dark faction. When you kill someone from the other side you get some of their darkness/lightness and this way achieve balance. Harry teams up with a girl.

When he achieved the balance he is back one the graveyard only a few moments after he left. He then forces Voldemort in the alternate realm who also comes back soon after. They then decide not to fight because it's kind of pointless.

The fic is an oneshot if I remember right. Hope someone knows the fic and thank you in advance.


** I think it's this one!

  Harry's trapped in the cemetary, Voldemort laughing at him with his Death Eater. Thankfully, he learned a spell enabling him to escape this trap. He should have known things would go wrong if he tried to take things in his own hands...
