Are there any stories where a sympathetic villain is thrown into the HP universe and joins Harry's side? I don't think that someone like Sauron the generic Bond villain who is just in for the power would be suitable, but someone who showed some integrity or honour (like Darth Vader, Admiral Thrawn or Prince Zuko) could fit that role.

#+begin_quote
  Like, imagine Darth Vader dying in Episode 6 but instead of turning into a force ghost he is thrown out of the Veil while the Death Eaters hold a bunch of kids at wandpoint. Vader is immediately reminded of his own atrocities in the Jedi Temple and takes action.
#+end_quote

Are there any such crossovers around that DO NOT include the Marvel or DC universes, fem!Harry or Hermione paired with the crossover guy or m/m?


** A Zuko x Harry Potter universe would actually be fucking amazing. Either him passing as a wizard in Hogwarts or just helping Harry in the summer time to learn Fire Bending. It makes me excited just thinking about it lmao.

** Grand Admiral Thrawn is a bad ass. Literally my favorite villain ever; Zahn did such a good job of making him just seem so dangerous and refined. It is a shame that Disney did away with the EU, but to me the Thrawn Trilogy make a much better 7,8, and 9 then the poorly written clusterfuck that Last Jedi and Force Awakens were.

As to your request? The only fic that is somewhat close to what you want is the Denarian Trilogy, as Denarians are rather evil. Meciel becomes a "good" guy through guiding Harry. Slight HP/Dresden Xover.
