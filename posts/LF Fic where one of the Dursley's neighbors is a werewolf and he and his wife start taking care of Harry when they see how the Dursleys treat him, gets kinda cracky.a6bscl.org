Ok, so I can't find this fic and I seem to not have saved it, and I desperately want to re-read it. Basically, one of the Dursley's neighbors is a werewolf, I think his wife is a squib (not sure on that) and they end up encountering Harry when he's really little. I distinctly remember a scene, after they've first met him, where the wife spots him walking to school in the cold without a proper jacket and she shames the heck of Petunia for allowing that, and gradually he ends up living with them. One of the major elements of this is that Harry is sort of an accidental dark lord - the local werewolves all think he's a cute kid and the whole pack ends up moving into the neighborhood, vampires and hags show up because some reason I don't remember, and it gets ridiculous but still super fun. It wasn't done when I last read it and I don't know if it's updated since, but I don't care, it was great even unfinished.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
