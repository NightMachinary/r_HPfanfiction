I don't want mindless bashing, puppy-kicking-Snape bashing, rather I want some realistic bashing, I think he is a very well written, morally grey character. I want his negative side explored just like his positive side is explored. Like Harry doesn't take it well that Snape loved his mother or a marauder fanfic that shows both James and Snape in negative light.

He is a little redeemed at the end but it's great

  Harry finds out that he's Snape's son. It goes as badly as possible.

**** Seconded.

I hate stories where they change Harry's parentage but this one is so good that its one of my favourites.
