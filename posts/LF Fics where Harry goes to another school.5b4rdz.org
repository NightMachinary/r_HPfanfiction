I like the idea of Harry going to other schools for one reason or another. Similar to Brave New World. Can be 1st year or start in 7th. Looking for completed or regularly updated fics.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

linkffn(the a la grenouille) - currently in 4th year, regularly updated. Haven't read this one yet.

I also definitely second HP&The Irish Choice. It's fantastic.

**** A pity, I really liked it. Have they made any mention of allowing it to be adopted? I typically don't enjoy adopted fics but for this one I just need closure. lol

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
