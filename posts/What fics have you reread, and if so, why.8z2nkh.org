** One of the first longish fan fictions is ever read was linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord). It was the first story I'd read where Harry was paired with an OC character. Sure, the writing isn't up to scratch, but the story is brilliant! I haven't ever read a fan fiction before that talks about the first Wizarding War, and the author has put enough time into world and character building. I keep coming back to it for the unique relationship that Harry has with almost everyone in this though. That, and when I first read it, I built up a world in my head as I read the FanFiction that has stuck with me since. I wouldn't mind getting lost in the beautiful village of Hogsmeade circa 1940 during my day dream sessions.

I read linkffn(Time To Spare by EmySabath) a little after AD, and the basic plot summary intrigued me. Time travel with Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter back to the Marauders Era!? I simply had to read more! But what keeps me coming back to it again and again is the world expansion that the author attempts and the unique way of Harry fighting the war. It taught me another thing several re-reads later though --- even the most bitter enemies put aside their differences and work towards a common goal if their life depends on it.

Then there's also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Pendant of Slytherin by neednotknowtheirname). I have read this at least thrice because of the unique relationship that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy have in this fanfic. That, and the fact that Snape features a lot in it, and plays a central role in the story.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.

#+begin_quote
  It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** Stages of Hope, Lady Diligence, 800-Rent-a-Hero, most stuff by kathryn518, and Vitam Paramus (Not sure why but I really like this one), oh and Culture Shock (crossover) gets revisited now and again, and I've gone back to Jeconais stuff a few times as well. Most other things, I might re-visit but often can't get through it. Many works fall painfully flat on a second reading. Then there are the works that I have to keep re-reading because I've forgotten major plot points... like DPSW, or HP & Prince of Slytherin (both of which posted updates this weekend) and I don't mind a full refresh.

** Oh boy I hope you're ready for some Hermione/older Slytherin romance.

Hermione/Lucius:

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2506055/chapters/5564747][Muggle Studies]]. As part of his probation, Lucius is forced to attend Muggle Studies at Hogwarts -- taught by Hermione. /Why I like it: Really fragile Lucius, moments of great comedy/.

2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11506670/1/Driving-Miss-Granger][Driving Miss Granger]]. Hermione and Draco break up, and she has to ask Lucius for a ride home. /Why: Banter and steamy in-car romance/.

3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/951847/chapters/1861651][Rehabilitation]]. Lucius was incarcerated after the war and has mentally shut himself off from the world; Hermione is his new case manager. /Why: Just a weird, good fic/.

Hermione/Severus

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788107/1/Another-Dream][Another Dream]]. Snape and Hermione bond over a few Christmases at Grimmauld Place. /Why: It's hilarious, fun to read, and has such a happy ending. Really anything by Dragoon811 earns a spot on my favorites list/.

2. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7627246/1/Loose-Lips-and-Slurred-Slips][Loose Lips and Slurred Slips]]. Hermione gets drunk and admits some things to Snape. /Why: It's absolutely hilarious/.

3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2155671/chapters/4711554][Slightly Less Sinister]]. Hermione receives an offer she can't refuse, and wants to prepare herself for it. /Why: I feel used yet clean at the end of it./

I read all of these at least once a year. Another Dream and Loose Lips I've read again twice this year already. And now I'm going to go read them again...
