#+TITLE: LF OC from our modern world reincarnated into HP-verse. So kinda like a self insert, but not. If I would give it a type name, it would be an Isekai-esqe thing.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wand-hp-si.260414/page-55#post-11066012][Wand by Hiver]] is on a forum site which makes it a bit harder to read, but I linked to a chapter index

I know I'm forgetting a bunch, but these are all I can remember off the top of my head. Just search the subreddit for SI, they almost always have knowledge of canon

*** I'm trying to read how do I weaponize this? Is it translated or something? Why does the main character refer to himself as 'We' all the time, and calls flying 'air', as in 'I cannot air as well as Harry' like wtf is this? Is it just a gimmick for the first few chapters or something? Or can the author not write fluently?

Edit: thanks for the list BTW, not trying to argue with you, just annoyed that the story is so hard to read since it sounds like it could be good.

**** It's written in an extremely casual tone, stuff like calling flying "airing" is just to be funny.

As for the "we", I'm getting a bit of a Deadpool style multiple personalities in the same head kind of vibe.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
