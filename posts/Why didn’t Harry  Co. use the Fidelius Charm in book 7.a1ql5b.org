Is there any in-universe answer that makes sense why nobody (mainly Dumbledore, knowing he would die soon and leave Harry to fight the war) ever thought of teaching Harry, Ron and especially Hermione the Fidelius Charm? Why they never thought of teaching it to themselves? Hermione prepared, read up on many things, yet didn't think the Fidelius Charm could be useful?

The existence of the old Fidelius on Grimmauld Place isn't really satisfactorily, as upon Dumbledore's death every member became a new secret keeper and could share the secret... which was a risk Dumbledore must have known of.

Maybe the problem is that they needed to own the property. But then they could've at least recast it on Grimmauld Place (to eliminate the Snape threat and reduce the number of people able to share the secret), or Hermione's parents house, or Dumbledore could've organized something in book 6.

Lily and James managed it shortly after leaving Hogwarts, and yet our three heroes spend the 7th book camping in the wilderness.

So yeah... any in-story reason? Maybe even one mentioned in the books that I simply forgot? (Its been a while since I read the last book.)


** I mean, I will always love HP, but there are a lot of plot holes and that is one of them.

The biggest plot hole to me has always been that Lily is muggle raised and knows how to survive in the muggle world, and it's implied that purebloods can't function in the muggleworld and attack muggles at random. If they attack muggleborns, it's usually because of the trace, the house is registered if they are underage or attached to the floo, or they can someone find the magic. So why didn't she and James, especially as James had a ton of money, just leave the country and live like muggles?

This kind of relates to Harry and Hermione, too. They have to use magic to track down the horocruxes, but at night they should just 'go muggle' and find a hotel room.

*** I guess that could be explained because there weren't only purebloods among Voldemort's followers but also halfbloods who could have grown up in the muggle world, like Snape, and maybe even muggleborns. And unless they changed their appearance permanently they could have been spotted at some point. For the hotels they'd also have needed money or to confund a muggle receptionist every time... so given that there's still a risk that they could be spotted, I guess it does make sense to me that they'd rather rely on magical means of protection than live with that threat over their heads. The more people see them, the more likely it is they'll be found.

Lily and James not leaving also makes sense to me. For one, it was also their fight, they were members of the Order and probably didn't want to leave the country to Voldemort, and second: They never expected to be betrayed, their support system was in Britain, Dumbledore was looking out for them, other Order members were... Their chances of survival probably didn't seem so hopeless to them.

**** Look, there are over 500 Tescos in the UK. Voldemort does not have the manpower to supervise even half of that (and that's not even accounting for shifts). There are other supermarkets as well, and that's not even mentioning smaller stores. You have an estimated 45000 hotels in the UK. It takes one trip to the barber and Harry/Hermione are safe. Voldemort might be able to keep an eye on Grimmauld, Hogsmeade and Diagon, but Ipswich? Filey? Bangor (either of them)?

Either simply duplicate some with the Gemini charm, summon it with a simple "Accio", confund some bank teller to give it to you, use the invisibility cloak to "forage" some money in a bank... The possibilities are endless, and Hermione is the walking embodiment of "the ends justify the means". Just ask Marietta, Umbridge, Snape's robes, Malfoy's jaw or Lockhead's signature. She might feel bad about stealing from some poor farmer, but a multi-billion company?

***** Mate, that's one of the reasons a lot of people dislikes the canon. Magic can be abused as fuck, but they never explore the possibilities with it, not to mention that "Hermione" sprouts about wizards having no sense of logic while she herself doesn't think logicaly.

There are sooooo many plot holes that a non-retarded character like the ones in HP could've exploited that isn't even funny.

That's what fanfiction is all about. Exploit the holes (wow, that sounds kinky).

It would have guaranteed some Muggle casualties when Voldemort did come for her, too. Also, didn't they just go into hiding for her to have Harry? That seems like a recipe for Death Eaters to go looking in every Muggle hospital they can find.

Also, they could just Imperius Muggles and have them search for the Potters.

If they go as soon as they find out she's pregnant, even before Harry's born and the prophecy, even better. Voldemort probably wouldn't care and wouldn't even realize that he had a potential 'defeater' that way.

But then again, there wouldn't be a story if that happened. I think there are better reasons for Hermione and Harry not going muggle, but with Lily and James it is a headscratcher imo.

** Common fanon theory is that having Harry made James and Lily sitting ducks. Usually it is explained by not being able to apparate with a small child due to the still developing magical core, thus the need to rely on other means of transportation with a baby. (Which probably wouldn't have been a big issue if Voldemort hadn't specifically targeted them.)

IMO there is some support for the theory of not being able to apparate with children in the books: When the Weasleys and Harry take the portkey to the Quidditch World Cup, Arthur mentions to Diggory that he will be glad when all his children are able to apparate. When Dumbledore takes Harry for a sidealong apparition, other Hogwarts students ask how it was, indicating they have no experience with it.

Remember that the trio moved around a lot, apparating from place to place. I suppose that is overall a better strategy than relying on Fidelius Charm.

Is this how Fidelius works? I didn't think it was a requirement that someone be in the house at all times.

They could apparate out whenever they need to leave, or just walk through muggle London if need be (I'm not sure what house they'd have put under the Fidelius).

**** Well that problem was actually covered by the grimmauld place fidelius. First of all, they can't apparate directly in, which can be assumed to be a trait of the fidelius. So there's the potential for the death eaters to learn the general location by tracking and keep watch, like they did on grimmauld. Keep in mind the death eaters didn't know they were there, just had an assumption. Snape couldn't share the secret (either due to the tongue tying curse from moody or his secret allegiance). When they got caught apparating by whatshisname, grimmauld got compromised and they couldn't go back. At that point they lost access to their base and anything they stored there, and now needed to come up with new solutions on the spot whilst panicking and with ron hurt

Compare that to the godrics hollow incident where their escape was just another part of daily routine, they apparated away and set up camp. Being tied down to one spot puts them in danger when things go wrong. As far as bill living under the fidelius, he wasn't going anywhere. He was safe and likely making the most of a sort of 'honeymoon' until ron gatecrashed

Wizarding society could be a PGP web-of-trust style network of Fidelius enclaves. The only need to go outside would be to contact new muggleborns or send your children to Hogwarts.

But in that case, the ministry can only enforce laws (or tyranny) to the extent that secret keepers allow them to.

So what if this was resolved a long time in the past, by civil war or whatnot, and the outcome was a negotiated truce? Suppose wizards are bound by oath/magical contract/etc. not to live under their own Fidelii, and ministry agents are in turn bound by oath not to use veritaserum or legilimency (hole: Umbridge). When the Death Eaters took over, either they chose not to take their oaths, or something about the way the coup was accomplished prevented them from being recognized by magic as the legitimate government.

Bill, being a clever motherfucker with lots of experience with working around curse triggers and whatnot, realizes this means he is no longer bound by the oath and Fideliuses his own house.

Suppose the Cruciatus was invented after the agreement, or the agreement happened before there was widespread consensus against using torture to punish criminals, spies, and the like. (The other two are too useful to forswear.)

Suppose also that the negotiators had something like the parable of the boiled frog or the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kbm6QnJv9dgWsPHQP/schelling-fences-on-slippery-slopes][parable of murder Gandhi]], and realized that a society where you could go places without being Introduced to The Secret Keeper would be very different from theirs. Therefore, they would have made it impossible to expand the scope of the oaths later without a supermajority vote or something like a constitutional convention (which would put all kinds of things up for grabs).

Now, well, they /could/ open that can of worms, but regular-channels legislation and the aurors seem to be handling it well enough -- the vast majority of witches and wizards manage to get through life without being cruciated even once. And maybe the ministry thinks they have more to lose in a renegotiation than they stand to gain: throwing people in Azkaban with dementors without trial, summary executions without trial, real time monitoring of all magic used in muggle areas (or maybe all magic used by children?), real time monitoring for specific spoken words. (Surely Tabooing "crucio" would be effective enough and within the powers they already have; that's a canon plothole you've probably seen before.)
