I can re-read my favorite stories over and over, but that gets boring. And yet I'm having trouble finding anything new that's good. Everyone just writes terrible Drarry or Hermione/Snape stories these days. Almost all of the best stories were written before JKR turned the Potterverse into an extended McGuffin hunt from book 5 onward, because books 1-4 were actually stories about magic rather than toys. But there just HAVE to be good new stories out there that I'm missing. So, does anyone know of stories that are over 60k words (ideally 250-350k range, ideally complete) that are GOOD? The best kind expand upon magic, make the world feel magical. Fey magic, necromancy, rituals, enchantments, whatever. Stories along the line of "Nightmares of Futures Past" or "The Dark Lord's Equal" or "The Lie I've Lived", that's what I'm looking for. Or crossovers like "Havoc Side of the Force". Are any truly good stories still being made, or has the HP fandom run its course, killed by JKR's continued retcons?


** What do you want?

Adventure/thriller/excitement ; linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)

Horror/mystery/family : linkao3(Blackpool by TheDivineComedian)

World building/history/magic : linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower)

Politics/Drama/Friendship : linkao3(Break by K1toftheworthies)

Horror/fey magic/oneshot : linkao3(Stinging Nettles and Milking Pails by OceanBreeze7)

Romance/world building/character development : linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89)

Angst/friendship/growth : linkao3(The art of getting by by Sarewolf)

All of these are fantastic and have different themes/genres. Can't recommend any of them highly enough. The first four seem particularly up your alley with more magic and world building. The last few are just very well written.

*** Thanks, but as I'm not into slash, none of them. Maybe it means missing out on some good worldbuilding, but when you put Sirius, an AGGRESSIVELY hetero dude, with Remus or Snape or whomever, I just lose SoD and interest. Back in the day one didn't have to accept slash as the "cost" for a decent story, and I'm not willing to do so now.

**** Give the second string a chance. Yes, it has slash, but it's not the focus (other then as continuing the story, and only with 1 pairing), and it's not putting anyone with Snape. A lot of the pairings you do see are true to the books. It's very well written and a great re-read. It was just finished, too my absolute delight when I realized it a week ago.

The Stinging Pails and Milking Pails by OceanBreeze7 has no pairing in it and is very creepy, fearie magic that you said you liked. It's also really fecking creepy it's great I love it üòä.

** If you're looking for a series that focuses on magic and feels like a Harry Potter story, you should check out linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). So far there are 4 completed ‚Äúbooks‚Äù with each one better than the last.

The premise is that Tom Riddle turns to politics to achieve his goals around blood supremacy. This has led to restrictions on who can attend Hogwarts. A female Harry Potter switches places with her male cousin Archie Black and takes his place at Hogwarts.

There's a lot of plotting and characterization and world building. The magic is very interesting. This series isn't complete yet, but the last update ends at a very good stopping point (for now).

This story is more friendship-heavy than ship-focused.

** Since you want /recent/ stuff, I'm including some that are in-progress and currently updating - though only one of them seems to have a strict schedule.

A Place Apart just finished up, and the first chapter of the second story in the series is due within the next day or so (weekly updates). No pairing, rather fluffy/worldbuilding. If a lot of inner monologue will get on your nerves you may want to pass, though.

Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay - complete aside from an epilogue, to come at some later date. Fluffy, feel good crack.

That Universe Over There - cracky/fluff. Harry/Luna, accidental world domination.

Lord Mortis, The Accident - necromancy, friendship, crack treated semi-seriously - currently in-progress, updating every week or so.

Voldemort's Very Successful Guide to Reuniting A Family - crack, family. Explores different types of magic, currently in-progress with bi-weekly-ish updates.

Kicking Gotham - A DCU crossover mystery, currently complete, with a recently completed sequel.

Love, Fate and Prophecy - Supernatural crossover, mod!elements. Spins Harry as the middle Winchester brother, taken away from Hunters because Hunters bad according to MACUSA. In-progress, regularly updating, no slash pairings. Interesting take on the origin of wizards and how that intersects with spn canon.

Perfectly Normal - The author is currently posting the newest instalment with regular updates. More of a Gen fic, been a while since I've read it and I'm waiting on the newest part to finish to dive into it again. Don't shy away from the length of part one, I'm guessing the series will be pushing 1mil words by the time the current fic is finished.

One final note: Unless you're also anti-offscreen slash, try out Of a Linear Circle part two. It'll spoil some of the rest of the series (sort of, it was a rather easy mystery to figure out), but you'll also miss out on the snarry apologism while still getting some great worldbuilding as it takes place during the founders era. The romance lasts for like, one chapter, and you see none of it. It's also, imo, the absolute best bit of the monster that is oalc.

  Hunters are not allowed to raise magical children. When it is discovered that Mary is pregnant with a wizarding child, MACUSA steps in, and the Potters step up. Henry Winchester is raised as Harry Potter until security concerns send him to a family that does not know he exists. As Winchester luck dictates, the road will not be smooth. Especially when Heaven intervenes.

  Harry Potter has never been good at lying under pressure, and his latest misstep lands him in deep trouble. He's now the Lord of an extremely ancient, extremely Dark, previously extinct house of Necromancers. Lucky for him he has friends who can keep up, and enemies who are determined to draw the wrong conclusions.---Harry blinked. He had to stop himself from doing something very stupid, like screaming in a public place or trying to run and plowing into a wall.Waiting a small distance from the exit to the elevator were the absolute last people he'd wanted to see. There stood Lucius Malfoy, looking about as composed as ever, though the sheen of sweat on the edges of his brow and the way his faint smile looked like it could shatter at any moment somewhat soured the image of perfect pureblood Lord. Next to him was Fudge, whose trembling hands squeezed each other white. There was a woman beside them, he didn't know her but her stern and monocled form reminded him of a particularly cross McGonagall.‚ÄúLord Mortis?‚Äù The Minister inquired

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** The Purpose of Wings and With Whom to Dance are fantastic romance novels that are super recent. Both are Harry/Fleur.

While With Whom to Dance is entirely romance, The Purpose of Wings has an over-arching plot about the ICW, a murder-mystery, and magical creature oppression that makes it super interesting. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13745570/1/The-Purpose-of-Wings]] I can't recommend the story enough.
