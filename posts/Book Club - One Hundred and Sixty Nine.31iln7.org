Given that it's finally updated again, we'll go with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] for next time.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]]?

#+begin_quote
  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

** I truly did enjoy this fic (though it's not one of my all time favourites). It's light reading, for the most part, and definitely a bit of fun (as long as you're not completely allergic to cliche). It's got nearly sixty chapters, though, and I always find it hard to read fics with so many (no matter how short a chapter may or mayn't be)--perhaps I'm the only one, but I've always thought there was something to be said for concise story telling.

The characterization is a little spotty, so sometimes it feels as if something a character says hits the nail right on the head, but at other times their words seem foreign from their mouths. More than once something that was said made me laugh out loud (though I finished a week or so ago, so I don't quite recall what), and the I found the situation in which [[/spoiler][M15 think Hermione's working for the KGB]] quite amusing. It was a rather sudden twist and definitely brought my attention back to what was becoming a bit of a dry read.

The end of the fic, where it turns out that [[/spoiler][Hermione actually unintentionally abandoned her original reality and all her friends in order to go back and change the past]] bothered me a bit, though I'm not sure if that's because it seems like a cop-out, or just because it's personally disappointing to know that [[/spoiler][technically she didn't save anyone she'd wanted to at all, or improve the lives of her friends as she'd hoped.]] Hermione didn't have much of an emotional reaction to that, which seems entirely out of character for her (for pretty much /anyone/, actually).

Despite my slight disappointment at the end, it was certainly worth reading overall. If I hadn't read it before, I would currently be advising myself to give it a go.

/TL;DR: enjoyable, funny fic with relatively believable characterizations, but paced in a manner that might leave you giving up somewhere 'round the middle./

That /really/ bothered me, too. I mean, that's a pretty heavy bit of knowledge for anyone, but Hermione is probably the last HP character who would just brush if off for a "happily ever after" ending. :/

Other than that, though, I really enjoyed the fic! The Marauders were well characterized and I liked how they portrayed Peter's betrayal of the Potters.

**** Yes, I thought the bit with Peter was good too. He was still a the bad guy, but people always have their reasons for doing the wrong thing and it's never explored in canon.

*** I feel the same way about the ending of the fic! Perhaps it's because I wasn't invested in the Hermione/Sirius relationship so I wasn't pushing her to stay with him. The part about sending her younger self to Australia really skeeved me out too. :/

** The author of /169/ is pulling the story at the end of the month (from ff, not ao3) due to harassment both in reviews and messages, so for people who like to save stories, I recommend you do so.

Edit: taken from my Tumblr post forever ago on this story over I finished it...

#+begin_quote
  I just finished reading “one hundred and sixty nine.” I think it's probably one of my favorite things ever. Legitimate laughing at scenes the whole way through, close to tears at some parts, frustration followed by revelation at the end... This one is getting moved onto the actual kindle when I get around to charging it.
#+end_quote

It has since been put on my kindle, this remains one of my absolute favorite ships, and it's a fun read.

**** Yeah, sorry I wasn't more clear. The one we're supposed to discuss here :) It's listed at ao3 at the very least, I think she's in the process of uploading her stuff there anyway.

** I tried so hard to finish this, but somewhere in the middle of the story, I couldn't do it anymore.

There wasn't anything in particular that turned me off. I'm not a big fan of the Sirius characterization in this story. It's the annoying redeemed romanticizer. It's a trope that I hate.

I'll try again to get through it so I can a better review

** Thoughts - this was really, really long. I'm 100% with [[/u/Hocus_Bogus]] in that I feel like this story would have really benefited from some severe editing down.

I was really frustrated with the end. [[/spoiler][Hermione jumping out of her own timeline, rather than going back in time]] and then having NO strong reaction to that? Really OOC. It seemed like the author liked the idea of that plot point, but not dealing with the mental/psychological ramifications that any normal person would experience.

I HATED [[/spoiler][the end where Dumbledore is killed by the Muggles in the van.]] I think it was a great plot point, but I reacted really viscerally to it, and I can totally understand the motivations of [[/spoiler][the group who want to police Muggles better due to the shockwaves Muggles ignorantly caused by killing one of the most powerful wizards alive. I don't often sympathize with extremist groups but damn did his death rub me the wrong way.]]

I really liked this author's Remus and [[/spoiler][his tea face]]. Super cute. (:

** I remember the first time I read it I had enjoyed it. I tried going back to it recently without as much success, though.

I may give it another try.

*** As [[/u/Urukubarr]] said, and I also leave it up for longer if the fic currently being read is fairly long.
