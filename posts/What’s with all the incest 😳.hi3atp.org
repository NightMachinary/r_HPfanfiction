Please lmk if this is a problem you experience. You're happily reading a post war fic from one of the weasleys POV and bam Charlie and Bill are a secret couple. Or George is sad from Fred's death and your like okay fair enough and then they sneak attack you coming out with the fact that it's because they were smashing on the side eeeeeew. I'm honestly so confused why is there so much incest based fics.

Edit: lol it seems like I'm the only person that stumbles across these, idk how I've managed to find so many hahahahah


** You can guarantee that every single fandom that has twins will have twincest as well. It's probably just another branch of the 'oooh forbidden love!!" trope that people seem to love. It definitely became more popular after that Ouran Host Club anime came out though lmao.

*** When I first uploaded /A Different Perspective/ (a fic which features Potter twins Harry and Rose), on my old FFN account, someone asked me to pair them.

After nuking my old accounts and reuploading it, someone commented on my new AO3 account (a chapter in which Harry gives Rose a peck on the cheek): "Alabama?"

** It's not just fanfiction. The porn industry has actually noted a ridiculously significant rise in 'incest porn' type terms in search since about 2014 or so, and there have always been jokes and elements of it throughout Hollywood (Back to the Future ring any bells?).

Nobody has any real conclusive idea why yet - the psychology of sex is quite complicated and contentious, as the prevalence of sex-related stuff in politics will probably indicate for most people - but generally the layman's conclusion is because it's deviant and 'naughty' and that's interesting for the libidinous types. So, probably some 'Charlie's actor is hot. Bill's actor is hot. The Weasleys are fictionally related. That's hot. What if they bang? That'd be hot' type line of thinking.

My university lecturer specialised in how sexuality and other stuff actually manifests in sexual behaviours and thoughts, so I've had a few lectures and read a few papers on this - I'm not an expert by any means, I'm asexual as heck, for one, and my field is definitely not this, but that's my 'educated summary/best guess'.

TL:DR - the experts don't really know, but people find it hot, they guess?

  "Every scene I do is always a 'step,' it's never my real father," explained Riley Reid, one of the most popular adult actresses in the business. "And usually they're fairly new [relations]---like, 'my mom's new husband,' so it's not somebody who has raised me."

  "I think you legally have to say, 'This is crazy, you're my step-brother' a certain number of times," Wright added. "You also have to somehow fit in there that both are over the age of 18, like, 'Now that so-and-so's back from college.'"

  Production companies that don't draw such a line can run into problems legally, performers and directors I talked to explained. Some credit card companies won't even process payments for that type of material.

Huh, TIL. Maybe it's not really a legal requirement, just payment processor trying to avoid the risk of getting tangled in legal. It's like the reverse of randomly saying "fuck" on otherwise wholesome movies just so you don't get rated safe for a kindergartener, "OK Stacy, once you finished rimming John, remember to call him stepbro, we're a wholesome company after all".

******** Possibly. I remember it being something to do with labelling accuracy laws (or whatever the phrase is) - like if you advertise 'fish cakes', those cakes have to contain fish. I don't have access to journals anymore, now that my uni license is gone, so I can't share or find where I got that, but that's what I remember.

Wouldn't surprise me if it was that, though. One of Europe's strongest stereotypes of America is your litigiousness. :D

*** Incest used to be a common theme in 80s-90s porn also, and was probably the most common one for the older porn novels from what I've seen.

Beginning of W's presidency the feds announced obscenity prosecutions were going to be a focal point for the DoJ. Seriously they fired US attorneys who weren't being sufficiently overzealous about porn and were spending too much time on drug trafficking and violence. So the FSC (porn lobby group) hired an attorney to provide guidance on avoiding obscenity prosecutions. Among the themes to be avoided due to increased prosecution risk were incest, interracial, and bdsm.

There was also the first text obscenity case in almost fifty years during that administration. Sadly Obama kept that particular zealot for iirc most of his first term. Pretty sure her leaving was one of the reasons stuff started getting a little more adventurous again.

At this point there hasn't really been much effort put onto obscenity prosecutions in about 8 years, so nobody cares about the list. Other than Amazon.

I think you still had the same percentage of the market that found this sort of fantasy hot, but weren't being served for a long period of time. The 80s stuff filmed on a potato had gotten old and scarce.

So somebody did it, and made a lot of money for their effort. Then everybody jumped on the bandwagon.

**** Who's 'W'? (I'm not American, so unless you're talking about Woodrow Wilson, who seems a lil' early for the timeframe you're talking about, I have no idea who that is).

But otherwise, yeah, could be. There's a lot of chicken-egg style debate in Psychological Academia on whether porn influences tastes or tastes influence porn. Could be meeting a market desire or making one, they're not sure. You could be right, though. :)

** As someone who purposely reads a lot of HP slash fic, it's news to me that this is common o_O Never personally come across anything like that -- I might've seen a Weasley-cest tag once or twice on PwP compilations, but never been bamboozled by it. Then again, I read mainly on Ao3 where everything is tagged. Plus, ffnet is a weird place, in my relatively limited experience of it.

*** Honestly, Harry/Lily time travel is the only sane of all HP incest pairings. Neither knows the other, Harry can't even remember her outside of dementors. He would probably not recognise her without her name being mentioned. He would mean nothing to Lily because she isn't a mother, or even in a relationship with the later father yet.

If you set the fic before Lily/James, basically all you are writing is "Lily/James lookalike who's not a dick". Avoid recreation and you're fine. If you write that pairing without time travel, it has to be solid crack or it's just disturbing.

** Ugh, I definitely take the time on ao3 to exclude all the incest tags (twincest, brother-brother, cousin, et al) and it is definitely worth it. It's the sheer amount of weasleys that make it more prominent in this fandom than others that I read.

Also, I wonder how many of these incest writers have siblings...like, that should make the ick factor even ickier.
