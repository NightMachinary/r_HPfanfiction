I do it all the time, partly because I'm a very judgemental being and base my entire opinion on the author by a few sentences of their own, but also because I feel like I get a feel for the writer, based on how their profile is structured out.

For example, I find the profiles that are especially concise and only a few sentences long tend to be the best, while the extremely lengthy ones are as hit or miss as they come. Some lengthy profiles have some interesting stuff to add to the conversation, while others spend 20 paragraphs ranting about their thoughts on canon. I've seen enough rants about Ron being evil, Ginny being a fangirl and Molly being manipulative to fill a battleship.

Anyone else do this?


** As a side note, I'm really glad every other profile doesn't have the whole, "COPY PASTE *THIS* INTO YOUR PROFILE IF YOU THINK /INSERT RANDOM OPINION HERE/" as much anymore.

I still see it from time to time, but it's fairly rare when I do.

*** I used to write fanfiction (not HP) when I was in middle school and I recently looked at my fan fiction profile. My god, the amount of copy and paste. I now remember that I used to be very Christian, anti-drug, and not nearly as clever as I thought was at the time.

** Almost never -- I find fics based on search results or recs, and judge first by summary and then first chapter. I'll only hit the profile if an author is good enough for me to look for more fics, and even then don't really read the bio.

** Not really. I try not to judge any sort of artwork by their creator. I pick my fics based on word-to-chapter ratio and how well written and/or interesting the summary is. If they pass that first hurdle, I give them a grace period of a chapter or two before I judge it too harshly.

** Absolutely.

If it's an author that I'm just hearing of for the first time, or I've read one or two stories, then I go just to see if there are any other stories I might enjoy. If I'm not there because of a story, it's to see if they hold a similar fanon as I do and then scour their stories and favorites.

In addition, you can find out a lot about how someone writes with regard to grammar, spelling, all that jazz, as well as their "style" of writing, if you will.

** I only read the profile if I like the author's stories.

I do, however, read the summaries of the author's other written fics and his favourite list to get a good feel what the author likes and what I should expect. If I see, for example, lots of bashing I won't bother with the story.

** Nope. I check the reviews, and if there's nothing deal-breaking, I just read the story.

But if there's weird stuff, I check the profile to see if it's a deal-breaking author trend or a genuine plot device.

One author wrote in his/her profile that the story would consistently use "tow the line" instead of the correct "toe the line". Because everyone used the wrong expression anyway. That's nice. One of my pet peeves that noped me right out of there. I'm a grammar nazi, in case you wondered.

  "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/1/Hogwarts-School-of-Prayer-and-Miracles][You're a Christian now, Harry!]]" Hagrid cried proudly.

  Harry smiled but then interrogated, "But *how do I be a Christian?* I don't know how!"

  Hagrid grinned widely. "There is only one place to learn that-Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles!"
#+end_quote

Ah. You're a raging Christian, and are deathly afraid that your children will turn into actual witches. Have you even read the books? And you sorely need a beta reader. Unless your bible expressly forbids it?

Holy crap. Literally.

That particular author had nothing on her profile at all. Not that she needed it. And the story had 9000+ reviews, which proves once and for all that it's useless to sort by reviews as an indicator of quality.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore becomes Reverend Albus Dumbledore, who is married and STRAIGHT. *Hermoine* is Dumbledore's daughter (for some reason?) and is described as “modest” and “obedient.” And the commandments are shoe-horned whether applicable or not, like when she addresses coveting thy neighbor's wife while introducing Harry to the children's dormitories??

It's Herm*io*ne, you illiterate heathen!

Another pet peeve: Spinning portkeys. I first encountered them in "Power of the Press". It was a valid plot device, and necessary for the plot.

Then every other story started to use spinning portkeys. This happens when authors read so many fanfics that they're unable to distinguish fanon from canon.

It's annoying. By all means create an alternative universe. But if you change too much for no discernible reason, then it's no longer Harry Potter.

Don't they spin in the movies? That would explain that trend handily.

** Not normally. I'll check out their profile if I recognize their name, if I want to see if they have a tumblr I can follow, or to specifically see if they have more/other stories. The latter two are generally right after finishing a story.

** I check after I've read a story I really enjoyed. I want to see if there are any other fics by them that I might like, and I usually check out their favorite stories. I like when authors put up the order their fics should be read in (if a series), or a more specific summary. I don't use tumblr much, but I will follow them if I really enjoy their work. A lot of authors tend to post links to other sites (GE, LJ, Ashwinder etc.) they're on, especially if they have a more mature version of a story posted elsewhere.

** I do. I read mostly romance and I always check to see if an author mentions their age in their profile and then I compare that to the date the fic I'm interested in was first published. I skip any fics I come across written by anyone 18 years old or younger. I just don't feel that the typical fic author that young has enough life experience with relationships/romance to pull off writing a believable romance story. Sorry to all you teenage writers out there!

** Absolutely. Seeing someone's profile can tell a story itself. If a story seems ambiguous, yet their other stories have bad pairings like Harry/Draco, of the profile has long lists of stuff that seems like it would be on a 13 year old's myspace page, then you know it's time to go. If someone were to visit my profile, they would see the disclaimer at the very top saying that most of my older stories are shit, which should help people decide if they want to read them or not.
