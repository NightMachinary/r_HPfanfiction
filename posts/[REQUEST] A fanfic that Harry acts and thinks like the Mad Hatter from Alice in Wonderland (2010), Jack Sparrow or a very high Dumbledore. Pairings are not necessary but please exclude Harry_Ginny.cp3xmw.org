Basically a fanfic where Harry is mad and his attitude drive people up the wall. Bonus cyber cookies if Luna is the only one that can keep up with him.


** Linkffn(4669348) Accidental Hero (aka, The Absentminded Ravenclaw) is really cute with Harry being Luna-Style “crazy”. He's super absentminded (exactly like the title says lol). Its really cute, but unfortunately abandoned after only 4 chapters. Linkffn(6892925) Stages Of Hope. Harry in this one has some serious trauma and addiction issues which cause him to be kinda insane. It's implied past Harry/Ginny, but it's not prevalent at all. Linkffn(10677106) I haven't read Seventh Horcrux in a while, but I think Harry is similar in this to what your looking for.

Lmk if you want any Insane!Harry fics with him being super dark/corrupted rather than mad hatter crazy. Those kinds I have WAYYY more saved of.

  ABANDONED. Freaky connections aside, does anyone else think it strange that Harry survived a Killing Curse with little more damage than a scar? Well, what if he hadn't come through so unscathed? And what if the other damage was more mental than physical?

*** Thank you for Accidental Hero. I just love it when people lose their minds when it comes to mad people and Harry was just adorable. I will try Seventh Horcrux, it seems promising. You mentioned some fics of Insane!Harry. Any you could recommend? Please do not limit yourself. I have a strong stomach. Just exempt any slash or Harry/Ginny. THANK YOU

**** Just fyi SH is /technically/ a H/G story. Though as somebody who doesn't like the vast majority of H/G stories I absolutely love this one, though. The pairing also doesn't really come into play until the end because Harry doesn't think they're dating and Ginny does. It works for this kind of fic, though.
