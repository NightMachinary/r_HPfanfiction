In French, Dominique is a unisex name. However, all the Dominique Weasleys I've read about are girls. Is this because of fandom conventions, some Word of God that I missed about Fleur and Bill's children, or for other mysterious reasons ?


** Suppose because in Britain, Dominique sounds a very feminine name? Although it does sound a bit "Council Estatey" in modern times...

*** Why does it sound "Council Estatey"? Thought it would be the opposite actually. I am not British, so I can't be sure..

**** They're basically saying it sounds ghetto, in American terms

***** I know what it means, but can't for the life of me figure out why would a name like this be associated with the lower class?

****** Because poor people have had this trend of naming their kids extravagant-sounding names for a while now

******* As someone who´s not British, Dominique seems more like a posh French name, instead of trashy French name, like Chantal or Jacqueline, because only country hicks or people that couldn´t possibly pronounce the names properly, to save their lives, name their kids like this, well in Germany at least.

******* Didn't think of it like that, but I guess it makes sense. Thanks for the reply!

** I just always viewed Dominique as a girl, although I remember when Rowling made all of the Next Gen some people were calling Dominique, Dominic for a boy version.

But yeah as far as I am aware Rowling never stated either way if Dominique was male or female (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). But yeah most people generally write Dominique as a woman, including myself.

So really I think either way is okay in fanfiction. Again unless Rowling has specifically stated that Dominique is male or female.

** It's a unisex name, but Dominique is a girl's name, while Dominic is for men ;)

*** In English yes, but in French both the girl and the boy versions are spelled Dominique.

**** Having known several couples who were from different languages, I suspect Bill would veto Dominique for a boy because it would create confusion, and instead look for a different name that worked in both languages.

****** No problem!

I actually find it interesting to see what names come out of those unions. One of my friends married a Japanese woman and had a daughter named Naomi - one of the few that works in both languages.

**** There is many more girls Dominique as boys Dominique. Both in France and England. To be honest, I lived in france since my whole life (20 years) and never met one boy Dominique.

***** I'm French too and have been living there as long as you and I met juste as many men and women named that way. Personal experience is hardly a statistical argument. The only source I found showed similar numbers for both versions. But even in terms of personalities, you have DSK, Villepin...
