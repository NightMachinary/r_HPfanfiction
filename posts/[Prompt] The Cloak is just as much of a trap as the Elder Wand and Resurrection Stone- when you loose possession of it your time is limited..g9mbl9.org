For example, soon after James Potter lent the Cloak to Albus to test, he died. James' parents died relatively soon after James took the cloak with him to Hogwarts. Albus too died soon after passing the Cloak to Harry.

Loosing possession of the Cloak means death is coming for you. And now Harry's kids keep bugging him to let them use it...

**** I think the actual tale explains it a bit, if we look at the moral hinted at in the story.

Death willingly gave the Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone away, at practically no cost to himself (it was a branch from a nearby tree and a rock from the river, at most he enchanted them).

The Cloak, he gave away /reluctantly/.

We also get a clue in what the brothers were /really/ asking - and there again, the Cloak is the only one of the three not meant as a further insult to Death, so Death gave some respect in return.

From there, the allegory continues into Death's method of getting to the Brothers in question - he has the Wand's owner killed, spurs the Stone's owner into suicide... But the Cloak's owner leads a long and happy life and eventually passes the Cloak on to his descendant, whereupon he greets Death as a friend.

All of those allegories point to the same idea - Wand and Stone unsafe, Cloak safe.

The story is quite vague so you can go either direction with it.

It could very well be interpreted that there did appear an avatar of Death and instead the bridge and the river were not literal.

While they can't age or don't die from old age they can still kill themselves or be killed by others and in the end the final brother just undid the immortality magic and allowed himself to die.

** A new and interesting perspective on the cloak. It's up there with my favorites now.

1 - The cloak isn't there for people when they need it. Abandoning them like the Ring abandoned Gollum. James didn't have the cloak when Voldemort came, lesser concept is that Harry didn't realize he left the cloak on the tower in first year because the cloak did it to get him in trouble and send him into the forest where he might die.

2 - The third brother is described as having greeted death as an old friend, which implies familiarity. The master of the cloak brings death down upon their loved ones. Punishment for the brother that can hide from death is the death of those around him that can't.

3 - The third brother is described as having greeted death as an old friend, which implies familiarity. The master of the cloak must always deal in death to protect those around them. They don't get to have peaceful lives where the realities of death aren't constantly thrown in their face. They kill, they see others killed. They fight in wars, they become child soldiers, etc.

I like that idea, that every time cloak wearer should have died, death instead takes the closest person physically or spiritually to them. It wouldn't be obvious all the time, but it would enough to tie in with some other ideas here- that the wearer becomes really paranoid that death is coming for them.

He didn't know about the cost and was very cavalier with his lives, not knowing what he was doing to his loved ones. The Death figure was disgusted with him each time they met because he couldn't imagine someone sacrificing their loved ones so easily.

Aside from that, if Dumbledore doesn't count, then we don't really have a trend at all, we have one instance in which someone (James) gave up possession, but apparently not ownership, of the cloak and died soon after, and one instance of an indeterminate and unknowable time period between James's parents passing the cloak down and dying.

******* Im basing this off of the Tale of the Three Brothers. It seems like ownership for the deathly hallows travels with the family. In the story the Third Brother passes the cloak down to his son, and it gets passed down through the family until it reaches Harry. The stone as well is passed down through the Second Brother's family, ending with the Gaunts. The only Hallow that changes ownership outside of the family is the wand, and interestingly enough, the 1st Brother has no children. This has sparked a whole new theory for me that only after all the direct descendants of one of the brothers is dead can the ownership of a Hallow be based on possessing it. Although the ability for any wand to change allegiance does make this a shaky theory.

*** True, just like we know that James' parents lived long enough to invite Sirius into their house while James was still at Hogwarts, but not long enough to appear in James and Lily's wedding photos.

Maybe the longer you own the cloak the slower it happens?

James' parents- owns decades, dead after 7 years;

James- owns 10 or so years, dead within a year;

Dumbledore owns for 11 years- dead within 6 years;

Remus maybe? owns for a few months, dead within 4 years.

Really, James seems to be the outlier here- maybe no matter how long you own the cloak Death collects within the decade. It doesn't sound like soon- but then to a wizard who lives 150 plus years easily it kinda is.

** I thought that was canonical. The Wand makes you unbeatable but betrays you when you need it most, the Stone lets you talk to the dead but drives you into depression and suicide, and the cloak gives you Plot Armor, until you pass it on to your first born, at which point you get a Red Shirt (the opposite of Plot Armor, anything can kill you).

The only reason Harry survived any of what he did, was that He Was The Last Potter. His extended family died in the war, while his father was Protected by the Cloak. His father gave it away, But Not Forever, and was killed first, that faithful holloween night. His mother died next, but she didn't matter, couldn't of inherited it anyways. And then harry was all that was left. There Must Always Be An Heir. So, Harry survived, and would continue to survive until he produced an heir. Of course harry is protected from the drawback, because by the time he had a kid, he was already the Master Of Death.

Only a Peverell could ever be the MoD. The name changed to Potter when the eldest was a female, with no male siblings, and she married a Potter. It could change again, the same way. But the Cloak Is Inherited. You CAN'T Steal It. You CAN'T Barrow It And Never Give It Back. You MUST Be Born To It. The Stone is Found. Not inherited, Found, Discovered, By Accident.

However, Harry would then run into more and more troubles, but Albus wouldn't want to give the Cloak back, due to him needing it too. He'd then steal the stone to try and learn magic secrets from the ghosts of dead wizards(maybe try and contact Voldemort and become his pupil?) This would cause him to fall out with his father, and their argument would escalate into a minor wand skirmish initiated by Albus, during which he disarms Harry and takes the Elder Wand, which begins to recognize him as its master. After finally beating the BBEG and drawing the ire of pretty much everyone, Albus begins to panic, expecting death to wait around every corner. Desperate to avoid losing the Hallows, he hardly ever takes off the Invisibility Cloak and has the Elder Wand chained to his hand to counter attempts of theft. In addition, he becomes so paranoid that he considers any attempt to disarm him to be an attempt of his life, and always responds to Expelliarmus with Avada Kedavra.

Maybe during the ongoing fight over the cloak, Albus wins the wand from Harry in a duel (that was meant to be friendly and escalated due to the tension between them). Then, Albus has the cloak and wand and goes looking for the stone because he is now starting to fall/is really being affected.

Maybe he gets more and more desperate looking for the stone and ends up killing some who he comes across in the forest, thinking they are there to steal the stone, extra points if it is a (young) student.

When he does find the stone, he is already pretty far gone, which is why he sees nothing wrong with calling up shades of evil dead wizards.
