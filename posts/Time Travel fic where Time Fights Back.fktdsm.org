Essentially, I'd like to see a Time Travel fic where, when the traveller attempts to change things, Time pushes back and tries to conserve the known timeline. If Harry went back to do something smarter in the Shrieking Shack scene than chain a man who could turn himself into a tiny rat and escape whenever he liked and then caught Pettigrew, he could escape later and Sirius would still end up on the run. Essentially, a fix it, want-of-a-nail fic where canon stations are met anyway despite the time traveller's best efforts.


** Most re-do or timetravel fics are like this, and it's not as fun as you'd think. Mostly, it's incredibly frustrating, because nothing changes.

**** To emphasise the futility of obsessing over the past and encourage you to move on to the future and let go of what's bothering you, I would imagine. It's a nice metaphor-analogy for the real life inability to change the past, IMO.

*** Sometimes a futile fight can be fun. That's basically what I'm looking for - some person struggling desperately to do a thing and it not working out.

I guess I've been lucky - most of the time travel fics I've read are almost completely AU. Very few 'nothing changes' fics.

  Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

** The Rewritten in Time series by Scotland Evander plays with this idea quite a bit. It's complete and really long - covering all seven years and there are some other tie in fics. Draco is the main character I haven't read it in a while but I remember enjoying it a lot

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/48618]]

Scared and tired, Draco Malfoy decides to take matters into his own hands. Using a potion, he travels back in time, finds himself in his eleven year old body with all his memories from the past seventeen years. Using this knowledge, he sets out change time. His first mission: befriend Harry Potter. His second: Keep Harry from doing death defying acts. (Turns out harder than Draco had envisioned.)

*edit, I remembered another one

Linkao3(Rose Petal Red)

In this one its more like fate fighting back, but in quite interesting ways with real consequences. The mc is a self insert and is Ginny's twin, which isn't everyone's cup of tea, and normally not my thing. But the story made up for it.

***** Other than Faery Heroes..? 'Good' isn't really a thing with that challenge. Fun, yes, good, no.

If you google ' harry potter fanfiction "champions of lilith" ' (Or just Lunar Harmony Pairings), you'll get pretty much all of them. IIRC, there's less than a dozen that are direct responses and another five or so that're inspired by the responses or combined with another challenge. I can find links for you if you like, but I'm about twenty minutes away from a skype meeting and I've filed those fics under separate tropes rather than the one challenge, so it'll take me a while to find my bookmarked links. If you don't find them yourself by the end of today, let me know and I'll go hunting for you (same to anyone else reading this).

** *Reboot* linkffn(9552519)

This is /sorta/ like your request. But instead, there are "fixed points in time" that /have/ to happen. Time/Prophecy forces things to happen anyway. Snape tries to prevent someone from hearing the prophecy, but there was a second person there. James/Lily were a fixed point in time too.

Loosely based on the Reptilla28 challenge. Anywho, Harry, Hermione and Snape die in the final battle and gets sent back in time to fix things. Snape goes back to pre-hogwarts and does most of the changes. The first half of the fic is Snape. The second half is Harry/Hermione with some Snape sprinkled in.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Pre Cursed Child & Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922615/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance][Harry Potter and the Last Chance]] - Harry teaches DADA for all of Hogwarts.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5695544/1/Harry-Potter-and-Afterlife-Inc][Harry Potter and Afterlife Inc]] - Besides the meta-bashing in the challenge, there is almost no bashing here. Harry uses a Traditional Pureblood law to take care of everything.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10766595/1/Harry-Potter-Three-to-Backstep][Harry Potter - Three to Backstep]] - One of the poster childs for this challenge.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9963013/1/He-s-Not-Dead-Yet][He's Not Dead Yet]] - It's a cliche trope-fest parody. Harem, tons of bashing, and Monty Python Jokes. The fic itself doesn't even take itself seriously. I felt the bashing was satire.

Christ, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4321881/1/Death-s-Pride][Death's Pride by: Paladeus]] was started back in 2008, this challenge is ooooooold. Sad about this one never going to be completed unless someone picks it up.

Sorting really does help. I mostly got into the habit after starting D&D and realising that worldbuilding of multiple worlds was a nightmare without organisation, but it works for writing and reading too. :)

I've not read Afterlife Inc or Three to Backstep, so thanks for those recs! I do now plan to reread He's Not Dead Yet. That one was so ridiculously stupidly funny.

*** I mean, it depends on what school of temporal thought you subscribe to. For some, time is malleable and can be rewritten at a whim; sometimes, it's related to your personal perception, so you living through one set of events then going back later on to change them is sequential; others follow that conservation of events style thing I mentioned in my description-note-thing up top. Hell, there are some people who don't think paradoxes would exist beyond you just dropping dead the moment you decided to do it. It's fiction, so it varies drastically and it all depends on what you want to go for. I can't really remember the specifics of HP canon timetravel, but I'm fairly certain it's just "You can't change what you already knew happened, but you going back in time and being there always happened too, it just hadn't happened to you yet". But canon timetravel also doesn't include anything more than a few hours, so the majority of time travel fics would be impossible by those rules anyway. :)
