A bit more of an idea than a full prompt:

The whole "Dumbledore blocks Harry's MAGICAL COREâ„¢ because he's EEEEEEEEVIL" shtick is really overdone. It's a fucking nightmare that makes little cohesive sense. But the whole concept can be taken in a fun new direction. Blocks on metamorphic talents are real, and are a medical necessity.

Metamorphic talent was created in Ancient Sumer, and it has propagated itself rather widely in Eurasia. The reason metamorphs are rare is because the talent exists on a range. Around 99% of people have a slight bit of it, and can use Polyjuice (which operates as a controlled, safe(r) activation of those talents). At the high end, true metamorphs (like Tonks) don't entirely rely on their internal organs. They more resemble undifferentiated flesh propped up by magic.

The problem area is with the people in the middle: the roughly ten percent of people with enough of the talent to start shifting, but not enough to handwave away little things like multiple organ failure. The blocking magic was designed to limit the talent so they don't fall over and die when they get distracted and accidentally turn their brain to spleen.

*** The talent was developed well before people had an understanding of how the body worked. They brute forced the damn thing to get it to work.

Polyjuice is a development from after people figured out what all those organs actually do, which is why it can piggyback a change off very little metamorphic ability.

****** "magic is just x other minor thing" is usually a pretty shitty trope, though. Like when an x-men crossover attempts to make magic an expression of the x-gene, or when a stargate crossover tries to make it just a form of energy manipulation.

Though I'd expand on it in non-crossover stuations as well. Star Wars is a good example: So what if a small village on a backwater planet of the Outer Rim collectively calls their abilities "magic"? They're local, not really up for the whole "greater Galactic Community" thing... They do not need a Jedi to 'educate' them.

*** Isn't that kinda the canon route anyway? Dumbledore basically has all this insanity happen at his school that Harry gets involved in (though no, I don't think he arranged it all) to use as training, he straight up gifts the kid the three most dangerous and powerful artefacts he can think of to help him and pretty much sets him up to survive the killing curse along the way.

Once that's over, Harry's a 17 year old super badass who's going down in history as wrecking the most powerful Dark Lord ever in a hilariously uneven duel using an /expelliarmus/ to kill him. Kid's the magical version of a chuck Norris meme come to life.

*** That would be rad as hell. Harry and Dumbledore do a bunch of power-up stuff that normally drastically shortens life expectancy and makes you burn up/explode/liquefy after a few years but as Harry will likely die anyways they just decide to fuck it and go all in.

Harry eventually duels Voldemort to a standstill, is killed, and his body explodes from the built-up magical flux, taking Voldemort and all his death eaters back into oblivion, and blowing a massive crater into the countryside.

Bonus points if Harry survives and comes to at the bottom of the crater, the magical flux gone but the added power intact.

***** Binding the magic past a certain age would have several severe debilitating effects or death as the body has already grown up channeling magic. The older one is the more dangerous it becomes so it would only ever be performed on magicals under one year old. The second point is that it could be really obscure magic and not just a simple spell maybe a ritual or some such so not just anybody could do it and it is also extremely regulated. It might also take a good amount of time to perform and take a good amount of power so not just anybody could do it. even if they know how.

We could even turn the story around and say even with Harry having this ability bound by Dumbledore when he was a year old was actually the power he knows not and is literally so strong that even with the ability bound it sometimes leaks out, like how he keeps regrowing his hair without even realizing.

You could have it that sometime during the end of the first year when he almost dies because of Quirllmort, and I don't know maybe something to do with the philosopher's Stone or during the second year when he's basically revived by Phoenix tears while having basalisk venom in his blood causes the ability to be unbound.

And wild Tonks is what many considering a normal full metamorph, she can only change the baseline exterior of her body. So her skin, fat, and cartilage can be moved around a bit to slightly make her taller or shorter fatter or thinner and change her facial features and color over skin or hair to resemble other things without actually fundamentally changing that they're still hair and skin.

Meanwhile Harry Potter is the first wizard who has unlocked the full ability due to a variety of reasons, one of them being his ancestry on the black side since in this case the blacks were actually descended from Merlin who was born from the Union according to certain legends from a human and a demon making him a Cambrien, who had supernatural shapeshifting abilities. Now Harry Potter has the same he can literally transfigure his entire structure into other things, turn into animals, perfectly mimic other people, etc.

He can decrease in increase his actual mass at will, and actually take on the phisical properties of organic materials, rather than simply the appearance, even magical ones, as long as he imprints on them. In other words if he is in contact for long enough with say a dragon, he starts being able to change his skin into dragon scale, eventually he can grow wings, draconic eyes, and eventually even breath fire.

So since he's still mimicking the form he will never be as sturdy or strong as an actual dragon Even if eventually he could copy their size, dragons are still fully magical creatures and have properties inherent to them alone something he can't copy. It's still be pretty badass as he goes picking up different parts and forms and combining them to be able to go on par with voldemort. Harry Potter with the strength of a giant, the durability of a dragon, the venom of a basilisk, the magical resistance and fear inducement of a dementor, etc...
