I really loved the AQ series and would love to have more of that kind of thing. Any suggestions?

Basically I want minimal references to Harry or the Mauraders. Fem-Harry is still Harry, so no thanks on that.


** So,Ii know you said no fem!harry. but. How about a fem!harry who has no character relationship to cannon Harry at all (I mean, AT ALL), pretends to be a boy named Rigel and has plots taken from Tamora Pierce?

Linkffn(the pureblood pretense).

Also in this vein, linkffn(a long journey home by rakeesh) is technically a fem!harry but she's totally divorced from cannon Harry after chapter 1. It's very interesting magical history - Merlin, ancient Egypt and ancient India.

Otherwise, linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation) is a seven book next gem series focused on albus (similar to the lippert James potter series).

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.
