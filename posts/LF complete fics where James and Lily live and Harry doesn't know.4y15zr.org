There was one in particular where Harry gets uber pissed and disowns them as Potters and they become Evanses. Can't remember that one but if anyone else knows it I'd appreciate a link.

Feel free to post any others as well.


** There was a fantastic story, it was quite short but Harry was actually a golem that his parents made as well as making golems of themselves, they then went into really deep hiding and the Harry Golem took on a life of it's own. It was really good and may fit the bill. +I don't have a link for it but am hoping that someone who sees this knows the one I'm talking about.+

Edit: Found it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute]]

**** The author has a /less/ depressing ending for the story written! You can probably find it going through his profile; it's buried there somewhere.

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

** Linkffn(harry potter and the Prince of slytherin) is a sort of "corrected" Wbwl story where everyone has motivations that make sense. The potters are alive, and boy does Harry hate their guts most of the time. Books one and two are complete (and great) and the fic updated weekly for nine straight months. The fic is on hiatus until September while the author outlines book 3.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

*** The author also said they would post some summer interludes during the wait and would put some content on his bio, neither of which have happened yet. While I doubt the story will be abandoned, I am a bit skeptical that it will start up in September. For now I am going to assume the wait will be longer. That way if it isn't I will be pleasantly surprised, rather than being disappointing if it is.
