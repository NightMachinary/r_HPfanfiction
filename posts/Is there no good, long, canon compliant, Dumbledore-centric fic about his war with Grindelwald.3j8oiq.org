** Well, I know of two fics that attempt this:

linkffn(The One He Feared) which features Dumbledore's memories.

linkffn(9079271) which is a oneshot in the time period.

  A chance encounter leads Dumbledore to finally make the decision to confront his demons. Or more specifically the one demon who started it all - Gellert Grindelwald. No slash!

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

*** My issue with The One He Feared is that while the first chapter that covers the Dumbledore/Grindelwald is excellent, the rest of the fic is rather boring in comparison.

** It would be very interesting but unfortunately people are more interested writing Harry/Draco buttsex and Dramione.

*** Everyone needs to learn that Seventh Horcrux's way of dealing with Draco is the best way. Treat him like he actually is: a spoiled brat and then as with canon give him some vague character development that changes him for off-screen and voila, a winning formula. /rolls eyes/

He can be alright in some stories, but honestly he's awful as a minor antagonist and always comes off as a joke. But lots of authors as with Snape love painting him as something he's not.

Stuff with Grindelwald always tends to be really interesting on the other hand so it's something I'd like to see.

** The problem with a story like this is that there isn't any indication that Dumbledore actually did go to war with Grindelwald.

Yes, they dueled, but only after Grindelwald couldn't be ignored by Dumbledore any longer.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was afraid to face Grindelwald, not because he thought he couldn't defeat him, but because he was afraid that Grindelwald could reveal to him who had truly killed Ariana. However, by 1945 Dumbledore could no longer turn a blind eye to Grindelwald's deeds, and tracked his old friend down.

Take the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore#Career_at_Hogwarts_.28pre._1938-1970.29][HP Wiki]] with a grain of salt but there's not indication anywhere that they ever dueled more than once or that Dumbledore had anything to do with routing Grindelwald's army.

Also a reason to take the wiki with a grain of salt. I don't think this is canon.
