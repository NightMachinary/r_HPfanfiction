I've been reading a lot of stories that revolve mostly around romance so I'm looking for general stories with no romance. What's your favourite gen fic and why?


** Tough call. In the last year possibly The Art of Self-Fashioning linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning) or Realignment linkffn(Realignment).

#+begin_quote
  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** I rather like The Art of Self-Fashioning that was already linked. By the same author I'm really enjoying linkffn(Made of Common Clay) and linkffn(Children of the Sun) - both are WIPs that updates regularly.

A complete one focused on Neville is linkffn(Becoming Neville).

Happy reading!

#+begin_quote
  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

** A Most Unusual Student, by Alkari

I'm not sure it exists anywhere the bot can get to it - I first read it via Sugar Quill - but it's got a lovely nuanced version of Poppy Pomfrey.

** This is my time to shine. I apologize in advance for the length of the bot's comment.

Edit: okay or the bot is just not going to work.

Edit: okay or it's actually going to work, just delayed + you'll have to look up the restricted ones and Stronger than Hope on your own.

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste) - there is a HP/DM romance later on but it's not very important to the main plot.

linkao3(D.S.S. Requirement by esama) - crossover with Stargate, don't need to know it to read it.

linkao3(The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer) - probably my favourite HP fic tbh.

linkffn(Stronger Than Hope by Alauntar) - really depressing.

linkffn(End Of The Line by shewhoguards)

linkao3(The Two Body Problem by Tozette) - note that it's restricted, you have to have an Ao3 account to access this.

linkao3(8906032) - same deal. (This is "Death of a Dark Lord, a True Story - by Gilderoy Lockhart" by Tozette)

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** *cracks knuckles* my time has come...

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11968875][to welcome you home]] by Glisseo (3878 words)

- Summary: A mishap on Platform Nine and Three Quarters leads to an unexpected journey into the past for Harry, Ron and Hermione...
- Super-adorable post-Hogwarts trio fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/245007][Lost among Our Winnings]] by bachlava (17511 words)

- Summary: Twenty-one things that happened over the course of nineteen years.
- It's got canon relationships in the background, but it's a nice series of snapshots of living after the war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11917125][Calibration]] by TheDivineComedian (4277 words)

- Summary: Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.
- Anything by TheDivineComedian deserves to be recced, but I've got a soft spot for Lupin-centric stuff.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14176482][Concerning Rabbits]] by LullabyKnell (8646 words)

- Summary: The thing about Cedric Diggory was that, if he was comfortable telling that sort of joke, he'd say that really, truly, and honestly... he was really just several anxious rabbits in a robe. Always had been.
- It's a scary-accurate depiction of being a high-achiever with anxiety. Seriously, it's like looking into a mirror for me.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278272][Wonderful Tragic Mysterious]] by branwyn (5301 words)

- Summary: When Albus Dumbledore is eighteen, he meets a mysterious young woman with a Time Turner, a secret mission, and a disarmingly comfortable relationship with death.
- Dumbledore and Luna is a character combination I would have never considered, but it totally works.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5147618][Eleven Up]] by ryfkah (7313 words)

- Summary: In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997.
- Really creative format. Very powerful and very sad.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diar]]y by Arabella (68700 words)

- Summary: 'His d-diary' Ginny sobbed. 'I've b-been writing in it, and he's been w-writing back all year -' | Ginny's first year in Hogwarts, written in diary entries.
- Ginny sounds very much like an 11-year-old here, and Tom is an excellent manipulator. I especially liked how Ginny managed to fight back, to almost the very end.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10799454][Dulce et decorum est]] by EssayOfThoughts (870 words)

- Summary: “You-Know-Who is growing in power,” Minerva says. “Watching the students in class... more and more of them are whispering his views. He recruited while he was at Hogwarts, Albus, and he and his continue to do so." / “We will fight,” Albus says.
- A nice Dumbledore character study, with war looming in the background.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]] by Wishweaver (264047 words)

- Summary: Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help?
- Unfinished (probably abandoned) and not very fast-paced, but I find it charming all the same. Harry-centric and very characterization driven.
