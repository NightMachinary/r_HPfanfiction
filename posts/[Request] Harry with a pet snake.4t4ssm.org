  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** - in the 2nd year of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/The Sacrifices Arc/]] (W^{T} : 3,075,741; Complete) Harry's gotten himself a snake familiar;

  - Also in this story, I think, Harry discovered that magical snakes developed conciousness when kept in close proximity to wizards, so he had several such snakes both as pets and spies.

- in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][/With Strength of Steel Wings/]] (719,300WL) one of Harry's attributes was a winged snake (Quetzalcoatl) \ magical dagger;

#+begin_quote
  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
