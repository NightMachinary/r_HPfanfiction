Imagine T.M Riddle as the Muggle P.M. of the United Kingdom.


** He then runs for minister of magic.

afterall there is no law saying someone can not both be minister of magic and the prime minister of the united kingdom.

but honestly, Tom riddle raised by his parents, would give him some nicer traits and round out his edges

so he would be smart, and even more comptent then his canon counterpart.

he would then slowly start bringing intergration between muggle and magical britian, for the slow purpose of creating a glorious legacy that will last forever

funny enough niether the prime ministership or the minster of magic have term limits.

Tom's personal Slogan would be 'Best of Both Worlds' in the muggle World they assume it refers to the few years of his live spent in an orphange before being raised by his wealthy parents.

In the Wizarding world, they assume it refers to his blood status

but it actually Refers to his plan to merge the best ascepts of both worlds afterall the best wizarding plotline merged with the best muggle bloodline to create him the best wizard

** He most likely confound all the ballot papers to win as MP and then all the MPs elected to become Prime Minister. Probably it doesn't matter whether his party got majority or not, he would be Prime Minister.

** This fic is pretty similar in scope, but reverse. After Hermione brings him his son, Tom Riddle Sr. pretends to be a halfblood and change the world, both wizarding and muggle.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

*** I really like that... I mean the muggle touring idea is genius and I love the bit about slithering... but it moves really slowly. I mean, I know why it does (shipping) but I want to see if Hermione's plan works.

I don't think that's the reason it moves so slowly actually. In the more recent chapters, Tom is saving young squib Marius Black, marketing wolfsbane after Hermione created it, trying to create vaccines & antibiotics, and setting up Tessie Prewett with his wealthy muggle friend. He also hired a woman to write a sympathetic book about werewolves. Dobby's teaching his fellow house elves to read and write down their stories. During all of this, shipping isn't even implied. Rather, I think the author just has a lot of plot threads, which they handle expertly.

***** I disagree. I think, unlike many authors, the author realises that the advertised endgame isn't believable unless it is built up slowly. Look at what all of those things are: they're very Hermione things. Similarly the clues we have about what has happened to Hermione before she travelled back likewise imply a lot of time is required.

Those plot threads are interesting and there are a lot of them but I think they are very much in service of creating the advertised ship.

Except Hermione's been out of focus for a while and the author claims they have no feelings for each other rn. What Hermione has been through is very traumatic, but it's not the focus of the story (which is imo changing the world completely and Tom's character development along the way). The relationship might be the endgame sure, but the story would work without it becoming romantic and the author dedicates a lot of time to building up the world. Dismissing that development as "just for the ship" seems inadequate response for the amount of work they put in.

******* Again, I disagree. I think the author is putting a lot of work into creating a situation where we can believe that ship. People don't just wake up one morning and find they have no problems with what's going on.

Fanfics have a tendency to be huge if they are long. A large reason for this is that they can be. A traditional book would not include something unless it serves a wider purpose in the story. This one is a romance or a saving Tom Riddle (snr and/or jnr) or both. I think it's both and given its characterisation and backstory for Hermione moving faster is out of the question.

I'm not dismissing it but I am more interested in seeing if Voldemort is averted than the romance. That's why I said shipping instead of romance. As I said it's a very good fic, but I've been approaching it mostly from the perspective of a time travel fic (how I found it) so the romance is not what I want to see first. And if you're right that these plots are less connected than I believe, the author is getting distracted from their concept by their worldbuilding.
