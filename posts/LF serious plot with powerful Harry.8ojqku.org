I've recently read linkffn(The Mind Arts) and linkffn(Transcendence) and loved them. I am looking for similiar stories. Preferably completed or recently updated.


** Try Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero linkffn(3994212):

Its part of a trilogy. By the end of the first book, he is widely regarded as the strongest behind Voldemort. By the second book he flash-frys a pair of nundus and destroys an entire world. By the third book? You have to read yourself. I would say the story hits its peak in the second book (classic trilogy flaw).

I'll use a quote from the 3rd book to entice you:

/Harry didn't speak, even as the wind died down and the snow ceased swirling. Hedwig was still on the ledge, and when Harry looked at her she flew up to sit on his shoulder. Turning to the iron door that had been all but impregnable ten minutes ago, Harry whispered a word and it fell to the ground as dust -- revealing a dark and sparsely lit corridor leading into the vampire stronghold./

/"Fly away, Hedwig," he whispered and the air shook at the strength in his words. Nothing could resist it. "I'll meet you back in England."/

/Nipping his ear affectionately, she hooted and took flight from his shoulder instantly, disappearing into the twilight sky moments later. The other tawny owl followed her./

/"So... this thing you're about to do, is it business or pleasure?" Ethan asked, leaning against the wall in a black collared shirt and jeans. He folded his arms over his chest and grinned, seeing Harry's thoughts./

/Harry smiled grimly, and beings of unimaginable power had quailed in another time before that smile. "Can't it be both?" he mused, winking at Ethan. That said and done, he walked half naked into the vampire stronghold, the darkness consuming him almost instantly./

/The ledge that he had been kept prisoner on crumbled away to nothing as he left it, and in the air his presence still hung -- just a feeling that something, neither good nor bad, had occurred here. Time would tell./

/Either way, Harry Potter was back -- and all bets are, once again, off./

The Skitterleap linkffn(Skitterleap)

Dumbledore lost to Grindelwald. Now Harry is part of the Austro-Hungarian army, and is sent on a mission to to front in Eastern Europe. You'll have to read from there.

** Lets see:

- Defiance by Dark Lord Slytherin linkffn(Defiance)
- A Cadmean Victory (tacit recommendation) linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)\\
  Realignment linkffn(Realignment) (Powerful characters, lots of fights)
- Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) (Heavily features mind magic, though not as much as The Mind Arts)
- Unspeakable Things linkffn(Unspeakable Things) (The DoM trained Harry, Ginny and Luna into magical super-soldiers/spies, some really good fights where the DoM takes the fight to their enemies)
- The Prisoner's Cipher linkffn (One of my favorite fics, a brilliant talented Harry who is absolutely off his rocker, fic deals with the concept of the soul a lot, some of THE BEST action I have read)

Hope these help.

  Post HBP. Harry Potter abandons his friends and flees in a desperate attempt to follow a training regime Dumbledore asked him to follow, prior to his death. But as Harry goes through the motions, he finds that the true enemy is not Voldemort, but himself.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  It is said that convictions are more dangerous foes of truths than lies. What if the tale of the wizarding world wasn't the truth, but merely an interpretation of it? What if a single spark, instigated a man to do what was right, than what was easy? Starts at the end of fifth year. AU. [Elements from Fate/ Stay night] [Rated for Dark, mature themes]

** Well I do have notes in a file for a story idea about a GOD!Female Harry, but with a serious plot and lore behind it all, and she won't be the only one OR even the first to have the unimaginable power she does. :) There will also be severe drawbacks and negatives to even having it, such as the major thing being that you will only live for twenty years. You CAN split the power with another person if you have an intimate connection with them, if you share genuine love with them, but this will only add another ten years to your deadline. AND it will reduce the recipient's lifespan to only another ten years from that moment onward. Which means if they were going to live naturally into the three hundreds, that doesn't matter anymore and they'll die in ten years now just like you. :)

I won't get around to writing this story until after I finish my current main one though, but I'm super excited to get to it. :)
