Hey, just finished reading a few Fanfic's where Harry was in another reality and/or became very OP from his love and research of Magic and couldn't help but think to myself about what it would be like if there was a version of this kind of OP Harry in the One Piece Universe, as a member of the straw hats or not.

So i'm looking for any recommendations for good HP & OP Crossovers


** Luffy would just jump over them and around them, I think and when Harry hits his hat he gets a problem of an angry Luffy

Luffy wins

Sorry, but I don't have anything

*** Wasn't thinking of them fighting against luffy. Thought more along the lines of them joining the straw hats. But thanks anyway.
