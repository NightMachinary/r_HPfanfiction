Id love to read some fics where Voldemort's shadow isn't looming over everyone and Harry grows up semi-normally, with the story just following their day to day lives. Thanks!


** linkffn(13230340) fits what you're looking for. Voldemort exists, but barely impacts the characters, it's mainly just slice-of-life.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Try Prodigal Delinquent by Ethereal Euphoria might be my favorite HP fic ever, 73k words, and I really hope it's still going.
