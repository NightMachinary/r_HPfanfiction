I'm writing a FanFiction right now, and I'm trying to figure out just how many people have actually SEEN Harry's patronus before, specifically, before fifth year starts and after fourth year ends. Basically, up to the point he has to save himself and Dudley from the Dementors at Privet Drive. As a side statistic, how many people in canon actually know what it is? It seems a large majority of the student population knows he can cast one, or has heard rumors he can, but I'm interested, specifically, in:

​

- Who know's what it is (IN CANON)

- Who has seen it cast personally (IN CANON)

​

Thank you for any answers anyone can provide!

EDIT: changed spelling (of what I could) to remove implication of explosive, projectile launching contraptions.


** as in, about to be fired from a cannon?

** He cast it at a quidditch game in 3rd year, so basically all of hogwarts. Seems like not going to quidditch games is pretty rare given the stands are always full, so maybe minus maybe 50 or so students. Rowling said there's roughly a thousand students at hogwarts (though her math has been questioned) so probably around 950 or so.

Plus Sirius, who saw it towards the end. And then he cast it again in the triwizard tournament, although I'm not totally certain how well the audience could see the champions.

*** Someone at the DA meeting at the Hogs Head questions whether Harry can cast a patronus though. So clearly not all the students saw, or weren't aware of what they were seeing, either at the quidditch match third year, or in the maze

**** Or, you know, JKR just forgot that the entire school saw Harry cast it at the Quidditch game. She does tend to forget about things that she's written in the past and how they might have implications down the road.

*** Like [[/u/AevnNoram][u/AevnNoram]] pointed out, it seems that the Hogwarts student body doesn't recognize Harry's patronus for what it is. Was it even a full blown patronus at that point anyways?

**** It was his first fully corporeal Patronus, because it wasn't actual dementors attacking (it was Draco and his goons) So i assume it was easier.

***** Chapter 13 of PoA:

#+begin_quote
  Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at him.

  He didn't stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, /“Expecto Patronum!”/

  Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn't pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead --- he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.
#+end_quote

Later...

#+begin_quote
  “That was quite some Patronus,” said a voice in Harry's ear.

  Harry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and pleased.

  “The dementors didn't affect me at all!” Harry said excitedly. “I didn't feel a thing!”

  “That would be because they --- er --- weren't dementors,” said Professor Lupin. “Come and see ---”

  He led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the field.

  “You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,” said Lupin.

  Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all struggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It looked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle's shoulders. Standing over them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall.

  “An unworthy trick!” she was shouting. “A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!”

I don't think it was a 'full blown' patronus. Maybe a real big mist or something. I could be wrong, but that's just how I read it. Plus, other than Lupin, no one makes a big fuss about him casting it, so I think nobody except Remus, who's been working with him, know's what it was supposed to be.

****** This is from Harry Potter wikia so no guarantees it's right:

Harry Potter took anti-dementor lessons with Remus Lupin in order to learn the advanced charm and so was one of the youngest to attempt this charm with actual results. During a Quidditch match against Ravenclaw in 1994 he cast his very first corporeal Patronus and again in June when he along with Hermione Granger and Sirius Black were being attacked by over a hundred Dementors, he cast a corporeal Patronus powerful enough to drive them all away.

Honestly I always saw it as his first full Patronus, but it could be swung either way especially for a FanFiction. Sirius, Remus, and Hermione would be the only ones to definitely see it then (I'm fairly certain), if we assume no one could see it when he cast it in book 4.

**** Yes it was. Remus praises him, saying that it was "quite a Patronus".

** We can be sure of the entire DA having seen it. He also cast it in front of the OWL examinator. I think Mrs. Figg and Dudleysaw it in the dementor attack, but not entirely sure if either actually saw it. Sirius of course. The Quidditch match is debatable.
