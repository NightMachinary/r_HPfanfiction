I'm tired of all SIs either not caring about all the deaths that are going to happen, or they try to solve the problems by themselves. Any fics where they tell someone about them and the books? Preferably someone with authority, like Dumbledore. And if they aren't believed, they can use veriatiserum.


** So I was trying to figure out what SI stood for, so I read a bit of one of the posted fics.

This is a genre I didn't know I needed! Do the Self Inserted characters know they are in the Harry Potter universe? Like are they aware of the books? Or is it just that they end up in that world without knowing anything about it?

*** Well, it really depends. I've read fics where the SI had the author's personality but nothing beyond that, and I've also read fics where the SI was omnipotent because they have outside knowledge. Depends really.

**** I'd like to see one where it's somewhere in the middle; as in the person being inserted read the Harry Potter books, but it was years ago and so most of the details have been lost to the mists of time, and they only vaguely remember the big plot points.

***** Yes! Honestly, that sounds like the only way of writing a realistic SI with outside knowledge without making them a Mary Sue.

** Its been a while since I read it, but I think that happens (somewhat) in linkffn(A matter of force by Contrabardus). As I recall, the SI eventually tells Harry and others, but not until some years have passed.

  Start with Harry Potter, change something, and Harry learns to rock. Irreverent, chaotic, and the more movies you've seen, the funnier you're likely to find it. Expect many cammeos.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12774480]]) More or less the first thing the SI does once they realize they are in the HP universe is to tell Dumbledore.

  Does the fanfiction realm need another original character insert? Probably not. But here's my take anyway. Alexandra Hughes didn't at first realize she'd been transported into the World of Harry Potter. Then again, there were plenty of clues.

** Please can you rec fics where they don't tell someone? Like the ones you're talking about?

Preferably the ones where they don't care and just enjoy magic. I ask because I'm tired of the ones where they do tell someone. Although I can't remember any names.
