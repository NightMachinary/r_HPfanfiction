Young abused Harry Potter finds a beat up discarded paperback book called Chariots of the Gods by Erich Von Daniken. As Harry's never allowed anything, he steals home this tiny wordy treasure, which changes him forever.

Aliens may exist? Powerful beings who visited us in ancient times and made humans?

Facinated, Harry searches the library for more and builds on it with an obsession. Maybe he's not a freak, maybe he's Alien?

The journey would take him to various of sites and researches across the world. Stonehenge, Glastonbury tor, the great pyramids and all the way to India and their ancient sanskrit texts bout the Vimanas and space battles.

How Harry pays for his journeys must be reasonably realistic, but he would not know he's a wizard until he's naturally 11.

Hogwarts, Harry still believe they are aliens, though they may have forgotten it and makes it his life mission to not only prove it, but taken them back to their ancient ancestors.

So maybe beyond the archaeology!Harry there could be scientist!Harry in it. Or Scientist! Hermione, if he can realistically convince her.

Voldemort gotta happen in a realistic way as well, but against a Harry who may have tried all he could to get in touch with his alien abilities through meditations and so on, may have made him telepathic, maybe with premonitions, as aliens are described to be. (think the force)

Would he rely on science? Up to you.

Relationships? As long as it's not an actual part of the plot, like many usually becomes.

Gender bender? Hell no. Well, unless he masters shape-shifting and hides as a woman while on journeys. I can see that. But it should not be part of the plot.

In the end, the plot can go from Yes, wizards and witches really are aliens, to No, they are not, or even Maybe they are, but we wont found out.\\
The plot it self would be the journey and changes he goes through while he searches for answers about who he is and where he came from and maybe about the changes he can make in the Wizarding world.

What will happen to these silly people when Harry and his beliefs and maybe even extraordinary powers, shows up?

Anything else? What do you think?


** This would actually be reasonably straightforward, at least as far as presenting a believable perspective from Harry.

1) Magicals are the result of genetic alterations, either through tinkering with human genome or simply being the children of the children of children of the 'gods'.

2) The various deities and respected powers = all 'gods'. Probably Merlin was a direct child of one of the 'gods'.

3) Broomsticks are just a very basic degenerate 'chariot/vimana'. This gives him a reason to love flying and competing in Quidditch.

4) Runes = language of the 'gods'? Like how some Christians think of 'anglic script'.

5) Voldemort...went crazy since he was hateful of those who shared magical ancestry (muggleborn)? A lesson to him and all 'purebloods' to respect the magical ancestry of the 'gods' wherever it shows up.

6) Other magical creatures/beings...maybe transplants from the homes of the 'gods' which prospered into breeding populations?

Mostly, if you just present it as Harry interpreting everything from this perspective then not much needs to change. It only gets complicated if you want his perspective to actually be real and maybe have the aliens show up, or something else tangible to happen that can only happen if the book is right.

*** That looks absolutely perfect. But yes, introducing the Aliens is another step one can take. It makes it complicated for sure, and you'd have to decide if they will be a variation of what Erich Von Daniken speaks of, or if it will be the prelude to a sifi crossover; Stargate, star trek, star wars, aliens and the predators and so on.

But if it's not going to be the clichÃ©d crossover, it's probably going to be an original take on the Annunaki and insert them. Maybe wizards and witches are the offsprings of the Nephalim? The giants who are the halbred children of humans and aliens.

Or they are offsprings of the survivors from Atlantis and Lemuria, who are also rumored to be of extraterrestrial origins. Maybe the magical survivors hid beneath powerful wards to hide them from their alien ancestors?

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][Culture Shock by Ruskbyte]] might fit well

Summary: Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet of all things? Especially one where the inhabitants still think nuclear energy is an advanced technology. And let's not forget the 42,000 light year commute

** This sounds a bit like the In the mind of a scientist and the sequels.

*** In what way? Only thing I can compare them with is the possibility of scientist!Harry and the fact that aliens may exist or not. But I don't see Harry as a scientist with technology in this one, but more an archeologists searching for the truth of their past.

The Harry in The Mind of a scientist doesn't care about that and its not even close to what I propose in this prompt. ðŸ¤”

**** More of the end of the prompt I'm pretty sure at the end of the first book he comes to the conclusion wizards descend from aliens.
