Just to clarify that the no-Ron thing is not for bashing reasons but because I feel he's too much Harry's brother from another mother for any chemistry to be realistic. Also, y'all can diss me but I ship Romione.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/962976][This series]] pairs Harry and George. It's sweet and fluffy.

  What if when Hagrid first took Harry to Diagon Alley he met someone who would change his life forever? Follow Harry as he learns about love, trust, friendship, and most importantly as he learns about himself. HP/CW Soul Bond Fic. Slash later on. Dumbles bashing. Past abuse. WIP. Open to suggestions. Enjoy!

Harry has a row with his girlfriend, gets a tattoo, and discovers that denial isn't just a river in Egypt.

  She may look like her father. Hell she may even have a certain lack in regards to rules, she even got his Quidditch talent. Harianna Potter however inherited more from her mother than just her eyes. Smart, caring and kind attracting the attention of a certain red headed twin. George/ fem Harry

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight
