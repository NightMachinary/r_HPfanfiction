I most enjoyed reading the weirdest things, so would now love to know the funniest things you've ever read in a non humor/crack fic.


** When Ginny is fighting off dementors in Hogsmeade, and her patronus is harry.

When Harry, Ron and Hermione travel back in time and in the middle of the serious big final fight build-up go and play ultimate frisbee.

Now that is just ridiculous! Unbelievable! How am I supposed to keep my immersion intact when any fool knows you can't play a game of ultimate with only 3 people...that's offensive. Or do they each summon their human shaped patroni for a bit of 3 vs 3?

** My favorite story has this conversation between a younger Snape and Evan Rosier:

#+begin_quote
  "Ev?"

  "Mmmmm?"

  "Don't try to manipulate the hypersensitive megalomaniac anymore, will you?"

  "...Eh?"

  "Or at least don't use the Platinum Peacock."

** I'm not sure linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) can be considered a non humor/crack fic but still, I've read this pearl: "I have a cousin that likes to be transfigured into a tree for fun and have everyone call him Mr. Woody."

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

*** Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This fanfiction is definitely not humor or crack but I have never laughed harder while reading any book, fanfiction or maybe even manga, than I did while reading this fanfic.

The fuckin' Sorting Hat. Jesus H. Christ.\\
"Go fuck a goat you insipid little ball of sphincter puss!" -- Definitely my favorite line.

** Honestly? Just read [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=157356][this]]. If you can keep a straight face through Chapter 8, then I might indeed benefit from professional help.

  Harry woke the next morning slightly down, though happy at the same time. It didn't take him long to remember that he had been cheated on and that he was holding Quidditch try-outs.
#+end_quote

Okay, you convinced me! That's ridiculous. Now I'll have to read this tomorrow...

Edit-this is a treasure trove of silly.

#+begin_quote
  “Don't you dare talk to me like that. If you are so much in love with Saint Potter, then why are you having a secret relationship with me?” asked Malfoy furiously.

  “I like to live dangerously.” said Cho softly.
