Pretty sure it's been deleted by now, but LJ is not indexed with google or any search engine.

It's /Remember to Floss/ by chipping.

The one line I remember clearly is

“She was, after all, a dentist's daughter, twice over.”

On the off chance that one of you has it saved somewhere, it was one of my favourite stories several years ago and I just remembered it with alarming clarity.

Here you go, though the line you remember is slightly different.
