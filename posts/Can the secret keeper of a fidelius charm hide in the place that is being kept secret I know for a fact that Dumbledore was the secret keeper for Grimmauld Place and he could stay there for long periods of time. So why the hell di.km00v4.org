** So that the books could happen (plus Bill was living in a house to which he was the secret keeper if I am not mistaken, the whole fidelius plot-hook is a mess).

Alternatively, if you really need an in-story explanation, maybe they couldn't be secret-keepers and live in the place in 1981, but then the spell was improved between then and ‘95.

** Other than the "Shell Cottage" example, I believe I've seen a theory that the subject of the secret can't be the secret keeper. So, the secret " The Potters live in Godric's Hollow" can't be held by a Potter... the secret for Grimauld Place is a more grey area since it talks about where the OotP meets, so maybe Dumbledore can be keeper since it doesn't concern living there and he doesn't dwell there longer than needed?

** I'm afraid the only real answer there is the meta one. Rowling is known for pulling whatever she wants at the time to make local plot fit, with very little if any regard for overall setting consistency. Consistency simply isn't a feature of her writing, deal with it, it's fun anyway.

If you want meticulously designed settings that follow consistent rules, other authors are good at that. No author is good at everything and books require a mix of a great many different things, so there will always be a mix of weak points and strong points depending on the individual author's strengths.

The strength of the Fidelius Charm is directly proportional to the Faith and Trust one has in the Secret Keeper with the only sure way to know if it was weak was to have it broken.

"Fidelis" is Latin, meaning trustworthy and faithful. "Fidelius" is the neuter comparative form of this word, meaning more trustworthy and more faithful. "Fidelius" can also translate to authors. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Fidelius_Charm]]

That or the Fidelius is just one of those old rediscovered super finicky spells and thus 'special'.

But he has Faith in his brothers in all but blood that they'll never betray the Faith he has placed in them.

Those that would wish to find the secret could nuke the country to bedrock and still not touch/harm the secret. Weak Faith could mean that the secret keeper can indirectly and unintentionally reveal the secret. While the Fidelius only allows the Secret Keeper to reveal the secret and prevent all methods of bypassing the Keeper to access the secret, the absoluteness of the protection is proportional to the absoluteness of the Faith given which can only be checked by being tested resulting in pass/fail. A secret is a concept and thus the Magic of the Fidelius is fundamentally conceptual and can't be munchkined to work around it, but Faith is subjective so the spell functions slightly differently for each Keeper and Secret pair.

But once it is cast there is no difference between those two? Unless it fails which is easy to recognize and I suppose you can just try again.

Which would mean that Bill's Fidelius was much harder to cast than the Potters' (but equally strong), which I suppose is possible but I'd think if Bill manages it then either the Potters or Dumbledore would have managed it too...

***************** This doesn't really track with the idea that /betrayal/ is necessary for the Fidelius to fail, because betrayal always has to be conscious.

On the other hand, IIRC in OotP the Order was careful to apparate/disapparate from/to the top of the steps that was still in the Fidelius so that Death Eater watchers wouldn't see them and figure out the location, and the Secret Keeper was Dumbledore who was both highly trusted and spent lots of time outside the house.

Anyways, when you live inside a Fidelius to protect yourself then it most likely doesn't actually matter if the secret is broken when your enemy sees you enter or leave the location. If they ever see you /at all/ they will just attack you immediately, so it's irrelevant that the Fidelius might fail if they observe you entering/leaving*. Therefore, the benefit of using the person who is hiding inside the Fidelius vastly outweighs the benefit of using someone else.

* At least in the situation the Potters were in, and arguably most situations where the goal is to protect one or multiple people for a long duration instead of just having a secret meeting place and occasional hideout.

** The actual description of the fidelius charm in canon is that you hide "a secret" in the soul of a person, called the secret keeper.

JKR then proceeds to ONLY use this to hide specific houses. What a waste.

There is a crack fic out there where Harry and Hermione find out how easy it is to cast and go to town, using each other as the repository for secrets such as "the incantation for the killing curse is Avada Kedavra," and devolving to ones like "Death Eaters have functioning legs." I don't think I bookmarked it, so if you know what it is please let me know because now I want to read it again.

**** I am wondering where the author of that admittedly hilarious bit of fan fiction got his/her definition of the Fidelius Charm. According to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (written by J.K. Rowling and published on Pottermore on 8/10/15):

"The Fidelius Charm is extremely ancient and still used to this day. It involves the concealment of information inside a living person. The chosen person, or Secret Keeper, is the only person who is thenceforth capable of revealing the protected information to others, however many previously knew it. If the Secret Keeper shares the hidden information, the person to whom he or she has confided it will be bound by the Fidelius Charm and find it impossible to pass the information on."

The wording here suggests that, once the Fidelius Charm takes effect, the Secret Keeper is the only one who is able to share the "secret information" with those who do not already know it. Meanwhile, rather than forgetting the "secret information", those who know it already but are not the Secret Keeper simply lose the ability to share the "secret information".

My thoughts is that James was still a active member of the Order. He choice Peter because it could have been public knowledge Sirius was Harry's godfather. He could have assumed or persuaded to not be the secret keeper because Voldemort doesn't trust people and would assume James would only trust himself to protect his family and with Sirius as a obvious second made James question putting his eggs in one basket. Also my head cannon always considered Peter as the overlooked Marauder. He might not be as academic as James or Remus. Sirius could have been well liked. Peter could have been seen as a hanger on. Maybe equal to early Neville with the Golden trio. Peter could have been the perfect secret keeper because no one would have thought he would know anything important.

** First Fundamental Rule of People - we're all emotional morons who evolved for stubborn grit over sense and logic. We'll make idiot decisions we feel good about instead of the common sense decisions every time. :D

Sure, it's a stupid decision, but people make stupid decisions all the time. I have no idea why it was canonically Sirius/Peter instead of James/Lily/Dumbledore, but I'd rationalise it one of two ways.

First, emotion. I can see the four idiots getting together and talking about it, then having a big huggy moment of "Oh, we're Marauders, we do all these hijinks together. No way Sirius/Peter is gonna let us down or not get involved somehow." in that "I, like, totally love you bro, wanna be the Godfather of my kid?" sort of way. Especially since the secret can't actually be tortured out of the secret keeper (apparently canon?) and thus the keeper would basically be fine and at very little risk because torturing/killing them would be pointless and less helpful than leaving them alive.

Second, bait. If the Secret Keeper is locked up behind the Fidelius, then there's no way to draw Voldemort out by getting them. Whether that's Dumbledore's master plan or the Potters' is up to your discretion. :)

I don't think it was ever explicitly stated in canon that the secret keeper can't live under the Fidelius, but it is an explanation that fits the information we have.

**** Right What is Wrong has pointed out several plot holes just from this scene in Deathly Hallows in the Force Interrupt series of short-shorts (longer than drabbles, but not always by much):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779463/3/][Chapter 3, Mutual Fidelius]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779463/6/][Chapter 6, Shell Cottage Again]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779463/9/][Chapter 9, Shell Cottage YET Again]]

One of my favorite stories that involves problems with a fidelius is In the Hollow of the White Hazel by OlegGunnarsson, which explores the vulnerability of the secret being worded in a specific way. linkffn(13193093)

Also, there was no indication that the Longbottoms were ever under the Fidelius or that they were friends with or even knew the Potters as anything more than fellow Order members. So it makes a lot more sense for them to choose someone who has been a close friend for a decade.

** As far as I know, there's no true in depth explanation for that, so the way I like to think of it is that the caster cannot allow themselves to be the secret keeper, though the secret keeper the self can live within the Fidelius Ward. However, that creates issues itself with how the charm itself is performed - if that's the case, how was dumbledore the secret keeper of Grimmauld Place? Maybe Moody cast the Fidelius for Grimmauld? It seems like the type of 'paranoid' idea he would come up with and Dumbledore would agree with.

As for the Potters I don't have an explanation in my head that fully makes sense. If it wasn't Dumbledore who cast the charm (though I'm pretty sure I read somewhere he was) then Lily would have made James the Secret Keeper or vice versa. The only reason I can think of for not secreting the Charm within either of the other would be further misdirection, which was somehow revealed or seen through. However if Dumbledore did cast their charm, then surely he would have known that Peter was the secret keeper and not Sirius?

Honestly the Fidelius is such a wacky unexplained charm that can really just do whatever it wants to fit the plot according to JKR, which is fair enough. I'd say if you're writing your own fanfiction and want to include it though, come up with a concrete way if how it works and stick to those rules. A good way to keep it in mind would be to put those rules in a planning document under their own header :)

** Well, pretty much every single plot hole in the Harry Potter books can be explained by Dumbledore being a manipulative old coot, since I really don't believe Harry figured out everything Dumbledick did or was a part of. But, well, yes it is possible. Bill was the secret keeper of Shell Cottage, actually. So, really, I blame Dumbledore being a manipulative arse for the Potters's incident.

The most damning piece of evidence of Dumbledore's manipulations is that he didn't order a trial for Sirius. He was the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot at that time, he would have been able to do so instead of doing the /highly/ irresponsible thing of giving two teenagers a time-turner and pressuring them to save a man they just met. I could go on and on, really. But I won't.

It is canon that he did not know. The Marauders only transformed once a month and well away from the castle, to our knowledge. And even if he did know (which he didn't), why would he recognize Pettigrew? He'd have to be very familiar with Pettigrew's rat form, as Sirius was, and even then he'd have to get a close look at Scabbers.

What a ridiculous argument.

No they do not.

- He was ousted from the school in the second book.

******* It's not a matter of reasoning out plot holes really. The traditional "fanon" utilizes a variety of concepts from substandard writers; these concepts weren't very good examples of plot, and world building to begin with. Unfortunately after a game of telephone going back half a decade, these; already very flawed, concepts have become caricatures of themselves.

I have fairy high standards when it comes to what I read, and in my experience 99% of what is written in this fandom is utter trash. Fanon in this regard can be used as a major signifier of very amateur writing, this is because Fanon concepts are typically implemented by writers who lack the creativity to reason out their own solutions, or from writers who lack the world building skills(and self awareness) to realize their changes are just making things worse.

** This is my theory, I have no idea if it's right.

1. The secret about Shell Cottage is “where is Shell Cottage?” So Bill, the owner, could hide it within himself and share it as needed.

2. The secret about James and Lily was “where are James and Lily hiding?” The answer happened to be “at their house,” but the secret was fundamentally different: What's Bill's address vs. Does anyone know where these people are

3. Lily and James probably could have hidden the secret within themselves, but if everything went to plan, how would they be found after the war? We aren't given any clues as to how the charm is lifted (other than conflicting information about if it lifts after you die). So there's the chance that the war ends, and they leave, and they go to find Remus, Peter, and Sirius, and find them, go up to them and say “hey we are right here, at this table with you” and what would happen? Would J and L appear and scare the crap out of their friends? Probably. Humorous, but impractical.

** They have to stay hidden. They can't get out of the house. It's too risky.

So if they can't get out and tell anyone the secret once the charm is cast. No one could find them after that.

They likely didn't want to take the risk to write it to Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore and Peter, in case the owl get intercepted or something.

So if they do this, they are all alone until they die. Even if somehow Voldemort dies and everything is back to normal, no one would be able to tell them that they can come out of hiding.

So the smart choice is someone that can get out and tell the secret to people needed.

It's eitheir Dumbledore, Sirius, Peter or Remus.

They were already suspicious of Remus. Or at least Sirius was, and I can believe he conviced the Potter that Remus wasn't a good choice.

Don't forget that if the secret keeper dies, everyone who have been told become the secret keeper. That is too many potentials leak.

Dumbledore is old and too many people want him dead. So he is also too risky.

So, they choose Sirius. But Sirius was too obvious (this was a good point). Everyone would focus on him and try to get it out of him, somehow. Well let them try. They can't success since Surprise Surprise, he actually isn't the secret keeper.

Peter being overlooked is crucial to the plan. If he hadn't been a traitor, it would have been likely that DE and Voldemort would waste weeks on Sirius then Dumbledore then likely Remus and every other Order members before thinking about Peter.

It was a good plan, when you consider their unique situation.

Bill could get out, Dumbledore wasn't living at Grimmauld and could talk to other people. So it isn't exactly the same situation

** Perhaps the secret keeper can't live inside the protected dwelling. So Dumbledore could visit Grimmauld Place, put he couldn't stay there like it was a home.

***** No, Bill was the secret keeper for Shell Cottage.

  “I've been getting them all out of the Burrow,” he explained. “Moved them to Muriel's. The Death Eaters know Ron's with you now, they're bound to target the family --- don't apologize,” he added at the sight of Harry's expression. “It was always a matter of time, Dad's been saying so for months. We're the biggest blood-traitor family there is.” “How are they protected?” asked Harry. “Fidelius Charm. Dad's Secret-Keeper. And we've done it on this cottage too; I'm Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that's hardly the most important thing now.

** Jk wrote a beautiful story but with plot holes everywhere, for example 1.as you mentioned yourself of the secret keepers why can't potters cast felidius one explanation could be given that is only exceptionally powerful wizards can cast those or with gobline runes which only few can afford, 2.wizards population so dumb they don't even know how to perform a protego spell, but can run an economy of wizards I mean wtf, 3. School kids fighting death eaters and defeating them, so either they are too strong for their own good or it's just a big plot hole Rowling left, and where are the adults except for the order and Weasley did we even see a normal citizen adding their contribution to the war, 4. Hermione how the hell can she be so smart and do every spell, author should have created Hermione with super memory and average power, that would have fit the plot so well, 5. Why wasn't luna introduce before order of the phoenix ,when ginny was possessed by Tom riddle she should have been there for her , for God sake they are childhood friends, 6. Rowling should have made decision with whom Harry or Ron or other characters would end up at the start of the story , then atleast their would have been progress for those ships from start of the story like Harry and Ginny , Rowling should have started making them close after chamber incident, then that way Harry suddenly out of nowhere didn't have to fall in love with her, and please Hermione should have ended with Malfoy not Ron , 7. And my most major problem is the power level and specially variety of spell which was clearly lacking , I mean ordinary wizards are so dumb thay can be killed by muggles easily, their should have been a amount of level of power among wizards like ranks A - S rank with Voldemort S++ and Dumbledore S+++ , this or some kind of scale which can measure someone magical core at the time of birth , A author must always focus on the world more than the story because without a realistic world even the most beautiful sory will fell Barren.

*** Magical cores dont really exist in canon. All wizards are technically the same strength; and no one ever seems to run out of energy.

The only reason Voldemort and Dumbledore were so much stronger than everyone else was because they were geniuses who could control magic stuff alot better.

Why should she have ended up with the guy who called her slurs, wished for her death and nearly killed her actual boyfriend ?
