Does anyone have recommendations for fanfictions where Harry either has an interest in or practices the dark art? I don't necessarily want dark/evil fanfictions, but ones where he's drawn into or uses it, but remains good. Bonus points if Sirius or Remus are in it because I like those dudes. Or Dumbledore because I like him seeing his 'golden boy' not play completely into his hands. Some good Voldemort/Tom Riddle temptation is fun too (though, again, not necessarily him joining the side of Voldemort)

Thanks friends!


** link(4745329) involves Harry dabbling in Dark Magic, but doesn't turn evil. It's sadly unfinished, though.

***** For what it's worth, I remember worrying that the fic was heading towards the manipulative!Dumbledore trope (which I hate), but later chapters ended up being much better on that front, with Harry realizing all the conflicting priorities Dumbledore is trying to juggle. So if that was your problem too, maybe give it another shot?

****** My issue is that I really want to find a fic with Harry and Draco becoming good pals, not just a substitute Ron, and while the above mention one has him in slytherin, it's just not what I expected. But definitely will try to tough it out while I also read “They Shook Hands” just started year two and I appreciate the author is a bit more subtle about rivalries between houses (one of my complaints with OtWtG is how lazy it is “wow harry, for a slytherin you act like a lot like a grffyndor” “Wow what a boneheaded Gryffndor move Potter” etc etc)

  Have you ever been killed multiple times because two of your friends are head over heels in love with each other but won't admit it? ... Okay, probably not. But Mallory Keen has and she's not going to put up with this situation any longer. Making an alience with your friend's friends (one of which is really handy with magic) to hook them up isn't going too far, right?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
