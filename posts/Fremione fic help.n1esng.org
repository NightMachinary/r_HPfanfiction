:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ughh I can't find this fic and I have scoured fanfic and just can't seem to find it. It's a completed fic about fremione. Now the problem is im not sure what type of fremione story whether it's a marriage law one or just a random. BUT in this one she's close with bill and charlie. Charlie in this one is gay and confides in hermione about it and when he's coming out the closet he holds her hand during dinner. Bill is more protective of her and considers her as one of her pack I think. And i'm pretty sure in this same story, charlie and hermione end up having a water fight in the kitchen? And she calls it a wet t-shirt contest maybe? (Although i may be mixing it up with another, but if anyone knows that one too then...xD) i know that all the weasley kids here meet up once or twice together to think of a gift for arthur and molly too, which they eventually decide on as a trip. Everyone jokes around saying that hermione is molly's favorite child and charlie is hermione's favorite weasley lol


** This is post-war btw and I think hermione may have been pregnant?
