**** I think it's more that if you read incest, and keep reading ways that it's fine, why there's nothing wrong with it, etc... it can bleed over into real life situations. While we'd like to believe that every person on Earth is a reasonable, decent human being, the reality is sadly much worse. I agree that if you have the mentality to seperate real life, and fiction you'll be fine, but again that sadly isn't reality. So while there isn't inherent harm, harm can still occur. I'd say that reading it is fine, but the second you start making up reasons on why you could date your sister, or cousin, stop reading such stories, and maybe read stories that show why it is bad, and horrible. Have a balance.

I've found the best way to prove my point is to get said person in an argument(in this case you) to go out there, and do your own research on it. You'd get a better understanding this way, and you'd have your own sources that you can confirm. So if you truly care enough about this, I invite you to do some research on it with an open mind.

And plenty of psychological studies have been done on video-game violence etc. And the general consensus (if I remember correctly) is that unless their grasp on reality is shaky as hell, human beings have little difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality - this doesn't, however, touch on the effects of age innapropriate material on children, which has been shown to have deleterious effects (ratings on films and video games aren't generally a bad thing).

Ergo, fictional incest, while a bit squicky, isn't in any significant way some moral event horizon that's going to corrupt people into banging their siblings.

You don't get that when just presented with a set of evidence already compiled. Like I said, if anyone cares enough to know then do the research themselves. It'll give more in-depth knowledge, and also allow you to even see argument that both support, and don't support said arguments, and why.

I'd like to believe that video games, books, movies, TV, etc... don't effect your psyche, but that is complete, and utter bull. Every single thing you experience has an impact on your psyche, and how you view the world, and if you watch/read/play enough of any one thing it will shape how you percieve said subjects. It's why I said don't read so much for so long that it effects, I didn't say not to read it at all, but to basically have variety. I don't think that came across clearly, but that's what I'm going for.

It's why after playing, and reading so many violent things I didn't really care about the recent shooting up east. It's desensitised me to at least the news about it. Don't get me wrong, if I was there at the tine, or recently after it'd effect me, just not as much, because my psyche has been beavily impacted by such thing just like it has to most people my age sadly.

*** Honestly, I'd rather read Harry having sex with his mom than with the people who murdered her. I mean, it's not as if they had a regular mother/son relationship nor as if it is possible without time travel (or weird AUs).

Slash requests don't get downvoted to oblivion, they mostly hover around +5. What is downvoted to oblivion are requests for Death Eater pairings, which is understandable since Harry/Snape is pretty much Anne Frank/the guy who sold her family out to the Gestapo.

Regarding threads that get downvoted, it's inaccurate to say that Death Eater pairing threads are harder hit than slash threads. Bellatrix/Harry and Narcissa/Harry threads consistently get upvoted higher than Death Eater slash requests. In several cases recently I've seen threads in which someone didn't settle for just downvoting the request post but seemingly went inside the thread to downvote every single recomendation comment.

Not true. Most of the Harry/Narcissa or Harry/Bella request threads I have seen in the past year are just general requests looking for any stories with that pairing.

What you've said doesn't really address the question of bias in voting patterns. Why should members of this sub upvote all threads about a pairing between Harry and a female Magical equivalent of a white supremacist just because of two fics? We could argue that there are fics of Death Eater slash pairings that are of equal or better quality, and yet Death Eater slash pairing threads don't benefit from the same trend as the Bella or Narcissa ones.

To be honest I've never used the Discord, and I have no desire to. I'm not surprised to hear there was drama, though. IRC and similar chatroom style gatherings often tend towards that.

Regardless, this is not a question of what a few vocal members think but rather a question of what would be more beneficial for drawing in and maintaining members of the sub in the long term. Hypothetically, do you think that the sub would gain more members if it had only threads that were to your taste?

There are a great many stories I don't like which get recommended frequently. But I don't mind those because they aren't whitewashing magical Nazis. You won't see me greatly enjoying the discussion on James/Sirius, but there is nothing wrong with that pairing IMO. Which is not something you can say about pairings with scum such as Draco Malfoy or Tom Riddle Jr/Voldemort.

Their past is rarely addressed or acknowledged, and, for some reason, the generic "I was forced/mind controlled to do it due to the Marriage contract" excuse is completely absent in slash. Even the "time travel to before they were fascist scum" trope barely appears. Generally, those stories pretend as if the whole civil war with its death squads and concentration camps was nothing more than a pub brawl.

I have outlined plots on how you could write a believable Malfoy and even a Bellatrix pairing, but I know of no fic which comes close to that. The authors seem to enjoy the awkwardness which comes from the torture scene (Bellamione) or the fact that Draco is a bigoted little shit. They do not want to change their characters to be better people. Especially with Malfoy, stories flat out ignore that he repeatedly committed war crimes which would have seen him shot during the second world war.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They should not. But those two fics are all that comes around in the Harry/Bellatrix threads.

Narcissa Malfoy, in canon at least, actually does nothing you could stick her in prison for (unlike her son, husband and sister, who all could face death for their (war) crimes).

#+end_quote

What is there to benefit from? There are two Bellatrix ones which aren't total garbage and yet still not good. They are also widely known around here.

And one humorous with Narcissa, but as explained above, canon Narcissa is pretty much a name only outside the one time she lies to Voldemort.

Also, you seem to oversee the one crucial advantage a Narcissa pairing has: The MC gets to taunt Malfoy that he (or she if we go with Hermione) fucked his mother last night and potentially has the photographic evidence. There is no comeback for such a line as "I fucked your mother, wanna see the picture?". And doing so does not require carnal relations with a magical Nazi. Other than throwing him into prison/through the veil, this is the best revenge you can get on Malfoy other than perhaps cuckolding him.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

False. A variety of fics get recommended in those threads, not just those two fics. The quantity and the varied writing quality of fics recommended in those threads is roughly equal to the quantity and the varied writing quality of fics recommended in the slash Death Eater request threads. That's not a justifiable reason for upvoting/downvoting, and I seriously doubt that's the root of the bias at play here.

You seem fixated on describing your own preferences for why one pairing is better than another rather than addressing the actual topic of this thread, i.e. voting trends on request threads and whether those trends are harmful or beneficial to the sub.

**** If canon rules are to be strictly followed always, then only white people would be allowed to play parts in Shakespeare. Are you fine with that? Hamilton should be banned because how on earth can people of colour play the part of the founding fathers of USA? Only animals from the African Savannah should be allowed on stage for the Lion King musical.

The problem is that canon rules are never strictly followed. No matter how much we all love Emma Watson, let's be honest Hermione was never that kind of a stunner. And she definitely didn't have the fine, smooth mane of hair that Emma has. So, why isn't anybody complaining about that then? What about Bill Weasley looking like a freshly recovered cholera victim? Or wait- middle aged people playing James and Lily at the age of 20?

I have absolutely no problem with white people playing lead roles in anime/manga adaptations. Because it's fiction after all. That's the magic of fiction - there can be hundreds of interpretations. But it should work both ways, as in people of other races being allowed to play white parts. When I'm watching a movie adaptation, I don't spend half of the movie thinking about whether the actor resembles the character or not. I look for whether the actor is doing a good job in capturing the essence of the character that's all.

***** But that's the thing. It's not working both ways. Why was it necessary to change Hermione's race? Would you be okay with changing the races of the Black Panther characters? If one is okay but the other isn't, then it's not okay.

My issue is when people start lying about the canon material, and then use that lie to justify changes in the adaptation.

Oh, and btw, I'm not white. I just don't like the unnecessary changes made to casting that don't at the very least respect the source material.

I didn't like Ghost in the Shell Hollywood adaptation because the original themes were screwed up. Canonically Kusanagi's shell is ambiguous as is her origin. Makoto Kusanagi's Isn't even her real name. The Hollywood adaptation messes up the themes by making it all about being special when it's not. It's about what makes one human despite no longer possessing flesh and not knowing of another life outside of that.

I didn't like the Death Note adaptation either, because the message was screwed up as well. The themes have to deal with the concept of justice, and like Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Series, is a critique on the Japanese Justice System. The Netflix adaptation turned it into a half assed critique of American foriegn interventionists policy. It just wasn't Death Note anymore. At that point, they might as well just create a new IP.

I don't exactly have any opinions on Hamilton if I'm honest. I do, however, know it's historically inaccurate and therefore will prefer to read a history book than watch the play.

As for Lion King. It stays true to African roots. What else you want me to say?

Do I think that it's wrong for people to deride others for what they read etc? Absolutely. Read all the /Harry/Whomping Willow/ you want.

But do I think an unregulated group of people can behave in an unbiased manner and not throw their ideologies down others' throat? No, I realistically can't.

About the discussion on whether people should read whatever they want (incest, H/Draco, etc) I firmly believe that everyone should have the freedom to read whatever they want.

As I see it, incest /fiction/ isn't that bad, it just creates a fantasy world where an older female figure satisfies you any way you want and so on. It doesn't mean that the reader wants to fuck their mom irl. Or their father, sister, brother, etc. This is the reason why PHub is littered with "step-mom" and "step-sis" videos.

Even necrophilia is something people like as an idea, an ultimate "show of dominance" so to say.

But all that discussion is aside from the fact that so long as I don't actually hurt someone else, I should be allowed to do whatever the eff I want.

But can I expect an average person to be logical and understanding? Absolutely not.
