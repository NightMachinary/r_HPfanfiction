So we've all encountered the horror of marriage law fics. However, can anyone name a marriage law fic where, instead of the two people coming to gradually fall in love with each other they just try to murder each other? Preferably it ought to take this to absurd extremes: Hermione putting exploding curses inside Malfoy's marmalade at breakfast would be pretty much step one.


** I did come up with a very strange idea a little while ago where Voldemort ended up enthralled to Harry, Marriage-Law style.

He still wanted to kill Harry, but the nature of their bond meant that he couldn't outright attempt murder, so whenever he did something like poison the food or lay a trap or whatnot, he had to politely let Harry know.

"Just to let you know, Harry Potter, I brought some fish-and-chips from a muggle shop tonight. Out-of-character for me, I know. In any case, I put quite a bit of hemlock in it, so do remember your bezoar."

**** Sorry, my writing skills are a bit on the fritz at the moment...I know it starts with Harry claiming the Slytherin vaults, being guaranteed a bride but the only available person to be a bride is Voldemort himself, and the wedding vows included 'true and faithful', hence why Voldemort is being totally honest about his putting lethal things in Harry's life.

***** is it the right thing though? the loss of life in another war would cause much more misery than the law itself would. Also for such a ridiculous law to even be able to be enforced, a decent amount of public support would be required(and they would probably need a very good reason), so a change by force would end up quite bloody .

The trio also didn't start a war over the slavery of the house-elves which is arguably worse then a marriage law, instead Hermione choose to oppose their treatment from the withing the system itself and joined the Ministry. I think it would be more in character for them to try to change the law by peaceful means.

The people of Britain just endured a war and lost many people, I strongly doubt that many of them would prefer war over peace regardless of reason. Starting another revolution instead of attempting to using diplomacy would just have the trio appear as warmongers or wannabe dictators. Also one evil and unreasonable law doesn't necessarily mean that the system is beyond fixing.

A war over this Issue would just be stupid. Regardless of the cause being just,starting a war to forcibly free all the currently enslaved house-elves would have almost exclusively negative consequences. For one unlike the marriage law issue their would have much less support for this. I cant even see Harry agreeing with this and most of the support Hermione would gain would be out of affection and loyalty towards her with very few actually agreeing that its the right thing, or even worth starting a war over. The war would basically end if she dies. And even if they were successful they would end up with hundreds of traumatized elves who blame themselves for being freed and basically chased away from their families. Many of them would end up damaged beyond recovery. The way house-elves are indoctrinated that their enslavement is right, having wizards die to forcibly free them would only ruin their lifes.

Sure you could say you dont buy those, but it would make a difference for them, like it didn't make a difference when Hermione refused to eat the food made by house-elves.

Of course people would do everything to stop it to happen to the people they care about, but going to war would not be the first choice. Id rather imagine a lot of protest or strikes in the ministry, the use of loophole and bribes or just straight up boycotting the law and refusing to either get married or to consummate the marriage, or just leave the country.

I actually do, and thats why I think the average citizen would try to avoid it instead of going through that again. Many people would fight to defend their own rights or those of other, but I have personally experience how horrible it is to hear about civilian casualties in an area where I have people I love and care about and not knowing if they are a hurt or worse. Or just straight up having people I care about volunteering to go to war and not knowing if they are still alive.

I would say though that people are remarkably tolerant of slavery going on within their own communities even today as long as they can turn a blind eye. I wouldn't necessarily trust the average person to actually take up arms against it. That's just because I'm a bit cynical when it comes to people though.

However, one would hope that yes, the heroes of a war against discrimination and prejudice wouldn't step down when people are being enslaved, or when (as in marriage law fics) people are being systematically raped and subjected to some sort of eugenics program (which is what those fics amount to).

************ Germans are dying out. Frankfurt/Main already has more people with migration background than "Germans" and in Offenbach, 80% of all babies born have foreign roots. And the politicians and state media are only making matters worse by ignoring the problem, which is wind on the sails of right-wing parties. Add to that the general incompetence of the Ministers. For example, our Defence Minister would have been tried for High Treason during the cold war. She put focus on Infantry transports for suitable for pregnant women while denying funds on any relevant projects. Our Air Force is grounded, our new Frigates were designed without air defence, spare parts are rare all across the service branches... As a result, our helicopter pilots are losing their flight licenses despite already renting civilian helicopters to scrap together any flying hours...

Tl;dr: It is a sad state of affairs over here.

************* Germans may be dying out but I haven't seen any news articles talking about the extinction of them as I have seen about the Japanese and Koreans. But if you don't mind me asking, and you don't have to answer if you don't want to, what were your views regarding Chancellor Merkel's open-border policy of refugees during the European Migration Crisis in 2015? I'm asking because while in grad school, I wrote a paper for my Macroeconomics class on the subject with a strict adherence to Germany's economy.

************** Short answer, no.

The whole crisis was a lose-lose situation. Taking in Syrian refugees should not have been possible for Germany since we are surrounded by safe countries. That being said, we should have taken everyone entitled for political asylum, but promptly deported everyone else. Age checks by X-ray should be mandatory.

You come here to be safe? There's a shovel, we have work for you, digging holes is not difficult. Are you from Morocco? The next train for the ferry from Gibraltar leaves at 4, platform 7. You deny to shake a woman's hand? There is the door, I hope we never see you again?

I mean, since 45 we had several waves of immigration in Germany. And most of those integrated well, some even becoming more German than the "real" Germans. And yet people from Muslim countries refuse to use our language, reject our values, are as antisemitic as the Third Reich and we sit by and do nothing. I speak from decades of personal experience here.

As for my political orientation, I would immediately vote for Sara Wagenknecht as chancellor (left wing party), but most of her party are reality deniers living in pipedreams. Voting has becoming choosing the lesser of all evils, which sadly nowadays means populist right wing. I mean, the AFD parliamentary members are good politicians, most of them highly educated former members of Merkel's party who left because they were fed up with her. If you don't want Merkel, there are only the left (Die Linke) or the right (AFD) to choose from, and that means either a party with a few really outstanding politicians and a shitton of gender snowflakes who want our women to be raped or a party with 50% ok-ish politicians and 50% right wing extremists...

*************** Thanks for your reply. I always wondered what Germans thought about Merkel's policy of not observing any limit on the number of asylum seekers. I actually have two cousins (with families of their own) who live in Hanover and Cologne who share your sentiments.

I think what's interesting (and downright crazy) is that many industrialized nations are facing the same problems with immigration with one side of the spectrum letting them have free reign while the other side wants to impose limitations. It's the same with the United States and immigration from Central and South America, the islands in the Caribbean. That's one of the main reasons Trump was voted into office was due to his hard stance regarding immigration, one platform of his that I actually supported (though building a wall on the border of Mexico and having them fund it was just ridiculous).

I've heard many times, though I don't know if it's true, that the German media was actually covering up anti-immigration sentiments in the country shortly after Merkel announced her open-door policy for the asylum seekers. And of course, international media deemed many of those traveling from the Middle East and Africa all as asylum seekers when many of them were actually economic migrants and technically, by Merkel's words, not applicable to come to Germany for free.

Yet, when I wrote this in my paper, my Economics teacher didn't buy it as Economics teaches us that immigration is good. However, that's based on the theory of growing GDP in which bigger populations = stronger economies. It's a subject matter that's absurd to many degrees and if you try to refute them, it's their word against yours.

Anyways, thanks for your responses. They've all been fascinating. Also, your English is really good (better than some students I've come into contact with at university).

**************** In theory, more population = more GDP works. But as of today, each asylum seeker costs the German nation over 500€/month. Which is even worse than it sounds when you realise that the same money would feed 10 refugees in the Libanon or Jordan (according to the Ministry for development aid). And unlike our Japanese immigrants, who take language classes on their own accord and are noticeable in the criminal statistics by having the lowest crime rate/100000, most refugees are simply not qualified. The government made grand speeches about "doctors and engineers" coming from Syria, but most of them are unqualified people who don't speak our language.

If it wasn't tragic, it would be quite funny how the media are covering up refugee/immigrant crimes. "A group of young men" almost always refers to refugees while mentioning that a German did something usually means that it was someone with foreign roots.

As for my English, I blame the Internet. Ot used to be quite atrocious until I spent far too much time online.

Sorry to piggyback on this, but many European countries (and some in East Asia) try to bribe couples into having children yet it doesn't seem to be working. Of course, there's many factors to consider when touting population growth (from higher birth rates and fertility rates) yet many people are under the assumption that bigger is better when a lot of the time, it isn't. I'm not saying the world should kill off those humans that aren't needed (because let's face, humans do that themselves) but I'm under the mindset that a small population is actually more beneficial in the long-run. And quite frankly, with most of the industrialized nations in the fourth or fifth stage in the Demographic Transition, governments, no matter if they want to or not, will have to accommodate a decrease in their respective populations.

I know that the idea of a marriage law is evil and ridiculous. But morally its not worse then slavery, only much harder to enforce with much less benefits(benefits for the people enacting it, not the subjects of course).

Thats why for it to even be possible would require support from the public, that means the resulting revolution would end up with many casualties on both sides. Causing more pain and misery than the actual law would.

Like I said when faced with the issue of house-elves Hermione chose to work with the system to free them, she didn't want to start a revolution to remove the people in power who allow house-elf enslavement.

I think this is really the rub. I don't believe the wizarding world as envisioned by JK Rowling, with mostly liberal western values and equality for women in particular, would even /think/ of a marriage law in the first place. Now, if that's the conceit of the story, by all means, /vive la révolution/, but I think it would take /much/ worse than what we see in most marriage law stories to actually get to that point.

I'm talking about things like population loss so severe that it threatens the genetic health of the population, skyrocketing miscarriage rates among a large portion of the population, not just Sacred 28 families, evidence that everyone marrying muggles would only make things worse that was solid enough for even Hermione to agree with it, etc. And even then, the people would want to deal with it in the least onerous way possible--doing what the real Europe is doing by bringing in more immigrants and offering cash incentives to have more children before they ever considered having the Ministry play matchmaker.

******* I have, sadly, to disagree there. First, HP lacks modern liberal values. Slavery, the death penalty, life in prison with daily torture at the hand of inhuman fiends, summary executions by Ministerial decree with no one batting an eye, and a tellingly easy switch to a fascist murderous regime show that no, Wizarding Britain isn't liberal or modern. If you take all the lot devices JKR used to ensure that Harry had hardships to deal with instead of support seriously, it's a fucked up cesspit of corruption and nightmare-inducing horror.

Second, even western democracies passed inhuman laws in the name of eugenics in the 20th century. What was done to Roma and poor people, homosexuals, indigenous cultures etc. is abhorrent. Forced sterilisation is among the least horrible there.

Third, a culture where love potions can be sold to teenagers without anyone batting an eye but the sole muggleborn with both a brain and a moral backbone isn't that far removed from passing marriage laws - though they would probably be gender-equal, I'll grant you that.
