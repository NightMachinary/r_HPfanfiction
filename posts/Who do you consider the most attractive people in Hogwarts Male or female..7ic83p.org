** In the movies or just groups in general?

Because if we're going just by typical school cliques, it's the Quidditch players hands down. Have to be physically fit and whatnot. I meant, we can argue there are some ugly players but you gotta have a winning face for the team.

If we're talking movies, then the Twins.

*** You posted this comment twice. And I meant just in your own head. Who do you picture as the most attractive when you think of characters.

**** Sorry about that. Bad signal.

Most attractive...er..

Still the twins. Quidditch players with humor. Red hair too. I do like me some bad boys, so the Lestrange brother or Antonin Dolohov too.

Women, I picture the most attractive being Hermione or Narcissa Malfoy. Either we have cold, sharp aristocrat who is a good mother or an awkward nerd who is kickass and looks good when she puts effort into it.

** From the movies (No particular order): Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Dean Thomas, Hermione Granger, and Ginny Weasley

And from the books... I don't really imagine characters as attractive or not, unless it's specified.. So I guess Ginny Weasley again. And Sirius Black.
