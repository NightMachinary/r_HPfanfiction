At the end of the first war against Voldemort, the Ministry under Barty Crouch Jr., riled up by Dumbledore, brutally retaliates against the Death Eaters; using the discovery of a Horcrux in the Lestrange vault as a pretext, they sent dozens of pureblood families to Azkaban and seized their fortunes, sharing the seized gold amongst the Ministry/Dumbledore's own followers to assure their loyalty.\\
 \\
Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were among those who were imprisoned and had everything taken, their claims of being controlled by the Imperius falling on deaf ears.\\
But before they were arrested, they were able to direct a house-elf to spirit their only child, Draco Malfoy, away to safety. Somewhere far away from Britain, far away from a school and government whose Headmaster and Minister hunger for gold. To the deepest depths of northern Europe, a little Hogsmeade-esque village in the shadow of Durmstrang Institute.\\
 \\
Now, at 11 years of age, Draco Malfoy is finally ready to enter Durmstrang Institute. But when a hulking man comes to deliver his letter of invitation, he lets slip his knowledge of just who the Malfoys are and why Draco is an orphan; a story of a dark lord called Voldemort, who used his parents like puppets, and a greedy man named Dumbledore who saw their lives as a stepping stone to riches.\\
Draco's shock at the terrible tale slowly turns to resentment and anger; though he attends Durmstrang, passing his first year with flying colors, his fury continues to grow. By the time his second year of schooling rolls around, the wizard-to-be has a mission; revenge.\\
Though no Slytherin in this timeline, he has ambition nonetheless, and his magic answers; building up a circle of friends and sycophants with his power and charisma, Draco slowly but surely begins to build an army, to gather intelligence on Britain, to one day slaughter Dumbledore and his associates, to avenge his parents and reclaim his birthright...


** could be interesting, but it would be important for Draco to learn that his parents were in fact no puppets, but actual cruel twisted people who was happy to see innocent people murdered and tortured because of their heritage.

Would make a great moral conflict. Was the ministry wrong to punish those who supported Voldemort and take money to repair society after the damages the death-eaters performed, as well as reparations to the families who had loved ones murdered, or was it going too far?

*** Mm...would Draco learn that, though? Given the Imperius is real and dangerous, along with who-knows-how-many-other brainwashing charms and potions, would he be more likely to believe that his birth parents were guilty perpetrators or innocent victims? Would it be possible to prove it either way?\\
 \\
On the seizure of wealth, on one hand the victims of the Death Eaters and Voldemort do deserve to be compensated, and that would add up to a lot of money indeed, but on the other hand many of these Death Eaters did have young children (implying either they weren't imperiused, or that Voldemort had a /really/ twisted mind) who don't deserve to be left with nothing, and total asset forfeiture/attainder is kind of a perverse incentive to ensure as many Death Eaters and "Death Eaters" are convicted and executed as possible.

*** This! Would be a good smackdown fic too tbh. Draco is all ready to murder the fuck out of everybody, only to be slapped down like the widdle terrorist he is, only realising once he is in azkaban that perhaps the death of the malfoy family is the only good he will ever do.

** What happens to Barty Crouch Jr?

IMO, he's a far far better candidate in taking this role. Even if Draco Malfoy is out for revenge, it would take him at least two or three decades to build up enough strength. Unless this Draco grows up under significant hardship and becomes totally different than in canon, he will not be going very far. Ambition without courage and hard work is nothing but a pipe dream.

*** Full disclosure, I wrote this on the fly after seeing you paste your 'Dumbledore and Longbottom seize DE assets' thing again.\\

Yeah, I suppose that unless Draco managed to pull a Tom Riddle (orphaned as a baby, no starting funds, still managed to become a dark lord), it'd take a long time for him to grow strong enough and gather enough minions to attack Britain. I'm not even sure how he'd convince others to help in avenging him, actually...

**** Dumbledore taking tough actions against Death Eaters would certainly prompt some of them to seek out Voldemort, and Snape could in fact lead them.

Once Voldemort is found and secured in a weak homunculus body, Snape will poison every Death Eater under him and stun the weak Voldemort behind his back.

Then Dumbledore will ruthlessly interrogate Voldemort about his every secret, obliviate him back to his infancy, petrify him, and lock him away behind ward stronger than Nurmengard. Snape will go on to earn Merlin Order of the First Class.

As for Death Eater descendants and relatives trying to take revenge, it's going to happen too after canon. Or are you of the opinion that sadistic genocidal mass murderers should not be punished because you fear revenge from their relatives?
