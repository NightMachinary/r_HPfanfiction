I'm looking for a fic, preferably not slash, where Harry is the one who does something cheats or lies in his relationship without feeling overly dramatic cliche guilt over it. Not necessarily remorseless, but he's not going to be tearfully confessing his misdeeds. I don't really nice mind the topic of the whole fic (except that I would like it to be long) and preferably one where while the romance is semi important, it's not the focus. Neglected Harry/WBWL Harry's are quite nice but not necessary. Apologies if this is ridiculously specific.


** linkffn(The Greengrass Contract by ncronan) should have what you're looking for and linkffn(The Reluctant Champion) should be worth reading as well even if the cheating is not a big part of it. Most other guiltless cheating fics are short and smutty so I'll be interested in what the community turn up. RemindMe! 7 days

*** Yeah I've noticed they end up being short and smutty too, which is not what I want (well, I don't really care if smut scenes are in it, just not the focus) and the two fics you suggested seem promising, will read now, thanks!
