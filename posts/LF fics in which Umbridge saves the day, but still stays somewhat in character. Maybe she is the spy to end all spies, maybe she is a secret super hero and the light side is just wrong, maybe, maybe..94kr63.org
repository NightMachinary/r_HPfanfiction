#+TITLE: LF fics in which Umbridge saves the day, but still stays somewhat in character. Maybe she is the spy to end all spies, maybe she is a secret super hero and the light side is just wrong, maybe, maybe.

Yeah, I know: She was created to be hated.

The worst of the worst. The terror toad.

What a challenge to make her likeable! Is there anyone who managed it?

** I believe someone (Starfox?) wrote a ficlet based on a prompt with the premise of an alternate-universe Umbridge who's a nonhuman-rights activist being transported to the normal universe in Fifth Year, confronting her "evil self". Look for "Umbridge activist" in this very sub's search bar and you ought to find it. It's only a prologue, however; the story hasn't been continued further.
