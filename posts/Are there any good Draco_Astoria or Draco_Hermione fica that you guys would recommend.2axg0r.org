** I highly recommend Isolation by bex-chan. I loved the character development, I got attached to characters that were rather minor in canon, and there were some seriously heart wrenching bits. It was finally completed I think a few months ago and there may be an epilogue in the works if it hasn't been posted yet.

Edit: Draco and Hermione.
