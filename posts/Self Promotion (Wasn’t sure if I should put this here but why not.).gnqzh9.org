Here's the description: Falling through the veil in the Death Chamber? No big deal. Getting home? Just as simple, though it may take a little longer. But just because you've gotten a little older and a little more powerful in your time away doesn't make your problems back home any less cataclysmic. Especially for people like Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. Dimension Travel AU, No Horcruxes, Fluffy HHr.

Here's the link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13551033/1/The-World-Beyond-the-Veil][The World Beyond the Veil]]

This is more or less a Marauders era dimension travel story. Check it out (maybe).


** Already following, it's a very nice story.

I like how you lampshaded the 'misunderstanding that could be fixed with a 2 minute conversation' cliche.
