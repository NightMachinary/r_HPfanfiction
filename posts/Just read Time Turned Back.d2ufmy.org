I just finished linkffn(Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil) and I really loved her writing style and the whole story. Can anybody suggest some fics with a similar writing style and themes?

*** The fanbase is ravenous. It will not, indeed /can not/ stop until the ultimate degeneracy - AD/Fem!HP. When this point is reached, when that story is written unironically, this entire community will collapse in on itself and die in a brilliant flare of infinite yikes.

**** Lol, there's way worse stories already. The point is that the writing made it enjoyable. I've never read something so captivating. I want to read more fics with such a writing style.

#+begin_quote
  Broken & angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with very familiar faces. Will the time spent with lost loved ones help heal Harry or only damage him further? HP/SB with a touch of HG/RL to relieve the overbearing angst.
