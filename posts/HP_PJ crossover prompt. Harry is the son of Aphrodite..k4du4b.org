Aphrodite created an avatar to explore Great Britain, which had fallen from the gods' notice as America took its place as the center of the West. Hectate, discovering her avatar in England, decides to give her mortal magic so that she can see the Wizarding World. The avatar's name was Lily, born to a family called Evans. Lily goes to Hogwarts to learn magic, meets, feuds with, and eventually falls in love with an annoying but nice James Potter. They marry, bear a child, and are killed by Voldemort, a creature utterly devoid of love.

Cut to 1993. When Harry slays the basilisk, Aphrodite's Lily memories are forced to the forefront. She quickly contacts Chiron, giving Grover the quest of bringing him all the way across the ocean to Camp Half-Blood.


** Not Aphrodite, but linkffn(13274956), Harry Potter, Squatter is a great hp/pj that updated 2 weeks ago

** linkffn(Home Is Where the Hearth Is by EmeraldShadowz101) is pretty similar to this, but with Lily as Hestia instead of Aphrodite. Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated in two years.

There's also linkffn(Carpe Diem by seagate), which has Aphrodite adopting Harry.

  Voldemort didn't know the powers he was messing with the night he attacked the Potters. Lily Potter was much more than she seemed. Freed of her temporary mortal body, she left behind a child with a very uncertain destiny. Taken to Camp Half Blood to be raised, he spent most of his childhood in New York. That was until circumstance drove him back to the country of his birth.

  A person's destiny is never set in stone, Harry now knows that better than anyone. After all, his destiny has been completely turned on its head by the actions of both his mother and a capricious goddess. Whether this is for good or bad is yet to be seen, either way Harry's life has been set on a new course, and he for one could not be happier about it.
