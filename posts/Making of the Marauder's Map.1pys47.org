Are there any well done fics about the marauder's decision to make the map and then the pains they went through to figure out how to make it? I've been looking high and low but have never come across a fic about the map.


** Have you tried just looking through multi-chapter Marauder fics? There might be a chapter devoted to it, even if it's not mentioned in the description/part of the plot.

** In canon it's said that the map was done using the homoncolous charm

*** Yeah I did think about that and decided to post here to see if anyone knew about a particular fic. Maybe I should just write my own

** The 4 boys took but a piece of parchment and drew blood. They lay their crimson heat on the parchment. /All 4 boys point their wands at the script soaked in blood, and cast a sickly blue glow over it/

Boom. Marauders Map. Their collected memory of every passage and staircase they had come across. In real time, on this piece of paper.

*** Haha that's pretty good. Now I'd like something like that in a slightly longer multi chaptered version. Get to it!

**** I am far too busy defending the Northern Realms from far greater powers than Voldemort, and cannot be bothered with the requests of children. Please send all script requests to my secretary's office; 1444 GrandKettle Ln, N. Helmshire U.K

Thank you for your esteemed cooperation.
