** I believe he needed to take a step back. He is obviously working on understanding the wand connection since he abducts Ollivander. He is also focusing on eliminating the strong competition. He kills Emmelin Vance, Amelia Bones and Dumbledore. He also blows up a bridge in order to get Fudge to resign and probably is also assassinating other people from the Ministry who could prove problematic for him. I think he would have definitely tried to kill Harry if they ran into each other. Not even torture him. Just be rid of him. But I think Dumbledore is the priority since he could be a real threat to any of his plans.

** Yes and no. Yes, he was always interested in killing Harry and given the chance he would've taken it. No, he was more focused on getting rid of the people who could best protect Harry and/or the Ministry.

Draco's assignment /was/ Lucius' punishment for his failure in the DoM. If I'm remembering The Prince's Tale correctly, his goal was to get Draco killed and have Snape finish Dumbledore.

*** Yes - Voldemort fully expected Draco to fail, however he had no expectations about Snape succeeding. This came out of the vow between Narcissa, Bellatrix and Snape - which itself was against Dark Lord's orders. Bellatrix was quite upset that Narcissa went to Snape for help.

At that point Severus already knew Dumbledore was going to die anyway, and he seized the chance. Chance that would make him Voldemort's most trusted.

I am absolutely certain had Dumbledore not been cursed, Snape would not have agreed to that part of the vow. It would have been easy - he is nowhere powerful nor skilled enough to just throw his life away. Even Bella would have to concede that.

**** It was Snape's belief Voldemort intended for him to be the successor. This seems to happen before the vowm

#+begin_quote
  ‘In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,' said Dumbledore. ‘Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?'

  There was a short pause.

  ‘That, I think, is the Dark Lord's plan.'

***** That might have been further down the line. Not even Voldemort can reasonably expect Snape to succeed where he himself has failed. It is possible that he may concoct a plan to take out Dumbledore at some point. But not "Kill Dumbledore, don't care how. Oh and if you don't, I'll crucio your ass off. dismissed"

Also note that conversation is purely a speculation on their part at this point.

**** Are you kidding? Bellatrix would spill the beans to Volde before he even needed to ask. From that moment, Volde knew that Dumbles would die.

**** At the beginning ob HBP when Narcissa asks Snape to help Draco he implies that Voldemort already ordered him to kill Dumbledore if Draco fails if I remember correctly

**** In the "Spinner's End" chapter of HBP, Snape explains to Bellatrix and Narcissa that he believes that, after Draco faillure and probable death, Voldemort would probably give him the same mission.

Voldemort never planned for Snape to kill Dumbledore at the top of that tower, just like he never planned for Draco to "succeed". The way he planned it, Draco would have died at the end of his 6th year after failling his mission (and as a punishment for Lucius' faillures), and Snape would have been tasked to murder Dumbledore during Harry 7th year, since he was the one in the best position to do so (and needed to prove his loyalty).

The whole events of the "Lightningstruck Tower" chapter probably went beyond Voldemort expectations, and advanced most of his plans by months.
