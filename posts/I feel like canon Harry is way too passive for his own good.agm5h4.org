After reading quite a few fanfics where Harry takes his life by the horns, so to speak, I feel like my opinion of the canon version really aint as high as before. Now, this isnt to say I think his canon depiction is bad, thats not my point. But I do prefer the more active and competent depiction he gets in fanfic. Canon Harry just seems to go along with anything that happens to him, never really question the hows and whys, he never puts all that much effort into school either (which given the danger he lives in, and the fact he is a de facto Muggleborn I find it really dumb). In most cases he comes out alive due to conjecture or the involvement of those around him. The competent Harry from fanfic sure can be OP, or way too mature for his age, but its just so much more satisfying to see him grow and really be in control of himself than to just see him react to his own life, so to speak.

Anyone else feels the same?


** I'd say what I was once told in a similar thread.

JK Rowling kept juggling between making Harry "the chosen one" and "a common man". She also had a habit of pushing the plot forward instead of what the characters are likely to do.

Think about this. Harry took it upon himself to learn the Patronus charm just because Dementors where being a nuisance to his games [Probably an exaggeration]. The same Harry would be chilling out in later books especially when a Dark Lord was after him.\\
The first case was the chosen one determined and active about his goal. The other case is a common man baffled and helpless because he never deserved it nor knows how to do it.

This switch keeps happening in the series often. Especially the end, where Harry entirely wins by luck [common man] but makes a point to give a big monologue about how the villain had been wrong all along [chosen hero].

So, we can say as the series progressed Harry started to "react" often instead of "act" ing. Generally, it should be reversed, Where the reactor gets more fed up and starts to act instead of waiting.

*** That's a good point Harry is both the chosen one and the Everyman. That said, I don't love most of the DH plot, but I don't think Harry is inconsistent between the patronus stuff and the horcrux hunt.

There's a huge difference between going to a trusted adult figure and developing a skill/solution to a problem versus being thrust into an open-ended, frustrating, and extremely dangerous set of tasks. Just because Harry took charge and found a good solution one time doesn't mean it's inconsistent he didn't another time in different circumstances.

** I'm sure people feel the same as you or else there wouldn't be OP!Harry Independent!Harry stories out there. And obviously, if you enjoy reading about that type of character the most, that's a valid opinion.

Personally, I like flawed characters. Harry Potter is a coming of age story where the characters learn and grow into adults. They're human, and for most of the story, they're kids. They make mistakes. When I first read DH I was really frustrated with Harry, Hermione, and Ron for aimlessly moping around in a tent for chapters. Now, ...several... years on from the DH release, I /get/ it. Sometimes your brain kinda shuts down when you're facing down a huge task and you don't know where to start, and you're reasonably frustrated with the task in the first place (not to mention the fact that they're grieving for several different characters at this point). It's a realistic reaction to a crappy situation.

How many of the fanfic writers who write about Harry jogging around the lake, getting swole, and learning deep magic of amazing skill and complexity, are actually super fit and delving into the deepest reaches of muggle science? Not many, I'd imagine. That's because we're all flawed people. Flawed people are relatable and interesting to read about because you see them overcoming similar struggles to you. On the flip side, some people find it really gratifying to read about characters who flawlessly do everything--it's wish fulfillment.

*** This. So much! I've always loved the books, even if some of the characters were dumb or annoying. Because everyone is so human and imperfect, making dumb decisions or just not making any and running away from the actual problem. It's all part of growing up, and why these books are so well loved and talked about even now, over 20years after their original release. All of Rowling's characters are flawed and a bits of good and bad inside them, which contrasts so well with Voldemort as a villain because he embodies the extremes of antisocial personality disorder. So someone with a mental health problem who cannot feel how other people feel is a perfect villian.

**** Voldemort reminds me more of Ridley Scott's aliens

" You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you? Perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility [...] I admire its purity. A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality."

In any well written fanfic, where the heroes interact with Riddle, he tends to provide the most useful, coldest, practical and unsentimental advice. Not even tainted by Snape's bitterness.

**** “How many fanfic writers live in a world where the government is corrupt and police are at best incompetent?” ?????? America's government is entirely corrupted out for money and hatred, and the govt has been shut down for 3 weeks now. We also have an extremely violent police force and a mass shooting every three days (on average - lots of psychopaths). Not to mention the many, many developing countries who are in much worse situations. I think for so many fanfic writers the Potter verse's reality is very similar to our own.

No one with any authority or power in the HP universe was even remotely competent on either side of the war.

*** That's a really good point about the tent. It always seemed like they were just stalling - I haven't thought about it in a while, but now that you mention it, I know /exactly/ that feeling after having been through grad school. There's a huge task hanging over your head that's amorphous and terrifying and you don't know what you're doing and you don't feel like you're qualified and have no idea where to even start and there'a a constant paralyzing sense of doom hanging over you all the time. So you do stalk some. You do things that are maybe tangentially related so you feel like you're doing something, but you're not really tackling the main problem.

I guess grad school was rough for me...

But thank you for that new perspective on that section of the story.

-Accidentally comes across the Mirror of Erised

-Accidentally comes across Voldemort in the woods

I mean, I've used the "There's just some things you can't go through and not end up as friends" (paraphrasing) line from the end of the troll chapter in fan fic to parallel a non canon friendship with the friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but it's kind of a terrible way to start a friendship. If she was going to force it anyway, why not just force it from the start when they met on the train.

*** Another commenter noted the difference between "acting" and "reacting", and how character growth can be shown by moving from reacting to stimulus, to acting with agency. Ideally, eleven year old Harry reacts to most things and would come across information and bad guys mostly by luck. As he grows, he would begin taking more initiative.

What we see instead is everyone else taking initiative and Harry usually remaining reactive, or having his attempts at acting with agency curtailed. Hermione has the idea to start the DA, and by the time Harry is really into it, Umbridge discovers them. Harry is suspicious of Draco in HBP, but is discouraged from investigating and all but told to be a good boy and not worry by Dumbledore

** But why WOULD he question anything and not be passive?

He was raised in an environment that discouraged such behavior, vocally and even violently at times. I mean, if you were raised by the Dursleys and treated the way he was, would you take life by the horns? No. You have been conditioned to be passive, to let others make the choices for you, and not to rock the boat.

In fact if anything, canon Harry is less passive than I would expect from a child raised the way he was, and likely that has to do with "magic" giving him a way to distinguish himself from the Dursley's and "separate" himself from who he was, opening up new possibilities.

I enjoy fanfics where he is more take charge, or at least, much less passive and not like canon, so I agree that canon Harry being more passive is less interesting. But to a large degree, that's what makes fan fiction great. Exploring BEYOND the bounds of canon. But that does not change the reality of Harry in canon and the mental and emotional aspects of his childhood and who he came to be because of it.

The over-competence and over-maturity problems are very real though, and something that generally turns me off a fic.

** Well the message of the books seems to be "If you have sufficiently efficient allies, you can basically be useless and still win". To me the books showcase that you can be a hero without being extraordinary and so everyone can. A nice message but highly unrealistic.

We often see in fics that Ron wants to get out of his brothers' shadow all the while being lazy. But we forget that Harry really wants to beat Voldemort since the end of 5th year without putting anymore effort that before. In fact his most effortful year was maybe the third when learning the Patronus. One could thing that after losing Sirius and learning the prophecy he would be more motivated to learn the most he could and improve but the sad truth is that he didn't even prepare to go on the Horcrux Hunt even after Dumbledore's death. The 7th book should really have been called "Hermione Granger and the two (mostly) useless boys".

Sure he has courage and can basically get some magical survival instinct out of his butt when he really needs it but he's at most average. Lot of fics tell how Harry is humble and says he had help and luck and his friends all say "No you have strength and courage and you're still amazing" but in reality, he has luck and people helping him (if not doing things for him) all the way. Maybe too much. It's nice to read at first or when young but with hindsight it's a bit miserable to see such lack of motivation and will in face of such destiny.

Again the message was more likely to show that everyone can be a hero, that love prevails and that you can't do squat without friends and family. Nice message and not fundamentally wrong. But in the real world Harry would most likely be eaten by the hard truth that is if you don't give yourself the means to success, don't complain when life give you radioactive lemons.

*** Plus, the fact that Harry is rather lazy when it comes to his magical studies (I mean he basically doesn't give a shit.) isn't helped by the fact that he's in a school that....really doesn't seem to care about educating.

The Defense curse notwithstanding...Dumbledore hires Lockhart, an act which cheats his students out of an entire year of education, all to expose him as a fraud? Like really Albus? You couldn't think of ANY other way to achieve that without sacrificing the time of the children under your care?

Then you have Snape. A man who is, on one hand, probably the very best at what he does. Then on the other...he's a deeply bitter man who utterly despises teaching. How many would be potioneers do you think Snape just crushed all interest out of?

It's always weird to crack open Philosopher's stone and see Harry not only willingly opening his magical texts, but god damn EAGER to do so.

I'd rather the Books excise fucking Quidditch entirely and instead show Harry learning and exploring magic on his own. We are told over and over that Harry is REALLY good at defense against the Dark arts, that it's the one subject he really likes, but we are shown.....nothing? At best Harry comes across as knowing the same three spells he uses ad nauseum. Stupify, Expecto Patronum, and of course Expelliarmus.

Of course, when he learns an actual effective curse, Sectumsempra, he never bothers to use it again. Because /GASP!/ the last thing we would want in a FUCKING WAR, is for our dear Hero to /whimper/ Hurt someone.

But in the end, it all comes down to how Rowling thinks. We don't see Harry try to absorb as much magic as he can, become as good as he can, simply because she didn't feel it was important.

It's funny that canon characters keep yapping about how Divination is wonky all the time, but the ridiculous not-martyr walk is enabled because of a line from a prophecy. That same prophecy also says that the child will marked as an equal to the Dark Lord - so, making Harry (or Neville, in those fics) OP for their age isn't so bad, as long as the author remembers the gap in experience between the chosen child and Voldemort.

In the first 4 books he barely shows any personality except for generic hero traits like being "brave" and "kind". I think that he started having more definite traits in the last 3 books though.

*** One thing that he is shown to be is sarcastic. He makes a great many sarcastic smart-mouthed remarks in the books.

He has a general lack of trust in adults. The exceptions are Hagrid, who he doesn't treat as an adult, and Dumbledore, who Hagrid all but worships. He does go to McGonagall as a last resort, is dismissed, then gives up on them.

He adores flying. It's a major, definining part of his character.

If he's told he has to learn about something, he digs his heels in every time. If told he's not allowed to learn about something, he'll go to great lengths to find out.

He likes treacle tart, chocolate frogs, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms and Transfiguraton. He is indifferent to Astronomy and Herbology and strongly dislikes the rest. He doesn't like the Chudley Cannons but doesn't feel confident enough to support another team, in the face of Ron's obvious fantasism, or is much less interested in Quidditch than he is in a) beating Slytherin and b) getting to fly lots.

If he /wants/ to learn something, he works really hard and picks it up quickly. He hands his homework in on time and doesn't get into trouble for not doing it, but he puts it off fairly often, and he never tries to get into any 'extra credit' work or club. When he learns, it's for a definite, limited purpose, not because he's trying to please authority figures. Intelligent and not really lazy, but not exactly enthused by the idea of academic achievement.

He's very vulnerable to parental figures. Moody says once that he'd make a good auror and that idea gets a hold on him and is still there at the end of book five. Sirius offers him a home after breaking Ron's leg, and he jumps on the chance. Consistently, ideas of family have the strongest pull on him.

He also has a 'saving people thing' where he takes everything on himself and won't seek help and then acts impulsively, which leads to adventure but is less 'brave' and 'kind' than mildly pathological. There's no reason for him to decide he needs to save the Philosopher's Stone. Arguably, he made things worse. He just gets a bee in his bonnet that somehow it's all on him, and that same idea is consistent in all the books. Quite often, if he'd sought help, things would have worked out better all round.

What he /isn't/, is wildly enthusiastic about anything except Gryffindors winning, Slytherins and especially Malfoy losing and flying. I think that's what makes him bland. He has a definite personality, just not the personal drive or enthusiasm that make people engaging.

** I completely agree. I always *hated* how Harry never even questioned what happened to his parents. He never sought out information, never wondered. He never thought "wow, MAGIC" and then tried. I mean, even Hermione wondered why Harry hadn't opened a book.
