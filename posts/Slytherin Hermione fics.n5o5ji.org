Hermione is just SO ambitious in terms of academic success and proving herself to the Wizarding world even as a muggleborn... surely she's perfect Slytherin material?

The golden trio could be with her or not, I don't mind. Maybe Slytherin is less bigoted than we thought and it's unicorns and rainbows, or totally not and Hermione has to prove herself.. It doesn't matter to me, the important thing is that she's in Slytherin.

If it helps, I really enjoyed Hermione Granger Demonologist (and dermatologist). Thanks!

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Hermione Granger, Demonologist and Applied Cultural Anthropology are probably the best of the lot. I also think Hermione would be a great Slytherin, but a lot of Slytherin!Hermione fics fall into pitfalls, mostly the one of making the Slytherins and/or Hermione super OOC, or worse ones, outlined more coherently than I can articulate in [[https://hapennydreams.tumblr.com/post/164113270040/what-do-you-think-of-the-slytherinharry-and][this tumblr post]] about Slytherin!Harry and Hermione fics.

But on to the recs:

If you don't mind Mary-Sueish Hermione you can check out New Blood - linkffn(13051824) which is super long and still updating. Or, Dreams - linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24089296/chapters/57981166]]) which is Grindelwald/Hermione in which she time travels to the 19th century every night so they grow up together. Also incomplete but still active.

A bit less Mary-Sue is Champion - linkffn(11790377) but it is Tomione. Hermione is sent back in time to fix the time line by making sure Tom Riddle (who was not supposed to be a bad guy, but actually a Dumbledore-level force of good) never becomes Voldemort. I had to push through the first chapter because the greater Good v Evil fight was not very compelling, but the story gets better and by the time that plot comes back around you will have been sucked into the story.

Also Sweets and Studies linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21789295/chapters/51993529]]) which is a Supernatural crossover in which Hermione is a pagan devotee of Loki. I never finished the first of this series, but this one is alright. It makes for an interesting Hermione, though I did need to read a few Supernatural wiki pages for the Loki character to make sense.

For an all Slytherin Golden Trio you can see linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6975322/chapters/15897253]]) which features the greatly expanded (and brilliant) Professor Sinistra. It's Year One for the trio and is complete, though the second year only as 2 chapter and hasn't been updated since September.

Finally, Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance - linkffn(10991501) which does not technically have Slytherin!Hermione, as she is sorted into Gryffindor, but also is the most extreme Slytherin!Hermione as she is actually Salazar Slytherin reborn and she's on a mission to redeem her good name. This hasn't been updated in nearly a year, but it clocks in at nearly 300k and cuts off cleanly at the end of Year 4, so is well worth the read!

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  The war is much larger, far longer, and much deeper than they could have imagined: fought on a scale that baffles the limits of human understanding.

**** The post refers to New Blood as Mary Sue-ish, but I really don't see how, hermione does all her own saving. It's a good fic, but there's a few chapters on wizarding sex Ed that I personally found really funny and clever, but could be a turn off for others (You won't even see those till after ch 200 anyway). Theres also a lot of emphasis put on the menstrual cycle (e.g witches and wizards magical power scales exponentially after on set puberty/first cycle) but it's pretty well done (at least, to me, a gay man) and is pretty much just world building since the story IS from a female perspective.
