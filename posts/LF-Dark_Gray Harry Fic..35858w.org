Well, its that time again. I finished the Denarian Renegade series, and wish to continue that line of rational with a Dark or Gray Harry fic. I want him to kill if necessary, at least. Now I only have a few requirements, 1) Must be either complete or frequently Updated and 60k plus. 2) Must be Harry Potter centric. I dont want to read about his kids (I have fanfiction for that) I dont want to hear about how his brother/sister is the best thing ever to be invented, I want Harry Potter to kill people who need to die.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] WBwL, but not one of the terrible ones. It has some justifications for the WBwL tropes, and has very few other ones. Additionally it is the only attempt to necromancy fic I've ever liked. Bonus points for being a Hufflepuff Harry fic.

** Stronger Than Hope by Alaunatar is the only dark Harry fic I've read that didn't make me roll my eyes (I don't know why, but the genre tends to annoy me, though I want to like it). You'll want to have a stomach for Snape though.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7359933/1/Infliction][Infliction]] This one is a story about Harry raised by the Lestranges. He is pretty ruthless and very dark throughout.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2861773/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dying-Embers][Harry Potter and the Dying Embers]] Is one of my all time favourite stories. This is a crossover with Star Wars KotOR so be warned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To Fight the Coming Darkness]] is a stunning story, Harry is gray in this one.

These three are all complete. If you want I can do a bit of searching and try and find more.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]] is the best dark/grey Harry I've ever read. Possibly my favourite HP fanfiction ever. At least top 5. I also enjoyed the Denarian Renegade so perhaps we have similar tastes. There's also a re-written version currently in progress that fixes small errors and slightly changes the plot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5957714/1/The-Darkness-Within-The-Rewrite]]
