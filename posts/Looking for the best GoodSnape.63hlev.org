** The only decent one I can think of off the top of my head is linkffn(To Shape and Change by Blueowl). I don't remember it being great, but it certainly wasn't bad.

Also, I maintain, and always will, that it should have been named "To Snape and Change".

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

*** I really liked this one. Read it two or three times.

Too bad Snape got laid in the epilogue in this one. Not very many fics where he gets laid give the lucky lady screen time.

  Who would Severus become without his burden of self-loathing? And how will that Severus react when Ron Weasley's widow comes seeking healing of her own? DH compliant, save for Snape's survival. SS/LP followed by SS/HG M for later chapters.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. HP/HG, SS/OC, not HG/SS. Rating & Genres may change later.

** How do you define good? I find that fics that make him nice and where he doesn't have moments of being an asshole at least sometimes seem very out of character. Do fics where he is actively working for the good side but is not always nice count?
