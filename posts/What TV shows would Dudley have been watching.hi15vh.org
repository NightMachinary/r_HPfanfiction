As an american, I have basically no idea what kids would have been watching in the UK in the early 90s. There's a decent amount of crossover in online lists, but what exactly would be those shows he was so upset to be missing on their trip to Hut-On-The-Rock?


** I feel like Dudley would have enjoyed /Bodger and Badger/

Or maybe /Maid Marion and her Merry Men/

/Fun House/ on channel 3 was great. I loved that show.

He probably would have liked /Knightmare/ but Vernon / Petunia might not have liked it because there were fantasy creatures and such in it. Same with /Round the Twist/ (weird show)

Maybe Count Duckula?

*** As an obsessive fan back in the day of both Maid Marian and Bodger and Badger, I am /wounded/ that you think Dudley would have liked those!

I bet he liked Noel's House Party. And Get Your Own Back. Mainly because of the gunge tanks both of those shows had. He was probably into the Turtles as well, most boys that age were. Lots of our shows were American imports anyway, but in terms of the actual British ones, I reckon he would have liked Chucklevision, Super Ted, Danger Mouse and maybe Art Attack because of the mess (but he'd never have done any of the projects). I absolutely second Count Duckula, and he'd have liked Power Rangers when that came on the air.

He'd have been banned from watching the Tales of Narnia (which is a shame for him because those cheap budget BBC adaptations are arguably the best thing to have ever aired on TV /anywhere/) and the Riddler's, because they're both focused on "normal" people encountering a form of magic. Ditto Bernards Watch.

** Ha! In one of my vast horde of projects in the basic planning stage is a little ditty with the working title: Dudley Dursley Saves the World.

The gist of the story is that Lucius decides to deploy the diary during Harry's first year rather than his second and when he finds Harry and Draco talking while being fitted for their robes, and recognizes him, he presents the diary, properly spiffed up to Harry.

Being a polite kid, Harry thanks him and goes about his shopping trip with Hagrid.

Getting back to #4, Harry finds the diary when he's cleaning out his pockets and thinks "Do I look like a girl," and tosses it onto a convenient flat surface. At some point Dudley sneaks into Harry's room and after looking over everything, yoinks the diary.

So, Harry goes to school, and Dudley to the surgeon to have a little curly appendage removed, then on to Smeltings, where he learns he is not the Big Bad of Smelting like he'd been at Little Whinging Primary. After a beating or two, having all his snacks stolen, and maybe a swirly or two, Dudley starts spending all of his time not in class hiding out in his dorm, when he discovers a Fanzine belonging to one of his dormmates.

After having a read, Dudley decides to try out this 'fan fiction' thing himself. Searching for some paper, he finds the diary, that he had totally forgotten about and begins his Knight Rider epic.

Diary!Tom wakes to bad grammar, misspellings, an utter lack of a plot, and what passes for sex in the mind of a sheltered 11-year-old. He keeps trying to get a word in edgewise, but Dudley just keeps on going, occasionally fitting Tom's comment into part of his 'story'.

After 6 weeks or so, Diary!Tom can no longer take it, not for one more misspelled word, and in some manner I've yet to come up with, commits suicide, figuring that as much a death frightens him, it couldn't possibly be worse than what he's 'living' through.

But since Diary!Tom was the first Horcrux, his 'death' causes all of the linked baubles to 'move up' a place, resulting with the second Horcrux (cup!Tom?) suddenly finding himself in the diary and the final (Scar!Tom) being removed from Harry, who passes out in a hallway when it happens.

None Magical Ink doesn't get absorbed into the paper, so Dudley's dormmates all read the story, and since like most 11 year olds, all of their taste is in their mouths, keep telling him what a genius he is and encourage him to keep writing.

An A-team opus takes out the next resident of the Diary, followed by a SuperCar story, then another and another until the last of them die rather than read another word. In typical Fan Fiction fashion, the death of the last Horcrux kills all the Death Eaters via their Dark Marks and the title is fulfilled.

So Dudley saves the world and is unaware that he did so.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

** Everything that I can think of wouldn't have been showing new episodes during July (The Crystal Maze), had already finished its season by the time Harry got his letter (Masterchef finished in early July), or was already canceled by then (Doctor Who in 1989).

But I did find on Google that there was this one-off game show on Channel 4 called [[http://htw.hadlands.me.uk/programmes/qd-the-master-game/][QD-The Master Game]] that ran from the 29th of July to August 2nd in 1991 and they didn't reveal what QD stood for until the 5th episode. Dudley may have been mad that all of his friends got to watch the show and he missed out on seeing the show because of Harry?

I think that Dudley likely would have seen the adverts for it for a while leading up to it, and been able to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_in_British_television#July][watch the first episode on July 29th]] at the Railway Motel the way that the timelines line up. July 30th they were in the Hut-on-the-Rock and Harry gets rescued by Hagrid at midnight, so Dudley would have missed the second episode and made everyone miserable over it.

*** He was probably just pissed off that he couldn't sit in front of CBBC/CITV between 3-5:30 every night! I mean, he was only eleven, I doubt he gave two hoots about MasterChef. He could have been into EastEnders, there's always someone beating someone else up in that, and it airs all year round.

**** I agree a normal kid wouldn't have cared about Masterchef but I was thinking that if he was addicted to television then he'd eventually just start following everything that his parents would let him watch so that he wasn't stuck with reruns lol. EastEnders is a good one!

***** Good point, Dudley strikes me as the kind of kid who would watch anything (apart from maybe the news), but I also reckon he'd fidget and complain through something like MasterChef but probably would have been well up for London's Burning or similar ðŸ˜‚

** Neighbours! Everyone watched Neighbours, every weekday tea time.

Going Live on Saturday mornings. Casualty on Saturday evenings. Gladiators on Saturday afternoons.

Red Dwarf! I'm sure he wouldn't have wanted to miss that.
