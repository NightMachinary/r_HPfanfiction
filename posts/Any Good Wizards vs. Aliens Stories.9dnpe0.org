I'm too lazy to search for this right now, but tell me there's something like this. Aliens invade. "Oh haha. The Earthlings have baby technology. We will win so easy." And then wizards, pissed off from having to deal with the stench of burnt metal and decaying Muggle flesh, come out to play and drive them off with dazzling feats of Transfiguration and whatever other jiggerypokery they feel like using.

"Hang on. Muggles were silly little brutes but at least they had /some/ class." -An important wizard person

  This is it. No one listened to Shepard, and the Reapers invade Earth. But since this is an old World of Darkness crossover, invading Earth is a pretty dumb move.
