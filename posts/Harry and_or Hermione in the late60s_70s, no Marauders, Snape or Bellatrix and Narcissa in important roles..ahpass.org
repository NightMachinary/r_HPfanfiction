It feels like most "Harry travels to the past" stories (at least First War ones) can be summarised with:

- Harry joins the Marauders, lots of pranks and teenage drama, even if Harry is a war-hardened veteran who lived through decades of civil war.

- Harry hangs out with Snape, the Marauders are worse than Hitler

- Harry hangs out with the House of Black, they kick arse and chew bubblegum.

Hermione in the past usually fits one of those as well, just with more shipping.

But are there any stories where the time traveller ends up hanging out with Luna's mother, Lily, Andromeda Tonks, Slughorn or one of the other background characters?

No (future) death eaters, no m/m.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. A new perspective on the 1970s time travel genre. Some slash much later.

*** Let's put it that way, I feel absolutely no attraction towards men. I cannot comprehend why anyone would be attracted to a man if you could have a woman instead. Therefore, a gay man is not a character I can immerse myself into. So definitely a hard no.

Also, canon Harry has absolutely no gay tendencies, so making him gay is OOC by default.

** Hi there my story deals with what I think you're looking for. I warn you that I'm in need of a beta sometimes but I think the story is worth it (hopefully).
