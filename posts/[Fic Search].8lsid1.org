Harry uses a spell which allows him to travel back to a moment in the past and make one change. He uses it to make Lily not die to protect him, and swear to raise Harry to serve Voldemort instead. Harry wakes up in a life where he is best friends with Draco, has a sister, Snape is like a father to him.. He then realizes how bad everything is with no one to fight Voldemort, and uses the same spell, tricking the diary-version of Tom to fix the timeline.

Wow, what a stupid change to make if you could change anything. That's almost as bad as Picard in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38LevpSHj2Q][Star Trek: Generations]].

Sorry though, no idea what fic you are looking for.

*** It actually made a lot of sense. He was in a very bad place, full of self-pity, and in that moment he just wanted to have his mother back. The entire thing was orchestrated by Voldemort, who knew he would never be able to pass up saving his mother.

**** Why doesn't he just wish for their parents not changing secret keepers? Or anything else that would be more reasonable? Or even better if he can make one change, why not change the prophecy so that he doesn't have to be the BWL? ... and if it absolutely has to be a stupid change, why not just make Lily run away one night before Halloween? The whole "serve Voldemort" thing just sounds retarded... why would Voldemort ever accept such a deal?

***** It's not a wish. It is a spell that has to be cast together by two people involved in a moment of time. Voldemort convinces Harry to use the spell with him by saying that they can simply go back and look at what happened. Harry can see his parents again. If he doesn't want to change anything, he can simply walk away and the spell would dissipate and that would be that. But of course, once they get back there and he sees his mother pleading for her life, he can't do it. He prevents her from sacrificing herself so he can grow up with her.

At first, the new life is great. He has his mother (James had already been killed), Snape is his step-father and really loves him, he has a sister (half, with Snape and Lily), etc. But he and his family serve Voldemort, and with no "Boy Who Lived", the world is going to hell, which he just didn't think through in the heat of the moment.

So he tricks the diary into reverting it back to the original timeline, and then uses his knowledge from the alternate timeline to befriend Draco and Snape, and make changes for the better.
