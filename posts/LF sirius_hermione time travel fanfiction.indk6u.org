I've been looking for this story forever and it's been driving me mad. The basic summary is that throughout 5th year, Remus and sirius keep giving hermione these strange looks, and sirius is always really kind to her and he knows her pretty well. After sirius dies, the story continues into 6th year. Harry is better than hermione at potions because of the half blood prince's book, but at the slug club holiday party, slughorn suggests to hermione that she work with him and study the wolfsbane potion. Then, mcgonagall sends hermione back in time after the war ends and she falls in love with sirius, befriends James and Remus, and her and snape both apprentice under slughorn. I think she eventually saves sirius from dying and they have a happy ending. Does this sound familiar? It's not debt of time btw


** Ugh I've read so many time travel fic's that most of them just seem to merge together, but I don't think I've read that
