Any Fics out there with said setting? can be Voldemort won the War and Draco hides with Hermione, but i want no romance between them (atleast not for most of the Fic. It can happen at the end), but physical attraction or "they need to get around" with each other, because they are the only "free" People.


** linkffn(11076424) doesn't quite fit your request because Draco is decently in the Dark Lord's favor, but it is a post-dark-victory Draco/Hermione with zero romance.

  One-shot. After losing the war, being held prisoner by the Death Eaters, seeing her friends' lives ruined, and being sold to the highest bidder, Hermione finally embraces her Slytherin side and finds a way to take control of her life again.
