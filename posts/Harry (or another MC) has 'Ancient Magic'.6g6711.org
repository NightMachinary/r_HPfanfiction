Ancient Magic as in magic from Greece, Rome, Egypt, China, Japan etc. Maybe something like runic magic? Just any magic that isn't wand magic.

** This one's nice. I haven't read the sequel yet. A lot of magic, no wands.

**** That story and its sequel are great, but enembee never wrote the (clearly intended) concluding third story. It's a great shame.

Harry drops Divination with Hermione, and he takes Ancient Runes instead. Turns out he's... quite good at it.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
