Are there any H/Hr romance fics out there that have Ron abandoning the Horcrux hunt as the inception point for the romance?


** Yes.

I can't remember the name of the one I read though.

It got quite ugly though. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the abandonment as the inception with the abandonment as a */catalyst/* for the ugly trio breakup and the begun romance...

I kind of wish ffnet had a solid reading history page. I think I read it several years ago.

Thanks [[/u/adreamersmusing]]

I'm pretty sure Endgame is the one I was thinking of.

*** You know what, I think catalyst might be a better word for this, anyway. The idea is that Ron's abandonment makes Harry and Hermione get closer to one another, which ends up becoming a romance between the two.

**** Actually, the one I'm thinking of is something like Moldyshorts is defeated, somehow Ron turns cynical, the trio has a huge fight based on the months Ron isn't there, H/Hr stick together and fall in love. Not exactly what you said there either

*** The problem I have with this story is that the pair hooking up takes about 30 minutes. That's totally unrealistic. Remember how upset Hermione was - not just after Ron left but much later, after they'd finally Apparated to a new location.

There's a lot of mileage in this premise, but it needs to be a slow burn. Unfortunately you need to write something else while it's burning slowly. Or do what TheEndless7 did in Chapter 11 of linkffn(Vitam Paramus), where... well just read it. But basically it describes the process of H & Hr getting together in a few brief lines and is actually far more realistic than what happens in this story.
