As for what exactly happens to the recieving person, in canon that is unknown, but in the movies it doesnt show the soul escaping the body like with dementors, nor is there a mention of this in the books.

****** That's how Voldemort descibed the curse reflected back at him, at which point the properties of the spell could be different.

Alternatively, Voldemort was stuck in the mortal world because of the horcruxes, so the feeling of being ripped away from the body might just be what death feels like to those with horcruxes, unable to peacefully move forward and whatnot.

A third option is that Voldemort could have been an dramaqueen playing up the concept to grandiose himself.

** /Last week's events of a witch victim of the Killing Curse being revived by a muggle continues to raise uproar in Britain's magical community. As the Wizengamot continues to deliberate about the legal status and rights of the newly dubbed previously-deceased, an inquiry to the Department of Mysteries regarding the muggles' unhallowed powers reveals new information. CPR, now identified by the Department of Mysteries officials to mean "Cosmic Projection & Reanimation," was until recently a top-secret research subject pursued only by the most arcane minds of the prominent department. Now, officials admit to growing talk within the highest levels of the department to declassify and disseminate all research into CPR, in the interest of allowing independent researchers to help push the field forward and catch up to the muggles. Concerns are being aired by a small, stiff-necked, unpatriotic group, stating the reaserch matter to be "profane," and, "An immediate risk to the security of our plane of existence from ruinous, unfathomable existences." To that, this reporter has to say: That the muggles can do it while the wizarding community can't is already more risk than any right mind should willingly bear. More inside:/

**** I'm really sorry, there's no way I'll remember it! Maybe someone else has read it though? Spoilers include:

Harry bought his own house with the goblins helping him trick his bank account.

During the summer holidays, idk what year, he decided that for some reason, he can't go to Hogwarts. So he runs away to live in said house and works in a nearby village in a restaurant for some old people. He gives himself a fake name and lives with Dobby, I believe.

Harry's friends sneak out during the Hogsmead weekend and take the Knightbus to visit him. Lucius Malfoy follows them

Harry had been teaching himself everything during all this and, believe it or not, he learns so much more than he ever did at Hogwarts! He's been somehow contacting his teachers whenever he had questions.

Hermione's parents, Nevilles gran, Professor McGonagall and the other guardians of Harry's friends are super unimpressed by how few courses Hogwarts offers, how hard they all suck and how stupid Dumbles is, so they decide to found their own school.

I'll add everything else I remember!

** Forgot where I read this...But in one fanfic the KC works by acting as if you got hit by a lighting bolt direclty. IT Kinda disrupts all electricity from moving in a human body IE:the nerves/brain. So anything that prevents electricity from moving through it would protect you from the KC. That why most armour does not protect you. Metal, dragon scale, Basilisk scale. they all conduct electricity. Thats why You can block the KC with random objects providing you are not touching them. But anyways. A muggle healed people via Defibrillators. And thus magicals created a spell that acted like one. Apparently magic and electricity have a Acid/Base relationship therefor no one ever thought to use electricity to jump start a human body.

****** ... Well that's a pretty easy job when no-one trying to catch spies in the PM's offfice have wands or even the knowledge that magic exists. Infiltration becomes a lot easier whenb you have a memory erasing, mind controlling tool and no one even has a reason to speculate on it being in your possession

** I know I've seen this before. It was in a true Izard fic where there were more people around and while others took care of pettigrew, Harry gave Cedric CPR. Cedric became the new boy who lived and Harry became the boy who saved.

** I like this idea! iirc you can experience medical death (aka breathing and heart stop) and come back from it so it's certainly possible that the killing curse causes that and magic folk simply don't have the technology/knowhow to help with that.

Obviously there would still be the complications that a heart attack or similar causes, but well, you're not dead anymore!

It happens in Part 4 of the series, /Potter Haven/, but it's ambiguous as to whether or not he survived due to the horcrux or the CPR

** Pretty sure I read something similar somewhere. The protagonist, I think was a girl, managed to use CPR to revive people and wizards acused her of necromancy or something of the sort. Can't remember the name though

** Or, to go even further, the only reason they never realized that it was possible for those people to be revived was because (for however long a period you want it to be) after getting hit with the curse, any other magic cast on the person will not work.

** I've wondered this ever since I got certified in CPR. If Avada Kedavra stops the heart and not the brain, could you apply standard treatment for cardiac arrest/heart attacks and have a chance at saving the victim? Could they be saved more than once? If we go by the heart attack model-AK then probably, my grandma survived three.

I have a hard time believing that wizards have no knowledge of CPR, though. Muggleborns would have brought it in to magical society.
