We've all read the fics that are from someone major's POV, but have you read any fics that were from the POV of someone not usually in the limelight? Say, just as an example, a story about or from Hagrid's POV? Or Filch. Or Mad-Eye Moody, etc etc etc. Not a story that stars an OC, but an already established character from canon who doesn't often get more than a side role.

Is there a character you'd love to see as the main but never have? Who is it? Also, if you've come across any of these type of fics before, do share! I've been trying to find these sorts of fics, but it can be a bit of a needle in a haystack sort of situation when you aren't even sure who you're looking for as far as POV or main characters.

#+begin_quote
  In sixth year, Harry Potter falls victim to a masterful and evil plan from Voldemort. Now, 5 years later and with the world firmly under the grasp of Voldemort, Hedwig has a boring job at Amazon. When on a hectic Prime Day, the delivery center is attacked, effectively canceling Two-Day Shipping, Hedwig has to run for her life. What she doesn't expect is being caught by a magic explosion that turns her into an Aniowl. When a sudden turn of events sends her back in time, she would have a chance to fix everything that was broken. Can she learn how to speak English in time to save the world? Canon compliant until sixth year.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.
