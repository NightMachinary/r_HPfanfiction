** Ha! First comment so I can say linkffn(Grow Young With Me) before anyone else does. [[/u/Taliesin19]] can probably confirm that this is still 'In Progress' even if the last update was a while ago.

*** I can confirm, yes! Not sure exactly when the next chapter will be done, but I'm definitely working on it. It's just been a bit of a rough year for me so far.

**** Sorry to hear that. Obviously focus on your real life problems rather than fanfiction. Good luck.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Linkffn(209566)

A sort of coming of age story with harry/muggle girl.

Don't remember much, been some time since I've read it. But I definitely have spent days hooked on this 600k monster.

** This is one I wrote a bit back. Sirius/OC. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10841322/1/Dark-Birthright]] It's flawed and in the queue for a complete rewrite (real life allowing), but I don't think it's too bad. It's complete and fairly short.
