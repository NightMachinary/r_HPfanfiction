:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
i remember this one fic i read forever ago it was a Harry stays at Hermiones house fic but she has this little sister who was absolutely adorable. the only other details i can remember is that Harry and Hermione started dating. they had a pool(swimming) room. the little sister was rather smart. and it was a relatively short story, less that 20 chapters if i remember right

any help would be greatly appreciated


** I know I've read a fix where a little girl was knocked into a pool at a family BBQ by a drunk Ron. Wasn't a sister though, was a neibours kid. Starts HG/rw and ends up hp/hg after they take the kid to the zoo. Might it be this one?

  Hermione is home for an Easter barbecue that her parents are hosting. She's brought her boyfriend and is thoroughly regretting that decision. She calls a dear friend to help with the damage control.
