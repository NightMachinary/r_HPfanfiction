They're my two favorite series and I'm tired of finding really good ones that have been abandoned or just plain bad ones, what are your favorites.


** Prepare for a lot of slash in the interim, if you're searching for straight pairings.

I.E: Harry x Annabeth.

** Linkao3(Lokison) also has Marvel and is quite explicit, but I really liked the story. Censored version at Linkffn(Lokison)

**** The story is basically just Harry f*cking around a lot, and the fact that its yaoifangirl-slash and not real gay content speaks for itself. The story lacks anything besides the usual tropes and does not stand out at all. Its rather boring if one ignores the sex.

**** Not at all. Doesn't do anything plot wise, just something he is required to do in becoming a god

  James and Lily Potter had a secret, one which led to Thanatos saving young Harry from a dreary life with the Dursleys and changed the face of the Second British Wizarding War before it ever began. Censored version at FF.net, uncensored (adult) content begins after chapter 10.
