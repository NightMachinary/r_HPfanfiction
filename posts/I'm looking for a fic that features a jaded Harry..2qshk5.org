I forgot where I read it but what I remember was at the start of thr fic was Potter was in a bar and he was looking for a fight. He had the hardboilled detective vibe and IIRC he killed someone usig a barrier spell whererin he tightened it was untill it crushed the perp. The fic was a murder mystery one i think. He was also iffy about working with Hermione.

One defining trait from the fic was that Potter controlled AK green fire and he uses it to light up cigarettes.

I've tried searching for it in FF.net and HPFF but it turned up empty. Help?


** I'm positive that you're looking for /Anguis: The Snake Within/ by Pseud0 Nymph.

Unfortunately, the fic has since been taken down as the author wasn't happy with a few things, but that was three years ago. You can find the author's FF.Net page [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1218259/Pseud0-Nymph][here]].

If you're feeling particularly nostalgic (or just masochistic) you can read the [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/pseudo_nymph/ATSW.html][first two chapters]] here on Schnoogle.

Hope it comes back one day, to be honest. I rather liked it to, back then.

*** Aww man! And here I thought that it'll be finished by this time. That was the first Dark!Potter fiction that I've read.

Thanks!
