What are some of your favorite fics that deserve a little bit of attention?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in Family: The Snape Chronicles]].

This is a massive story, detailing the life of Severus Snape. It starts when his parents move into Spinner's End (his mom is pregnant), and ends with his death. It is religiously book-compliant, everyone is ridiculously in character, and the rendition of Snape is surprisingly rich and believable. I found someone recommending it on Reddit once, and was shocked to find that this was not considered the #1 Snape story of all times.

Also, it has under 100 reviews, which just boggles the mind.

*** Did the author post it all at once? Sometimes that seems to cut back on review amount.

**** I think he did, it's a post of a story he wrote on another site (which doesn't exist anymore). But seriously, that shouldn't matter in this case. Anyone who wants a solid explanation of how Snape's life might have looked should read it, because bar none, this is the best one out of all those stories.

** All fic are under-reviewed. I think the ratio is something like 50 readers to one review for most of my stories. Reviews are also not the best way to tell a story is good, as they could all be flames, and reading them to tell may hit you with spoilers.

I try desperately to force myself to review each chapter, but not if the chapter was blah. I just appreciate what reviews I do get, I wish for more, but I prefer quality over quantity...

Who am I kidding, I'm totally a review whore, but I don't BEG or anything.

*** There is a person who reviews after every chapter of my stories and all they say, every time, is "Love it. Update soon." Every time. At this point, I wish they would just stop. I get so excited to see there is another review then it's just the repeat of the same.

**** I dunno, I'd be happy that somebody is inflating my review count, since a lot of readers look for number of reviews and never bother to see what the reviews say. At least they aren't saying, "dis fic sux ballz lol," which is how I used to type when I was 12.

***** Generally reviews that start with:

This is why your fic sucks...\\
You misspelt this and that in page x line y...\\
I think your characters are not acting in character because... There is a continuity error... I liked it but...

***** I want reviews to discuss what's actually going on in the chapter, whether plot or stylistically. Something to show that the person is reading and actually enjoying and digesting the story.

Indifferent on if spelling/continuity errors are PM'd or reviewed. I'll usually take care of it either way.

Indifferent on 'cool story bro' or 'update soon' I put about as much thought into those as the people leaving them did.

Hate when fanon or other's works are implied. If I I don't refer to Gabrielle as 'Gabbi' a single time in 160,000 words, stop calling her that in reviews.

Also hate questions. Not because of being questioned, but that I put at the end of every chapter that I'll answer questions that aren't spoilers, or pretty much anything on a completed story, as long as it's PM'd to me. So doing it in a review and expecting a response is just showing me they didn't bother to read the one sentence author's note at the end.

*** I never got the point of people reviewing each chapter separately. They aren't representative of entire story - which is really what people reading reviews are looking for, and they raise red flags that the review count was artificially inflated for readers like me.

Particularly annoying on less well read, long stories where the entire first page of reviews is the last person who read it reviewing each chapter - and they often put minor spoilers in those reviews.

**** As a writer, I appreciate the reviews after each chapter. Some of those chapters took me hours to write, and I'm proud of them. It's just nice for me to see that my hard work was appreciated. Even if it is short, and just saying they liked it. It really does mean something to me. I understand why spoilers are often looked down upon in a review, but they let me know what specifically was liked. And knowing what my readers liked/disliked is very helpful.

I think sometimes it is easy to forget that the people who are writing fanfiction are all just aspiring writers that need encouragement. It took me a year of writing my fan-fic before I got up enough nerve to start posting. I posted my ch17 yesterday, and have 80 reviews. A lot of them are from people that regularly read my work, but it is encouraging for me who was nervous to start. Anyways, to summarize I feel that the people who review each chapter separately like that know this, and they don't really review for other readers, they review for the author. Most of the people that review, you will notice, write it out like they are speaking to the writer.

**** It's nice to be able to review more than once when you're following a fic. I don't review every chapter, but if I'm reading a fic, I might post a comment about how I really like the way they wrote Harry's reaction to this issue, and then a few chapters later I'll write about how hilarious something was.

***** I wish fanfiction.net and other hosting sites would start giving an option of different types of reviews for when you wish to give feedback to an author without spamming their mailbox vs providing a traditional review to be used by other potential readers checking out the story. Or just automatically create a forum thread for each story where the feedback can be posted.
