#+TITLE: I started a fanfic a few years ago. Found this sub and thought I'd see if anyone had any interest in giving it a read.

** Pacing seems to be a definite problem. The first chapter has this OC getting together with her without any real groundwork being set up, without any real reason at all.

Dark Forest should be Forbidden Forest really stuck out to me. Grammar and Spellcheck could be cleaned up. Read some of the dialogue out loud, the flow doesn't always seem natural. Your summary also needs to be rewritten.

Continue writing, but /for the right reasons/. Write as a hobby, write for fun, write because you enjoy it, not because you want people to like it. I think you should continue writing, no doubt about that, but don't feel obligated to continue this. Write what you want to.
