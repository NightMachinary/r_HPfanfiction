I'm older than a lot of HP Fanfic writers are now. I started reading fanfic a long time ago, I think just after Gobet of Fire came out. There were tons of beloved BNFs (Big Name Fans) back there whose fanfic was praised as really, really amazing.

So, whose stories have stood the test of time? Are any of them still drawing the attention of readers?

Have newer fanfic writers ever garnered the level of attention that those early BNFs did?


** Can you OP post a comment with some of your rec's? I have only gotten into fanfic recently and want to take a dive into older fanfics. Would be interesting to see canon perspective from before the series finished!

*** Unfortunately when I was reading these longer fics (and it was eight or ten years ago), I didn't take note of their titles so now I only recognize them when I stumble across them in other peoples' rec lists. The BNFs I remember in particular are the ones who caused such scandals and then got book deals. ;-)

** ohla,

I've been reading fanfiction for about 8 years or so, (i'm 28)

The oldest authors I can think of that I still re-read now and then and seem to still be getting reviews are:

1) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/140916/Leila-B][Leila B]] posted in *2002*

2) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/426171/Caeria][Caeria]] posted in *2005* still writing it, and still gets a /lot/ of reviews.

3) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/425332/Disneydoll0424][Disneydoll424]] posted in *2003* still getting reviews.

4) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/866426/][Children of the Shadows]] *2006* still writing, still very popular.

--------------

There are others that came out around 2007/8 but I don't know how far back you're thinking? I know stories that are very popular and authors who are very popular who only started in around 2010ish? Althoug when I say popular, they're not up in the thousands of reviews yet most of them I don't think. Although [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1632752/Anubis-Ankh][Anubis Ankh]] is quite new and they have over 1600 reviews for [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time][Pride of Time]] which only came out in 2011.

The most impressive I have to say is Caeria, she's spent /years/ writing her story and people are still lapping it up.

I guess it depends on what you're looking for. A lot of the fiction pairings I've been interested in lately have been few and far between, so i'll read almost anything that comes out relating to it not basing it on reviews at all. /But/ the more popular pairings while there are lots of stories involving them which have thousands of reviews do tend to get read more in general anyway. I'm in the process of writing myself, but have yet to publish, i'm hoping I can ask some of the more popular authors I get on with to plug me a bit perhaps. but I don't imagine, even if the story is good, that'll get many reviews till it's been up for the lenght of time as the oldies.

I loved it when stories came out before you knew what way rowling was going to take the books. they were always so interesting and no one resented the weird directions authors tooks the stories in, which they seem to now. I personally love reading stories where X never happened, or Y never died or when it turns out some random character has some mental super power. It's reached the point where i've read the same story so many times. told so many different ways that when people do change something I can still imagine it being perfectly feasible.

Would love to hear your own thoughts fleshed out a bit.

Does it ever freak you out when you relise an author you like is wasn't born till you were ten? When they're called 'something93' and things it freaks me out... But I wasn't really a child when the books came out, so what did I expect I guess.

*** I wonder how readers new to fan fiction can handle changes authors make. I started reading fanfics probably in 2003-2004, and it was just an entirely different mindset going into them. How did Voldemort have his powers? How would Harry defeat him? And of course who would end up together (for the more romantic centric ones) were the big questions writers were trying to answer. Nowadays I just read Methods of Rationality because it is such a fun/interesting twist so it has that same feeling the older ones did. To those who started reading fan fiction after all the books finished try to go into a story with an open mind or else you'll probably have a bad time.

**** True, I hadn't even read all the books or seen the films when I started reading HP fan fictions. I kinda fell into it from another fan verse. So it was really interesting because I hadn't a clue what was real or what came from where. It was kinda disappointing in a sense when I read all the books and started watching the films properly because everything I'd read up till then had been so off the wall. Basically no fanfiction writer killed everyone off either.I was in shock when that happened to say the least.but it did spark a Renaissance of sorts with all the /la la la that never happened/ fics that came afterwards to rewrite history ;)

Same thing has happened to me with other genres too. Read a torchwoodXharry potter fic once cause I liked the author and BOOM! I ended up obsessed with doctor who. Bit odd, but there are worse ways to get into something.

I've often wondered why more hp fanfiction obsessives aren't on here. deviantart is full of them but I dont like mixing my art page with fanverse stuff because I use it professionally. So I just lurk most of the time there.

What's the craziest story you've read from back in the day that took what might happen to it's weirdest end? Or what story almost got it right? I can think of none of the latter, but I'll think about the weirdest one for a while. God knows there's some competition for that title!

***** I think the path Rowling took with the Horcruxes was very cool, but fanfiction writers have the freedom to really develop characters and their plot.

With that said, a few ideas really stood out to me which weren't really focused on/used. One fanfiction focused on the fact that Harry can sometimes see what Voldemort is up to and had him slowly "lose himself" the more it happened. An idea that I liked (fanfic was never complete or anything) was Harry becoming an animagus (black panther) to hide between 6th and 7th year.

A few I read had actual training for the war. I can't really blame Rowling for this but if you think about the spells the gang use for combat are limited. So a few that stand out to me (although not enough to remember by name) are the ones where year 6 they don't go to school so they can train with the Order OR for the ones that they do attend Hogwarts turns into a military base where everyone is trained for the war.

Overall I can say I never read any that were TOO crazy (and if I did they were funny romance ones written for that purpose) but like you said there weren't any that came close to "getting it right" either. Like you, I read fanfics for other stories (mostly anime) so I think that helped open me up to AU stuff.

Oh just remembered one that might take the cake for weird just because of what led up to me reading it. For those of you that are fanfic junkies there is one for EVERY couple. So one night I was joking around with my friends about the different odd pairings and searching them, and of course we were finding some. So then I had to do it and searched to see if there were any Harry/Hedwig ones and there was one. No he didn't get freaky deaky with his owl, but basically what happened was Hedwig was set free because being with him was too dangerous (perfectly normal)... but then Harry starts to cry and confess his love for her and that no one will understand him the way she did. So it may not be super weird, but it felt extra weird/funny because I went into it with the mentality "Holy crap there is actually a fanfic about Harry getting with his owl."

** We started reading around the same time. Betwen GoF and OoTP.

I still recall the big splash Severitus made and that genre still goes on (Severus as Harry's dad, the username is the term for this) even though that users story never finished.

I saw someone post about Anubis...OMG that writer makes some crazy crazy mammoth stories! I've read over 1million words of his/her stories. I wanna say her, but forget.

I used to read a lot of Notwolf, some time ago. That name rings a bell.

I posted this in another thread, but Sugar Quill, from the site, the Sugar Quill did After The End, and that will always be a classic to me.

Dunno how long coffeeonthepatio has been around, but she writes quite a bit, and some great work too.

Star Polaris is an older user too, but sadly, abandoned a story I was reading (nearly 5 years ago. Still waiting. lol), but is still actively writing.

These are all ff.net usernames, BTW.

I dont recall any others, and aside from the crazy huge writers, like Anubis, I dont tend to recall/keep track of usernames, because I read so much, and the community is so huge now.

I find now, you dont find as many stories via word of mouth/user as you used to. It's a very search and read world. It's great that there are so many options. I used to run out of DECENT Time travel stories to read, and now they are nearly endless (though I do try).

For anyone who want to find older stories, look up ff.net's C2 communities and look for that sort of specific group. It can be a great way of discovering stories. And you dont realize how dated they are until you re-read them.

Ok...enough insanity from me. PM me if any of this is unclear. It's 1am and I'm tired, and busy reading fanfiction, of course!

** There was a really great Maruaders era fic called "Match" on harrypotterfanfiction.com. Now, they have a policy that after a year of no activity, they take your stuff off their servers/site. It had gotten to about 49 chapters and it was amazing. It was a big name/big story on that site, so when I saw that the author hadn't been around and that the story was taken down, my heart broke.

There was a very tomboyish seventh year girl named Ze, who played beater on the Gryffindor quidditch team and her relationships with her teammates and her /new/ relationships with her dormmates. The guys on the quidditch team decide to stay celibate until the last game, with consequences if they don't. One of the girls in the seventh year named Gwen (if I recall correctly), is manipulating too many people (she's been cast the ice queen who reigns with an iron fist), so the other girls in the dorm plot to take her down. When the last chapter had come out, Lily and James had switched bodies. Ze was seen beating up her best friend's girlfriend. Think this was after the Ravenclaw/Gryffindor match.

The chapters were usually 4000 words. It seemed like it had a slow moving plot but three chapters later, you wonder how everything got there. Such an addictive read.

** I didn't start reading fanfic until after OOTP but what about [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra_Clare][Cassandra Clare]]?

When I first started reading fic that was the must read story I was directed to. I've actually never been a big fan of that particular series, even though I do like H/Hr. But she's managed to catapult that into a successful career where her original work is now being made into major motion pictures themselves. Not sure if this is relevant but as a reader of H/Hr fic when I first started looking she and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/TPOU.html][Lori]] where huge must reads in that particular community.

I actually only read the first two of her trilogy so I have no idea if H/Hr even ended up as the ship endgame of the trilogy.

*** Yes, she was Cassandra Claire then, with the "i." She only changed the name when she got her book deal. She's the BNF that I still remember. Even now, I think the concept for Draco Dormiens (the first book) is great--I love the first few chapters. I don't remember whether I felt equally enthusiastic for the rest of that book, but I did begin to find the CC obsession puzzling, because I found the sequels to be overwrought.

I also found it rather awkward that someone who plagiarized so much got a book deal out of her fandom fame, which is why I call liking the memory of DD a "guilty pleasure."

**** I actually only found out about the plagiarism issue last year despite reading the trilogy when it was still being published (I think I discovered it halfway through /Draco Veritas/ being posted). I reread the trilogy for the first time since it'd been finished and realised I didn't enjoy it half as much as I remembered. I did have to push myself to actually finish DV because it just dragged on so much. But I was quite shocked to learn about the plagiarism thing and it certainly stole what little enjoyment I still got from the trilogy, and made me a lot more sceptical about her published works (of which I've only read one and didn't enjoy it much - certainly not enough to read any more of her stuff).

***** Part of the reason most people didn't hear about the plagiarism issue was because her best friend and fellow BNF, Heidi, was a lawyer. Any time it was brought up, she would swoop in and threaten to file defamation lawsuits. The HP Fandom was completely nuts back then. If you have a lot of spare time, you should look up the MsScribe Story.

**** Okay, thanks for that. I thought I had imagined the I in Claire after I searched for her profile. It's been a long while since I even thought about that story that I thought I'd remembered her handle wrong.

Also as a huge fan of Buffy I can't even remember if I picked up on the plagiarism at the time or not. I'd like to think I did but all I know is I only read through once and wasn't really impressed with it. Unfortunately I think this happens more often than nought. I know there was a One Tree Hill fanfic I was really enjoying that started to completely blatantly rip off Gilmore Girls dialogue and there is a currrent H/HR fic on FF.net that is a complete rip off of several plots from Lost's first season. The main plot I think is original but all back stories are based on Lost.

**** I quite enjoy the POU trilogy even though it's unfinished and I can see how it can drag on it parts for some. I started reading while part three was already started so that might have helped with the slowness in my perspective. I do know she eventually did end up posting a summary of what she intended to happen with the fic even though it was never finished. I would still recommend that particular story to a new H/Hr reader even though it's extremely AU by now.

The only other BIG fic I can think of being a must read at the time is Trouble in Paradise, an H/Hr fic from the perspective of Angelina Johnson married to one of the Weasley Twins and Hermione with Ron. I do remember enjoying it at the time and might have to seek it out for a second read for perspective. I have to find it though. It might be lost in a Yahoo Group somewhere.

My very first forays into fanfic was [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1430023/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Acceptance-of-Fate][Acceptance of Fate]]. I don't know if it was very popular but I enjoyed it even though it remained unfinished after HPB was released and she stopped writing it. It was my gateway drug into the world of fanfic.

Oh how I enjoyed all the endless H/Hr vs R/HR debate during the lapse between OOTP and HBP. Such great times. I knew deep down my preference wouldn't end up canon but the debating back and forth on silly Yahoo Groups was still amazing all the same!
