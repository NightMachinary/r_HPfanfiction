** “Can I help you?” The goblin asked.

He was shorter than what Harry was used to seeing, and had a few piercings on his very long nose. He was flipping through a booklet on gold futures lazily.

“Um, yes. I'm here to get a blood test to confirm my right as heir to the head of the Black, Slytherin and Potter households, and confirm my status as head of their lordships,” Harry replied in his most confident voice. He bowed, and made sure not to make eye contact as he was told was custom in goblin etiquette.

“What are you doing?” The goblin, Bonenasher, as was written on his name tag asked nastily. “Get back up. We don't do that here, you idiot.”

“But,” Harry protested, “I was told...”

“Obviously someone told you that because they knew you'd be an easy target. Anyway, I can perform a blood test only for accounts you have access to. The rest you have to take up with the Ministry.”

“So, will you do that?” asked Harry.

“No, I'm on break. Come back in twenty minutes.”

“But you're at the counter, couldn't you just...”

“What part of I'm on break don't you understand? Now, scram before I close all your accounts.”

“Can I leave my name with you?”

“You can wait back in queue with the others. The current estimate for waiting times is about one hour.” Bonenasher replied, flipping a page.

“This is ridiculous!” Harry shouted, leaving in a huff.

“Thank you for coming to Gringotts, we value your business,” Bonenasher replied in a full monotone, flipping another page.

*** It's one of those things that aggravate me to no end. It ranks so highly on my pet peeves that if the goblins are bashed, then I automatically favorite a fic.

**** This fandom has ruined the goblins lol. They're supposed to be nuanced like the centaurs. Bitter, resentful, and prideful, but also capable of respect (like when they bowed in PS).

***** I think the Goblin wars sort of muddied the waters. Yes they're greedy, selfish assholes. But the wizards ruthlessly stole and Genocided them and they returned the favor. So your level of empathy corresponds to how much you hate the worst aspects of wizard exceptionalism

**** There was one fic I remember where the goblins were portrayed like dementors, in that they subsist partially on cruelty - and just switched torturing innocent humans for running an obtuse and completely unusable bank system.

That was kinda fun.
