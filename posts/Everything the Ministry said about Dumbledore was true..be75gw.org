I'm not going to do anything with this plotbunny but I find it really humorous, so I thought I'd share it in hopes someone else would like it and then I could read it üòú

Everything Fudge, the Prophet, and Percy said was true. (Umbridg is an outlier: fanatic.) Dumbledore was stirring up trouble where none existed, and using Harry to build an army. The Headmaster carefully sculpted a world for Harry and co. with hints and intrigue in order to trick then into playing out his game; Quirrell was little Harry's first victim. You can decide whether Sirius had also been brainwashed like Harry or is playing along (evil) and the Voldemort from the Triwizard Tournament (and the Ministry, depending on how many canon years you use) was a crisis actor.

Only, Harry stumbles on a very real clue to "Voldemort's" location and despite Dumbledore's kindly instruction that it's the wrong avenue he pursues his find and comes across the normal-skinned, nose-having, normal-eyed actor who smiles, and cheerfully asks Harry how he enjoyed the improv LARP scene they'd put on together.

*** I think I might have been a little inspired by the "insane Harry" request someone else put up. A lot of evil Dumbledore fics don't make sense but I felt like this idea had potential...

**** Essentially the person we were led to believe was the main villain for half the film was just an eccentric actor who was hired by the actual villain as a distraction/decoy

** I'd prefer a plot where he is planning to overthrow the ministry and building his own army where Voldemort is back. Imagine, Dumbledore decides to start teaching Eldritch magics. He thinks Fudge is a moron and is planning to murder Umbridge for the greater good.
