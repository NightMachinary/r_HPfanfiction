He/she always wins. All obstacles are overcome with dumb luck. The MC rarely realizes he's in danger, but against all odds always comes out unscathed. He isn't particulary good at magic and beats his opponents in stupid ways.

The MC can be a minor or major character in canon.


** Well in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] Harry isn't stupid but clearly has a lot of luck. Bit of a crack fic but quite funny and enjoyable. linkffn(2318355).

It's got a sequel by the same author and another which is a crossover with DC universe (particularly the Justice League Animated Series from early 2000s) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11965672/1/Terminal-Justice-by-Overkill-AKA-Irrational-Intelligence][Terminal Justice]] (unfortunately unfinished right before the end... before the last chapter if we believe the author on his original publishing site) linkffn(11965672)

  The unofficial fourth of the Make a Wish series by Rorschach's Blot, it was originally written by Overkill aka Irrational Intelligence and removed for some reason. EDIT: Have separated the chapters now.

Not quite what you're looking for. Harry's an idiot, but he's not stupid. Sorta. Some reviewers think he's autistic.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

*** I'd say he's definitely autistic. A few subtle things he does (such as being unable to recognize someone in the wrong context) are textbook autistic traits. The author also did say that while they didn't set out to make Harry autistic they did use an autistic friend of theirs as a basis for Harry's personality.

Harry's a little bit crazy in that one. His friends are afraid that if he learns how famous he is, he'll go completely around the bend.

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.
