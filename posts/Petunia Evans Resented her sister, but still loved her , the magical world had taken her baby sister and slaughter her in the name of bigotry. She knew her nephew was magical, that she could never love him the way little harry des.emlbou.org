Petunia Evans does the one decent thing she can for her nephew. The little boy deserves a loving home it's the least She could do for her dead sister. Dumbledore said he had to live with family then she would send him To family.

Petunia calls her older brother Bruno, an Interpol agent working in the states. Uncle Bruno had spent the last decade tracking war criminals Across north and South America. He is more then happy to take on his Nephew, Petunia And he had never agreed on anything other than that they both loved Lily . Harry is raised by an honest to god Nazi hunter that knows a thing or two about international law.

*** I don't know, in a lot of families, the naming traditions are gender-specific. Like I knew a family where the firstborn son always gets named “Dorr” ---the one I met was I think Dorr VI---but the females could be named whatever.

So it makes sense to me that the flower naming would be a tradition only for the females in the family. This can be seen as fact in HP cannon too because Petunia and Lily are females named after flowers, but when Lily had a son she named him Harry---not some flower name. Therefore some lost older brother of Petunia and Lily doesn't need a flower/plant name. (I think a lot of stories overuse the flower-name trope anyway..)

**** I know someone who's family regretfully stuck to naming conventions so the eldest child is named Gerald , she later changed her name to Geraldine to prevent confusion of her gender. It depends on the family.
