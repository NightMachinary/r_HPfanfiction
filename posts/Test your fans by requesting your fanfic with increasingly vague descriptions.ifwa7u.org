** Any new fics in the past six years where Harry is mentored by Quirrell? Preferably gen, would like at least 40k+ but I don't mind waiting for unpredictable updates. (I've already read HPMoR, looking for something different.)

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU
