Does anyone know the name of the Fic where Harry uses the ley lines to tell all the muggles about magic and make them subservient to wizards. I'm pretty sure its a grey harry fic with some dumbles bashing. Any help would be great in finding it üëç

Ill get back to you as soon as i remember.

edit: linkffn(jaded eyes of a prodigy)
