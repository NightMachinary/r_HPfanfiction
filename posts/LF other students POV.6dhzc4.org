** It's from the perspective of OCs(original characters) and the first of the series is books 1-5 in only a few chapters.

The [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=259003][sequel]] is Book Six and is 180000+ words.

And it's worth noting that the [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293286][second sequel]] is set during DH and the [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=318952][third]] post DH. But it does 'mostly' fit your request.

  Slytherin House is a hard place to be in the run-up to the Second War. Any student has to worry about classes, careers, juggling the wishes of teachers and parents; a Slytherin gets the rest of the school's judgement, the internal politics of prejudice and choosing sides. How do the decent but cunning, the moral but ambitious, walk the thin green line?

*** Have to second this recommendation. Slide is a fantastic author (She's published original fiction). She creates a brand new world, deeply fleshes out her original characters, and conveys a rather complex premise. Also brings life to a series of secondary characters we don't really see too much of in the books (McLaggen, Katie Bell, Urquhart, etc.)
