But I'm actively looking for a Beta reader. I have five chapters and had the outline for the 6th and 7th but really need help to solidify the flow and diction of the first five before this falls through the ground. Along with undoing the unintentional Mary Sue of the OC I've created.

Point being. I've messages SEVERAL people on the Beta pool that FFN has and not one has responded. I've never had that problem before. So I'm asking here where people are much more active if anyone knows or is one and would like something to do this weekend.

:::Story quick look::: Adventure/family -- h/hr(potentially not romantic at all just currently the two mains) Sirius and an OC are heavily involved

Thanks guys


** I can't commit the time to being a beta, but I'll read through your posted items and give you feedback if you want.

*** Don't need any commitment past the first 5 chapters! I'm a full time (14 credit hour) college kid with a child and job so my chapters take ages to finish but I feel like I can nol onger love forward with the frustration that I have with the current ones. If you are okay with that then I'm okay with that too

** I am good with story, less so with other stuff, my only problem would be how I am writing something right now, and would feel like shit if I borrow from you
