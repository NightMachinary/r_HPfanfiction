**** No, no, Harry's in on the whole thing in cahoots with Grunnings, he's the one keeping an eye on things to make sure nobody gets cold feet. It's his job to catch the snitch.

*** Maybe because the culprit is a mad half- or pureblooded wizard, trying to frame Harry? At least that would be my strategy for this.

There might be an angry wizard who tried to find Harry's weakness by having him investigated. The investigator did his job rather bad, claiming Harry was raised by his aunt and uncle like a beloved son. Why shouldn't Harry want to help his loving uncle by helping him rob Gringotts using drills?!

** This sort of reminds me of a fic or snippet where Grunnings is actually owned by the Dwarves, and Vernon is very supportive of Harry, and he knows and interacts with the Magical World. Anyone know the name?
