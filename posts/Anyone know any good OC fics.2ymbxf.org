** Latet Anguis in Herba is a great series of fics focused on a group of Slytherins a year older than Harry.

In the first installment they reminisce about various things they've been through as a group over the last 6 years. The second installment focuses on the events of HBP, and deals with various issues, like the rise of the Death Eaters and the abuse Slytherins have to deal with from the rest of the school which treats them as mini-Death Eaters. The third installment is set during DH. Without spoiling too much, the group is forced to break up and each of the characters tries to find his/her own path in life.

The characters deal with the conflict of Slytherin pragmatism vs "dumb" morality that tends to get people killed, the stigma of being Slytherins and/or associated with bad people in various ways, and growing up and dealing with increasingly complicated issues. There's lots of drama, tension and quite a bit of action. Also there's countless character cameos from the books, complicated character relationships, and generally lots of awesome stuff. The only drawback comes, not from the story itself, but from the difficulty of selling the story. Not many people are into stories with OC ensemble casts.

I can't sell this fic enough. To convince you I will say this: I've read both Latet Anguis in Herba and Alexandra Quick (generally considered to be the magnum opus of OC fics) and while AQ was wonderful, I easily preferred Latet Anguis. If Alexandra Quick is the sort of thing you're looking for, Latet Anguis will be, at the very least, a satisfying and enjoyable read for you.

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandria Quick]] series is easily the best OC-centric series there is.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss][Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss]] is decent enough is you can stomach romances.

*** I came here to say this one. The characters are characterized very well and there are some more 'unique' or at least unusual character archetypes. The plot is very interesting, and contains a great mix of adventure, action, mystery, and even a little romance. But my favorite thing about this one is that the author has created a new original universe that still fits into the Harry Potter OC Universe. Most of the magic and creatures and institutions (schools, governments, law enforcement, etc.) are fresh and new. Definitely one of my top three, and the best original story in my opinion.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me][You'll be the Death of me]] by Dominikki644. It's a Neville/OC.

One of my favorite stories ive read. 384k words and she's not done with the first book yet. Excellent character development and one of the best Gryffindor/Slytherin love stories I have read.

It's an OC who's Harry's sister that's written purely for fun.
