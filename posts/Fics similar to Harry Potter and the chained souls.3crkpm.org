Hi, just finished these two wonderful fics and am hoping for recommendations for fics that are similar. So good mentor type Snape but no slash or anything where he and Harry go from hating each other to being bffs overnight.

Many thanks :)

  They say there's no such thing as a magical Animagus. They're wrong. Harry Potter, Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy join together in an alliance no one, especially Voldemort, is expecting. Severus/Harry mentor, Harry/Draco friends. No slash.

** linkffn(Resonance by GreenGecko). It took me an unusual amount of time before I actually tried this story, but it and its sequels are amazing. Slow as fuck sometimes, but excellent.

*** I just finished reading this and oh my god it was great. My favorite 'Severitus' story by far. There were 1 or 2 story archs I thought were dragged a bit too far, and it's missing 2 chapters in the last book (according to the author) that probably won't be added, but it ends at an OK point if you're into mildly sudden endings.
