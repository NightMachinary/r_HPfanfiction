It also has to have hit at least 4th year, or au equivelant. I'm sick of getting hyped by stories with 100k+ words, and then finding out it barely hits freaking halloween of first year. I want a hyper smart Harry which has actually gotten further than the "introductory years."

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** linkffn(7578572)

Complete and 500K+ words. Everyone is relatively in character, the crossover mixes well, (so you don't need to know about too much of either fandom to understand), a nice mix of Wizard Traditions along with Muggle Tech, without Mugglewank. There's a sequel out as well, also completed.

  When Professor McGonagall went to visit Harry Watson, son of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, to deliver his Hogwarts letter, she was in the mindset of performing a familiar if stressful annual routine. Consequently, she was not prepared to find Harry Potter at 221B Baker Street. BBC Sherlock HP crossover AU

*** I started it but didn't finish so did Harry actually became that smart? Because in the beginning he was pretty useless.

** Not sure how well this meets your criteria but Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) casts Harry as a natural legilimens, giving him Sherlock Holmes levels of insight into the motivations of others.

It's a trope-busting WBWL fic. I like it, but I've seen criticism from others that it's failing to live up to it's premise.

I think it's mid year three right now, some 800k words.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  When Albus Dumbledore shows up at Baker Street with strange demands and baby-filled picnic baskets, Sherlock Holmes is less than thrilled. Featuring Detective!Harry, Competent!Quirrell, and the world's only private consulting detective. No slash.
