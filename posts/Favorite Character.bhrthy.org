I've always thought my favorite character was Neville. He just seemed awesome to me, with his huuuge development, especially in the fifth book.

Recently though, I read a fic where the author said they won't be adding Hedwig at all and I got so annoyed that I closed it and went browsing for a new one.

So I'm pretty sure she's actually my favorite but she's just so underrated bc she's an owl not a person.

So who's your guys' favorite character? Why?


** Hagrid. He is the biggest example of the fact that Rowling wanted HP to be a laid-back, sarcastic take on then-modern British lifestyle. He's a half-giant who was thrown out of school and had his wand snapped after being convicted of negligent homicide. He works with the most dangerous monsters in the world - and for all that the implications of Dark magic are often glossed over, the dangerous creatures in HP are /exactly/ as terrifying as you'd think they would be.

And for all that, his role in the story is to be a cheerful, emotionally upbeat center of calmness and support for Harry. He collects pictures of his parents, and gives him a whittled flute even though Harry has no idea what to do with it. He dates Dumbledore's female half-giant French counterpart. His relationship with the centaurs is to treat them like sitcom-esque irritating neighbors.

He tracks down Voldemort without even realizing it in Philosopher's Stone. He's always on Harry's side, and more often than you'd think, Harry finds himself looking forward to his visits when things get rough. Hermione confides in him when Harry and Ron are angry at her. He's literally the unsung hero that's present through the entire series. He takes Harry out of the Wizarding world, back in, and carries him back from the forest after he 'died,' too. He's not just comic relief, though he's got that in spades.

Best character. Plus, you'd best respect that beard - for several decades, people thought that was the Hair of Slytherin.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** I mean in the books, Hedwig is cool and all. But in fics, she's either there to play with Harry's hairs/fingers or miraculously understanding whole conversations and eating bacon. (But to each their own, I have specific pet peeves too!) But I guess this explains why I tend to have different favorites when talking about books and fanfics.

I really love Neville and Ron (besides the episodes where he ‘abandons' Harry) in the books. Ron truly seemed like the best friend one could have, almost as magical as their world is. And Neville is just so good and growing so brave.

But in fics, especially Ron, they both are pretty boring, I find. Even in Weasleys positive fics, Ron is just... meh. Even well written, he's never this great friend with this really great friendship with Harry.

And while in the books I disliked Voldemort/Tom (because, you know, I was absolutely immersed into the story), well written fics about Tom becoming Voldemort are just the absolute best (for me). And all the Tom at different times/universes. It's just fascinating. (I think it comes from the fact that Voldemort because rather dumb in the books for being this big evil vilain that everyone worldwide fears; so it's satisfying to see him makes more sense). So, yes, fanfics writers made Tom my favorite character.

Oh. And Sirius. He's probably the only character (if not counting Harry, of course) which is just fantastic both in fanfics and books. I'm still not over his death, to be honest. But fanfics are saving me, little by little. He's so tragic and dramatic, it speaks to my soul. He's really one of these few characters that have so much depth or potential for depth.

*** The two best Ron that I've ever read, where he's really similar to canon in his friendship with Harry are from Eclipse of the SKy and Grow Youn With Me.

I've rarely enjoyed Ron in fanfics because they, as you said, rarely portray him accurately, but in both of these, he really is, though in one he's much older, seeing its 12 years after DH, and while he's much more mature and responsible, he's still that laidback chill dude that just wants to hang out and drink a beer with his buddy while joking around.

**** People always forget that in GoF Ron isn't upset that Harry allegedly put his name in the goblet- he's upset that Harry did it /without him/, because they're best friends. And he comes to his senses fairly quickly- the feud only drags on so long because Harry throws his apology (and a chess set, hard enough to draw blood) in his face when he tries. Harry isn't blameless here.

As for DH, Ron is under more stress than either Harry or Hermoine. Hermoine's family is safe and Harry has none- but Ron's whole family is on the front lines. Arther and Percy are in the Ministry, Bill and Charlie working for the Order, the Twins are on the run broadcasting an underground news station, and Ginny is living in a school run by Death Eaters. Every day the war goes on is another day where he might hear that someone he loves died, because they're all in harm's way. The locket no doubt fed on that, because Harry's obsession with hallows comes across as dicking around while his family is in danger from this perspective.

I thought it was one of the Potter Stinks badges, but I do agree overall. Hermione even later says when they're apologizing to each other that they're both /so/ stupid.

** The main problem of Hedwig in fanfic is how Harry got her. Hagrid bought her for Harry the day of his first visit to Diagon Alley which coincide with his birthday. But if you change anything about the scene (Harry makes his shopping with someone else or alone, or go another day), it makes the scene sound fake. I remember seing a fic where it is Snape that brings Harry there (and it was a disdainful Snape, pretty close to Canon), et yet Harry still left with Hedwig with him.

Canon Hedwig was great but I never saw a fic where she was as magical (except in a Crackfic where she was like a super agent et was teaching thing to Harry like how to torture someone to extract informations).

​

As for my favourite character, I'm torn between Ron and Tom Riddle. Ron is the great friend that is always there (or almost always there I guess). Noble and courageous (he sacrificied himself in PS, dug a tunnel in the CoS knowing that Harry was fighting a basilisk, put himself in front of the thought murderer Sirius Black and his target, telling him he would have to kill him first with an already broken leg, and his general willingness to follow Harry in troubles), and is even a tactician.\\
I'm still pretty annoyed of the way movies made him an complete idiot and is treatment in fanfics.\\
As for Riddle, he is just the perfect villain, intelligent, attractivie, being trusted by everyone but Dumbledore. Even his faillings are in character like his arrogance or tendency to put a show (you never monologue in front of your enemy, you just kill him).

** Oh boy, forgive me for making a list.

​

*- Dumbledore*, book-wise. His whimsiness and wise geniality combined with his complexity, is of a kind I had never read or felt before.

HP has for the most part a pretty whimsy tone that is failed to be recreated by 99% of fanfics, if not far more. It's difficult, I imagine. But I've still found far fewer fics where this tone is well-accomplished compared to fics that are 'just' well-written or have good character development. So often, when we originally learned something about the wizarding world -anything at all- it was just delightfully odd, except for the later parts ofcourse. And Dumbledore is perhaps the epitome of this.

Especially when you learn of him as a severely flawed but intrinsically good human being later.

- *Sirius* is a character of the tragic kind that I love, though me being a fan of Gary Oldman probably played a part in that. Dude had an unbelievably shitty life.Just do the count : unwelcome home life /possibly abused. School, which was mostly good, but still kicked out later. Few years of war, lose a lot of friends. Be 12 years in Azkaban, literal hell, because you're not even given a trial and everyone thinks you are exactly like the people you hate while your idea backfired and killed your best friends. And some 3 years on the run and hiding where the few bright sparks in several years are dealing with your godson's increasing despair before you're murdered by your cousin.

Not going to defend he was probably a bully in Hogwarts, but if you still manage to be a decent father-figure for Harry and overall decent person who was fucked in every possible way by society like that. And a much better person than Snape, who escaped Azkaban while ACTUALLY being a death eater and generally being a much viler person to everyone.

*- Arthur, Hagrid* and *Harry* are also characters I admire. The first two for the strong but gentle people they are, Harry for his compassion despite every reason he should not be so. Harry can be moody, sassy, stubborn, melodramatic and not seem the nicest at times, but his compassion outmatches even Dumbledore's. But it's done without it being overly obvious. He refuses to harm death eaters when they try to kill him early book seven, he forgives Snape and Dumbledore, he even tries to stop Pettigrew's hand from turning on himself, he returns the elder wand, he is obsessive about Malfoy being a death eater but when proven right sees in an instant that Malfoy is forced into a situation he pities him for, despite him nearly killing Ron. He goes back for Malfoy in the Room of Requirment. He makes peace with Dudley.

Honestly, for all that the fanfics like to portray Harry as the one that dares to be brutal against Death eaters and have Dumbledore going on about endless chances, the reverse is closer to the original. Only Harry succeeding in the crucio of Carrow is truly OOC. If he couldn't do it against Bellatrix, no way that Carrow insulting Minerva is enough to make him succeed.

** Going by your standard of "which character can I least stand being overlooked/mistreated by fic," I think my answer is Dumbledore, because bashing him will get me to nope out of a fic instantly, no matter how good it is otherwise. I love the wise, kindly, twinkly-eyed headmaster he is in the earlier books, but even more I love the lonely, guilt-ridden, flawed human that we later learn he is. He's an endlessly complex character - preaching the power of love while isolating himself, working towards "the greater good" but almost ruining his plans because he wanted to protect Harry, giving other second chances while never forgiving himself - and I dearly wish more fics would embrace that complexity, rather than reducing him to a one-note Machiavellian chessmaster.

*** I agree it's really hard for me to read Dumbledore bashing. Usually I just stop no matter how far I'm in if it gets bad. I would say my favorite fanfic character is Draco because he's kind of a clean slate. The writer can go so many directions with him, I find it enjoyable to read. Favorite canon characters are the twins. They invent new spells, they show Harry how to get around the school, they have an underground radio station. One of them looses an ear and doesn't even care.
