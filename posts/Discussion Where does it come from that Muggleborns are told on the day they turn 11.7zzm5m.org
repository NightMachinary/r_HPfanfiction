So I was reading linkffn(12421914) When Hermione was introduced she mentioned that she was told of the Wizarding world on her eleventh birthday. It's hardly the first time I've read it, but the first time I thought to ask where people take this from.

Yes, Harry learned about it on his birthday. But according to Canon they tried to let him know at least a week before. Suggesting that they started informing people ca 5 weeks before the start of the school year. Which certainly isn't a strange standard to have, regarding being informed of that years textbooks. Certainly better than the archaic 'we'll let you know whenever your birthday is' stance that some people seem to take.


** Well, there are a few possibilities!

1. People misremember canon, and only recall that Harry actually got his letter on his birthday.

2. People are stupid (I doubt this is the answer).

3. It snowballed out of one or two popular fics back in the day doing it and it has now become a nigh-unstoppable force, pulverizing all common sense in its path.

** Yeah it's dumb, but it's understandable that readers would misremember: JKR made such a big deal about the birthday.

Imagine if your birthday is on August 31. Good luck buying your school equipment!

It's totally unreasonable for Muggleborn. They should be informed at least a year in advance.

True enough, but that should mean that they're introduced in the summer a school year before starting, and not at the child's birthdays or random weekends of the fall semester.

And I mean that the textbook lists would come out 5 weeks before start of term.

***** That the oddity is about being informed on ones 11th birthday. Not just the summer of the school year preceding when they'd start at Hogwarts. There'd still be a discrepancy between somebody learning about Magic early in September and in December. So why not deal with it all a year in advance and at a time that the teachers had more time on their hands to do so.

And the 5 weeks had to do with the textbooks which they need for the school year. It's not an unreasonable time to be able to get them if you've got 5 weeks.

Getting the textbooks is no problem. A Muggleborn child will already have enrolled in another school at that point and probably made all kinds of other arrangements. It's completely silly to tell them only 5 weeks in advance: Your life as you know it is over for the next 5-7 years. But I'm an extremist and think Muggleborn parents should be informed the first time Accidental Magic is detected... also to make sure that no abuse occurs (fundamental christians will not be very happy about their child being possessed by a demon)

I was going to say. "We don't have that problem here in Europe." But then I recalled the story of a girl that vacationed or something with relatives in Russia. They were Fundamental Extremist Orthodox. Or something along those lines. I do not believe she returned. :(

******** I was just giving an example anyways. The Dursleys aren't particularly religious as far as I can tell and they are still quite abusive. In a better Magical Society this behaviour would at the least warrant regular visits by some kind of social worker.

** This really doesn't make sense to me. If I ran the zoo, I'd start outreach around the child's fifth birthday. Educate the parents first and make sure that they understand that some things may happen around their child but these are not things to be punished for. I mean, look at Stephen King's “Carrie”. Can you imagine a magical child being raised in a fundie environment? What a shitshow that would be.

Then as the child ages, teach the child about the statute and how to control their magic so you don't end up with another Tom Riddle that hurts or bullies other children with magic. Make sure that they aren't frightened by what they can do so you don't end up with Obscurials or worse.

It's all about setting up your next generation for success, something the world JKR set up seems very ill-equipped for.

** I'm confused by some of the other responses and the OP. Doesn't Hermione say she didn't know until she got her letter as well? On the train in PS? It's at least close to one's birthday, seemingly.

Which doesn't necessarily mean anything as Harry got a single letter as well. But as they were under the delusion of him knowing anything about his parents or the wizarding world I suppose that would've been OK. But beyond that it's hard to tell WHEN she got it. Which is really what the argument, if one could call it that, is about.

** In my fanfic, I just got around this by having the Ministry detect Muggleborns via a second Trace (it's a bit AU) and so the Accidental Magic Reversal Department lets the parents know when they pick up accidental magic use. Makes more sense than waiting until later, after all the chances of Muggles seeing their magic or the parents freaking out and trying to see specialists to fix" their kid.

  Harry Potter responds more naturally to the Dursley's abuse and neglect. Finding out he was a wizard was the letter that broke the owl's back. Harry follows his lust for knowledge in the face of power-hungry opposition.
