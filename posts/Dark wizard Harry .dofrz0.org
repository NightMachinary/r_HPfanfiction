Hey guys, i recently read the Cage and Key fanfic.\\
That is an AU where Harry begin to train dark arts and became pretty interested with it, even obsessive sometimes (Like the chapter when he wants to test Fiendfyre but Daphne does't let him)\\
So i became curious for more fanfics like this.

-A Darker Harry that wants to learn dark arts.

-A Harry that uses curses even against other students (Like how he tortured Nott by destroying his bones in Cage and Key)

-If there's some pairing needs to be something unusual (Not H/Hr or H/G). NO SLASH

-Good Dumbledore (In Cage and Key Albus is like a mentor to Harry and helps him sometimes but advices him in his search for the Dark Arts saying that he must be careful to not lost himself)

​

Bônus ( In the same post but it's not related to the fics that i want above) : I would like you guys to recommend me fics where Harry becames Vengeful and darker after Dumbledore's death.

Same thing here, if there's some pairing needs to be unusual NO SLASH

​

That's it ! :P


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) is a favorite around here.

Linkffn(Antithesis) is great, decidedly tragic.

Edit: There's also linkffn(Too Young to Die), which is somewhat closer to what you're looking for.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
