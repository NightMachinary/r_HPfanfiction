Has any one ever read a time travel fic that has Voldemort following the main characters back in time and totally messing up their plans to save the world?

**** It essentially results in something similar, with the good guys and bad guys doing time travel shenanigans. Hence why so many people felt it read like a FanFiction, because it's a trope that's already been used there many times before

** Definitely have read it, but can't remember which one it is right now. It's also not readily apparent that's what's happening early, so it'll be hard to find...

** Well there is one one-Shot where Harry return to his 10 years old, not knowing that Riddle also returned to his wraith form, at Hogwarts, Riddle approaches him saying he possessed a boggart., and that's it, Harry is struggling to look average, because you cannot "fake" Magical Art Knowledge and Tom just wants to troll him all day.
