Hi so I'm currently reading these books and wondering if they have pairings at all? I like the extensive world building that they have but I also like me some romance.

Would appreciate anyone who's read either book to answer in a yes or no!

Trying to avoid spoilers as they both sound like very good fics. Thank you so much!!!


** So far no, the author says beginning with year 4 at the earliest, and we've just reached the end of year three

** Pureblood Pretense might start to have some, it seems like its building up to it.

** I'm on book 4 of pureblood pretense, and no far no romance - from the A/Ns it sounds like there won't be any, and with the concept it would be hard for any romance to occur.

*** There's been the slightest /hints/ at it. But pretty much no.

** Pureblood Pretense has a whole bunch of potential options for romance, but it hasn't gotten there yet. I don't doubt there eventually will be, as it's a pretty big part of the source material (Song of the Lioness). But also, remember the main character is barely fifteen. There's still room and time to grow into it.
