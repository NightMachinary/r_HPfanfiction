Looking to see if people liked one over the other, don't care, or like them both and for what reason. Feel free to post another site and why you like it as well. Someone mentioned that I might want to post a story I have on AO3 onto FFN. They said I would prob get 1000s of more likes and follows. (Right now I just write for fun so I haven't done so. I personally like AO3 better for posting my works). Thanks!


** I post on both. ff.net seems to get more traffic (in terms of favorites, follows, views, etc.) but ao3 is a lot nicer to read on imo and the tag system, while imperfect, is a better way to find fics than on ff.net.

** Ao3 has good points and drawbacks.

*Pros for Readers*

The tagging system allows for in-depth searches (if you know what you're doing) for readers. It's a bit harder to exclude tags, but it can be done. It's also friendlier towards Mature- and Explicit-rated fics. You can also separate stories in a way that FFN can't -- gen, f/f, f/m, m/m, etc.

Demographics there seem to skew older, so the comment sections are usually decent instead of hot flaming garbage. Some fandoms are actually bigger there than they are on FFN.

*Cons for Readers*

The tagging system is easily abused and I still don't know how to filter out crossovers. They also desperately need a way to list main pairings and genres in order to help trim the tagging fat.

Searching and filtering requires more than a few peeks at the instructions or FAQs.

*Pros for Writers*

Again, that tagging system. It's easy for people to find a very specific type of story, provided the author doesn't tag every little thing that's in the fic. You can also use [[http://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/1370][CSS]], if you so choose, to prettify your fics.

*Cons for Writers*

Takes a little know-how to do some of the fancier stuff on the site. The reader base is also smaller, generally.

*** It's that "if you know what you're doing" part that I still haven't figured out. I mean, I'm not incompetent, if I spent five trying I could figure it out, but I don't have to on ff.net. Plus, ff.net has a much better app.

Edited to say that I do think the overall quality of writing is better on AO3, I just which it was easier to use.

** I primarily use AO3, but not for Harry Potter fic. I really only look at AO3 for HP fic if I have a particular pairing in mind.

AO3 has a lot of benefits: better interface with some customization. There's also a good amount of support for downloading fic, as well as a robust tag system. Sorting by kudos/bookmarks gives better quality fic on AO3 than the equivalent on FFnet (which tends to be long, shorter chapter stuff.) Not to say this doesn't happen on AO3-- it does-- the influence is just dampened. I also like the interaction system better than ffnet, though wish they had PMs. I use it for most other fandoms, especially if I'm writing for a particular pairing.

However, the tag system in specific is not without faults, and those faults seem to converge for Harry Potter stuff. People over-use tags, which means they'll tag a fic with every background character ever, which means it's hard to find character-centric fics. This also applies to pairings, and the series in general gets massed in with a lot of crossovers. It's hard to catch readers on AO3, especially if you're writing for background characters and not a pairing.

When it comes to finding fic, well... I tend to use either ffnet for a specific character, or old LiveJournal rec lists for general fic. (Though there's a lot of drama with LJ servers recently, so I'll have to back up my recs...) You're also looking at a lot older content on ffnet/LiveJournal/SugarQuill than on AO3-- which isn't bad, but it's more likely to contradict canon.

I will say I think AO3 slash/femslash fic tends to be much less... prototypical "slash don't like don't read" as ffnet, and I say this as someone who writes/reads it.

As for your situation-- doesn't hurt to post it on FFN, especially if it's Harry Potter! I haven't written much HP (a short one shot is it) but there wasn't a lot of overlap of readership on what I did cross-post. Doesn't hurt to increase your readership.

*** If you're on (a relatively new version of) Firefox, you can pop Ao3 into [[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages][Reader View]]. I use it with FFN too since the sepia mode is easier on the eyes.

The only issue with it is that you have to click out of Reader to go to a new chapter on FFN (but Ao3 typically allows you to read a whole fic instead of just chapter by chapter, so that's not an issue there).

** I only use FFN unless someone recommends a fic that is only on AO3, I hate the AO3 tags and I'm fine browsing through stuff until I find something I like so FFN does the job.

It's also probably just habit, I've been browsing FFN since I was a kid.

** While I generally prefer AO3 for several reasons, when it comes to HP fic, FFN is pretty much my main hunting ground (unless I'm searching for slash/femslash). FFN simply has a larger (and older) selection of HP fics.

I crosspost to both AO3 and FFN unless my fic features adult content. Whether or not I get more traffic from FFN or AO3 depends on 1) the fandom and 2) the pairings, if any. Some fics do better on AO3, others on FFN. It really depends. So really, your best bet would be to make your fics as accessible to as many readers as possible by posting to both sites (unless you find it too bothersome, in which case I'd just choose whichever site is less of a hassle to use. For me, that's AO3.)

** I prefer AO3 for two reasons, one, I find it really hard to search for/find new stories on FFN and two because I love that on AO3 you have the option of viewing either chapters or the entire work- this is especially handy when I know I'm going someplace with crappy phone service, I can open an entire story, turn off my wifi and read, while with FFN I'd have to turn the wifi/3G back on to get to each new chapter.

To be fair though, I don't use a specific app for either, (up until a week ago my phone was only 8G worth of storage so I had like no apps at all) I just upgraded though so I'm interested to see if the reading experience is different through the app.

** For HP fanfiction, I think that AO3 is a better venue for more "out there" stories, and out there in this context includes slash or dark themes. In my opinion, the top ranked FFN HP fics are pretty mainstream in terms of cultural issues (certainly heteronormative).

I've also had better luck just picking "random" stories on AO3 in comparison with FFN. My absolute #1 criteria is quality of writing, and though there are truly excellent writers on both sites, in my experience the writing trends better on AO3. I feel like authors on AO3 are more likely to use a beta than on FFN, so that saves a lot of time in weeding out dreadful grammar, spelling, plotting, etc. When I first started reading fanfiction I mostly used FFN; now I read AO3 stories almost exclusively.

** I really like ao3 in terms of layout and functionality, but I can never find anything I want to read there and my fics never see much traffic. It must be great if you're into AU or non-canon pairings, but for us vanilla, canon compliant people it can be a little disappointing.

I hate so much of fanfic.net - I hate the doc manager, I hate the layout, I hate the guest review feature. But it just seems to be the go to and where everything is happening. I miss the glory days of mugglenet fanfic but it's so riddled with spam accounts it's unusable now.

** It's actually very interesting how ffnet and ao3 have a different mentality, so to speak. In the same fandom you get completely different types of fiction in terms of plot and writing style.

I think that, in HP fandom at least, ffnet is more known for novel style works, while ao3 is more for easy reading. (There are exceptions, of course). It is also easier to stumble upon a really bad story on ffnet then on ao3. And there are more kinky and controversial works on ao3;)

** In terms of pure content

FFN: Long, drawn out, 100k+ sagas of romance, drama, and action. Fics are on average fairly tame, possibly as an aftereffect of the great Explicit purge. Het is usually more common, depending on the fandom. Significantly more fics available.

AO3: Fics fall on the shorter side, one shots or <60k works being more popular. Tone of short fics is usually either humor or smut, possibly both. Longer fics have a greater variance of tone. In terms of explicitness, you wouldn't be surprised to see the top kudosed fic be filled with painstakingly detailed descriptions of each and every push and shove and pull in the act of sex. Slash and femslash is usually more common, possibly because of the aforementioned explicitness. Less fics available, but because of having separate rating systems for keeping a fic and liking one (bookmarking and kudosing, respectively, it's easier to find better written fics at the top (if sorting by kudos) instead of just classics and the stuff people want to keep for later.
