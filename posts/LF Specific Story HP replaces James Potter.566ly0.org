Looking for a specific story. IIRC, Harry travels back in time or to another dimension, back to the attack at Godric's Hollow. James dies but Lily survives and Harry ends up pretending to be James. The story in question was not either Ruin by MasterSlytherin nor Sighs of the Neglected Flower by nuhuh.

IIRC, Lily and Harry were in a somewhat antagonistic relationship (not paired with each other either, IIRC) and I believe only Lily knows Harry's identity.

Would really like to find this story again, so any help is much appreciated.


** Almost certain that you're looking for linkffn(The Other Boy Who Lived)

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

*** Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, that isn't the story I was looking for either.

  Harry always knew his dad was arrogant git, but turned around in his seventh year. Maybe Harry will find out why when he gets a mysteryous birthday present.

** I can't say that this is the most tasteful of ideas for a fanfiction, but if it was that good, then good luck in finding it, by the way... was it that one where he (as you said) replaces james- or rather pretends to be him, and lily knows, but andromeda also does, because she'd accidently used legilimency on lily?

** Reminds me of a plotfoetus i have: harry's consciousness is sent back in time into his father and to make sure he continues to exist and stop it from happening, has to seduce, wed, impregnate, and so on his mother. So muchy lemony fauxcest would happen.
