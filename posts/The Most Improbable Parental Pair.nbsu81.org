In a world where Lily's entire family is murdered by Death Eaters in their Seventh Year - including their older sister, Petunia - Albus Dumbledore finds himself in a dilemma about what to do with Harry Potter, Boy Who Lived and Savior of the World Magician, after the defeat of Voldemort in 81. With several Death Eaters still at large, without the protection of the Blood Wounds and the suspicion that Voldemort will return one day to reestablish his reign of terror, he finds himself entrusting the child to an unlikely pair, composed of two of his oldest friends: Batilda Bagshot and Alastor Moody.

What kind of problem can a Harry Potter fully aware of his identity and history, created in the wizarding world under the supervision of the most paranoid man in the world and the aunt of a former Dark Lord, cause?

â€‹

Or: Where an extraordinarily paranoid Harry distrusts everything and everyone - even himself, occasionally - seeing enemies in every shadow and always alert to assassination attempts, and Professor Binns, with his boring and inaccurate teaching of the History of Magic, is your biggest enemy instead of Voldemort.


** This is actually weirdly probable! According to the below letter written by Lily Potter (that's what the fandom wiki page says anyway, I don't personally remember this letter lol), Bathilda was very close to the family. She even attended Harry's first birthday party. Entrusting a familiar grandma-like figure with the care of a young boy is far more practical than giving Harry to grieving 20 year olds. I imagine that Moody is initially there for the protection against revenge attacks from Death Eaters and then he falls in love with Harry and won't leave :)

  â€œWe had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us, and who dotes on Harry... Bathilda drops in most days, she's a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore, I'm not sure he'd be pleased if he knew! I don't know how much to believe, actually, because it seems incredible that Dumbledore could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind's going, personally!"

*** It is not? I was thinking about a Harry fanfic created only by Moody, but I think he would be so paranoid that he wouldn't even leave the house, so I added Batilda, because she is a specialist in the History of Magic, Grindelwald's aunt and knows the Dumbledore's story, in addition to meeting Harry's parents.

I think she would be quite interesting before she died and had Nagini of all the things inside her body in a bizarre puppet facsimile. Couple that with Binns' incompetence, Moody's paranoia and a Boy Who Lived, and you have a Harry who thinks Dumbledore is a secret Dark Lord, Mrs. Norris - Filch's cat - is an agent from another country in her form animaga in search of the secrets of Hogwarts and Snape is the worst spy of all time, because he basically makes everyone on the "side of the Light" not trust him and hate him, when this is extremely counterproductive for a spy.

*** The letter is in chapter 10 of DH. But Moody considering he still looked sort of less old than Dumbledore being paired with Bathilda who was an adult during Dumbledore's school years makes me just want to puke.

**** I think you misunderstood. When I say "parental parent", I'm talking about taking care of Harry and teaching him, not in a romantic match. Batilda, in fact, is only ten years older than Dumbledore, having been born in 1871. This makes her forty-one years older than Moody, who was born in 1911. They would not be in a romantic relationship at all - they would just work together to raise, protect and teach a child at Dumbledore's request.

*** I was at work when I thought about it and immediately started laughing, and everyone was looking at me like I was crazy, but I couldn't think of anything but what the confrontation between Harry and Voldemort would be like in the first year. I think it would be something like this:

{Quirinus frowned at the mirror, hating his happy reflection and cursing Dumbledore all the time in his mind. He needed the Philosopher's Stone so that his master could return to his former greatness! Not an annoying image of him smiling with her in his hand. He tried all sorts of detection spells and various enchantments suggested by the Master, but none worked.

Quirinus was so distracted by the mirror that he didn't notice another presence in the room until Potter was almost at his side, taking off an Invisibility Cloak that Quirinus didn't even know he had.

"Hey teacher." Potter greeted him casually. "What's up with that fancy mirror and all these pathetically flawed traps?"

"Potter." Quirinus scoffed, but he was internally satisfied. The Master wanted to deal with Potter before leaving Hogwarts and who knows, maybe the brat would be useful with Dumbledore's trap. "I wondered if I would see him here. Without a doubt coming to play the hero, don't you? I'm sure you didn't expect to see me here, after Severus tried so hard to be hated by everyone."

Quirinius expected shock and awe. Maybe even a little horror and fear. Although....

"A-ha!" The insane kid screamed. "I said you were too pathetic to be anything other than a criminal in disguise, but nobody wanted to hear me! 'Are you paranoid, Harry', 'Quirrel is a joke, Harry', 'You shouldn't accuse a teacher of being a bad one, Harry ', they said! But! " Potter held up a finger, looking satisfied. "I've been right all along, so Hermione and Neville owe me ten galleons!"

Quirinus stared at the boy, not exactly sure how to respond to that. Potter is strange at the best of days and frankly incomprehensible at the rest. Fortunately, his Master soon spoke, the hissing voice he had heard in his mind for the past few months becoming audible.

"The boy." The Master whistled. "Let me see the boy."

"You're not some kind of ventriloquist or something, are you?" Potter asked, curiously. "Because in addition to being a failed criminal, it would be very humiliating to play with dolls too."

Quirinus, furious as he was at the comment, happily gave control to the Master - the less time dealing with Potter, the better. And it would be nice to see your Master torturing Potter.

"Harry Potter." The Master hissed in disgust. "We met again. Do you see what I've become in the past ten years? Do you see what you've made me into?"

A strange silence hung in the room, broken only by the occasional crack of magic flames at the door. Quirinus assumed that Potter was petrified with fear, but the insane brat broke his expectations by frowning and asking:

"Sorry, but who are you anyway? I have a great memory - at least that's what Aunt Tilda said - but I don't remember things when I was a year old, you know."

Quirinus almost falls with the absolute rage and the incandescent hatred that flows through his head, the anger of his Master so intense that it looks like his skull is going to explode.

"I am Lord Voldemort!" The Master screams, angrily. "The Heir of Slytherin, the greatest wizard of all time! The one who will take his life and end his days in terror, defeat and agony!"

Anyone with common sense would have tried to run away or kneel down, begging for mercy. However, although Potter was accused of being many things, sane was not one of them.

"No thanks, I think I will refuse." Potter spoke, almost politely. "You seem to have had a hard time and everything, but defeating Binns, the Evil Destroyer of History, is more important than that. Do you believe that everything he taught in the last four decades is about the Goblins Rebellion? Is it absurd? It is certainly part of Dumbledore's secret plot to manipulate all the knowledge of British wizards. I say he is a Dark Lord in disguise, but everyone ignores me, can you believe it? "}

The result? Harry's total contempt for accepting Voldemort as an enemy led Quirinus Quirrel, the owner of the body to be possessed, to have an aneurysm due to his Master's excessive wrath and to die without Harry even having to touch him.
