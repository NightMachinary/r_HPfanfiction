** Hey, I unfortunately don't know what fic this is, but I'd suggest putting useful/relevant information in the title of your post when looking for fics. A ton of people in this sub simply won't look at posts without any info in the title, they just won't bother. If you put "LF Harry resorted into Slytherin fic" as the title you'll get more chances of people reading the whole post if they've read any fics like that.
