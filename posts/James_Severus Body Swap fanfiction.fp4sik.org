I've only found two that I really like and I love the concept of the both of them switching bodies and seeing life from each other's perspective, (e.g. James as Severus experiencing bullying from the Marauders and vice versa or their new relationships with Lily) so I was just wondering if any of you guys had any recommendations? Maybe even picking up this concept and writing it? I'd support it!
