hello! i'm writing a marauder's era fanfiction and my oc's animagus form is a raven. I cannot for the life of me come up with a creative nickname (I'm awful with names) so i'd appreciate any help. If it's relevant, the oc is female and a slytherin. Thanks!


** Sharpbeak, Longtongue, Blackfeather, Niffler (as both species love shiny objects), Chatterbox [[https://youtu.be/9I5Vm_YO_MY][Ravens, Crows, and other Corvids, are capable of mimicking human speech and individual voices far better than parrots]], Omen, Black Snidget (the magical animal in HP world the Golden Snitch is based off is the Golden Snidget), and lastly silvertongue.

** The original nicknames - moony, wormtail, padfoot and prongs - are made up by 15 year boys and aren't too creative.

If you're looking for stuff in the same vein, you may wish to consider something like 'Pinion' or 'Plumes', 'Quills' or something that's just an uncommon word that a raven has compounded with a body part.

Alternatively, animagus forms don't actually require a nickname and I've never really understood the desire to give them nicknames.

It's more in the spirit of tradition. The marauder group had nicknames, it make sense that if they had more animagus friends they would also have nicknames. And if their descendants become animagus and start getting nicknames then a tradition can easily start.

*** I actually had considered just forgoing a nickname as you mentioned, but I'm trying to go for a more light-hearted fic and nicknames are fun! So i figured I'd add one just for the sake of it. Thank you for your suggestions!

** Quoth. As in "Quoth the raven, nevermore".

On a more serious note:

- Blackquill (in the vein of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs)
- Spook (double meaning - ravens are associated with horror, but also spying.)
- Huginn/Muninn (Odin's raven spies in Norse Mythology)
- Merle (Old French for a blackbird)
- Rowena (Ravenclaw)

**** Sort of fits with the Marauder-style naming though. Like, a lot of animals have antlers or padded feet, but 'Prongs' and 'Padfoot' still work as nicknames.

** Talons.

Moony, as a name, is an outlier. Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are all names based on an anatomical feature, and at that an anatomical feature that isn't especially identifying/revealing. Wormtail has a fat rat tail that looks like a worm, boom, Wormtail. Padfoot had pads on his feet, boom, Padfoot. Prongs has prongs, boom, Prongs. Very simple.

Talons has talons, boom, Talons. Very simple, based on an anatomical feature.

A lot of people already have negative associations with OCs. If it were me, I would aim for a name that errs on the side of being simple and unadorned, like Prongs, rather than trying to come up with an original composite word like Wormtail or Padfoot. That seems like a very easy way to get readers to roll their eyes and say "great, looks like this is gonna be another 'cool' animagus OC with a 'cool' name."
