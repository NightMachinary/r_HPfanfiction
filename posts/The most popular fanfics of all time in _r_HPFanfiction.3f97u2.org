| Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past | The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?                                                                                                                   | [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963]] | Rated: Fiction T - English - Adventure/Romance - Harry P., Ginny W. - Chapters: 41 - Words: 409,130 - Reviews: 13,464 - Favs: 17,470 - Follows: 16,560 - Updated: 4/7 - Published: 10/28/2005 - id: 2636963                                            | 49           |


** Of course if they are the 20 most linked probably everyone has read them, so here's the additional 8097 unique links I got after excluding github.com, mailto: and a couple of other strings: [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1miIAV7QJepVb-OEr4gy933HW9485k3x_Ac1JsV1alT8/edit?usp=sharing]]

I didn't want to get banned for hitting ff.net too hard so only the links that have been linked 20 times or more have their name/summary/info so it ends up being like a Top 100.

*EDIT: I updated the spreadsheet with new info, now almost every ffnet and archiveofourown fic should have name, summary and information. Most other links should have at least a title.*

** A good collection of stories. Well, mostly good. NoFP is outdated, Temporal Beacon has the typical Dom!Hermione/Sub!Harry and I never understood the hype for Princess of the Blacks, but a mostly good collection of stories. Out of curiosity, which are the next few?

Edit : Also, I totally need to link On the Way to Greatness more. It should be number 1 in everything, being the best story in the fandom and all. Well, that and The Phoenix and the Serpent, but nobody knows that one.

  Temporal Beacon has the typical Dom!Hermione/Sub!Harry
#+end_quote

Which for me is a refreshing change after all the Hero!Harry/Interchangeable!love interest. Really, in canon, Harry seems to go along with whatever anyone with an opinion wants him to do, and he doesn't often have a thought for the future. Temporal Beacon makes him significantly more proactive, as well as generally useful relative to Hermione.

** Number 119, /404 Not Found/ Looks like a truly gripping tale :)

Snark aside, I'm really curious how many of these come from the same poster vs. different ones -- like, there's that one guy/gal who is always recommending /Hocus Pocus Adele Polkiss/, and I'm sure a good portion of its 15 links come from them; similarly, I often link to /Biscuits/ and other works by Pinky Brown, and I know wordhammer has (rightfully) linked to their own works a number of times.....

So I'm curious how hard it would be to modify the script to account only for links by unique posters, or weighted by number of upvotes or something.

In any case, this is great work, so thank you so much for your time and effort :)
