Looking for a specific HP fic. Harry and Ginny pairing where they get these mad trunks and train in them with Hermione, Ron,Neville and Luna and they all become animagi? Very loose concept but that's all I can specifically remember? HELP!

** Was it this one? I know Harry Hermione Neville and Luna go into a trunk in this one but I'm not sure if Ginny's in it

**** I can't think of the name of it. Harry went to the room of requirement and they all appeared? And they fought with him? Harry Potter and the elements? Or something.

Sorry I know this isn't helpful!
