Last night i was musing on the idea and imagined whatever power it was sending him back sent him into the body of a young witch who dies a few days after she gets her letter. He's forced to pretend to be this freshly orphaned girl and protect prime!harry without anyone finding out who he is while being one of the unnamed gryffindor girls as well as dealing with his attraction to girls and boys and how parvati and lavender love practicing makeup on 'him.'


** Isn't there a fic where he basically merges with Gilderoy Lockhart? I don't recall the name.

*** That one gets kind of weird though, he starts trying to set up Harry and Hermione and it comes off as him sexualizing a twelve year old (teaching her to walk sexy, having Harry take pictures of her naked for a potions thesis, etc.) I rage quit after chapter 19. Also they use The whole Harry is the Lord of five Ancient Houses cliche, which now extends to the Gilderoy amalgam

***** It gets worse. Harry psychologically tortured him throughout the year. And tries to get Neville to produce a patrons in the most uncomfortable way. I had invested time in the story, so I wanted to finish but I couldn't. Instead I left an angry review. And I never flame

** I know a few Master of Death Harry fics where he's reborn in other bodies, one of my favorites by Tsume Yuki involves him reborn as Sirius's older brother. I think it's called Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is linkffn(10610076)

Your personal story reminds me of Harry Potter and the Mysterious Case of the Girl Who Lived.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
