** 'Excuse me?' A slightly shabby looking young man graced Gilderoys office. 'I was asked to apply for a position as assistant for a G Lockhart. Is this the right place?' Gilderoy, having just been woken up from a truly /delightful/ nap thank you very much, took a few seconds to place the man. 'You must be Lupin!' He cried out, adding a bright smile. 'Come in, come in! I've read your cv, truly /impressive/, you managed to last a whole year in Hogwarts! With Sirius Black and all! I taught there myself, just before you. Had to teach Harry Potter how to handle his fame, with that basilisk around too. Nasty business that..' he trailed off, muttering. 'Perfect for the job then, of course. You see, on my travels and, to be honest, quite grand adventures, I need someone to take notes for my books. Can't do that while fighting werewolves, can I?' He shot his new assistant his brightest smile (managed to win /Witches Weekly/ with that! Twice!), who had paled significantly, gaze hardened. 'I taught Harry as well,' he said quietly. 'And I cannot /imagine/ him ever having needed help 'handling his fame'.' He hadn't risen his voice, or seemed angry in any particular way, but Gilderoy felt rebuked/chastised anyway. (He also hadn't failed to notice the use of Harry Potter's first name and wondered how impertinent this young man was - or how close they might be). 'Yes, well, I taught him well, then. Happy to hear it! From your cv I gather you've plenty of experience fighting Dark Creatures (he made sure you couldn't miss the capitals. It was a gift)o you're hired! I'll let you know when we'll be off!'

*** Part 2

It took a few days before a lila-inked letter arrived at Remus' window. They were off, in Mr Lockharts word. Just in case Remus had forgotten what he looked like, he had included a picture with a too-bright smile and a wink. And the letter... sang. Yes, really. Incredibly off-tune too, just to make it worse. Remus was to pack all his belongings and bring plenty of notebooks, ink and feathers. As if he had been planning to go without. They would go to the Alps were apparently there was a zombie-infestation. Well, they went alright, but Lockharts idea of solving the problem was letting the women there chase him and get drunk. The next day, Remust had to use his most icy /aquamenti/ and a glare to match the artic to get him to get up and help a bit, would he? There were zombies to burn. Groaning and muttering about 'spoilsports' and to-bright mountainsun Lockhart followed him up. Remus made sure to be his most annoyingly enthusiastic self, exclaiming about the beautiful day and 'look at that bird!' (shouted carefully in Lockharts ear, of course (who groaned and covered his ears in vain), until they saw their first zombie on the path below. Then Remus stopped his playing around. His face was stony now, with eyes of steel. Gone was the teacher or long-suffering assistant. In it's place; a seasoned warrior who was completely focused on his enemies. He made quick work of the zombies (it was easy, really, with how close they were standing. It only took one spell to light them all on fire), until quite suddenly, he was pushed. Despite his surprise, he managed to remain standing and turned around. Whatever he had expected, it wasn't this; that his boss hung of the rock by the tips of his fingers, and that he was so scared that he almost fainted. Hastily he used the first spell he could remember. 'Wingardium Leviosa!' It was just in time too. As Lockhart let go he floated into the air and on the path again, where he dropped into a dead faint. Remus sighted. This was hardly the hero of the books, but he should probably have expected that by now.

**** As the days passed, Remus began to feel rather like a Jeeves to a Whooster or whatever he was called (Remus didn't remember), except he had been more self-aware. He had to answer fanmail, make his 'lovely tea', arrange meetings and occasionally help confused people out of the door (he always helped them home, although they rarely needed it). When he had time, he let socks disappear, but that was all, as far as pranking went.

(TBC by adding on later)

** To be honest, I'd love to read this just for a chance to see Remus having to take notes about Lockhart defeating that werewolf. Even Remus would find it hard to be polite after having to listen to such nonsense.
