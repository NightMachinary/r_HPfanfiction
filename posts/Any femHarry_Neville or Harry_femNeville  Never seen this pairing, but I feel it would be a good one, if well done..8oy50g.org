  Sometimes life at Hogwarts wasn't all doom and drudgery. This was one of the good times. Fem!Harry. Smut.

*** I don't mind smut, but I was looking for a good novel lenght, maybe more, with character development and romance. If there happens to be a smut, or a hundred, within, I'm ok. Thanks tho.

** Oh, that's something I have never read before EVER! :) But it sounds like it could be pretty interesting! :) Taking their similar backgrounds, their shared prophecy-ness, and the blossoming friendship in OOTP, except you make it continue on into a romantic partnership! :) What if Neville went along on the Horcrux hunt too with her? What if they went to the YULE BALL in 4th year? What if all those instances in year 1, like the broom class incident, the three headed dog stuff, all were what cemented Neville's crushing on her? :) But it isn't really realized until like 4th year?

*** Exactly, and it doesn't have necessarily be Neville as the male, we could have a completely different Longbottom, because being female, Augusta probably wouldn't keep comparing her to her father, so the kid wouldn't have the same personality, which could be a "catalyst" to have a stronger friendship with Harry from the get-go, evolving into a romantic relationship later on.

Its really something I've always wanted to read, there's a few fem!Ron or fem!Draco, but never fem!Neville. And whenever its fem!Harry, its either femSlash or its paired with Cedric, Twins(one or both), Snape or Draco, so it gets stale. No love for Neville.

**** I think I might just store away this idea to write later in my ideas folder! Well, two separate versions of it actually! One with female!harry/normal Neville, and then one with normal harry/female!Neville. :) I think the latter will turn out to be more interesting for me to write. Or at least more challenging, because I'm not really too great at writing guy characters. Especially not if they're the MAIN character - I only write girls, because I'm a girl.

********** Um, no, I don't write stories with a "goal to put any specific characters into a romance." I write stories to write stories. To explore plots and character interactions and worldbuilding fun. My main character is bisexual, and she has been in a few relationships before, and she will go through a few more over the course of the story, but she is just not a romantic type, and she prefers being single and doing what she loves in the world. :) So she will always end up getting out of the relationships eventually, either because she ends them or the other person does. But she does enjoy casual sex, if the time and person is right.

So yes, relationships for her are more like curiosities. Like sampling food.

*** Check another comment from AlmaLamaEmperorKusko and my response, its basically that. It has a load of different opportunities that can make a divergence from canon with next to no effort, while also being something that's rarely, if ever, done. I'm also a huge fan of Neville, but I don't like slash, so I'd never read a Harry/Nev, if there's even one.
