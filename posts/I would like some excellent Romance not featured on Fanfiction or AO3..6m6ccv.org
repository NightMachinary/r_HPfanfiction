So I started reading a few fics on Fanfiction Authors, and I'm enjoying it, I have only been in this fandom for about a year and I'm not familiar with any fiction sites outside of Fanfiction and archive our own, can you guys help by recommending me some excellent romance outside of those two sights? No slash please and I'd prefer long completed stories (long to me being at least 8-10 chapters) and I'd prefer if Harry was the protagonist.

A bit about it: cavity inducing levels of fluff, a lot of cliches (though to be fair this was written before they were cliches) (God level Harry, vela bonds, etc.) Beyond that, no glaring grammatical errors or horrible writting.

** Wish I could help, some of the best sites no longer exists. Have you considered portkey.org as potential site? Only problem there though is they only host specific pairings... as in like four. The site itself is massive, however there may be some site issues as it's not maintained like it used to be.
