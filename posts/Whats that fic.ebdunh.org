:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A while ago (1/1.5+ years ago) I read a fic where harry does drugs with some muggle friends at the park. I know that he has fun at the start however when one of his friends, maybe named danny/daniel might be wrong about that tho, overdoses next to him so harry starts on the road to recovery, visits his parents and does some thing with Sirius. I would like to reread this fic so could someone help me out?


** The only one I know off hand is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5231861/1/10][Harry Potter and the Blazin Goblet]], but I've never made it past Chapter 1, so I can't say much about the plot

** I'm trying to find it- I think I know the one you mean. Is has a character called Summer as well right!? Harry runs away from Hogwarts at some point to hang out with them...

** Okay it's taken a few days but I've finally found it [[https://www.wattpad.com/62300118-hooked-a-harry-potter-story-chapter-1/page/3][here]] I know it used to be on ff .net but I think it's been taken down there!
