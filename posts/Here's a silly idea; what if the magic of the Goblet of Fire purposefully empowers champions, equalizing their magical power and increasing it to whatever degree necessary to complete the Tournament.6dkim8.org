Sort of the opposite of the 'the Goblet takes your magic if you don't compete' cliche that everyone seems to like; instead the Goblet /gives/ you magic to help you compete. It'd make everyone's power level the same so that skill and knowledge are the only deciding factors, AND make the champions powerful enough to beat whatever tasks come their way...think about it, how could a quarter-veela sing a dragon to sleep when it normally takes half-a-dozen wizards to stun them normally?

And! To hamper sabotage and help their training, they'd probably have the power increase outside of tasks as well. So, Crouch-disguised-as-Moody might have enchanted the Triwizard Cup as a portkey, because if he'd tried to kidnap Harry sooner, he'd be hopped up on Goblet power and probably blow up Voldemort and Pettigrew the instant he saw them.

--------------

So, there's an idea for a story; it wasn't Fake!Moody-Crouch who put Harry's name in the Goblet, it was Manipulative!Dumbledore, in order to make Harry temporarily strong enough to beat dragons and giant blast-ended Skrewts and Voldemort and whatever, in order to head off whatever plan Voldy has that year.

And the entire year is Voldemort & Fake!Moody trying to help Harry win as much as possible, because once the tournament is over Dumbles will be on guard again and the best kidnap opportunity is the Triwizard Cup itself, right as the last objective of the tournament (take the Cup) is completed and Harry loses his boost.


** THe problem I always see with stuff like this is the overrepresantation of the goblet. For me the goblet of fire had one and only one function, choose the champion. Periode. It dosen't magical bind anything (atleast not the goblet itself does rather your act of throwing you name in does if you really need the magical binding) and it dosen't hamper with anything else.

But of course anyone can see it diffrent in their fanfic but an additonal problem I see with your idea is the premise of 'magical power'. If you say it empowers the champion you would need to explain the way your magic works thorughtout to make it beliveable. If you can do that, your idea could be worth to explore (maybe except the Dumbledore did it part, that sound mostly lame).

** I think that that was the opposite idea of what the goblet is meant for. It's supposed to only pick those that are Magically 'worthy' (Aka: Those it deems the ablest to compete in the tasks and come out the victor). The point of equalizing the champions is, in fact, pointless after that point, nor do I think an object should be capable of permanently increasing/decreasing a wizard's power for equalization's sake.

That makes absolutely no sense, it's a veela's special ability, they have their own magic just like house-elves and goblins have their own magic. So technically, that Veela part of her allows her to access a wider variety of spells in the fact that she can use Veela-only spells, whereas most wizards are either not capable of accessing such powers or the Veela keep it a 'family secret' and don't allow wizards to learn it.

** If everyone is equal magically what is the fun in watching thr tournament?

Much if Jk's tournament was fun imo because you got to see different champions play to their strengths because of the power differences, as well as finding the "best" wozard. A lot of fanfics (like "the lie i lived") also do something similar (like including dueling). I agree with another commenter that if u add this you should explain more how magic works in your universe and what the draw of the Triwizard Tournament is then.

*** I could see it increasing just the base amount of magic everyone has. So if Harry sucks at transfiguration, he becomes better at it, but is still porportionally inferior to say Cedric, who would have more skill and practice. Sort of forcing the champions to fight smart, and not coast on their innate traits, which would in turn better represent the schools and their education, which would be the deciding factor in a lot of cases.

** I've come to think that the Goblet subtly compels the champions to try to win above there own safety. In Canon Harry is first happy to not be in danger for once, then he decides to play it safe, and then he's trying to beat Cedric to woo Cho who he suddenly has a crush on until after the Tournament.

** I really hate this idea of quantifiable magical power, its basically the idea of some measurable magical core that gives everyone a certain amount of "mana" that they can spend. I don't think it works well with HP's magic, though I have seen it done well in a couple fics.

** That's not a silly idea, but I don't think it is realistic either. What fun would it be to watch champions with equal power? It removes much of the strategy from the competition.

** Then the Champions blow themselves up before even the First Task, unable to deal with the sudden surplus of magical power. Those that survive will tank through the Tasks on power alone without much of a thought.
