  In which Ron realizes that maybe, just maybe, you aren't supposed to feel this way about your best mate. But only after a dance at the Yule Ball, months of being busy with other things, Cedric Diggory's death, the return of Voldemort, and a quiet knock at his door.

** This one Harry has a crush on Ron linkffn(3160424)

I also have this one saved (one of my favs) which again Harry crushes on Ron, but 1st you have to get through a potentially TRIGGERING Harry/Ginny situation. The triggering bit is so rarely talked of from this viewpoint. So Trigger forewarned. Linkao3(13275069) (The trigger one is by: Nahiel)

  Harry told himself that everything was fine in his relationship with Ginny, at least until he couldn't lie to himself anymore. And by then, he thought it might be too late. Fortunately, he has two very good friends who will always be there for him, one of whom might eventually be something more.
