I'm in the mood for something kind of fluffy about Harry finally getting the family he's always wanted.

I'm looking for het here, not mpreg. I don't care if the baby is planned or accidental. Or even if the mother dumps it with him and runs - though I'd prefer him getting to anticipate the birth some; you know - building cribs, discussing names, fetching weird food for cravings. Any pairing really - Ginny's not my favorite, but if the fic's good I'll read it. And not older kids - I want to see him adjust to a new life, a new identity as a father. Although I guess finding out he has a 2-year-old he never knew about might work.

The one I usually read in this mood is linkffn(beltane child by white angel of auralon), but I need more.

And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards"
