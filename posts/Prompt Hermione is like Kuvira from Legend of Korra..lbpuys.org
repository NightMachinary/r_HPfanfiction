OK, so I've kind of been on a LoK kick lately.

This prompt is where Hermione has sniffed too much airplane glue, and now all she can see is martians. OK, not really.

Anyway, I feel like Hermione becoming a dictator-like figure is a decently good idea for an evil!Hermione fic.

My idea is this: Decades into the future, Britain has been thrown into chaos by a worldwide economic catastrophe. The USA is too busy fixing its own problems to worry about anyone else, and Europe is in pretty much the same state as Britain. Now, in this world on fire, the Statute of Secrecy has less been broken and more.....become nonexistent. So, Hermione, who in this world has risen to become a General in the British Military, reunifies the Isle and abolishes both parliament and the monarchy. And like Kuvira, she also has irredentist tendencies, but instead of Republic City, she wants Ireland.

What do you all think?


** Inb4 someone comments on irredentist, Hermione's parents being dentists.

** Okay, wait, exactly how do (seemingly) Muggle economic crashes destroy the Statute of Secrecy?

*** I meant it as more of a list and less of 'this thing caues this thing'. More like, these factors taken together allow for Hermione, or General Granger's rise to power. Also, I think I could say that it takes place in the 2030s, and that in the 2020s, the statute was abolished because it became impossible to enforce in a world full of advanced surveillance technology.
