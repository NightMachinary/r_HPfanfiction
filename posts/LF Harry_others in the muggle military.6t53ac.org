*** While I have been reading Iron Lady for quite a while now and enjoy it immensely (did you see the latest update yesterday?), I must say that it has quite a few grammatical errors that can make it difficult to read.

***** Fair enough--and the fact remains that the plot of Iron Lady is engaging enough that I can ignore the grammar errors.

(For once, it has an independent-minded Harry that is not overpowered. I don't think I've ever seen that before)

**** Thank you! Marriage Law Revolution sounds very familiar, I think I may have read that one. The Thatcher one is intriguing, despite (or perhaps given) my dislike of all things related to the ol' milk snatcher.

***** Yeah, I seriously had no idea how divisive she was as a political figure. Live and learn. She plays a very minor role in the story however.
