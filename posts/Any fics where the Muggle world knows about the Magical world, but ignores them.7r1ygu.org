Maybe because wizards are extremely powerful though fewer in number, and would wipe out the Muggles if provoked. They believe that Muggles are unaware of them, but the Muggles are not only aware, they're pretending the Magical world doesn't exist. Kinda like the Dursleys pretend.

If such a fic exists, please post. If not, here's an idea.


** "Is anybody there?"

"Obligate!"

/completely unaffected/ "Must have been my imagination."

** It was Magical world that forced it's people to observe statue of secrecy. In a logical, sane and rational world that would mean that magical world feels the need to protect the secret of their existence.

Why? I don't know. Logically it could be argued that they were probably afraid. Why? Magical world is really not that powerful.

On side note: Canon implied that muggle authorities were aware of magical world.

Another note: It's caked ministry of magic. I don't know about you but the world I live in usually don't have independent ministries. They are always part of government. Logically it can be said that minister of magic was part of cabinet under Prime Minister of Britain.

Anyway, have fun with you wizard wank.

*** Yes, this is within canon. The British PM is aware of the Ministry, Chapter 2 of HBP deals with that conversation. Which is why I posted this as a fic request. Not just the Muggle authorities, but it's common knowledge that there exists a magical society. Wizards would not be hidden or have Muggle repellent charms or anything, but Muggles avoid obviously magical places anyways because they don't want to mess with wizard. Perhaps some history where the Muggles attempt to show force, but are utterly and easily decimated by a small wizarding force. Wizards don't go out of the way to squash Muggles, just like a human would not ordinarily go out of their way to squash ants.

Hmm. Sounds interesting... I suck at writing but I could give this a shot.
