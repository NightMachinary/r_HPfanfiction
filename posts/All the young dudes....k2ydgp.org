I put ATYD (the song) on my playlist and every time I hear the opening chords I have to stop whatever I'm doing and sit down. Anyone else?

And if you haven't read it, All The Young Dudes by MsKingBean98 on AO3, details the Marauders' lives during and after Hogwarts, with Remus as the MC. Please read it, you'll never regret it. (Yes, you will, but only because it's so amazing it'll make you actually feel emotions)


** lmao yesss. the song is so damn good and catchy, but even singing it in my head makes me emotional :(((
