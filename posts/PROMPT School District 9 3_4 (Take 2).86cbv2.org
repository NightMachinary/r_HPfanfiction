In the Sorcerer's Stone, one of the most magical moments (at least in my opinion) was when Harry first entered Diagon Alley - it was stepping into a whole new world. What if, rather than seeming kind of old-timey medieval styled inside modern society, the WIzarding world looked and functioned like modern society, nested within a Victorian Era society? Imagine a street-urchin eleven-year-old Harry entering /that/ Wizarding World. He would face, not only the usual perils, but those of (shudder) /public education systems/ and /standardized testing/.

Write a scene or story where a Victorian Era Muggle-Raised Harry Potter is introduced to the Wizarding World and/or Hogwarts, or how they would look with modern style regulations and standards.

*Requirements:*

- 200+ words
- Harry was raised Muggle in the Victorian Era
- Harry being introduced to either Hogwarts or Diagon Alley
- Wizarding society closely parallels current modern society

*Bonus Points for:*

- Harry being a cute lil street urchin
- having a seperate Dumbledore for the equivalents of each of his Canon positions (Percival, Wulfric, and Brian Dumbledore)
- Voldemort trying to get the wizarding world to reform the muggle world
- non-OOC Luna Lovegood somehow qualifying as a School Counselor
- Harry being Fostered by the Lovegood family, as he has finally returned to magical society
- Someone is a Steampunk Wizard. Probably the Muggle Studies teacher.
