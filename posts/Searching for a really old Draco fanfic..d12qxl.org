Hi there. I am hoping /someone/ can help me.

Years and YEARS ago I read an amazing, super short fanfic of Draco visiting a cemetery and having flashbacks to his secret relationship with Hermione (I feel pretty certain it was Hermione, but it could have been Ginny). Their relationship was during the war, I think, because they were always hiding and her hands were cold and he was holding her. Then at the end of the story he winds up at her gravestone and is super heartbroken and it was amazing and shocking and I am so mad at myself that I can't remember what it's called or who wrote it.

I know the author was a pretty prolific fanfic writer of various genres/fandoms and in real life she was into LiveJournal and cosplay and was from North Carolina if that sparks anyone's imagination.

I've tried Google, but I just can't seem to find it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!

*** I wish I could remember! I will certainly look for that one, though. Thank you!
