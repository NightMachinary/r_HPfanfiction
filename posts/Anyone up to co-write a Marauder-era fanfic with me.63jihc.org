Premise: Out of detention ideas, Dumbledore tasks the Marauders to open one of the aspects missing from ol' Hogwarts: a wizarding school radio. Why does Minerva look like she's about to burst with anger?

Genre: Parody/ Humour

I was listening to My Brother, My Brother, and Me---a hilarious 'advicecast' done by three brothers---when I got the idea of Dumbledore assigning the Marauders their own wireless network inside Hogwarts.

I have an outline of their show and sample questions they might receive ("How do I become a Death Eater?" "Is it bad to be pregnant at eleven-years old? Asking for a friend." "Why is there a giant squid in the black lake?").

I'd really love to co-write with someone since I'm writing another novel-length fanfic. Not to mention that I have a dry sense of humour and I'm a bit afraid it won't translate well in the story.


** The best britcom is very dry. Just do it as short (300-1000 word) replies to the queries, kind of like a reply from an agony aunt in between chapters.

** Sure thing. Give me a premise and I'll write an episode up for you.

Best to make it a bit of a round robin though. Get as many ff writers interested as you can, assign them prompts/timelines (like 'Hogwarts, 4th year, November') and get them to write it out.

Give me a prompt or an idea and I'll run with it. If you want me to just come up with something myself, okay but it'll take a little longer. PM me with a response either way.
