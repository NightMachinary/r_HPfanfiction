:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Vaguely recall reading this on ff.net sometime last year, no idea who the author is but was fairly long (200-250k word count), was a fairly angsty start but evolved into a lot of fluffiness later

James & Lily survived the attack on Godrics Hollow leading everyone to question how had Voldemort been Vanquished by a Child who survived a Killing Curse

This leads the Unspeakables to investigate where they learn the existence of the still active Prophecy concerning Harry & the Dark Lord, meaning they realise he is still alive

They report the findings to the Minister at the time (cant recall who it was but not Fudge) who upon realising the war was not over like they hoped, authorised the DoM to take Harry and train him to end Voldemort once and for all

Lily, James, Sirius, Remus & Dumbledore are all against this but have the choice taken out of their hands when the Prophecy is leaked in the papers and public demand is for their new saviour to finish the job

The Fic mostly followed Harry as he dealt with Voldemort but also focused upon after, where upon he learns how to live and function in a society that he has never truly been apart of before whilst trying to find his own place in a family that is desperate to have him back yet terrified of what he has been forced to endure & how broken he is by what he has become

Much appreciated if anyone could help me relocate it, thanks


** This is somewhat similar, but probably not the exact fic. linkao3(1149623)

I'd love to see more in this vein, though.

** Seems similar to this one linkffn(Blank Page) but I'm pretty sure it is not the one you are looking for as it is shorter than what you describe and James and Lily were not aware that Harry was alive.

  AU: The black ops program that Harry is part of is dismantled when Fudge is forced to step down. Harry Potter, battle -hardened, privy to the dirty secrets of the wizarding world and accustomed to doing everything under the radar, has to deal with his very much normal life and a family he has been told all his life was dead.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** there's a muggle version...sort of. I /think/ i have it in my old ff.net bookmarks so I'll get it later, but essentially Thatcher and Co. get a hold of him, and while it's not straight up 'child soldier', he is placed with a highly ranked (retired?dont remember) soldier, so he grows up with certain values and morals and mindsets instilled. Was an interesting read, iirc. Never got around to the (Tonks centric) sequel.
