Greetings fellow FlowerPotts....that's the one true ship....but I digress. I've been on a MoD binge lately and I think I've read most of them. However, all of them seem lacking. Does anybody know a fic where Harry is more like the Supernatural Death? Cold, all mighty, and exact.

That portrayal is, perhaps, the best portrayal of Death in any medium and since he's been replaced; I've been itching for more portrayals like that. Thanks a lot fellow FlowerPotts.


** Question! I've been out of the fandom for a long time and have just returned and am struggling with new terms... what is MoD and what is FlowerPotts?

Please and thank you <3

**** That has to be the stupidest thing I read today.

Is it hard to just write Fleur/Harry so the rest of humanity can understand you?

  Loki's in for it now. Odin has had enough and has banished him to Earth to relearn some lessons. Too bad he hadn't paid attention to where Loki ended up. Now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has to deal with memories that aren't his own while he gets his revenge on those who sought to use him as a weapon. Can Harry regain what he lost, or will his past self take control first?

  Sequel to Tricksters and Gods. Loki (currently hiding under his human name Harry Potter) has escaped his part of the universe and has found refuge in a new one. So he tries the world where his favorite book series happens to be set in. The only catch returning home is almost guaranteed to get him killed. Now he has to survive a world where real magic is almost impossible to find.
