Disclaimer: none of this magic is strictly canon, but it's never been said to not be canon, soooo...

Blood has power. Dragon's blood has many uses in potion crafting and enchanting, the blood of a wixen can be used in a vast variety of ways, including rituals and wards. But not many realize that you don't have to /remove/ blood from a subject to use it in a ritual or ward. The Founders did, however, and used that to fashion the greatest wards in Britain around Hogwarts castle.

The living blood of students moving through its walls power the many protective enchantments on the school. When a particular area of the wards needs more blood to remain effective, the castle simply rearranges its geometry slightly to force students into the problem area. In this way, the wards remain strong enough to repel any assault, and keep students from suffering injury or death, whether to accident or malicious action.

The only time these wards weaken is when the students are not permitted to wander the halls, say if the teachers decide that all students must remain in their common rooms or be evacuated entirely. Unfortunately, the Founders never told anyone of this weakness, for fear it would be exploited.

Just a random idea I had, thinking about world building for a fic I may or may not get around to writing.


** My mind went to Salazar adding the living blood of the basilisk to the wards as his own kind of fail safe. A fail safe that could also attack whatever may be a threat.

** Cool interpretation! My personal head-canon which I use when writing fanfics:

During the early years after founding Hogwarts, the Founders quickly learned that having students running around a Muggle-constructed castle led to all sorts of structural damage and injuries. Once the student body grew enough, the Founders found themselves spending more time repairing damage and adding or renewing protective Charms all over the castle than actually teaching. They knew something had to be done.

Rowena, as usual, came up with a brilliant solution. Normally, the Charms used to protect physical objects from magical damage worked by redirecting the destructive magical energies into the Void - the same place Vanished objects go. Rowena found a way to instead capture the energy in the object itself, essentially turning it into a kind of magical battery. The protective Charm would sustain itself off the captured energy, never needing to be manually renewed by a staff member.

While this worked extremely well, it led to a problem. Casting this protective Charm throughout the entire castle turned it into a giant magical battery, but it stored more energy than it expended maintaining the protective charms cast on it. Eventually, the castle would become "over-charged," leading to unpredictable magical occurrences when the excess energy discharged, including the manifestation of Peeves the Poltergeist.

The solution the Founders came up with was to have the Castle automatically spend excess energy in harmless reconfigurations of the structure of the building, since this was something they were already using this energy to aid in when they needed to reconfigure or expand the castle when accommodating the ever-growing student body.

** Thats a pretty neat idea, it does also reflect well with the whole blood wards thing going on with the Durslies. After all, it IS their living blood within their bodies that powers those. Uh those are canon right?

*** See, I've always interpreted that with blood as a metaphor for a familial relationship, because the most powerful magic (specifically spells) in Harry Potter doesn't seem to come from any physical objects, but the emotions behind it. Trust for the Fidelius, happiness for the Patronus, Hatred for the /Avada Kedrava/, and so on.

**** It could be both, but I feel like if it was solely an emotion based ward, it would have fallen within a year or two, if it could even be established. No doubt the original protection was very much emotional (lily-harry), but the version that was slapped onto the Durslies MUST have relied significantly on the blood relation itself rather then the familial relation.

*** "I despise the term Wixen though, it's a stupid ass term." See, as someone who identifies outside the gender binary, I personally really like it. It doesn't conform to social ideology behind witch or wizard, though witch is the technical term for anyone who uses magic, not necessarily someone who is female. It's easier to say when referring to witches and wizards, without having to exclude as well. You could say "magic users" or "user of magic", but that seems long, don't you think? ~ Erin

** My first thought was menstruation and how it would work to fuel the wards or school... I have a theory that Hogwarts is protected as it is because of blood wards and the land itself is saturated by magic and had taken a 'sentient' sort of flair due to children's magic. Who's to say blood rituals were seen as 'notmal' back in the day compared to the current climate where it's considered dark and evil.

Funny thought: can you imagine that the school siphens the kids magic? Like it absorbs the accidental magic? Eleven doesn't keep it from happening like emotional outbursts/puberty and the school is geared to take advantage of such a thing.

** One fanfic that I wrote but never got around to publishing had the rearranging geometry of the castle be an emergent thing, a product of a thousand years of staff and students modifying the castle, rather than it being something planned by the founders. And then the castle went a little mad...

Remember how the flying car developed something of a personality of its own after just one man enchanted it? Imagine that happening to Hogwarts, but with the combined influence of every witch and wizard that has ever modified it, /ever./

The halls near the entrances and the sections originally built by the founders are the most stable, existing (mostly) in real space and made out of real materials. But, as you get further and further into expanded spaces and more remote places, you start finding hallways that Hogwarts itself built out of an effort to be helpful. But, with thousands of conflicting ideas on what's actually useful, the rooms get a little insane. Imagine a maze of hallways going nowhere, a classroom a kilometer long, two dozen bathrooms linked together in sequence, broom closets that teleport you to other closets, rooms where the furniture grows out of the walls like cancer, rooms that are upside down or twist about, rooms where gravity itself isn't constant, rooms that fractally repeat infinitely in one direction but are finite in the opposite direction, rooms filled with water, rooms filled with potions, rooms that look like they're outdoor spaces, rooms made of flesh, and so much more.

If it wasn't obvious, that fic had a heavy dose of lovecraft-style worldbuilding injected into it. I may revisit it and publish it one day.

*** I always imagined it a bit like this, but also including the fact that the castle found and converted into Hogwarts not built to house it, so even the bits that are working correctly were never intended for the use they now have. I personally always thought it weird that apparently four people could build an entire castle much larger than the school would ever need even after a thousand years and this would neither be remembered as an amazing achievement in its own right and yet nothing else like it has been built since in Britain.

** It would also help explain how the Wards don't seem up to scratch in canon. Say that there's a minimum amount of foot traffic required for the Wards to get their daily fix, an amount that's been met since the days of the founders thanks to a stable pattern of population growth in the magical world. As magic advances and the Wards & enchantments are forced to deal with tracking more and more variables (types of magic, objects etc), the higher energy requirements are easily met by the increased number of students and staff circulating the grounds.

However, with the recent disruption in the form of a decades-long civil war lowering both student numbers and discouraging a more convoluted traffic pattern due to monitoring concerns, the Wards have to shed complexity to compensate. In other words, the lower numbers have forced the Wards to retain stability by becoming simpler and thus less effective or more overbearing over time. This would have allowed anomalies such as a group of pranksters effectively setting up a school wide monitoring enchantment with no blowback from said Wards and a slew of different creatures & villains to enter the grounds unopposed.

** Very clever!

I don't know if you've read the Sword of Truth series but this exact idea is used in that. The Palace was designed with pathways in a specific manner and people would be traversing them daily for their prayers and work. The net result was that the Lord had immense power while in his castle while other magic users felt their powers being significantly weakened. This contributed strongly to the Palace's defense, if I remember right.
