What 4 fics show the best qualities of the house the protagonist is in. For Ravenclaw I think Methods of Rationality and Hufflepuff I think It's not a stick : a wand crafter's story. As for Slytherin I have a hard time picking one because I don't see many fics that have the full scope of Slytherin in protagonist. It is either just an edgelord or borderline Hufflepuff. Slytherin should be cunning, resourceful, and ambitious. Not sociopath. Ambition doesn't mean take over the world, it is having goals and doing whatever it takes to complete them. Also people really need to read Watership Down to understand how cunning is not immoral. Having a resourceful character is a fun read, since you can see how they improve their situation by using what's available and having a unique solutions. I might just be reading the wrong fics. As for Gryffindor I don't really read Gryffindor fics.


** Well for Hufflepuff, It's .[[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die&ved=2ahUKEwjfg6y8odftAhXAyDgGHU7cCsoQFjAAegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw3bGwVnua_7nM4eeutfWRmg&cshid=1608285300589][Too Young to Die]]

*** No way, I just tried to read that and had to give up and skip to the end when Harry had sex at 11 years old in Chapter 3. Was that really necessary for the plot?!

I'd say the best Hufflepuff Harry is that semi-crack fic where he finds as many loopholes as he can to be as lazy as possible, it's absolutely hilarious.

**** You have to trust me on this, It is quite good and as far as I remember this is probably the only sex scene (Not even explicit.) in it.

** The Pureblood Pretense has a Slytherin MC that embodies those characteristics well
