** Culture Shock was incredible. It led me to the Culture series.

When you read the Culture, you'll understand why Harry compares the Sorting Hat to rape. In a world where sanctity of the mind is held in the highest regard, where your memories and thoughts are the only thing you truly own, someone rifling through your mind without your consent would indeed be as bad as rape.

I've not found a sci-fi fic anywhere near Culture Shock's calibre. And the Culture has to be my favorite sci-fi series.

*** Damn you meddling kids for stealing my prized arguments. anyways aside from reiterating the above comment I shall also add that you basically made a request for something before ruining your request. you took the two most important aspects of culture and a culture/hp cross and ruined them. You took culture which is a highly advanced society and asked a member of said society not to rationalize "magic" at all, like not even try, and then as tusing said think that taking the sorting hat/legillimancy and decided to not equate that to rape or some other heinous crime where you have a highly advanced rational society wherein the most important thing about oneself is not their body nor possessions but their mind. Besides where magic is *mind* over not only matter but reality itself the invasion and violation of said mind should be looked upon by any rational as a heinous act of the highest degree akin to rape and murder being the violation of the body and soul.

Mind, Body, and Soul, are the most important things to both and reasonable person with a shred of self worth.

Then again, maybe you are of different opinion not being able to have your mind violated and having the violation of the soul as something that, not having anyone to tell of the experience, seem inconsequential.

edit: removed shitpost from shitpost and got a legitpost? what the hell did I just do.

**** Elon Musk already gives his spacecraft the names of Culture minds. He's also researching the idea of a neural lace. It's clear that the Culture has influenced him immensely.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6562075/1/Isis-s-Bane-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire][Isis's Bane And The Goblet Of Fire]] is a HP/Stargate crossover which has a not-dissimilar setup and has actually been completed: a 14yo Harry is summoned to Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament after growing up fighting go'a'uld, practicing wandless magic, and acquiring technology. It's readable. Maybe read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4564625/1/Isis-s-Bane][Isis's Bane]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4564882/1/Isis-s-Bane-Tar-Chell-s-Wrath][Tar'Chell's Wrath]] first (previous stories which explain how he got there). linkffn(6562075;4564625;4564882)

** What about linkffn(I Still Don't Know What I'm Looking For by kathryn518)?

Its a Star Wars crossover, with the typical Magic = The Force spiel, but a Harry who makes quite clear that if anything, The Force is only a very small part of Magic. It has some great character, for the price of being /reeeeeally/ slow.

A great fic, but unfortunately (at least for me) written in first person, is linkffn(The Havoc Side of the Force)

You could give linkffn(The Difference One Can Make) a chance. Its a GoT - or rather an ASOIAF crossover which doesn't shy away from explaining the stuff found in Westeros to you.

I don't know any crossovers with Culture, but maybe these strike your fancy?

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
