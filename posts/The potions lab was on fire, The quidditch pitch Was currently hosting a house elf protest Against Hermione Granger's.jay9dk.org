The potions lab was on fire, The quidditch pitch Was currently hosting a house elf protest Against Hermione Granger's Ever worsening Crocheting techniques, and The weasley twins had Scaled the astronomy tower to get a better view of the festivities

Victor Krum had taken the Daily prophet Articles at face value, and challenged Harry Potter a duel. THE Slytherins and half the school Were cheering on the Bulgarian , As the 2 boys became combatants Each assuming a dueling position preparing to cast, until all hell broke loose

Ron Weasley while the currently not on speaking terms with his previous best friend had set The Abraxans horses loose , And the giant wined horses Stampeded towards the crowd.

Causing most of the spectators and both the duellists to scatter for shelter. As the cries of terror and Exasperation had filled the air, The twins were delighted to note that Hermione Granger had found her boyfriend In the chaos dragging him off towards the forest while tearing his a new one for believing such nonsense.

Some enterprising sixth year decided it would be a good idea to Transfigure a golem, To corral The horses...

Which just added a new layer to the problem

The spectators in the astronomy tower started passing around the popcorn and chocolate Eagerly anticipating the next chapter in the unfolding disaster

As the golem somehow procured a large Tree Branch capable of dealing a bit of damage Harry Potter was dragged inside a well fortified green house along with a few of the other students.

Neville Longbottom Was randomly sticking his arm out the window and seizing anything he came across, Pulling a student in towards safety among the clay flowerpots.

Harry went to help with the rescue operation not even daring to inquire why Susan Bones felt the need to blush. Or why She and Neville had been in the greenhouse to begin with ... But he wasn't being trampled thanks to his friend so he really didn't feel like asking at the moment
