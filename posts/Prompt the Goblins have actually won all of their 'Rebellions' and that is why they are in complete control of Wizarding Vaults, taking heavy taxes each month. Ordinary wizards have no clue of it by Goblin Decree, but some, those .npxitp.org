#+TITLE: Prompt: the Goblins have actually won all of their 'Rebellions' and that is why they are in complete control of Wizarding Vaults, taking heavy taxes each month. Ordinary wizards have no clue of it by Goblin Decree, but some, those who know the truth, wish to fight back.

I was thinking Harry or maybe Hermione could find out that the real war Voldemort is fighting is against Goblin oppression, and the pure-blood cause is Goblin Propaganda.


** This feels very Protocols of the Elders of Zion, ngl.

“The +Jewish+ goblin bankers run the world (never mind the actual signs of their oppression, like the Wand Ban) and are suppressing the truth. We're just trying to overthrow our secret rulers!”

*** Damn, I didn't think about the analogies that could be pointed to with this prompt. I can assure you I meant to portray nothing of the sort.

The idea actually comes from Binns always talking about Goblin Rebellions, with the term Rebellion and not Revolution implying that the Goblins were defeated in the end. Well, I thought, what if they hadn't been and the British Wizards are just meant to believe that?

So yeah, nothing more than a little idea that popped into my head here with absolutely no allusions to the Jews intended.

**** Yeah. It's nothing on you, and I hope I didn't come off as accusatory or anything. I've got a stack of ideas that sound cool but one day made me go “Wait a minute...”

(In my youth, I didn't always hit that point before I'd actually written the damn thing, but I think I've been able to scour the Web of any trace of those stories lol)
