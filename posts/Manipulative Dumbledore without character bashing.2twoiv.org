I was reading through the thread on character bashing, and was wondering if there were any examples of a cruel or manipulative Dumbledore that isn't set up as a strawman, or maybe Harry cutting ties with one of his friends because they have been legitimately awful but are still fleshed out and are well portrayed.

I'm looking for thoughtfully written, fleshed out characters. Stories don't need to be novel length, but preferably complete.


** A Well Groomed Mind is probably the best here.

*** Great rec! About halfway through it. I don't think I've ever seen this kind of Dumbledore portrayed so well.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking-Control][Taking Control]] does this pretty well, unfortunately the sequel is unfinished and probably never will be.

** Try Harry James Pettigrew, that's what I was going for at least. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3896602/1/Harry-James-Pettigrew]]
