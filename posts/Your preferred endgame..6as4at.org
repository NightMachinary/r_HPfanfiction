Reading so many unfinished stories, it occurs to me that many writers may be gunshy about coming up with an ending simply because they don't know how to end it. For many stories, it's obvious that the writer had what they considered to be a fun concept, and perhaps they had some really cool scenes they wanted to show, but few if any fixate on the wrap-up. I've also seen a number of popular stories lose fans because the ending was too quick, too long, weak, or inconsistent with the rest of the story.

So here's my question: what do you consider to be a good ending? Which stories had good endings and what about them made it work?


** The endings are the hardest parts simply because there has to be such a balance. My personal preferences change depending on my mood but in general there needs to be a balance between 'fairness' and 'real'. People like justice but not if it breaks their immersion. There also needs to be a balance between closure and potential. Ambiguity is often done poorly. Epilogues can make or break endings, they reduce potential but reinforce potentially disliked ideas. Would the main series have been better without the epilogue, I think quite possibly judging purely by the number of people who felt the need to write EWE stories.

I think TE7 has an interesting balance in their stories between ambiguity and actually ending the story. I've heard that the story's ending should be the first thing written and that JKR had the ending in a safe so someone else could finish it if she died. As OP said, so often fanfics are build around an idea rather than a plot. This means the ending is weaker since they aren't sure what they are ending.

*** I don't think a story should wrap of every detail of a character's life with a pretty little bow. At some point, the story that the writer wanted to tell will be over, that point is very rarely the end of a character's life.

I feel like the best ending is a bit unsatisfying because stories should be true to life and life can be unsatisfying. But there's something learned or developed that makes the character better off than they were before.

I personally like there to be a sense of life going on, with the possibility of more adventures in that world, more or less. I like endings to things like The Dresden Files where each book works as a stand alone, but there's the promise of more.

Now I'm never really going to write a sequel to fanfiction, but I don't think that means that every detail of the future should be settled by the end of a fic.

Of course I tend to blow it by going and writing fluffy epilogues because that amuses me.

I don't write endings before the rest of the story. But I do plan it completely before I write it. So I know how it will end. And I've actually already written the epilogue of my current fic, despite there being quite a few chapters left in the fic itsself.

**** You definitely hit unsatisfying in the best possible way. Its not a blunt 'the end' but it stays with you. In the nicest way possible your endings are never my favourite so far as giving me the warm fuzzies but they stick with you which is why I cited you as the most interesting. You really do capture the story is over but life goes on vibe.

** My fav ending is probably Starfox's Patron. HG wins, kept her principles, and didn't have to kowtow to the bloodpurists. Also: good fight/battle just before that.

Also liked the ending for nonjon's Black Comedy; crazy party just seemed appropriate.

** Hrm. Really depends on the tone of the fic as a whole. Fics that are focused primarily on a relationship end strongest on a scene that is strong there - but many authors end up just writing a dry or forced genealogy of the next couple of generations, which is just a list of names that the reader has no connection to. Ending on a wedding, scene of birth of a child, etc. Gets points because family is HP's canon one true desire (Erised).

Fics focused on the political side (reform wizarding world) could end on some kind of 'mission accomplished'-implying scene. Again, it is easy to be either heavy-handed or boring.

Munchkin or Merlin-level!HP fics, in my opinion, can end in scenes that imply at least the possibility of the first stages of eternal technomagical utopia.

I utterly detest without reservation the ones that end with HP dieing of old age peacefully and reuniting with his family. It does provide cheap feels-bearing closure, but as a sworn anti-Death activist, such endings stick in my craw. Rage, rage against the dying of the light!

** Personally, I don't start writing a story unless I have a pretty definitive end game already plotted out. I can safely say for Harry Potter and the Iron Lady that I have a very clear ending planed out, and have have even fiddled with writing a rough draft (though I'm sure things will have to change) for the conclusion of Harry's arc and the story of how the muggles got smart.

For Red Headed Stepchild, I know exactly what the last scene and joke will be, though the story doesn't end so much as I stop writing. The Weasley family will continue to get up to shenanigans for a very long time indeed.

For a Ballad of Wolves and Serpents, I have a bittersweet, triumph from the ashes kind of ending planned. Sure, a lot of heart ache will have happened, but in the end the world will be a better place.

** Often times I'd be happy for the basics. To steal from Jim Butcher- A good ending is one that answers (during the climax) the story question. Hopefully in a meaningful way.

When [story changing event] [the protagonist] sets out to [accomplish goal]. But will he succeed when [antagonist(s)] gets in his way and tries to stop him?

Many fanfics have the story changing event and protagonist but a wishy washy goal and a inflatable doll of an antagonist or an impersonal one. What this does is undermine their own Protagonist and Event (which itself may not be so clear- ex. time travel... nothing/little changes).

In addition most fanfics are, with rare exceptions, posted while being written/before being completed. Therefore, especially for those who discovery write, they lack the opportunity to go back and drop a line to connect and refine the thrust of the story to the climax (story answer).

A good ending is one that matters (to the reader and protagonist both), one that the Protagonist has worked for, one that the antagonist is at odds with (which can be a good guy like The Fugitive), and one that is clearly defined- what are the stakes, why does it matter.

There can be a lot going on, but there is strength in simplicity. What's the saying- No plan survives contact with the enemy? Well I'm not saying be boxed in, and writers bridle at sticking to rules and structure, but personally when I've ignored keeping it in mind it's lead to frustration. Frustration in trying to tie things together and make it all work and move to where I wanted it to go. Largely because it wasn't explicitly defined.

counter-examples:

Harry wakes up realizing he's gone back a year. Can he, will he, be able to change anything second year?

There will be an answer, probably 'yes', but it isn't an explicitly defined concrete goal. The pieces probably won't be set up right away, and the shape of the ending won't come until late and may be blurry, thus losing build up, momentum, and clarity.

Harry wakes up to find it's July, of last year, with the Chamber, Diary, and basilisk looming. Harry will stop at nothing to ensure the real monster behind the attacks, Lucius Malfoy, is imprisoned for his crimes. But can he gather the proof and bring it to light against the connected Governor of Hogwarts and the dark oaths, secret dealings, and favours at his command?

(helpful summary material too)

Here it is much clearer what the overall goal is, what is standing in his way, and the possible answers of 'Yes, Lucius Malfoy is imprisoned' or 'No, Lucius Malfoy's too slippery'. It's specific and the author can't help but drive clearer to the outcome. It also helps give the author an idea for an immediate specific goal. And therefore a relevant scene, which helps motivate the writing, to begin weaving towards a meaningful ending. Which is a good ending in my book.

*** I found jo's ending utterly depressing - all I felt was 'nothing has changed'. The wizarding world is as isolated as it ever was, HP has not progressed in slaying Death, instead turning to utmost evil by accepting it, Hermione is with someone I utterly detest, bloody vengeance has not been wrought, and the 'one big family' is mush far too sickly-sweet to be permissible in this or any world. Also, I dislike both Albus and Severus as human beings, so it irked me that HP would name someone as such, and furthermore, it puts such a huge burden on the poor kids shoulders. It would be like.... a devout socialist naming a kid Lenin Marx. (as at best, they had some nice ideas, but did and advocated things that are at best eurgh (I was going to do mathematicians, but I'd like more than me and two others to get the reference easily)).

**** I feel the same.

But in order to say something positive: I think she did the right thing by not making Harry win by magical prowess but by force of will. I think that was a very strong message - if it hadn't been ruined by the whole "setting up the pig for slaughter" and martyrdom dealio. Instead of being uplifting it makes Harry's sacrifice really seem like an indoctrinated child, who has nothing left to live for and who always feels like he has to prove himself to others: His final resolve - while righteous - feels wrong. He's doing the right thing for the wrong reasons... he doesn't even get a proper choice anymore after his fate as a Horcrux is revealed to him at such a crucial moment. No chance to really get over the shock and evaluate other options, no, you've got to sacrifice yourself because that's your destiny and what else is a freak like yours good for than making sure everyone else gets to have their happily ever after.

Even the actual Christian Messiah at least gets to be a little bit afraid and sad about it in the New Testament. Harry, like the perfect brainwashed child just marches towards his Death, not even asking if maybe they could find a way so that he might live.

**** A good ending ties up the main storyline, hammers home the themes of the story, and has a tone consistent with the whole of its work.

The above is why I have problems with Rowling's epilogue. It hits point one, but two misses the bullseye -- and three is complete misfire. Part of the problem with the ending is that it was apparently written/conceived at an earlier stage, which shows in its tonal inconsistency. An ending like that would fit if the series had ended at /Prisoner of Azkaban/, but not after. The series just grows too much for it to transition smoothly into something so happy and neat. (It also feels like it was slapped on in order to keep people from asking Rowling for more adventures in Potterland, but that didn't work out so well.)

The other half of the problem is that the epilogue ignores the messages that occurred as the series went on -- you can't trust authority (MoM), victory comes at a cost (Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, etc.), no one and nothing is perfect (Dumbledore, the magical world) -- in favor of something that stuck a neat little bow on everything.

It would have been more satisfying to have either left off at the last proper chapter or come up with something that combined the lighter tone of the first few books with the increasingly darker tone of the later ones. A bittersweet epilogue instead of a sweet one.

** I don't like "the end" endings, but more along the lines of "what's next?"

The ending of the HP series was an ending of finality. Plain and simple.

I like them to be shown in a future setting, but to be shown in what they're currently doing and the effects of their previous strife. So instead of ending with that line about Harry's scar having not hurt for 17 years, maybe it alludes to the trio about to set off on a new adventure. The best stories to me are the ones that never truly end.

** For me, it stems from the pairings I prefer to read (which is Hermione/Charlie). Almost all of the stories focused on that pairing end happily (with Hermione and Charlie together, married, and with children). in fact, the majority of their stories are very...simple, which I find slightly disappointing. (Also, a good amount of stories involving Charlie and Hermione pose Charlie as a Christian Gray-like character which I detest!) Therefore, the endings of a Hermione/Charlie romp are happy and simple, though with very little substance.

I would prefer endings that were more complex (though that stems from whether or not the story itself is complex), while not detailing EVERYTHING that happens (a happens because b happens which is because c takes place...and it equals z). I also like endings where happy endings isn't a forgone conclusion, but more of a reality (i.e. not everyone gets what they want with whom they want at the end of a story).

I would say that a fair share of stories I've come across don't have particularly strong endings, but instead have endings that satisfy what the story entailed for it it do. I've rarely come across endings that I feel are completely justifiable, in which I close the tab with a smile on my face; my reaction is more of an "Eh, the ending could've been better."

** A lot of fics have trouble sticking the ending. Why? Well, one of the biggest factors is that a lot of writers seem to work with chapter by chapter plotting rather than outlining the thing in one go. Having an outline keeps track of chapters and keeps the tone consistent. (Or, if not an outline, then a thorough summary of previous chapters will help tremendously.)

Another reason is that the plot can get too big, which, again, is easier to deal with when you have an outline to tweak into a new story or to keep you on course.

The last factor is one of experience -- the more you write, the more likely it is that you will come up with the ending of the story long before you start writing the final chapters. You get a hang of act structures without needing to look them up every five seconds. You know the beats of your genre. You've done this before.

It's very easy to tell the above factors in the first few chapters of a fic. It's very hard to find something written to that level, but it's out there. Basically, I like tonal consistency and consistent plotting in my endings.

** I tend to have a liking for slightly (or majorly) downer endings. I'm not against a happy ending, but unless the entire fic was pure, conflict-less fluff, it feels dishonest to end it on a perfect note. That's why I'm also not huge on the canon ending. The last line, "all was well," strikes me as a lie. How can all be well after the events of the books?

In short, it boils down to an ending that is consistent with the tone of the story. If I'm reading a story that's dark and gritty, you can't drastically change the tone to provide a perfect closure for the ending, much as you may feel--and I may agree--that the characters deserve it for all the hardships they've faced.
