The fanfic had a massive AU theme and I remembered reading it in FFnet. I remembered some things but I really forgot the title.

1. HP was summoned during GoF timeline.
2. HP is very powerful (almost god-like), and was able to summon his friends/companions. He could also sense the presence of other poweful beings in the universe he was in.
3. Had Fate/Stay Night elements in it.
4. HP picked a fight with Jormungandr/some giant serpent.
5. Had some harem feel in it.
6. Manipulative!Dumbledore, but HP was so powerful he couldn't even start.
7. HP and companions aware of multiple universes.
8. James and Lily alive. (?)
9. I also remember an angel-like character serving HP.

I'm a bit distracted with searching for it so any help would be great. Thank you!

*** Since it had Fate/Stay Night characters, I think Irisviel and Ilyasviel were in it.
