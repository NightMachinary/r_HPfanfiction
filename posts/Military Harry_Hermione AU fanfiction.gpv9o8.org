:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a HP fanfic, this is what I remember:

I read it on the ff site

Harry helps a neighbour/old man who possibly is in wheelchair during a summer, possibly when being 16 or 17, and the old man takes Harry to a golf/military hang out and lends Harry clothes to pass as a waiter/respectable young man. At this event Hermione appears, I thiiink she is related to the old man.

H/H become a couple plus take on the wizard world a la muggle military style

Anyone who knows which fanfic this is?


** Yeah I think this might be it

**** I was going to link that same fanfic until I actually read that description, then noticed the mention of helping an old man over the summer, and I'm like, "Nope. That's not the one I was thinking of."

If it is, you either tried to link to the wrong website or the wrong ID. On FFN it's this:
