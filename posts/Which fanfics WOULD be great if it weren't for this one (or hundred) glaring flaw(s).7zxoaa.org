** The Rune Stone Path would have been so much better without Daphne Greengrass and the whole Pureblood multiple wife/consort/mistress thing. Instead of the weird "welcome to the love group which is NOT a harem" thing, a simple "two couples decided to have sex together and slowly develop attachments" would have worked better instead.

*** While I'm not against harems of reasonable size where each girl has her own story time, I agree that The Rune Stone Path could be better.

I didn't like two things in it.

The first one is that Tonks was included out of nowhere - as I remember she didn't have any bonding experience with Harry before.

The second one is that the author was afraid of sex scenes almost until the very end. I think it's either you're writing them or not writing. Something between looks very frustrating in M rated story.

**** The problem with sex scenes is that technically M-rated means suitable for sixteen years and above, which is further complicated by different definitions of suitable for 16. For example, Americans won't blink an eye at excessive violence but cannot show much in the direction of sex. Meanwhile, in Germany most softcore porn is rated for sixteen years while violence is frowned upon. So how to write a good sex scene within these constraints?

***** I think the amount of sex in fanfiction is a separate big topic. Personally for me it's strange when writers are more comfortable with violence than with healthy sex.

In The Rune Stone Path the author started writing them at the end. Before it was just frustrating teasing. It seemed like she did want to write them but wasn't sure in the result, so she didn't.

***** Yeah I am with you, the problem I find there is very little romance and a huge fuckload of shipping, which boils down to the author declaring that these 2 characters who have never spoken in the canon are now totally in love because they're both gorgeous and looked at each other twice while doing something cool. I think just about every single one of my favourite stories either has no romantic subplot at all, or some characters occasionally hook up but its skimmed over in a paragraph because its irrelevant to the larger narrative. I think I would really struggle to find a story that I could point to and say "there, that is a good example, learn from them".

** Countless fics would be tremedously better if the authors didn't feel the need to insert some ship aka. """romance""" into it.

If you want romance, write romance. But don't just shoehorn in some paragraphs about kisses and think thats all it takes to make a good relationship sideplot.

linkffn(Wind Shear) had so much potential, but it's almost as if the author was afraid the fic would become too interesting. I feel like if the author committed to what he wrote, and the situations he created, we'd have out hands on a great piece of fanfiction, but like this it will always just be a massive tease in fic-form.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** Imo Prince of Slytherin does a better job of taking all those shitty tropes and making them less shitty or at least make more sense, where as Den of Snakes has all those shitty tropes, and they still suck. But I agree it does have a tighter narrative vs Prince's cluster of too many side plots, and is well written enough that it's still a good fic even with all the shitty tropes and slytherin/pureblood culture wanking and annoying dumbledore/ron bashing.

Not sure which I enjoy more, I haven't actually read much of book 3 of Prince yet which seems like it was ramping up the side plots.

However I actually was thinking of mentioning Den of Snakes for this topic, with the glaring flaw being those tropes.

***** That's true, Den of Snakes definitely isn't attempting to subvert them, it uses them completely unironically. I just prefer the subversion approach Prince uses as I find a lot of those tropes annoying, especially the 1 dimensional characterizations, and they are my least favorite part of Den of Snakes. For example James action towards Sirius that came out in the most recent chapter aren't believable imo. The justification for what James did is absurd.

I am however curious. It's clearly inspired by Prince of Slytherin so the author has obviously read that. I wonder if it's a reaction to that, since the author likes all the tropes Prince subverts and wanted to write a similar story that just had them all normally, or if the author didn't realize what Prince was doing with the tropes, an just wanted to write a similar story and missed that part.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** I think the first bit of speech by Voldemort perfectly explains what to expect from "Bellatrix's second chance". It's incredibly off-character. Voldemort doesn't use plebeian speech like "piece of shit" and he certainly doesn't say "but, nooooo...". Voldemort is well spoken, educated and holds himself to high standards regarding his language. This miss-characterisation just drags through the fic (at least the chapters I read).
