****** I'm still compiling information, but here's things typical of the upper class Victorian society:

- Whitened front steps for nicer houses.
- Rooms dedicated to showing off your vast collections (like the drawing room in Grimmauld Place).
- Extravagant hats for women (like the one Neville's grandmother wears) and top hats for men.
- Sentiment rings. Men gave these to the women they loved. (I think they're similar to promise rings (i.e., pre-engagement rings) but I'm not sure.)
- If the funeral was held at home, then it was an open-casket service. If it was at a church, then usually the casket was closed. (Don't ask me why.)
- Rose-scented perfumes
- Lots of men smoked pipes and cigars.
- Herbal soaps
- Scented ink

Most of this was taken from one site, and the author seemed to be American, so I'm not sure how much is applicable to Victorian England. However, I think wizarding society would be more like that era than the earlier ones.

******** *Anglo-Zanzibar War*

The Anglo-Zanzibar War was a military conflict fought between the United Kingdom and the Zanzibar Sultanate on 27 August 1896. The conflict lasted between 38 and 45 minutes, marking it as the shortest recorded war in history. The immediate cause of the war was the death of the pro-British Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of Sultan Khalid bin Barghash. The British authorities preferred Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan.

** I'm a fan of fics that explore pureblood culture, but leaving out all the usual tropes from those, there are a few fanon traditions that I liked because they fit well or were original.

- In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] it's a coming-of-age tradition (going out of fashion in modern times) for young wizards to design and create their own custom magical trunk. They would then expand and adjust this trunk to fit their needs throughout their lives. I like this idea because it would fit well with what we see of Newt's trunk in the recent movies.

- In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12157995/1/Tom-Just-Tom][Tom, Just Tom]] Hermione researches the traditional magic of familiars in America, such as a potion that can allow the witch or wizard to hear their familiar's thoughts. She adapts a ritual that was commonly used to move an aging familiar's mind into a new body. This seems like an incredibly creepy idea, but I could see it being the norm in some wizarding communities.

*** I know tons of people HATE the expanded trunk thing but even though I roll my eyes a bit when I read it (especially as part of a pre-Hogwarts shopping trip) I still love the idea of them, even though (like someone mentioned below) they're supposed to be restricted, usage-wise. I've always kind of headcanon-d that that's one of the more regularly ignored laws. If you break it, it's just a fine, and the only reason you'd get caught doing it in the first place is if you massively mucked it up or someone told on you. I can see a luggage shop being given a license or a permit or whatever anyway though.

The second... ugh, I'm sorry but I have an intense GRRR-reaction to anyone mentioning "familiars" in the Potterverse. Nagini was a one-off deal, okay? (And per more recent canon she's not even really a snake at all, without even going into the fact that Potterverse snakes aren't really animals to begin with.) The others are /pets/, no more, no less.

**** I enjoy fics that stray far from canon, so I've never seen that as a disqualifier if an idea is executed well.

Regarding familiars, JKR's series incorporates many 'pop culture' ideas about witches from history (i.e. riding brooms, using cauldrons, historical witch trials, skinwalkers, etc.) People were accused of having familiars during the Salem Witch Trials in real life, so I don't think it's a stretch to incorporate them as a outmoded historical tradition for American wizards/witches.

I agree that it's silly to call something a familiar if it's just a slightly more intelligent pet, like in canon. However, I would enjoy reading a fic in which witches/wizards have a mental bond with an animal in a way that actually impacts their magic.

***** Oh, I enjoy /intentional/ AUs --- but, rather like "magical exhaustion" or pureblood Lordships, one gets the overwhelming impression that a lot of people who refer to Hedwig or Crookshanks as "familiars" aren't really /aware/ that they're straying from canon. Perhaps /Dodging/ isn't one of them, but it's the reason why I recoil at the idea so.

****** To be honest, I've never read a fic in which those pets were called familiars, though I have seen some with passages that specifically point out Hedwig /isn't/ a familiar. It's as if that idea became so infamous at one point that now the norm is to react against it.

I suppose I'm a bit blasé about AUs. Since I'm not attached to the idea of canon, my knee-jerk reaction is to say that it's a meaningless distinction and technically every word that didn't come out of JKR's head is AU. But that's just me; the distinction is of course very helpful to people looking for 'canon-compliant' fics.

I'd say both of the fics I linked are examples of deliberate AUs. In particular, /The Well Groomed Mind/ contains world building that is a steep departure from canon. I've never read /Dodging/ (since the idea of harems doesn't appeal to me), but the Wild Hunt idea posted by a different redditor in this thread did pique my interest

For me, the difference between an AU and a general fic is "if it weren't for the speicifc point of departure, could the canon books have happened in this fic's universe with no visible change?". So "what if Harry was born with red hair" or "what if Voldemort won the first war" are general fics, while a story where magical Lordships exist, Hogwarts is a paying school or bonded familiars exist are AUs.

Something as mild (dare I say charming?) as this trunk idea... if it ever had been illegal, I can't imagine why Lucius or someone would not have taken Cornelius Fudge aside at some point, offered him a drink, and told him "really now old chap, we're not harming anyone, and I /mean/ it this time, so why don't you whip up a little Ministerial Decree for us to clear up this whole business?"

Rather like how I imagine most ancient mythologies had at their roots families of powerful wizards and witches who made themselves the gods of an unfortunate Muggle people --- the Olympians being a particularly powerful and long-lasting dynasty because they had access to Elixir of Life and Philosopher's Stones (a.k.a.
