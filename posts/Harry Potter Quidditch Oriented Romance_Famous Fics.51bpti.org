Simply out of curiosity, are there any fics that have Harry becoming a professional quidditch player... either fairly early (like Krum) or in some other fashion.

They dont have to ignore the other aspects of his life such as needing to defeat Voldemort, but perhaps that happens earlier, or a different path is taken or something.

Also I always want some romance if possible (smut/lemons included are fine if thats what you suggest). Perhaps with the Gryffindor seekers, or an OC, or a Multi, or maybe even with a quidditch playing Hermione/Ginny/Whoever (Point is.. quidditch based romance).

No slash (just not into it).


** Ive mused off and on about a Harry who takes the easiest path after Hogwarts and joins the league only to find the team politics and backbiting of sponsorship even more dangerous than a dark lord hunting him. And now i imagine it with him courting the hottest singer in their Culture, Sophitia Ellington-Baxtorite, a singer who just left her band to strike it on her own after her band imploded due to their sudden fame post hogwarts.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

*** Someone already recommended The Quidditch World Cup, but none of the other stories he has listed seem to be Quidditch related, or at least, dont say anything about it in their descriptions.

Any particular ones you recommend?

**** Harry is a Quidditch player in Vitam Paramus. In fact, it's pretty much exactly what you asked for in the OP. Just don't expect very detailed Quidditch games. They are mentioned, some even in detail but mostly it's a fic about Harry's life, about how he deals with his fame after the war and about what kind of person he is and wants to be.

It also focuses quite a bit on Gabrielle but the romance is very, very slow moving. I probably would have liked the fic even better if it wasn't Harry/Gabby and they had a brother/sister relationship but it's still decent.

/The Garnet Snitch/ has Harry as a Professional Quidditch player, but the story isn't really focused on the sport.

I haven't read /A Cannon's Harpy/, though it is on my reading list.

  He had it all: the perfect bachelor pad, great friends, a Quidditch career any first-year ever dreamed of-and weekends free. Until Ginny Weasley came back into his life, Harry was quite happy to be alone. But if you play with fire, you get burnt. DONE!
