** I can't find them now, but I've read at least 2. The only thing I'm sure about is that they're old. Look for popular fics from 2008 or before.

*** I think I found one where Ron is used as a war strategist because he's good at chess which apparently makes total sense.

It's linkffn(Dumbledore's Army by Bobmin356), with the sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Spiritus Crystalus by Bobmin356).

I don't know how well they've aged, but there are at least some hilarious situations in the second fic.

** There was One where he's sent to an academy in russia. I think it's a time travel story where harry wants him out of the way so he doesn't fuck up the harmony again. I wish i could remember the name.

*** It's "Lord of Caer Azkaban" (Chapter 11), not a time travel story, and it's not Harry who pulls the strings to get Ron out of the way.

  A letter causes Harry to learn some surprising things about his lineage, a different twist on the usual Harry in Azkaban story line.

  I wasn't a huge fan of how Rowling built up Ron's chess talent
#+end_quote

It's not like Voldemort was going to hold a chess game for the world. It was a niche talent that didn't really serve a purpose to the plot.

*** Code Geass? /s

Real talk though, I agree. It's just that, knowing a bunch of younger kids with talents like that (singing, dancing, sport), I kinda want to see what would happen if he took his talent all the way

** The best chess players are disciplined workers in a way we get no indication that Ron is. He has some natural talent, and that allows him to kick the ass of a few untrained adults, which does seem impressive to those who've never delved into the game, but that is at best a necessary (not sufficient) condition for the immense talent people love to ascribe to him. Given how shaky he can be psychologically, I really don't see him do well in competitive chess.

** I don't think he's actually mentioned as being skilled in chess, but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] does have Ron being a tactian and behaving like a general.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
