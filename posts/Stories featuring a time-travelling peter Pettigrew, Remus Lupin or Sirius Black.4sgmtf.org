Timetravel is a subject that works best if the character doing the journey has deep regrets they want to overcome, and I think the Marauders fit the bill better than most.

Peter Pettigrew was a coward who wanted to survive, but ultimatively sacrificed the only people that ever cared for him in the process, only to die through the betrayal of his master (though he probably would've met the same fate via the veil if he had survived the silver hand anyway). Where are the stories where he receives a second chance to become as good a friend as the other marauders?

Remus Lupin thought Sirius Black guilty and (through inaction) condemned him to an incredibly long time in Azkaban. He wasn't able to raise Harry because he allowed his own insecurities and fear of himself to blind him to what a loving environment he could've provided to the child. Where are the stories where he lives his youth a second time, just this time already at a mental stage where he accepted the werewolf as part of himself instead hating himself for something beyond his control?

Sirius Black distrusted Remus Lupin and allowed this error of judgment to kill his best friend and friend's wife, allowed his hot-headedness to get him thrown into Azkaban and later killed via the veil, allowed his errors to almost destroy all his friendships and chance to see Harry grow up. Where are the stories where a man who walked through hell and back replaces his younger version, where he yearns to protect his friends and godson (and maybe even his estranged brother).

Do you guys have any story suggestions that would fit this description?


** linkffn(Misplaced Moony) has a time travelling Remus, but he may not be exactly what you want? He isn't fully accepting of himself but it does delve a lot into "what would happen if he hadn't had to go through losing everyone/being alone" etc.

  A mysterious item and mischievous Marauders end up accidentally shoving Remus Lupin into another time and place where he has to rebuild his life from scratch, deal with the aftermath of a war he hadn't yet been a part of, all with the help of new friends and a special young witch. Remione - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes. (Remus/Hermione) *Art by Freya Ishtar*

  Peter Pettigrew thought death was a reprieve. Except now he's in an alternate reality with family he thought he would never have, and friends he knew better than they did themselves. With a war on the horizon and Voldemort lurking in the shadows, can he get it right the second time? And more importantly, what are Horcruxes? (Rated T for minor swearing) NOT SLASH, WIP.

** I don't recall all details but there was a oneshot( I think) where Peter Pettigrew sends James back to 7th year. I will look for this when I am not on mobile.

** I had a pretty developed idea for Peter, but it ended up scratched off the list. It involved him going back to his fifth year and Marauders finding and exploring the origins of Room of Requirement, with Remus getting kinda corrupted by the power it can help achieve.

I might come back to that idea later. My main problem was their age - I need at least two years with the Room to bring Remus where I want him, but I have no idea what to do with the rest of the Marauders during it.
