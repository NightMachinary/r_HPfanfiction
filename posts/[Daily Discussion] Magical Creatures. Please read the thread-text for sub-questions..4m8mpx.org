Yesterday we discussed magical peoples, but some decided to go full creature, so I figured why not carry on with that. Please choose one or more of the following questions to answer. A one word response to each question is acceptable, but it would be better if you were to provide a detailed reasoning for each. This is a discussion, not a poll.

1. What is your favorite magical creature?
2. Which magical creature is the most dangerous? (Let's try to be more creative than nundu's and dragons)
3. Which magical creatures sounds most delicious?
4. Which magical creature would be the most interesting pet?


** /What is your favorite magical creature?/

Nifflers sound so adorable and useful, I've never wanted an animal more.

/Which magical creature is the most dangerous? (Let's try to be more creative than nundu's and dragons)/ Lethifolds and Dementors both terrify me and are so tied up in traumatising experiences/mental disorders that I would argue that they can be more damaging on a wider scale than dragons.

/Which magical creatures sounds most delicious?/ Hippogriff... Like a really gamey chicken.

/Which magical creature would be the most interesting pet?/ Apart from Nifflers, I would like a Kneazle. I don't even like cats, but the idea of a very loyal one is lovely.

Gotta be Veelas. They have such wonderful personalities.

  Which magical creature is the most dangerous?
#+end_quote

If not nundus, half-Veelas. I mean, any wizard or witch (including half-Veelas) can use Fiendfyre. Use that in a Muggle city--particuarly a densely populated one--without wizards nearby, and you get an unstoppable fire which will kill thousands.

Veelas. I do not feel as though this requires an explanation.

You may have detected a theme by now. That's why I'm gonna surprise you and say a phoenix, because they can teleport and--wait, wizards can teleport, too. I'm gonna have to go with Veela on this one.

** *>Which magical creature is the most dangerous?*

Ashwinders kill a fuckton of people, I expect. I mean, to look at they're not all that dangerous, but the worry is in their eggs destroying your fucking home.

I mean, on a domestic level, it's not actually dragons and Nundus that the average wizard has to worry about.

*Doxies*

We know doxies are venomous, though we don't know what general effect their venom has - I'm guessing that in the event of an infestation, though, there are a few deaths every few years.

I mean, they're only little bastards, but if you're cleaning out dead Aunt Mildred's kitchen cupboard and twenty of them descend on you when you've got no antidote to hand, you could well die on the floor.

*Puffskeins*

Generally they're not dangerous. I mean, they're fat little tribbles that stick their tongues into sleeping wizards' noses to eat bogeys.

But imagine an incredibly earnest puffskein with an overlarge tongue that just stiffens its tongue and goes for the brain. It'd be a horrible, terribly messy way to die.

I'm into it.

*Owls*.

Not in themselves, necessarily, but post owls can find virtually anyone in the magical world, so long as they don't cast whatever spell it is that makes them undetectable to them, so surely mail bombs and the like exist in the magical world.

I mean, you could obviously go for poison on the parchment or whatever, but surely you could just take a mail owl and train it to assassinate your chosen victims. Their value would be in the element of surprise and in their ability to find virtually any desired victim.

Go in and aim for the eyes, Hedwig.

** 1. House elf

2. House elf - they can pop an attacker in and out quickly

3. I dunno, are there magical versions of cows or chickens?

4. A unicorn. I could capture its farts and use that to power an ideal machine. Hello clean and abundant energy!

** What is your favorite magical creature?

I love thestrals, they are so intriguing. A creature that looks so dark and horrible but is actually a kind and shy creature.

Which magical creature is the most dangerous? (Let's try to be more creative than nundu's and dragons)

At lot of the creatures seem to be pretty dangerous. I feel like though, hippogryffs are pretty dangerous since you cant always track their intentions. You could be doing something exactly right but it could still be offended and attack

Which magical creatures sounds most delicious?

I honestly have never thought about it, and I dont know if I would. Maybe dragons, since I think hagrid had a steak of dragon meat. Maybe it would be kinda good.

Which magical creature would be the most interesting pet?

Back to thestrals, I seriously would love to have one!

** 1. Boggarts. I think they would be incredibly practical in real life. Psychologists would have a field day and find out what people fear rather quickly. Not only that but their solution could also help patients.

2. Infieri sound incredibly scary.

3. Centaur Steak. Centaur Burger. Centaur Wrap. Mmm.

4. Owls. I know you said magical but these birds fly over countries and back in days. They're small little buggers. Pretty magical. Plus I think there's a difference between owls in the magical world and those in the muggle world.

** No particularly deep reasons for me, I'm afraid.

1) Dragons for the cool factor of flying scaled lizards that can breathe fire.\\
2) Canonically, Nundu are among the most powerful magical animals in HP if they aren't the most powerful bar none. So, instead, I'm not going by killing potential but by the amount of fear it induces. Lethifolds take the win, by /far/. I've always been terrified of wraiths of any description for no good reason. Dementors, too, but you asked for something more creative :p\\
3) Kneazels. It's just that name reminds me of kneading, which brings to mind the process to create bread, and bread... is fucking awesome.\\
4) Phoenixes.
