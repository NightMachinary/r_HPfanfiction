I recently finished the Super Bowl Breach and I need more. Preferably with focus on the fallout rather than the initial discovery, but I'll take what I can get.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** Well the only one that I know of is a crossover with MLP. I know enough of MLP that I'm not completely lost, but some events go over my head. Basically the MLP world contacts the Muggle world first, starts trading resources/information with them, and the WW gets salty when they find out. The story is complete and a sequel is in the works.

** The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig has it, but they only remain on Earth briefly.

If you've read HPMoR, then it has an AU, Following the Phoenix, that includes a reveal. Both the original and the AU are quite long, though not quite as much as Superbowl Breach.
