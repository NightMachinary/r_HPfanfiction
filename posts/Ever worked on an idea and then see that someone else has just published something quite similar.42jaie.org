** Eh, my story plot is quite a common one, with already very popular fics that everyone knows. It hasn't really held me back at all, because you make your story your own.

Plus, given the monumental amount of stories, there's a good chance most of your readers won't have read the other fic.

** Yeah, and not just within the HPfanfic community. I pretty much accepted that none, or very few of my ideas are truly original. It's more the spin I give to it that makes it unique. Pretty much everything is already written, composed and played. So worrying about not being original is futile.

** By Victoire, do you mean Fleur's daughter?

Beside that, these kind of pairings must be hard to find because they are both Epilogue compliant and EWE.

**** EWE=Epilogue, What Epilogue? For those that like the end of the book but not the Epilogue and the pairings.

For the incest... I'm sorry to say that, but the only incest "acceptable" to me is the Lannister kind.

And for the odds of two stories with the same pairings... I can only say tough luck and try to skim through it to see what they did wrong.

** Yeah, pretty much happens to everyone. I embarked on my longest fic with the intention of subverting/warping as many cliches as possible. Now it gets compared to fics that hadn't even crossed my mind. It is what it is!

** The worst case of this I know of this is BajaB, who was alerted to the fact midway through posting linkffn(The Substitute by BajaB) that the premise for his story was virtually identical to that of one of Rorschach's Blot's one-shots.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

** When I was working on my most recent story (Euphoria), it was after months of a Harry/Fleur drought, where almost no new interesting stories of that pairing were published. Then, as I was working on it, it seemed like everyone and their mother was also writing one as well, and within a small window there was a half-dozen new fics.

** No matter how obscure the pairing, that alone won't make it stand out/ make it unique from any other story. If your plot is different, then you're onto a winner.

** I've been working on a piece for a while and have yet to come across anything with similarities great enough to bother me. I dread it though.

I was ecstatic when I searched FFN for the pairing I was working on and found only a single one shot, which didn't actually pair them up. I've not seen a great many things which feature in my head Canon depicted and hope it stays that way until I can finish my story and get it out there!
