Now, honestly, I'm not a sadistic weirdo! (At least not that much.)

So I'm currently in the process of re-reading HP and somehow remembered of a fan fiction I read long long ago (6yrs ago at the least, might be 8). I cannot seem to find it despite all my superhuman googling abilities, so I guessed I would try what the Reddit community is capable of.

The setting is in a prison, with Remus Lupin alone, the fanfic is mostly about his thoughts/feelings/remembering stuff. Somebody tortures him slowly, as far as I can remember, finally to the madness and death. The only thing that comes back clearly is him remembering back at somebody (Dumbledore?) who tells him something like: 'People can't remember pain. We can remember of having actually felt it, but not the pain itself. And this is a gift, Remus' as of prepping him/persuading him to a quest or something which would end in that prison. And I must warn you, I cannot rule out the fanfic being gay themed. I clearly remember reading some of that sort also.

Anybody else remembering this exceptional piece of artwork? :)


** Is this the one:

*** Nope, but thanks so much for the try. :) It was much longer, 4-5 chapters as far as I can remember. And very dramatic!
