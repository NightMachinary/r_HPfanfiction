:END:
I am looking for a fanfiction I cannot remember the title of, but can describe: It starts with 15 year old harry (maybe coming from the ministry battle?) being teleported back in time, lands in/goes to the Dursley household, takes himself with him (I dont know whether or not Penunia has even seen him jet, but I am leaning towards not??? maybe??? I think I am wrong there...???) and proceeds to live on the streets. I remember him worrying about what he was going to give baby Harry (whom he later on names differently so he isn't recognised by possible wizards, the name starts with an H too, but not Hadrian maybe maybe Harold or something similar) to eat, he himself is eating from trash bins I think (he also mentions having done that before when he used to hide from Dudley when he was a kid (? maybe?)). Eventually he robs a shop by wandlessly shrinking the diapers/wipes and hiding baby food in his jacket, going to "buy" one jar of baby food (something with peaches maybe???), pretends to have forgotten his purse, playing the sympathy card so the clerk eventually pays it for him. I think it mentions he does that more often then, but not in the same place. They may be moving towards/around London. They sleep in some abandoned building or something like that, Harry has trouble with the diapers, feeding baby harry, ect... he is worried about baby Harry being cold and wandlessly (an accidentally maybe) casts a warming charm, wich he then practises so he gets better and better at it. Later on, it was around Christmas I think, he robbed a Lady who left her handbag open? while she coos at baby harry playing in the snow? it was quite an amount I think, but I am unsure abaut the details of this scene. I dont really remember more then that. I dont know the pairings (if there were any), the rating, whether or not it was finished, how long it was, what happened after that... but I read it on ao3, most likely (idk could be somewhere else too, this was like years ago). Thank you for any help you can offer :)
