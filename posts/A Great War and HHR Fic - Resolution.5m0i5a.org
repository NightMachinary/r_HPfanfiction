I really enjoyed the darker tone of this fic. I thought it did a great job of showing how a more competent Voldemort might succeed, given the small wizarding population. The HHR aspect is pretty major, but I thought it did justice to all the characters. There were a couple of Deus Ex Machinas, but these tended to more the realistic side I think. Anyways, it's a good War story and it's complete. Happy reading!

  Voldemort has launched an all out war on the Wizarding World, and has taken the Boy Who Lived. But he has not reckoned on the resourcefulness of Hermione Granger. HHr developing in a sort of postapocalyptic environment.

*** I think the story linkffn(We, Alone by continuedinterests) was previously named resolution? Not sure though. From the ops description, this might've been it.

  Voldemort only waited five years. Harry Potter remained the unwanted nephew. Hermione Granger stayed the friendless know-it-all. That is until they found each other and magic. That is, until Voldemort found them. H/Hr. AU. Formerly known as Resolution.
