** One of my favorite fanfics is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]] . James and Lily are alive, and it's not that they purposely ignore or abuse Harry, but they focus more on his twin Skylar because he's the “boy who lived”. Harry in a childish way of thinking “understands” that his brother is more important and needs protection. It makes him bitter and angry in similar ways to other stories where Harry is intentionally ignored. It's dark!Harry though so idk if that's something you want. The entire story is extremely dark really. Take a look at the tags on ao3 before you read, because it might not be your cup of tea. IMO it's one of the best fics I've ever read, but everyone has their own opinions. Happy reading!
