Okay, I know the request is a bit vague but I want to read more fanfics like these two.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/][Ginger's Second Chance by redHussar]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13195476/1/The-Get-Together][The Get Together By Rowan'G'Winterlace]]

The bitterness in the writing style and non-existent 'true love' without significant angst... That's what I think is common among them.


** I thought you said 'better' for a second there hahaha

*** Yeah, it's kinda hard to describe. The protagonists are bitter, the relationships don't have plotline convenience of unfading love and eternal fidelity and it seems like a real-er world. Yet somehow, it isn't angsty.

*** Interpersonal conflict with a bit of angst is my style, but I'll have a look through my favourites and get back to you.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12265183/1/][Picnic Panic]] is both complete and a MUCH better version of The Get Together. It's a bit more on the wholesome side and Ron is sidelined after Chapter 1.

** Maybe Draco664's "Apprentice Potter" and its sequels:

[[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/]] [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Journeyman_Potter/index/]] [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Master_Potter/index/]]

The last one was never completed, but it's still worth reading.
