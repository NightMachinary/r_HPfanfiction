** Sirius is right up there with Voldemort for never getting genderbent. Too much a playboy in most peoples' minds, I guess. I'd like to see some of this too.

*** I've seen a few female Voldemorts, but Snape and Sirius are never female.

  Sirius are never female.

Why though? Such a shame... it's the perfect opportunity to let all those "evil secutress" cliches out to play (both in looks and in character/temperament). Except turns out she isn't evil. Sort of a mirror-verse Bella...

***** It's difficult to genderswap sirius' backstory of being part of the marauders, who all bonded over being in a male dorm together, I suppose.

But hey, the more we talk about it, the more likely an author will be inspired to write it!

****** Exactly. If you're gonna genderswap Sirius it would be easier to just do the same with all the marauders.

******* If you genderswap all the marauders, wouldn't you also have to genderswap Lily so that (s)he and F!James can still get married and have Harry?

***** Because Tonks and Bella can fill that role more naturally. Tonks for the seduction of "the poor children" and Bella because in those fics she's most likely the good girl in disguise. Or at least the likable psychopath.

I beg to differ. Tonks is too sweet and bubbly, she lacks the ex-convict sort of edge that Sirius has and Bella, well Bellatrix is evil. You'd have to warp/AU/OOC those characters siriously to get to what I had in mind for a fem!Sirius.
