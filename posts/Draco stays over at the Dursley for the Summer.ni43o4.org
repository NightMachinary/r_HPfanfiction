:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Exactly what the title implies, Draco stays over the summer with Harry, there are two fics I'm looking for, I remember in one of the fics Dudley was "leering" at Draco then tried to sexually harass him later on in the story, then Harry busts in and kicked his ass (or something like that). And in the other, I think Harry's uncle started/tried to hit Draco, and then He and Harry left. Thank you to anyone who can find this fic.


** Were the fics Drarry? If so, you might want to try [[/r/drarry][r/drarry]] and [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] too :)

linkao3(Timeshare by astolat) might be the second one? And if it isn't, I'd still highly recommend it! It's one of my favourites.

  “It's not for long,” Hermione said. “By the time we get back to Hogwarts, the Unfettering Brew will be ready.”“Listen to you!” Ron said. “He's got to get through a month with the Dursleys and a month at Malfoy Manor. With Draco Malfoy.”“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said, because he hadn't just spent the last week contemplating just how much more horrible his summer holidays were about to be than they'd ever been before.
