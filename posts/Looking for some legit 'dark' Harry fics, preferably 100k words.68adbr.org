I've read all the commonly recommended ones;

Nightmare Man,

Shadowed Malice,

Heir of Dracula,

Emperor,

Rise of the Dark Lord,

Too Young to Die,

With Strength of Steel Wings,

On a Pale Horse,

Worthy of Magic,

Vahan,

Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin,

Prodigal Delinquent,

Trouble,

Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor,

The Darkness Within (and sequels),

Enveloped in the Darkness (and sequel),

Rise of the Wizards,

Circular Reasoning,

In the Mind of a Scientist,

Deprived,

Renegade Cause,

A Cadmean Victory,

Core Threads,

Rise of Overlord Vulcan,

Brutal Harry,

Prince of the Dark Kingdom,

Harry Potter and the Veela,

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived,

The Art of Self-Fashioning,

The Havoc Side of the Force,

Barefoot,

etc etc.

I've searched this subreddit with the proper keywords, and I see the same fics posted in threads like mine over and over.

Is there anything else out there?

I realize 'dark' is a vague descriptor- all I want is a fic where Harry has some ambition and skill, where he isn't squeamish about doing what needs to be done, preferably one where Ron and Hermione are not friends of his....

Anyway, thanks in advance n.n

P.S. no slash please!

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

I actually like dark!Gryffindor!Harry a lot better than dark!Slytherin!Harry, especially when his old DA friends joined his new cause. It would be the ultimate insult to Dumbledore's ineffective and failed leadership, who turned to sacrificing children in desperation. I love to see Harry's generation tearing down the Old Order, rebuilding the society to their liking, and making their enemies PAY.

That was why l like "The Sum of Their Parts" so much. If the author managed to come up with a sequel of similar quality, this story series would become by far my top favorite.

*** I think my problem with The Sum of Their Parts is that Harry isn't awful enough. We don't see him flaying people alive, torturing them to death, ect. He might be titled "Dark Lord" but really he's just a radical, with questionable morals, politician. I think The Sum of Their Parts would have been better if Teddy had /died/, and then Harry went insane DL and decided to kill them all.

I liked it on my first read, but reflecting back on it, I'm disappointed with it, in all honesty. It's a good fic, but hardly dark.

Also, question about Dodging Prison, Stealing Witches, is it humorous or is it just the way the title + description reads?

** Only vaguely what you're asking for, and has slash, but I'll always plug this fic. linkao3(The Anti-Heroine)

Hermione is nuts in this, and arguably evil. Tom Riddle comes in at one point, and is even more dark then Hermione. Harry is the only one who isn't completely evil. However, in his attempts to support Hermione + Tom, he slowly does more and more awful things.

The fic is decent enough until Tom comes in, then it's amazing. I highly recommend, but you might not like it.

** Okay, so Ron and Hermione are friends in it [[/spoiler][though Ron dies and won't be in the sequels]] and [[/spoiler][I'm fairly sure Hermione is a Death Eater]] give linkffn(Lesser Evils by Scott Press) a read. Literally one of the only dark!Harry fics I've read that isn't utter shit and is in fact pretty good.

While the start is angts heavy, try linkffn(Stronger than Hope). While Ron and Hermione are his friends in this, they don't really play large roles and there is a good period of time where the friendship is on very shaky ground. Features still-an-asshole!mentor!Snape.

I'll also have to second the recommendations of What Lies Beneath by Master Slytherin (a pretty good thriller) and Prisoner's Cipher by Ecthelion3 which is pretty bizarre.

- first half of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]]/ --- this one's technically a slash story, but it almost reads like two different stories --- with the first half (with no slash) being quite good, and with the second half (w\ slash) rapidly nosediving in quality. So you can try reading just the first half and then drop it.
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][A Third Path to the Future]]/ --- generally of a mediocre quality, though gets a bit more interesting plot arc near the final chapters (HP × X-Men: Evolution).

***** Because Harry is a guy, and I'm a guy, and I've been reading Harry as a guy for a very long time.

That's not to say I never read any stories from the perspective of a female character, but when I do it has to have more substance than fanfiction. Great classics- including those with female leads- gave a new perspective and gave you legitimate food for thought, oftentimes bringing new issues and problems to light.

Of it doesn't do that, then I really have no interest in reading a book with a female lead, especially if there's romance in it, because I have absolutely no interest in hearing about exclusively trivial feminine concerns, like what to wear, what someone is thinking about them, etc etc.

In other words, it's generally not fun reading such stories, and fanfiction isn't going to be exploring or breaking any new ground to make me want to read them.

It's also usually pretty obvious when it's a woman writing a male character. Hell, canon Harry Potter and Ron Weasley are prime examples over this. Them having rows over jealousy was so contrived, it was ridiculous- Rowling did not, does not understand male camaraderie. There are several people in my life who get more attention and are much more successful than me, or any of my friends, and I trust and respect them greatly, despite spending much less time with them than Ron and Harry.

Anyway, that was a long-winded response, but there it is.

But "concerns" are only a minor part of why stories written by women are less apealing- and I would wager that 99.9% of fem/Harry stories are written by women.

The simple fact is that gender plays a role in what sort of content people enjoy, and write- this applies to when they're writing a plot or dialogue or what have you. This doesn't mean one is superior to the other- just because men tend to prefer certain content and women tend to prefer other content doesn't make either inherently worse than the other.

********** I can't stand jealousy-related drama (and jealous characters) in stories either.

That being said, I think you're consistently missing the point slacktherin is trying to make. The main problem is with the /exclusively/, not /trivial/. Neither personality trait is an exclusively feminine concern: male camaraderie notwithstanding, men do get jealous and\or envious of each other too, even if not in the exactly same manner as women (same with the “what to wear” and “what someone is thinking about them” parts).

  [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/head-games/201308/who-gets-more-jealous-men-or-women][Consistent with prior research, women]] reported higher levels of jealousy on both /[Sexual \ Emotional jealousy]/ measures, and both men and women scored higher on sexual jealousy than on emotional jealousy. However, men reported greater jealousy in response to sexual infidelity than to emotional infidelity. These findings square with the theory that men and women differ when it comes to types of jealousy---that is, sexual vs. emotional.

There is empirical evidence supporting this idea, showing that men, relative to women, report greater jealousy in response to sexual infidelity than in response to emotional infidelity (Edlund & Sagarin, 2009; Sagarin, 2005; Sagarin et al., 2003; Sheets & Wolfe, 2001; Wiederman & Allgeier, 1993).

These are just some study results from google's first page --- I'm sure there will be better \ more thorough information in some other, more relevant books and papers.

My point is: even if there is some difference in numbers, this difference doesn't mean that men don't get jealous \ envious at all. It also doesn't mean that a specific story protagonist has to have those personality traits that would've been the most likely for their demographic group.

** I usually write a Harry who isn't too squeamish when it comes to killing Death Eaters and their ilk, but I also usually have Hermione and Ron be his best friends (and share his views about doing what's needed), so I'm not certain you'd like that. My story "Patron" might fit - Harry's quite skilled, as evidenced in the tournament, and he and his friends want to gain enough influence and power (and gold) to change the country.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
