:END:
I can't remember the title for the life of me but in the fic everybody is under the impression that Harry has been murdered by the Dursleys as a young child. Severus had the opportunity to go back in time and ends up saving Harry and raising him on a tropical island.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE
