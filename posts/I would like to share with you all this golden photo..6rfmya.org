** anachronisms - have to be my biggest pet peeves. I will take shitty grammar, horrible spelling and massive typos over Harry using a pocket sized mobile to invest in Google that he researched over the Internet in 1991 and then tweets about it.

*** Marauder fics are absolutely terrible for it. Not only in terms of described fashion, but in the way the characters speak to each other. Sirius and James wouldn't talk about their bromance because that wasn't a thing in 1970s Britain.

**** At the very least there was a lot of fics that didn't state that a fic was moved up to be set in the 2000's++. So it was quite yarring to read when it comes up, at least when it's not mentioned anywhere before that one scene. Or chapter.

***** Yep, I read one recently where the author moved it up 20 years because they "didn't want to bust their brain trying to figure out what life was like in the 1990's". LOLOLOLOL?

****** I was born in '93, doesn't I mean I can see something that is out of place from the movies or the books. The events take place between '91 and '98. Cellphones are bricks and they are only able to make calls. Internet is rare, and is slower than a snail. Few have computers, and even fewer have multiple computers.

********** 1,430 Me-262s were made. It definitely got into mass production, at least by German standards of attempting to go for quality over quantity. Which, as the Wehrmacht and SS experienced, was not something they could achieve. The slaves working on building tanks and airplanes often tried to sabotage them, and in the case of some, like the Panther, succeeded on a massive scale.

Of course, the Me 262 had an innumerable number of flaws, and was introduced at a point in the war where the Allies, through quality and sheer numbers, had completely taken over the skies. Germany had almost certainly lost the war even /before/ it lost air supremacy. The Battles of Moscow and Stalingrad were a turning point in both the ground and air wars.

Thankfully, it was a crack fic, so I didn't care.
