In the 1600s there was a muggle population of 500-580 million muggles acording to Wikipedia.

So using that number how large can you make the magical population while still keep the need to hide the magical world?

I would say that you could have a magical population be anything up to 50 million mabye more.

Because the magical world and its races were probably not united as a single world so there were probably magical races at war with each other.

the magical races at war also probably used muggles as proxies in there wars by pointing a group of muggles at there enemies and secretly giveing them magical help in the background.

Really because of aquatic magical races and races like the goblin and dwarves that lived mostly underground you could probably push the magical population up to 150 million or more depending on how large the population of the aquatic and underground dwelling races were.

How big can you make the magical population before you take away the need for the statue of secrecy?


** I think it's likely that the magical population was always a tiny fraction of the Muggle population. Muggles have high birth rates for several reasons: lack of access to or religious beliefs against birth control, needing children as labor on farms, high rates of infant mortality. None of these would necessarily have applied in the Magical world, and we get the sense that large families like the Weasleys are a very rare exception to a norm of one or two children per family. It's quite possible their birth rate hovers around the replacement rate (2 children per family) or /below/, and that their population didn't explode like the [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Population_curve.svg/547px-Population_curve.svg.png][Muggle one has since the 1600s]] for these reasons. It could be quite tiny, [[https://www.quora.com/How-big-is-the-wizarding-world-in-terms-of-population-in-Harry-Potter-series][e.g. this analysis]] - and it could be shrinking. Muggleborns might be the only thing keeping witches and wizards from going extinct.

*** The Magical world is made of of more than just wizards and witches. How do you think population numbers of Giants,Goblins,Pukwudgie ,Vampires,House elves, Veelas, Merpeople ,Centaurs and dwarves.

that means that there is as least Nine magical races in the magical world apart from wizard and Witchs probably more, how do you think their number effect the population of the *magical* world?

**** The impression that I get from the books is that all of those magical races are quite rare, rarer than witches and wizards.

***** I second that. There is maybe 1 vampire on 5000 magical and a werewolf on every thousand. As for Centaurs, Merefolk and similar, I'd say that there are one or two groups of each in Britain tops.

On a related note, I never understood the fascination with the other sapient species. Vampire's and Werewolves are a nice challenge (You can go "Hellsing" on them if everything else fails, but at least they put up a decent fight). But rape-y human-horse hybrids? Fishpeople? The cheap Switzerland knockoff without chocolate?

They don't even make interesting adversaries since they die very easily. A couple Depth Charges in the Black Lake and there's no more Merefolk. And I mean, what's the worst they can do, screech? Centaurs die to pretty much any offensive spell (or pretty much any weapon). Goblins might have some spell resistent weapons, but there's little they can do against Greek fire/flamethrowers/Fiendfyre. And they are bankers. What the hell is interesting about banking?

** Magical races I don't know about but I'm rather sure that JKR said that the Wizarding population is at about 1% of the population of the country. So at about 5-5.8 millions. Or maybe it was 0.001%, I don't recall completely but it was rather low. I'd rather work on the assumption of 1% as it allows for a lot more things than what 0.001% will.

*** yep i know that a lot of people have worked out how many wizards there are in canon.

I am asking how Big you can make the Magical population(not just wizards and witches) while still keeping the need for the Statue of Secrecy.

**** I'd say 300-400k max in the UK, but it really depends on how many Muggleborns you have each year. If there are less than 1000, secrecy makes sense, but more and then suddenly everyone knows the secret.

In theory, there could be millions of wizards in Britain if they all lived in their own isolated society. There's little interaction with Muggles so they are not really endangering the secret. Space extension is a neat plot device to explain that (enlarge farms for food, plantations for resources and so on).

As for non-humans, their numbers appear to be insignificant in canon and most of them are far easier to kill than for example dragons, which were hunted into extinction since they were causing issues. With the disdain the magical world shows them, their numbers will stay low, one way or another. Merefolk? Meet dynamite fishing? Centaurs? There's this thing called shield, which together with an unbreakable or "Impervius‚Äù charm render them absolutely harmless.

** My headcanon/AUcanon has Wizarding populations roughly the same as Jewish populations in the same time periods, as they (in my canons) had similar sociopolitical statuses and small starting populations.

Specifically, they were both feared and hated by the peasants, perceived as enemies of the Church, and useful to the rulers - so they were outside the feudal system, being beholden directly to the monarch, and were regularly thrown to the peasants or Church for some light recreational genocide when they got uppity or pissed at him.

In my canons, the SoS only became a thing after the wizarding world became able to be sufficiently self-sufficient and unanimous in their goal to make a clean break across the board.
