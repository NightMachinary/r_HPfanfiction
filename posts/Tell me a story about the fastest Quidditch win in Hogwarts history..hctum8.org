I'm talking a score of 150-0, within minutes of the crate opening, accusations of Snitch-summoning/tampering, etc.

How did it happen? What rules, if any, were broken, what rules were implemented afterward?


** One day, young Quidditch prodigy Harry Potter heard some terrible news. The sinister bat of the dungeons, Severus Snape, had volunteered to referee Harry's next Quidditch match against Hufflepuff. After watching Snape attempt to murder Harry in his first match, Harry's friends were aghast.

"Pretend to break your leg," Hermione suggested.

"Really break your leg," said Ron.

But Harry refused to let his team down--there was no reserve seeker, without him, Gryffindor had no chance. Once he arrived, he realized he had nothing to worry about--with Dumbledore in the audience, Snape wouldn't dare try anything. In the end, Harry had nothing to worry about--he caught the snitch in 5 minutes, the fastest catch in Hogwarts history.

** This was the one and only match Lily Evans played in at Hogwarts. She caught the snitch 47 seconds into the match. James Potter tried to propose on the spot.

** You can check out the story Harry Potter and the Old Friend by Sinyk. It has a scene for the fastest snitch caught 8 seconds after the snitch becomes visible (which happens 5 minutes after it's released).

Wheeling hard about he held his hand aloft showing he'd caught the snitch. There was about three to four seconds of near silence before the announcer, Lee Jordan, yelled, "Bloody Hell! Potter's already caught the snitch! It's over! The Badgers win 180 to 30!" The resultant applause was almost deafening. Harry still heard Jordan's follow-on call, "That would have to be one of the fastest snitch catches in history! Five minutes, eight seconds from game start!"
