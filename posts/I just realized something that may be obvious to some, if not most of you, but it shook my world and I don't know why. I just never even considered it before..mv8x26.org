Harry was born on July 31st. Which means, if you take into account that pregnancy is supposedly 9 months on average, his conception was close to late October. Meaning he was possibly conceived on October 31st. Which is a major date each year in the books. I guess we could probably add one more important (yet not deadly or disturbing) event to add to the importance of the day.

**** I don't think Hermione is so careful with her language. She has a rather explicit suggestion when Ron asks her where he should put his wand after annoying her. She also does the double-entendre speech about how all wizards like to brag that they have a bigger and better wand.

** Pregnancies aren't really 9 months on average, especially not to the day like that, but it is a fun bit of symbolism to write and think about, so I would rather take artistic license about it than get bogged down in realistic conception dates.

** I love this and have also thought how cool this would be, but pregnancy is actually 40 weeks*, or if you are unlucky like me, 42 weeks. 9 months is just what they call it to make it easier to remember but it's more like 9.5 to 10 months.

Most likely Harry was conceived mid October. However I will grant that JKR was probably thinking this when she gave him that birthday (unless she just wanted him to have her birthday) because she is bad at counting and also because so few people realize ‚Äú40 weeks is actually 10 months but two of those weeks are fake so it's really 38 weeks‚Äù because education about pregnancy leaves a lot to be desired.

/There is also funky and perhaps arbitrary week counting in the medical world. They judge a pregnancy by the date of your last period, which is wild, since people don't *typically/ ovulate until ~2 weeks later.

I will now leave and stop ruining all the fun haha.

*** Seems like babies just come whenever they feel like it though. My kid repeatedly tried to be born at 27 weeks so I had to go on bed rest until 37 weeks. And then they WOULD. NOT. LEAVE. I was jogging down the street at 42 weeks out of desperation, and they ended up having to induce me. lol

*** 40 weeks is from first day of last period, though, so 38 weeks from conception for a standard 28 day cycle. Halloween fits pretty well. Actually checked it with a pregnancy calculator and everything.

** Except that ‚Äúthe seventh month‚Äù is quite problematic: seven months since when? Why January 1st? Are timeless magical entities that much concerned with the Gregorian calendar? What about seven months since the day the prophecy was made? What about the fact, that seven months is generally considered the shortest time the pregnancy must long for child to have chance of survival? Or what about seven months after the marriage, that would be tasty! [SELF-AD] I have worked with debunking The Prophecy in my story ‚ÄúGinny on prophecies‚Äù linkao3(22663204). And yes, it is always useful to remind everybody that contrary to fanon, Dumbledore actually didn't believe in The Prophecy itself, but was forced to follow it by Tom.

  While writing other Harry-after-DoM-debacle-gets-his-life-together story, I got this piece of conversation, which didn't fit anywhere. So, I am putting it here just as a separate one-shot. In my original story, they found out that Ginny is in fact a daughter of Lily Potter, Harry's sister. This story may very well be canonical (Hinny), but I haven't mentioned anything about their relationship, so it could be either. In the canonical world, it would be just that they were friends before they were more than friends (and Ms Rowling as usual forgot to mention any parts of relationship other than snogging).
