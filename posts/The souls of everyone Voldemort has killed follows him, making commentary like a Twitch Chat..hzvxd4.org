Voldemort: "I will enslave the wizarding world to my whims. I will be the sole dictator, controlling everything. And then, finally, I will be the one in control."

Lucius: "My lord? You've been climbing and leaping off that ledge for... twenty eight hours now. Would you like, er, a cushion?"

** Voldemort wanted to scream. He was trying to sleep. Was that to much to ask for. Yet every night when he would lay down they would all scream, chant, or make some other racket. They decided tonight half would throw insult after insult while the other half screeched at the top of their ghostly lungs. It was going to be another sleepless night.
