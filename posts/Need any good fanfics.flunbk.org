** Several of annerb's oneshots can be pretty heartwarming, such as linkffn(for a pessimist, i'm really an optimist by annerb).

linkffn(Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much) is a very benign yet believable "Dudley has a witch for a daughter and reaches out to Harry" fic that ends on a high note.

linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) and most of BajaB's more crack work are good at lighthearted spin on HP fanfiction.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

I have specifically not listed any works in progress, abandoned or otherwise. Most of these are gen or mild as far as relationships go. If you want more explicit stuff, it would really help if you'd give us some preferred pairings, because I'm sure most of us have huge lists for our favorite couples.
