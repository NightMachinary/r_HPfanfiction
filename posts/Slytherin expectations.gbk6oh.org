Does anyone have a fanfiction where people in the slytherin house have expectations about harry (that he is arrogant, weak, etc) but after they meet harry they are shocked since he is the opposite of their expectations?


** I feel like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) is a good example of the everyone always seems to like Harry (outside of some exceptions that are spoilers for the story)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
