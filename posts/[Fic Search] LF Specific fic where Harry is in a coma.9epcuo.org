I read this really good fic a while ago and don't have the name. The basic concept was that Harry goes into a coma for some reason I can't remember and inside the coma dreams Inception-style that Sirius tells him that he'll be there when he wakes up and then it turns out that he's trying to wake him up from the real world or something. Can any of you dudes work out which one I'm referring to from my butchered description? Thanks


** Sorry you aren't having luck in replies. I'll chime in with a question

I vaguely recall a story where Sirius kinda is a ghost/apparition (or maybe just in Harry's head) after he fell into the veil, and his ties to Harry keep him around, and eventually allow him to get free. I don't remember a coma, but it's been a while.

Any chance its that fic? Otherwise I can't help, since the only coma fics I recall involve Hermione.
