  Nine years after the Final Battle, Amaryllis Potter finds herself working long shifts in a private hospital in New York City, combining Muggle and magical Healing. The war never really let her go. And then suddenly her quiet, somewhat peaceful life changes abruptly as she runs into a stranger one night, after a long day at work. But not only her life changes... (Fem!Harry) [AU!]

  Tony Stark has secrets. Despite riches and fame, he has few true friends and little life outside of Iron Man. Which is who everyone seems to want, except Pepper. Pepper hates Iron Man, but he can't change what he is. Harry Potter has no idea what life after death holds, but he can't go back, can't undo what has been done. The only way is forward, for both of them (SLASH) Harry/Tony

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  In the several millennia he had existed Loki Odinson, Norse God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things, he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before, in his thousands of years of existence had he been a loving father, but all it took was a single glance at the perfect little creature before him and knew, he was gone.

#+begin_quote
  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.
#+end_quote

/Well-written, but not very action-y. There's a chunk of fighting, but most of it focuses on Steve and Harry's friendship./

  Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers."

/Wonderful fic, but it hasn't gotten to the meat of the plot yet. Or the start of it, really./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9625555/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a Feather]] (Incomplete. Updated 7/23/2014.)

#+begin_quote
  Tiboldt's Family Circus brings together two birds of a feather. The world tries to tear them apart.
#+end_quote

/Only 18k words so far. It's just reached the start of the conflict. However, Clint-Harry bromance!!! So adorable (and heart-twanging)./

  Normal people didn't have to worry about this sort of thing when they go on vacation. They worry about things like losing their luggage, catching a cab or something similar. Not alien invasions. Harry, however, had never been normal. Then again, neither were these guys.

/Funny and short- just give it a read./

** Mrs.InsaneOne has just started an HP/Avengers cross called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11146299/1/Destiny-Delayed][Destiny Delayed]], and while it's only one chapter so far, she has a demonstrable history of completing sizeable fics and writing quality stuff (though I must admit that most of her crossovers are with things I'm not at all interested in). She has a habit of keeping a queue of pre-written chapters, which is nice.

Personally, my main exposure to her work is with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552390/1/Magic-Online][Magic Online]], a crossover between Harry Potter and Sword Art Online. I'd had no exposure whatsoever to the latter, but I'm still enjoying the story immensely. I've no doubt her HP/Avengers crossover is going to be entertaining at the very least.

  One day, Harry J Potter made a wish in front of the mirror of Erised. One day, Bruce Banner woke up naked in a green-eyed man's aparment. One day, Harry introduced himself with his father's name to a strange man he found naked, green, and angry on the street. One day, SHIELD discovered human magic... and tried to make weapons from it. And the world is never the same.

Nice action going on, only downside you might find is its been more than a year since its updated. Its labelled as slash but it wouldn't be a problem since there's no actual romance yet.
