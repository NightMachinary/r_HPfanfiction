In Order of the Phoenix, the Sorting Hat sings the dire warning about house unity, but that plot point is quickly dropped and no one really cares about unifying the houses. I've seen a lot of fanfics trying to rectify this by somehow including "nice" Slytherins in the DA and the battle of Hogwarts, things like that.

Likewise, when Dumbledore flees the school he gives this little "strike me down and I shall become more impossible than you can imagine" dialog where he tells Minerva that he isn't going to Grimmauld Place, but that he's going to make things tough for the Ministry. What does he do, exactly? Nothing? This plot point is completely dropped and I've never seen it touched in a fic.

Are there any other dropped plot points you can think of? Good examples of those being followed up on in fics?


** The door where love is locked away in the Department of Mysteries; every mention of it makes it seem like Dumbledore expects Harry to be the only one able to open it, and that it'll be necessary if they are to acquire the final weapon against Voldemort.

Don't get me started on Tonks- JKR invented this really cool character with awesome abilities who should have been central to the Orders strategy to monitor and undermine the Death Eaters' infiltration of the Ministry, and she's either stuck on babysitting duty, blubbering about because of a guy, or sidelined with a pregnancy. It's like 'We have Wonder Woman on our side. She's a great cook. I love her souvlaki.'

*** Really good points on Tonks! Infuriating when you lay it all out like that.

I'm willing to give the Department of Mysteries stuff more of a pass because it's nice to get a glimpse of "the magical world is wide and mysterious" but still sticking to the plot. Plus if Harry literally opened a "room full of love" it would be tough to write that in a way that didn't read like "the Care Bears defeat Voldemort!"

I think Lupin also got the short end of the stick in books 6 and 7. You see him risking everything to evangelize to werewolves and that has 0 results. Obviously not everything characters try should be successful... but come on...

**** I feel like there's definitely some internalized misogyny in the books. Well, not nearly as much as "fat people are disgusting monsters" constantly played for laughs, but I think it's still in there.

Think of the female characters that get the most screen-time: described as shrill, simpering, overly strict schoolmarm, super mom, bossy, generic popular mean girl, psycho girlfriend, etc.

Maybe she is trying to show how much more complex characters are /beyond/ those stereotypes, so it's not really misogynist. But someone much smarter than me who actually has a humanities degree should figure this out, and then I'll read that essay ;)

***** There was a good [[https://old.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/ap3964/as_i_get_older_the_writing_of_lavenders_character/][thread on r/harrypotter]] on JKR and how she portrays femininity in the series.

I found the way Fleur was treated by Hermione and Ginny as pretty awful, and read it as the author's criticism of feminine/girly characters, which was shared by Hermione's (a self-acknowledged author avatar character, and JKR's favorite according to interviews between her and Steve Kloves, the screenwriter behind the movie series and creator of Flawless Movie!Hermione) disdain of Parvati and Lavender, and her dismissal of their interests and hobbies as shallow.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Fleur's not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament,' said Harry.

  ‘Not you as well!' said Hermione bitterly.

  ‘I suppose you like the way Phlegm says /“‘Arry”,/ do you?' asked Ginny scornfully.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  ‘I'll bet you wish you hadn't given up Divination now, don't you, Hermione?' asked Parvati, smirking.

  It was breakfast time, two days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.

  ‘Not really,' said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. ‘I've never really liked horses.'
#+end_quote

The majority of thread responses write off these recurring moments as "teenagers being teenagers" rather than being a manifestation of internalized attitudes on the part of the author, which was kind of disappointing. Reading the series today, I feel it's pretty obvious that some of the writing shows its age, as a product of the early 2000's.

  Last but certainly not least is the presentation of Hermione's character. She is not certainly not the archetype of a typical problematic female character we are used to seeing. She is not the Cool Girl, not the Girl Who's Just One Of The Boys. She is not one of personality types that are stereotyped to make a woman who takes on masculine traits while still demonstrating feminine beauty seem more appealing or inherently worthy than other women who don't match those same values. J.K. Rowling might have made her a nerdy, bushy-haired, independent character --- one that we admire and strive to emulated --- but in doing so, she also unconsciously cut down women who weren't like Hermione.

  Consider this: there is constant praise from the main characters throughout the books, reinforcing that Hermione is not like the other girls at Hogwarts, which is why Harry and Ron deign to be her friends. While the books mock Fleur for flaunting her good looks, and make Lavender and Parvati look foolish for their heroine worship of Professor Trelawney, the narrative prizes Hermione for being "above" those stereotypically feminine things. In fact, of the main girls attending Hogwarts, only Hermione, Ginny, and Luna seem to be free of that feminine scrutiny. In an effort to flip the stereotype on its head and make the awkward, brainy, and slow-blooming girls as "worthy" as the cool ones, J.K. Rowling time and again takes it too far by creating a space where we are still shaming women --- this time for acting too girlish. (And if we're getting hella specific here, then look no further than the ultimate villain --- Dolores Umbridge's penchant for pink and tea cups and cats was constantly brought up, and she was evil incarnate.)

  Of course, the majority of these characters are "redeemed" for their femininity in the end; Fleur proves she is not as vain as everyone presumes, Hermione's dorm mates join Dumbledore's Army, and even Ginny gets over her ~silly~ crush on Harry by asserting her independence before dating him for real. These redemptions, though, just further enforce an unconscious notion throughout the book that acting less feminine somehow makes a woman more worthy of love or respect. Rather, the books would have done better to differentiate between these characters without relying on feminine tropes to make readers value one way of being a woman over another.

More often than not, I lament the way so many female characters come off as one-note compared to the male characters who are depicted as more complex. Lily Evans Potter is the angelic savior's savior, and her beauty and love goes forever untarnished. An admirable ideal, but James Potter, for as much as he shows up on-screen, comes off as much more three-dimensional. He was a rich boy, a pureblood who didn't swallow the ideology, he was a spoiled brat, a bully, a braggart. He was a loving father, loyal to a fault to his friends.

Start counting off the major male to female characters and you realize how many of the ones with actual fleshed out personalities skew to one demographic.

Because she's dead and we never interact with anyone that close to her. While we have 3/4 of the marauders around 2 of which get serious screen time.

****** This interpretation seems too simplistic, as it assumes the POV of the story is the author's real opinion. Young Hermione has a crush on Lockhart, but that doesn't mean Rowling herself is presenting Lockhart as some sort of masculine ideal. Rowling is accurately presenting Hermione's flaws. When various female characters hold Fleur's beauty against her, again, that's Rowling showing us the flaws of these characters. She isn't telling us that this prejudice against beauty is justified.

***** I couldn't point you towards it now, but I did at some point see a great post about how Madame Rowling proves with what she's doing that she's not capable of portraying minority problems, including simple discrimination, properly. The person who wrote it did make an argument about her either letting Hermione be turned black or even enforcing that change based on her inability to portray Hermione's difficulties stemming from being a non-obvious minority (i.e. a muggleborn) and thus deciding to make her minority-ness more obvious.

Considering her comments about certain other minorities, negative comments that you could imagine stemming from ignorance (possibly wilful) rather than hatred, I can easily see there being internalised sexism and not only that.

On the other hand, we have

- Then he later decides to *stun* Umbridge and Yaxley who were engaged in committing genocide instead of ending them which immediately loses them their safe house.

- He *stuns* Greyback at Malfoy Manor instead of using /Sectumsempra/ or some other lethal spell.

Because that is the most likely spell to bring your enemy down(except for the killing curse, but we dont even know if Harry can even cast it), we know form Snapes memories that even if you hit your enemy with it, they can still attack you back and defeat you, like James did against him.

Harry only uses a single Expelliarmus, its also the only successful spell in that entire battle, and literally incapacitates Goyle as enemy.

Just to be clear Harry kills when he has to, but disarming and stunnig your opponents still still a much better way to take your enemies out, being willing to kill doesn't mean you should kill when its stupid.

Where does it say what spell Snape used? Harry casting /Sectumsempra/ with one wand did enough damage to nearly kill Malfoy and required immediate healing. Guess how much damage the spell would've done with 3 wands.

Sure, but Harry judged the situation not to be fitting, he is literally the only one in that scene who doesn't show any actual problem with the idea of killing them, but judged it to risky. At worst you can say he was stupid, but it wasn't the killing itself he had a problem with. On the other hand he totally judged that Voldemort had to be killed to be permanently neutralized.

It's very possible it was in the early stages of being created so wasn't powerful enough to do to James what it did to Draco, or it could have only nicked James' ear and so he returned fire with Levicorpus.

In the quick battle in the cafe/diner, Harry and his friends had the jump on the Death Eaters and could have hit hard and fast and landed killing blows. Even then, they restrained the combatants that were then freed and went on to kill more people between then and the final battle at Hogwarts.

**** I have written a response to some issue similar but I can't find it right now so I'll type it out again.

The issue with Harry being pacifist is, that while he kills in the Battle of 7 Potters he does so by mostly using Stupefy and similar non-dark, relatively harmless curses.

In every battle 1on1 he uses only stunning or disarming curses even against Bellatrix or any other good fighters. He teaches much more harmful curses in the DA like Reducto, Bombarda, the cutting curse or Incendio. But he still does not use them in battle.

He even kills Voldemort by using the effin disarming curse! If I would face the guy who killed my family and friends I would be trying to harm him.

Harry being pacifistic is, while fanon, grounded pretty solidly in canon as well.

​

Not using dark magic wouldn't make him a pacifist if he still uses magic to knowingly kill his enemies, he even mentions later how in that situation a stunning charm was the same as a killing curse. And its also not true, he literally kills one death eater by using a blasting curse on the sidecar. Also there are no non-dark curses.

Firstly its not disarming curse, curses are dark magic, Expelliarmus is a charm, secondly Harry totally does use harmful dark magic against enemies, what did you think he was doing against Snape and Carrow, and the only spell Harry ever used on Bellatrix was the Cruicatus Curse

​

Here Harry uses dark magic on Death Eaters and they end up dead.

​

And there is tactically absolutely no reason to not use a stunning charm in a fight since it literally brings down the enemy, while a cutting curse doesn't have to. It doesn't make him a pacifist.

****** The fact that there are no non dark curses is true.

Cited from the HP WIKI: "A curse is classified as a Dark charm, which is primarily defined as any spell that affects the object in a negative manner, usually associated with varying levels of discomfort. A curse is the worst kind of dark magic intended to affect the target in a severely negative manner."

Under that category fall all curses, for example Confringo, Flagrante, Full Body Bind and others that are taught and used as early as the First Book.

So that's a technicality and an error on my part.

But dark magic doesnt make my point of "Harry being a pacifist is grounded in canon" any less true.

He might be using curses etc in canon but there are still many points that could be seen as him being a pacifist in the sense of "No long term harm and/or killing.".

Him trying to disarm Voldie is stupid as a tactic. If his charm is blocked, he is dead. If Voldue summons his wand back, he is dead.

To win a fight you disable the enemy. We know that Voldie is extremely powerful. To disarm him might get Harry an advantage but doesnt mean an end to the duel. If Voldie is killed by any means it's over for good.

Furthermore, Harry doesnt kill the DE's being trampled. The crowd does. We dont know if Harry was using Confringo or the Full Body Bind, both of which are curses. One is most likely deadly and the other is just freezing you. The doesnt aim to kill them most likely.

Your point is that Harry is not a pacifist. That I can agree with. But still there are points in canon which can be seen as him being anti violence or pacifistic.

The biggest one I can think of atm is the Mystery of the Ice Cream Guy. Unlike Ollivander, there wasn't a good reason given for what happened to him or why he was targeted. From JKR's meta-commentary, apparently he was supposed to have something to do with finding the Diadem Horcrux, but the expotalk NPC job was given to another character.

That dangling thread is still left unfinished in the book, though.

I don't know if this one counts, but Hermione altered her parents' memory, and this is never addressed in the book after that mention. I thought there would be a subplot of the trio going to fix them and bring them back, but it never happened, and JKR said post-release that Hermione did it off-screen.

It's been addressed thoroughly in fanfic, but in canon, Hermione's parents never react to being constantly abandoned to spend vacations at school and at Grimmauld place, and all the dangerous things that happen to Hermione (or at least Hermione's guilt about covering up incident after incident).

Either they've always had a distant relationship with Hermione and they don't care that she's drifting away from them at such a young age, or they are heartbroken. Either way you'd expect Hermione to be conflicted about that relationship on-screen at some point.

**** Fanfic always seems to want to portray Hermione as having a loving close knit family with absolutely no issues. There's no indication of that at all in canon. I've always figured that her parents were 'career parents' who had a kid because that's what's expected and then went on with their careers.\\
Hermione would have grown up under the eye of a nanny, not exactly neglected but hardly under close supervision. Perhaps books were plied on her to keep her quiet/away from being underfoot. Her constant need to excel and prove herself might well have started as an attempt to get her parents approval, and just ended up being a personal drive.

She certainly didn't seem to complain about gradually spending less time with her parents, even skipping off very early in some of the summer holidays to be in the magical world. In book five she abandoned a skiing vacation in the Christmas holidays when she got wind that Harry was being a mopey lad.

I'd say there was just a lot of emotional distance between Hermione and her parents, and when the cultural distance joined in to help with that, she just let it happen.

Obliviating her parents, despite that, would have still been an emotionally troubling thing, but honestly i couldn't imagine her doing it if she had been as close to them as fics like to say.

On the other side of the coin is her insecurity about her intelligence when she isn't certain. That only really comes up around exams though - failing to a boggart, excessively worrying etc.\\
I mentioned before a drive to prove herself, and that does manifest negatively in the early parts of book one, at least. She's always raising her hand in class, sharing her opinion or knowledge about something out of the blue. It's what brings about the conflict with Ron. I guess it lessens after that, I'm not actually sure

That could all stem from a distant relationship with her parents. The problem though, for Rowling, is how to show that.\\
Rowling prefers to show, rather than tell. And it's a story about the wizarding world, so dedicating scenes to the muggle world wouldn't really fit her style i don't think.\\
Perhaps the general lack of anything about her parents is the manifestation of her relationship with them. They don't do anything, they don't have any relevance, and that could show that they aren't interested.

***** I mean, you would have to ignore that Bond would be nearly 80 years old by that point... or not. I think I actually prefer to imagine Bond as a old man with a Dumbledore beard teaching Defense. On his first day he takes down his entire seventh-year class by making them hit each other with spells.

****** I've always thought that James Bond was a name that someone took when they reached a certain level in MI6. Joe Blow when he reaches superspy status changes his name to James Bond to perpetuate the legend. Kind of like the Dread Pirate Roberts from the Princess Bride.

** *Book 1*

- Goblins - a powerful inhuman species that has repeatedly clashed with wizards, sounds interesting.

- Hey there are centaurs in the forest, that seem important.

- Fluffy, how did you get here and where did you go?

- So Lily's protection makes Harry able to sense Voldemort's presence, burn him with a touch, and spell resistant!? Imagine if he picked up a book containing a portion of Voldemort soul.

- So the Flamel's are a married couple of ~600 year old alchemists with unlimited money who owe Harry for protecting their source of immortality and wealth. Seems like that will be important later.

*Book 2*

- So there is another sentient species at Hogwart's called house elves that enjoy the kind of work the Dursley's force Harry to do? Seems like a great cover for more misadventures, especially since the Dursley's have literally starting imprisoning Harry over the summer.

- Deathday Party, neat. Can you tell us more about the HP afterlife?

- Hey there are sentient giant man eating spiders in the forest, that seem important.

- Are mandrakes sentient!? They throw partys so that seems like it should be a higher priority for Hermione, especially since she owes them her life.

- So what other secret's are in the Chamber of Secrets?

- What happened Lockhearts other victims?

*Book 3*

- I have so many questions about Dementors.

- So why did Lupin get to go to Hogwart's, and why isn't there any other werewolves at Hogwarts.

*Book 4*

- Veala, leprechauns, and a sphinx; are any of these going to be relevant?

- So there is merfolk village in the lake, going to do something interesting with that?

- How easy is it to create new magical creatures? Hagrid apparently creates a dangerous new species over the summer.

- Eternal Glory? So are triwizard champions going to be important somehow? What about Krum, he seems important.

- A Death Eater put multiple classes under the Imperious Curse, I have concerns.

- Wand ghosts remind us we still need an explanation of the HP afterlife.

*** Wand ghosts was explained, though. If I recall correctly, they were the result of a priori incantatem. The ghosts that come out of the wands are not actually ghosts, but echoes or representations of the people killed with that wand. Think of them like holograms with the ability to act and talk like their original counterparts would, but to a limited extent. Kinda like magic portraits do.
