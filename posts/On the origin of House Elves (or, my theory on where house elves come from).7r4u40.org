Where did house elves from from? This is a question never touched on in canon. Elves have magic of their own, but the only free elf we see is Dobby, and he very quickly becomes bound to another master. Obviously, at one point, elves had to come into existance. You could suppose they were expliciately created by wizards as servants, but my own theory is that something far more dark and sinister lurks in the history of the common house elf.

This is my theory:

House Elves used be Wild Elves, or Svartalves, native to Scandinavia and the Baltic region. Ever heard the legend of the Cobbler and the Elves? These were those kind of elves. They were naturally inclined to be helpful to humans as payment for being left alone and provided with cast off human objects. They mostly mended old things, clothes, pots, shoes, that sort of thing. However, wizards realized that a species naturally inclined to be helpful to humans and with the magic skills to back it up would be well worth taming.

At first, it was innocent enough. Wizards would invite in colonies of elves and provide them with things to fix, in return for safety from their natural predators; red caps, trolls, and panicked muggles. Soon, however, the wizards started demanding more. The elves had natural magic, and in some cases, fought back and demanded fair treatment. The wizards magic was stronger however, and they started using compelling charms and kidnapping young elves and pressing them into labor.

When the elves rebelled against this, the wizards cracked down. The elves had never been warlike, preferring to hide and disguise themselves instead of open confrontation. They were simply no match for wizards when it came to a fight, and soon wizards were enslaving grown elves, forcing them into labor. Then a group of slavers developed a binding enchantment that could force an elf to serve a wizard. The elf was bound to the wizards clothes, and forbidden from touching them. The enchantment could be broken if the elf was given clothes by its master, and that magic lingers today.

At first the elves tried to resist, but the wizards understood the basics of breeding livestock. They bred the resistance out of the elves, layered them with compelling charms, and eventually hunted down all the wild elves. They're extinct as a free and independent species as far as most are concerned, though rumors persist of independent colonies still hiding in isolated places in Scandinavia.

The worst part of it is, the elves were always sentient creatures. They were systematically mind controlled, enslaved, and broken, stripped of their identity and heritage. There was elvish art, an elvish language, and a thriving culture. It's all gone now. The elves do not remember, and precious few wizards cared.

This means that Dobby is a bit of a throwback, and perhaps one of the few remaining elves who hasn't been completely spelled into blind obedience and servitude. Even he has to follow the rules of the magic he is bound under by ancient spells, and he has been so modified by magic that he MUST have a master to serve, due to all the compulsion charms and genetic tampering that has gone on (even if the wizards don't know what DNA is they are likely capable of meddling with it). This means that with Dobby's death, perhaps the last of the resistance in the elvish bloodline died forever. Perhaps Hermione could work to free the elves, but would they even want it after being forced to depend on wizards for survival for so long?

I did see it mentioned in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/9/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived][The Mysterious Curse of the Girl Who Lived]] (not to be confused with that other 'Girl Who Lived') that house-elves were originally a kind of brownie.

That's fanfiction, but I'm pretty sure house-elves are based in those 'help out around the household, leave if paid' legends. But that raises the question; those household spirits aren't slaves, they leave if they're offended...so what happened to enslave the house-elves?

****** Umm, I may have a source annotated somewhere from when I was in the research phase for my House Elf character because I remember being bummed that it was from an "official" source (so an interview or Pottermore) and it torpedoed my initial plans but I'd have to go looking in my external drive. Oh, in fact, that might be it - before the old Pottermore went dark someone on here had PDF of all the worldbuilding information it contained and emailed it out on request. It's tickling my brain but I think /maybe/ that's where it was from

****** In 5e, ordinary kobolds are just CR 1/8, while drow elves are CR 1/4.

Although, that said, if you pull out the Player's Handbook and Volo's Guide in addition to the Monster Manual, you could build elves, drow, or kobolds with any NPC class you want, so they could be anywhere from CR 1/8 (tribal warrior) to CR 12 (archmage) then.

******* I mean in 3.5 if I really wanted I could get the right splat books and build a kobald half dragon with some insane CR but honestly in cases like that I'd just take something of the right CR, tweak its abilities, and just pretend it was a kobald.

*** Depends what kobolds you're talking about. The house-dwelling variety I take as just a name muggles made up for elves, of course, but the mine-dwelling kobolds are clearly Goblins.

*** Meh. Unless you really worldbuild deep, I don't think "fae" really fit together with the Potterverse. To me, most muggle lore about "the fair folk" are actually about wizards and the details were fudged when the Statute of Secrecy was passed.

** I like most of this, except (because I like my Potterverse a bit lighter-hearted) I don't think any inheritable mind-tampering was done --- there's just the one bond placed on every elf that forces them to obey their Master's orders, and everything else (/wanting/ to do housework, etc.) is just because those elves were born and raised under these work-obsessed customs.
