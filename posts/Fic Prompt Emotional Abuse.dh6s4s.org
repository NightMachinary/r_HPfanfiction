Set in OoTP. (but I'll happily accept other time-settings :P )

I've never really seen a fic that solely on emotional abuse, rather than neglect or physical or sexual abuse, and I'd like to read one (xD I hope that doesn't make me seem like a basket-case). Harry-centric, with non-Dursley abusers; perhaps Snape, or Ron, or Hermione, or McGonagall, or an OC, I don't really mind. Maybe even Sirius or Remus. Harry doesn't take it seriously, reminding himself that "at least I'm not locked up, or starved. This /is/ better than the Dursleys, and he/she/they love me, really," and "I'm 15/16, I'm too old to be bothered by this" or "I've faced a basilisk and dementors and Voldemort himself, am I really going to cry over someone calling me names? It's not as if it isn't true, anyway. They/she/he is only trying to help me." Perhaps the story can start off where even the reader doesn't realise where it would be going; for example, Sirius' recklessness can be played off as playfulness (he could take Harry out of the headquarters to a themepark even though it would place him in danger etc.), and an insistence that Harry be James-like could be seen as grief, or he's depressed/acting haunted and so Harry forgives him for lashing out (if you choose to write Sirius as the emotional abuser). Harry could try to talk to someone he trusts about it, Dumbledore or Ron or Hermione, and they could ask, concerned, "Has he/she hit you? Does she/he feed you enough?" type thing, and then it becomes more cemented in Harry's mind that nothing is wrong. Perhaps Harry goes back to Dursley coping mechanisms, calling Sirius "sir"/ referring to him as "Godfather Sirius" in his head (as a parallel to "Uncle Vernon"?) , cooking and cleaning about the house, hiding somewhere small and dark, or "punishing" himself when Sirius is upset (reminder: it doesn't have to be Sirius, that's just an example!) by withholding food, or forbidding himself from flying, or grounding himself/isolating himself from his friends, "since Sirius seemed unwilling to discipline him, Harry took it upon himself to exact his own punishments. He read the darkness in Sirius' eyes, the days of cold shoulder that cut to his soul, and realised he must have done something wrong again. This time he didn't reply to Hermione's owl. He let the letter, half-crumpled, fester on his desk, telling himself he deserved the silence from everyone." (or something like that? maybe less extreme and with more build-up?)

Emotional Abuse: 1) Criticism and manipulation, criticise constantly and manipulate into thinking they deserve the criticism. 2) Humiliation, puts them down in front of other people. 3) Control, (e.g. financially or socially; someone wants to go out with a friend, and the abuser throws a fit in order to guilt them into staying). 4) use of Verbal Abuse ( 1) Withholding, refusing to engage in healthy conversations/reveal thoughts and feelings, 2) Countering, shoot down ideas/insult, being really argumentative, discounting thoughts and feelings, 3) Discounting, denying the right to their thoughts/feelings - e.g. telling someone it's stupid every time they cry). You don't have to incorporate all of these, in fact all of these might be a little overkill, especially if you want to have the person accidentally emotionally abuse Harry... xD

As always, if there's already a fic out there like this, I'd /love/ to know about it and I'd be super greatful if you could link it!
