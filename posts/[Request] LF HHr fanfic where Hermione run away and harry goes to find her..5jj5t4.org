** Doesn't entirely fit your criteria but I absolutely loved linkffn(Breakfast in New York). Extremely well written imo, great plot development, etc.

*** The only issue I have with it is the muggle- and 'Murica wank in it. It goes for almost an entire chapter and is frankly a bit insulting if you're european.

Edit: Now that I've re-read it I remembered why I never finished it. Its like the author has a vendetta against anything magical. Everything muggle is superior and progressive, anything magical is backwards and dumb. Urgh...

**** Hmm...never actually noticed anything like that but I do know which chapter you are referring to. Though I suppose I am less likely to notice it since I am American. Oh well, to each their own.

***** It's the usual problem with those kind of stories - if there's a magical utopia where everything is so much better, why didn't they help with the fight against Voldemort? Why didn't anyone even consider moving there when things went grim for the muggleborns? Why didn't anyone know about this before? Especially muggleborns who are curious and well-traveled, like Hermione.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.

** A linkffn(Silly Ruler Waving by Horace Nihil) mostly fits the bill, even though the runaway part was not quite voluntary.

  Hermione Granger is fifteen, sixteen in a few weeks. She has this summer job in the local library she loves, but something is amiss. Why does she spend so much time waving things, like this ruler, in such a silly way ?
