** I've got a whole fanfiction series for if Harry was in Slytherin and he has a trio, but it's not dark. It's the original plot of the book but from Slytherin perspective. Don't want to give away too much though but if you're interested I can give you a link. (I've already written 3 of the books)

** Do you want a story about them actually in Slytherin? Or just having those qualities? Because I don't know that I've ever seen a good story where Ron is sorted into Slytherin, let alone one where he's still heroic.

Now that I think about it, are there even any good dark!trio in Slytherin stories? Usually it's just edgelord Harry with or without Hermione. And even when she's involved she's the mayor of Justification City, not actually dark.

*** The Chessmaster Series by Flye Autumne has the Trio sorted into Slytherin for various reasons, but are still good guys. (Harry got his introduction to the Wizarding World from Snape, Ron embraced his chess skills, and Hermione had a run-in with a witch who mentioned Old Magic.)

And being roommates with Draco Malfoy gives Harry and Ron even more reasons to despise and prank him.

**** I've read the first couple of that series and liked it, I don't remember why I stopped. I don't remember them being particularly dark, though that could be a product of their ages. They might be what the OP is looking for. Exception makes the rule, I suppose.

I'll have to go back and read again. I don't remember much about it.

*** I've seen many, many Dark!Trio stories, there are a bunch, and many with Slytherin!Ron (one of my faves), but I was wondering if there are any good ones with them being sorted into Slytherin without being evil.
