So there's this time travel series that I can't find. Read it a few years ago.

The first part involved Harry, Ron, and Hermione going back in time using a potion that they had to put their memories into in reverse order and then drink. They went back into their old bodies. Dumbledore's portrait helped them. I think they had one the war but there were too many casualties and they were heartbroken.

Also I can't remember if it was this one but there is a time travel fic where Harry and Ginny fool around sexually when they are way to young to be doing that, but it is their grown up minds in their adolescent bodies so they can't resist. I think it is a different one because the memory potion one above didn't involve Ginny going back, I thought, but maybe it did. Maybe one of the other characters died and Ginny was actually part of the group.

Anyway in that one, Mrs Weasley or someone catches them fooling around and Harry becomes alienated from the Weasley family. SPOILERS: Then later you find out it was all intentional, to protect the Weasleys from being close to Harry as the war heightened. I think in that one they had gone back multiple times and realized that this was the only way to keep the Weasley's from dying.

Yeah I think these are two different fics.

​

ANYWAY, for that first one with the memory potion, it ends with a big scene on a battlefield at Hogwarts...where Albus takes a hit of a curse for Harry and it somehow stops Voldie once and for all. Cuz Albus had actually gone back in time too! But you don't find that out until you read the sequel, which involves Albus Potter going back in time numerous times, changing little things, using different methods, I think, and when he comes to the future each time it is changed but not in the way he hoped so he keeps going back and eventually realizes he has to sacrifice himself by getting hit with a curse that is going to put a time limit on how much longer he can live. Then he memory charms everyone to forget he did that until he says a trigger word to release their memories, which he eventually does do at a Christmas party in the future.

Also in this fic I think Severus and Sirius become friends, and Sirius gets with some other girl and she gets pregnant and he is going to name the kid Elvendork as part of a deal with James Potter (Sr) that if he ever became friends with Sirius he had to name his kid that.

Anyone got a link?!

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.
