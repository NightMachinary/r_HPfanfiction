Hey there,

I am looking for some fics where Dumbledore shows off his power. I mean, Rowling said he is one of the most powerful wizards ever, but I never actually read a fic which actually does him justice. Mostly, he is portrayed as a manipulator who is defeated by Harry. I am looking for a fic where he actually duels Voldemort, like in Order of the Phoenix. Please share if you have read one.

Thanks.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, & the TWT in a way you have never seen. Alterate Universe.
