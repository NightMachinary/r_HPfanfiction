*** It's terrible. It's just wanking over how awesome the Geth are for chapters on end and how much everyone else sucks.

**** Geth, awesome? Everyone else, sucking? I guess I'm OK with that. We'll see if I feel the same when I finish/stop reading.

**** yeah but it's the best kind of terrible steamrolling. the kind where the steamrolling actually almost makes sense and imo it's way better than harry potter and the methods of +rationality+ shortsighted bitching.

its like if harry potter was the master of death but like a naruto jinchuriki so while he can manipulate death he has the deathly hallows and a voice in his head driving him insane, that could be a great story albeit with a hella steamrolling.

or even if he was like gandalf or the PotUS

also tbh it was less about everybody sucking and more about harry being god and a reaper and a prothean and gandalf and a supercomputer and thats what this thread is for and honestly Vulpine Wizard had harry being less overpowered but was still worse than HP:G.

tldr: Harry is god but in an */interesting/* way

  Death saw fit to save Harry Potter from his uncle when the man saw fit to stab the young man. A careless toss later and Harry found himself alone in the Mojave Desert, confused and scared. The Potter heir was now tasked with the immense task of surviving in the desert full of horrors and hardships. M for Violence and Vice. Warning Genderbend. people apparently savagely hate it
