Hi everyone!

I've been looking for a while now and can't seem to find this story anywhere (wish I knew the name).

Harry is in complete love with Hermione. Ginny is jealous and she gets a love portion recipe from Draco. It's some kind of portion that relies on magnetism and it only works when he is near Hogwarts. After she gives it to him it fades when he is away.

One other main thing I remember is that when ever Harry and Hermione had an orgasm there was a pink light and they said it was something like a harmonic convergence.

I'd like to read it again but can't remember anything else.

Hopefully one of you guys will be able to help outðŸ˜„


** I've read this! I cant remember what it is but I've read it! It'll be 80k+ words and on ffn or ao3 if that helps narrow it down (as those are the only search parameters I use)
