I'll admit I was a bit confused by the ambiguous ending. The last chapter and epilogue left me a tad disappointed, especially in comparison to the rest of the story.

Also, possible spoilers in case you haven't finished it yet.


** I thought the ending could be better and the author rushed it a bit. However, the general ideas were interesting. The similarities between Harry and Voldemort and showing Tom Riddle's past was pretty cool.

I feel like people are bashing the author too hard. He worked hard to produce quality content in a short period of time. No other author updates as much as him. Would like to see recommendations of fanfics similar to this that you guys think is better.

*** I'm not bashing the author at all, I'm just confused. The change in writing style for the last chapter just completely threw me off to the point where I couldn't understand what was happening.

The amount the author wrote in only six months is incredible and generally of exceptional quality, no doubt about that.

Not sure why you think I'm implying there is something better... O.o

** I think I might be the sole voice of support here, but I kind of enjoyed the ending. The last chapter fit thematically and the epilogue was kind of heart-warming. I actually had a bit of a smile as I finished the epilogue.

Now that's not to say that none of the criticism is valid. The change of prose style in the last chapter and epilogue isn't done well to be blunt. It is somewhat poetic at best but overall doesn't fit with the style of the 99% of the chapters.

I think it also comes down to how you view epilogues in fiction. I always see them as an optional extension of fan-servicing since that's all they are. The story ends at the last chapter, anything that happens in the epilogue is fan-service at best.

I think honestly that the author just got tired of writing A Cadmean Victory. The A/N and the work itself very much gave me the impression that the author wanted to move on to new things but felt obligated to finish up the work as quickly as possible. If you look at the beginning and the end of A Cadmean Victory, I think you see it at its worse. In between all of that, I think there's a touching romance with all of dirt and hurt that comes with it and a decent story of one man losing everything for a dream. It had decent writing and held my interest for all this time.

I also think that because A Cadmean Victory is Harry/Fleur it gets a bit more hate than it rightfully deserves, but that's just my love for HF pairing talking.

Maybe you can explain what happened and why you enjoyed it? What in the world happened 102 and how did Harry come back? Did he make Hedwig a horcrux or something? I don't get the wand stuff in the epilogue either. :/

**** So in Chapter 102 what I assumed happened was that Harry died and part of his soul took over Voldemort. And yes Hedwig was somewhat made into a Horcrux or somehow transported Harry's soul back to his body. Not really sure there. That's at least what I made of it and kind of just accepted it at face value to be satisfied. I honestly think just going with Harry beating Voldemort in a duel would have been better.

The wand stuff I assume to be only poetically significant, as symbol for Harry coming back and repairing her broken heart.

It isn't the greatest ending and probably on further reflection will be disappointing, but it was satisfactory enough I suppose? Does that make sense?

***** Harry's wand was the horcrux. Hedwig was also a horcrux. Fluer kept saying she felt a sliver of Harry's magic. that means the horcrux was there just wasnt perfect. (probably made by accident) I think Harry made the hedwig a horcrux by accident as well. The ending however was Harry and Voldemort. Voldemort killed Harry but Harry, being a spirit, took over Voldemort. Voldemort lashed out and we saw how similar they truly were. We also see that Harry even as a spirit is as strong as Voldemort. Harry never truly died, so Voldemort did. Voldemort, with no other horcruxes, could not survive being possessed by another. So Harry ended up Killing Voldemort the same way Voldemort survived in the first place.

****** I understood it a bit differently. To me, Harry made a horcrux and anchored it in the elder wand when he knew he couldn't win against Voldemort, he then possessed his owl (the same way Voldemort possessed Quirrell) to return the Horcrux and the other half of his soul (the one possessing Hedwidge) to his physical body.

This would explain why the owl's body was deteriorating.

It would also explain why Voldemort was fed images from Harry's life when he picked up the elder wand. The same way the locket corrupted Hermione by showing her what she feared, Harry's horcrux showed love to Voldemort, which is what was supposed to be the "power he knows not" since the beginning. This in turn reminded Tom of a time long ago when he had loved (the ambiguous Myrtile parts of chapter 102).

Which stays within the idea of "no light or dark, only intent", as even what is considered the darkest of magics, a horcrux, was used with the intent of redeeming instead of corrupting.

I'm not sure this was the intent (ha) of the author, but that's what I understood from it. I suppose there is no real way to know whether it was Harry's horcrux that had this effect on Voldemort or if he possessed him before possessing his owl.

** I dropped off the last 25 chapters or so and just skimmed them. Totally lost interest in the characters and the premise. Plus the plot got extremely dragging with no real action or purpose for the length. Sad because it started well enough (although extremely flawed) and just couldn't hold up with the frenetic pace the author wrote at.

I wasn't even the remotest bit sad when Harry died, and as others have pointed out, it was literally the point that he would die.

The last two chapters were a confusing mess, poorly written and structured. The implication that Voldemort and Harry are the same is just kind of tacked on with no foreshadowing or lead-in, and no payoff, so why bother adding it?

And yes, it seems that Harry made Hedwig a horcrux, or his soul just went into her wholesale or something. Whatever, it doesn't really matter. The Harry/Fleur romance was a codependent unhealthy mess anyway. If I had friends that acted like them I would advise therapy and a long break from each other.

Still, it's a completed Harry/Fleur fic that is readable, if crazily flawed. Endings suck anyway, and at least this one is so poorly written that you can almost read anything into it. Maybe Fleur just went batshit at the end of it.

** For a story that attempted to do Harry/Fleur, with a Harry that was both grey, and unhindered by remorse, I think the author did well for their first try.

there are many issues however. The characters do not change after Harry and Fleur get together, the romance between the two is a bit fucked up, and we have an author that... from the evidence, got disenfranchised with the entire project after the death of Katie.

There are however some AMAZING aspects. the spell creation of the work is top tier. Harry gains power realistically. the update to quality ratio was pretty great. Bloodmagic made sense. the characters, while OOC, where also in character through out the entire fic. INCLUDING THE ENDING. It would be exactly like Harry, knowing that Voldemort will kill him that there isnt a way for him to escape, to use his death to ensure that Voldemort died. Voldemort, was always fascinated by the fact that he had found an "equal". When he finally killed his equal, he was at a loss... which allowed Harry as a spirit to take over.

the part I did not like, is not the terrible story, because in reality it was still better than most of the stories out in the fandom, it was the Stalling. throughout the entire work,especially around the middle (from the beginnings of Fifth year up too the end of sixth.) there were little to no real action. We have a grand total of sevenish major nonrelationship accomplishments, in over 60 chapters. so.. yea. The author was attempting to stall a bit in my opinion. HOWEVER. It is still one of the ONLY complete Harry/Fluer stories out there that is actually readable. my ranking of the entire work would be 3.9/5.

And you're right, all of the spell creation and ritual stuff was awesome, some of the best ive read in fan-fiction!

I also really like that Voldemort felt loss in the end when his equal 'died', and did the author imply that Myrtle was his best friend at one point? That seems like an original idea I haven't read before.

But yeah, the pacing was a bit off especially in the middle. At least it was finished though! :)

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** I loved this story from about part way through 5th year onwards. Especially after the Department of Mysteries. I actually enjoyed the end (except for the epilogue). It felt a tad rushed in the end but at the same time, it fit in the story because Voldemort forced Harry's hand to come and fight. Harry didn't get to pick when to battle him. I loved watching Harry become powerful [and eventually lead to his downfall. Had he been less paranoid and trusted Dumbledore, he would have survived. Instead, Harry became one of the most powerful people possible and it still was not good enough to take down Voldemort. I love a truly powerful Voldemort and I thought the last chapter with Voldemort's history was interesting if a little weird. I wish he had either A. Let Harry win but lose Fleur. or B. Let Harry just die after his sacrifice].

** I think one thing people have missed is that "a cadmean victory" can also refer to cadmus peverell, not just the greek mythological cadmus. Cadmus Peverell hoped to use the Resurrection Stone to resurrect his fiancée. In the last chapter, Fleur vows to resurrect Harry, and then he resurrects himself before her eyes! So in that sense as well, it's a cadmean victory.

I quite liked it, though I think the last few chapters were rushed and as a result have a poorer writing quality than the middle of the story (the first 10 chapters are also fairly poor).

As for what I think happened in the ending, it's clear that his wand was a horcrux, almost certainly created when he killed pettigrew. When Harry died, his soul went in to Voldemort, and then after Voldemort's body died Harry's soul possessed Hedwig, though it seems possible Harry now has Voldemort's memories and/or magic.

** I realize this topic is old, but I just finally now managed to finish the story.

I found the styling of the last chapter pretty annoying. I can kinda understand what the author was trying to do and why he wanted to do it that way. It just made it feel contrived, though. The content is good (It showcases again the similarities between Harry and Voldemort, and also the one defining difference: finding an equal partner. Myrtle did not accept Riddle completely as Fleur did Harry.) but the "introspective" styling as he called it, made his point needlessly obtuse.

I really have no problem with the epilogue. It is very very ambiguous, though. My current theory is that the first AK Voldemort hit Harry with created two botched horcruxes: one in Harry and one in Voldemort. Soul bits of each were flying around and meshed together in both their bodies. This explains why Voldemort loses himself in a blend of himself and Harry in the last chapter. The Harry soul fragment in Voldemort is no longer dormant and the two soul fragments fight for dominance. During that fight, Voldemort's body dies. The shade possesses Hedwig, takes the Elder wand, and eventually makes its way to France. Since the killing curse, according to the author, rips away the soul, Harry's body should be otherwise unharmed, especially since Fleur has preserved it like Dumbledore's. The shade leaves Hedwig (liking killing her) and then joins with Harry's body. The last question is: which soul fragment won? It was a blend of Harry and Voldemort last we saw, and we truly don't know which was victorious. We just know it's in Harry's body. That's the real kicker, and really the only thing that bothers me. It's ambiguous but almost in a good way.

As for the title being a misnomer, it is never said whose victory was Cadmean. Before the fic ends, it could refer to Harry, Voldemort, Dumbledore, or the Ministry: the four sides of conflict. (Of course, two sides are wiped out before the end, too.) Based on the author's definition (Spartans at Thermopylae), it just means that the eventual loser put up a disproportionately good fight. If the Harry soul fragment is dominant, it refers to Voldemort, and if the Voldemort soul fragment is dominant, then it refers to Harry. I'd say the title fits, regardless.

*** Interesting perspective!

See, my problem is not that I dislike ambiguous endings, I actually like them (for example, in the film Inception). What I don't like is when the ambiguous ending is itself ambiguous.

That might sound stupid, but what I mean is that: I like ambiguous endings when the possible endings are known to the audience/reader.

Using my example of Inception, there are two possible choices for the end of the film: either the top keeps spinning and he's in the dream world, or it stops spinning and he's in the real world.

With 'A Cadmean Victory' the possible endings are themselves ambiguous; it's not made even remotely clear what happened.

Maybe we, the readers, are supposed to wonder if it's Voldemorts spirit in the body at the end of the epilogue or Harry's. But how the souls became one, or didn't, and how Harry made a hocrux (accidentally or not), or didn't, isn't made clear in the first place.

It would be like trying to answer a multiple choice question without even knowing what the question is! >_<

/That/ is my problem with the story. Hopefully what I said made sense, I've had very little sleep today so it could just be a mash of words, lol.
