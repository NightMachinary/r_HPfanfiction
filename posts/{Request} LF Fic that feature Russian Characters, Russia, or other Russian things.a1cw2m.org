** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/betagyre/pseuds/betagyre][A Marked Deck]] by betagyre (sequel to [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/450724][Choosing Grey]]) has a plotline in Russia.

linkao3(5121731) and linkao3(6638233)

Flye Autumne's Chessmaster series also has a subplot with Russian characters. I can't remember which story it started in, but the whole series is worth a read! The first one is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11543934/chapters/25921356][The Chessmaster: Black Pawn]].

#+begin_quote
  Hermione has always been a warrior for the Light. But when an attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands her in 1944, she quickly realizes that sometimes it is best to allow a lesser evil to flourish, because defeating it only creates the conditions for a greater one to rise. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?

  Minister for Magic Tom Riddle has a family and a position of immense political power, and he must adapt to the responsibility that comes with both. But Hermione has much to adjust to as well, married to someone who is still very much a power-hungry Dark wizard. Follows Choosing Grey.
