I am trying to recall a fanfic. Harry is able to converse with the bit of Tom Riddle in his scar; Hermione ends up being his love interest and herself has some sort of presence in her mind. Anyway, they turn out to be dark and that's all I can really remember.

Any links would be greatly appreciated. Also, any solid recs for Dark! Harry x Hermione would be great. Thanks!


** I believe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6770408/1/The-Dawn-of-a-Golden-Age][The Dawn of a Golden Age]] is what you're looking for.

As far as recommendations for other dark hhr stories, I have a few:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7662761/1/Charade][Charade]] "He wasn't the misunderstood victim everyone thought him to be or the chosen savior decked in the purity of the light. He was the exact opposite, and he had fooled them all. Dark! Evil! Harry. Slight Dumbledore and Weasely Bashing. Harry/Hermione! One-shot"

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9028035/1/Dirty-Little-Witch][Dirty Little Witch]] "It's the summer after 5th year and Harry is not a happy camper. With his godfather dead, Harry has nobody left to turn to. Except one. One who has been with him since the beginning..."

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4478398/1/Riddick][Riddick]] "He was ostricized by the very people he was destined to protect and sent to Azkaban. However, they never imaginged that sending Harry Potter away would create something much darker, and a helluva lot more badass. H/Hr"

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5515009/1/The-Serpent-Court][The Serpent Court]] "During the summer after Sirius' death, Harry discovers some things about His mother and Hermione. A/U DarkHarry, DarkHermione"

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8885902/1/Remedial-Lessons][Remedial Lessons]] "AU OotP. What if Hermione had taken a more proactive stance against Harry's treatment by Snape and Umbridge? How far is too far to go to protect someone you love? Complete."

The last one is a shameless self-plug of my own fic, and it's more Dark!Hermione than anything, but it is H/Hr, so I think it counts. The rest are pretty solid and well-written (and Riddick is hilarious!) so you should be good for a while. Hope this helps!
