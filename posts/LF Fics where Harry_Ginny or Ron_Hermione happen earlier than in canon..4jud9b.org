Don't particularly care when either of them happen as long as it's earlier than in canon. I think that would be pretty interesting.


** This one was tickling my brain. Linkffn(nightmares of future past). This was one of the first fics I ever read. Another fix it time travel fic.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650): they started shagging each other during the summer after year 5.

Of the hundred fics I read, that's only one I can think of in which Ron and Hermione got together before year 7.

If you are just looking for Harry and Ginny getting together earlier, then there are too many to count.

Didn't Ron and Hermione get together early in "The Accidental Animagus" as well? I'm not quite certain.

** Linkffn(the book of Morgan le fey) is an old (pre-HBP) that is Ron centric. It runs together with the seventh year sequel, but I'm pretty sure Ron gets together with Hermione in 6th year.

I agree with [[/u/inquisitorcoc]]: there are LOTS of h/g fics that happen early. H/g as a pairing frequently doesn't do much for me, but my favorites are linkffn(the amplitude frequency and resistance of the soul bond) and linkffn(backwards with a purpose: always and always). The former is not a typical soulbond fic, and contains one of my favorite dumbledores of any fic. The latter, if you haven't read it, is a time travel fic where harry and Ginny go back together (and so they're ten and eleven when they start dating).
