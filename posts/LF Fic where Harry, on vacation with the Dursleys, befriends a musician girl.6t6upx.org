All I can remember was this entity in disguise staging a freak out to scare Harry into the bar she worked at. If anyone actually knows of the fic I'm talking about, that would be amazing.


** That would be linkffn(Ganymede Rising by Krahae).

  A slightly different take on indy!Harry. A summer vacation leads Harry to do some exploring someplace not so far afield. Sixteen, bored, and faced with the newest threat to his sanity - the cute waitress. Music and a little mayhem. Post 5th, slight AU.

*** YEP! I scrolled down for like three seconds and if the Lazarus Long quote up top didn't do it, seeing Hettie's name did. Thank you very much.

Edit: And having re-read it, I'm sad that it's part one in something that was planned for two or three chapters. :(

Alas, at least I have that much.
