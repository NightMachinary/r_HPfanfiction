Bonus points if they're actually good at music.

** There was a story I read years ago (before I kept records of the stories I read) that involved Harry and friends talking about starting a band in order to become popular with girls. It was probably a crack one-shot, because, IIRC, they were choosing instruments like accordion, bagpipes, and ukulele because, in the wizarding world, guitars were for dorks and losers.

** I'm pretty sure I once read a fic where Harry and Ron, and possibly Draco and Neville as well, start a band. None of them can sing, but Ron (IIRC) remembers a spell which makes your singing voice amazing. In their first public performance, they find out the spell was actually made to make the /singer/ think their voice was good. I'm pretty sure Snape made a few remarks about 'getting a laugh, if nothing else', or something along those lines.

Unfortunately, I'm at a loss for the name. Pretty sure it was on FFN though, so if anyone could swoop in and save the day...

** linkffn(6243985)

Warning that I think the sequel is abandoned.

It is an unusual fic, read it a few years ago but from what I remember it starts like any other ‘Harry gets sorted elsewhere and makes different friends; then as they get older it gets further and further from canon and starts introducing bdsm relationships, foursomes, cross dressing/gender queerness etc. Also it falls into the kids being unrealistically smart and capable and fixing the world trope.

BUT it does have Harry Neville Draco and Luna starting a band and I remember it being an interesting read

  A sort of different Harry Potter is sorted into Ravenclaw in his first year. Sticks to canon very loosely. Goes through first year and beyond. SLASH, HET, FEMSLASH, HPDM, HPNL, HPLL, and other pairings. MATURE readers only please!
