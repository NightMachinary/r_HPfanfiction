:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All I remember is that a new timeline is not made - everyone from ther past remembers her, they just think she's a different Hermione or named after her.

Edit: I remember vaguely that it might've been an accident for her to go back? She was still young, not an adult going back or anything.

Edit 2: it was definitely a completed fic and no later than about 2019.


** Is it this one? linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10734054]])

It's one of my favourites and I highly recommended it even if it's not the story you're looking for!

  Time-Turners are dangerous devices, and awful things happen to wizards and witches who meddle with time.Or do they?For Hermione Granger, an accident that leads her back in time changes the course of nearly a dozen lives, her own included: love where there was none before, hope where it was lost, trust where it had always been suspect.A young Gryffindor girl that hadn't existed before.For Aurora Snape, starting school when the threat against Muggle-borns and the Chamber of Secrets makes it more difficult to be the Potions master's daughter. Or making Draco see that his perception of Muggle-borns is wrong. And it certainly doesn't help when one of the few Gryffindors who is nice to her is the one person who really shouldn't know her too well: her mother.

** I don't know if it's this? It's very good anyway, even if it's not the one.

Edit: Can someone please tell me why TF this is downvoted? I literally answered the question with what I thought it might be so is not off topic. It doesn't break the rule as she and Snape are the same age / no underage shit.

**** Thank you, that's what I thought. I was downvoted before when someone asked for the same pairing and I suggested this one. This is actually a really sweet story and it feels natural as they are friends first with a gradual change to romance.

  Haunted by her lack of action towards Severus Snape in the Shrieking Shack, Hermione Granger decides that the best place to intervene and work on the problem of restoring her parent's memories is Hogwarts -- over twenty years before the battle.
