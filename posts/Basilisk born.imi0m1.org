Damn. Damn. How can someone write like this. Just can't get enough of this chapter. Ebenbild. You are amazing. Truly truly amazing.


** This Wizengamot meeting has taken years to reach, and it's going to take months more before it concludes. $10 says they make the next chapter another flashback.

*** I actually thought this chapter would be a flashback and the author mentioned they wanted to do that. Thankfully they were merciful .

** The last two flashback chapters were really painfully dull and confusing to read

*** I definitely agree, the flashbacks got progressively more dull the closer they got to the present, to the point where past Grindelwald's war I was skimming each of them

**** I didn't so much mind Grindelwald's war. It was Voldemort's war that was vague, uninformative, and repetitive. It seemed like it tried to drag things out for suspense, but mostly it just fell flat and even though /everything/ repeated I have no idea what happened except that I don't think time was linear for unknown reasons

***** I didn't mind Grindelwald's war either, maybe I said it wrong but I'm meant after that war it got progressively more dull. It was rather interesting and insightful. But past that, I feel like the author realized how close to the present the flashbacks were getting, yet wanted to continue to format of alternating between flashbacks and the present which caused them to start dragging the plot and jumping around more. It's a really bizarre read where one chapter I'm disinterested and end up skimming through it, whereas the next I'm delighting in the plot and savouring every word.

****** The repetitive flashback dreams? Omg I wanted to scream. Everything just keeps dragging on and on and while I was really into this story last year now I'm about ready to cut it loose.

There's been a few stories (in various fandoms) I've encountered where it keeps building and building and never goes anywhere. Eventually I stop waiting and just stop following the story instead. If it takes too long to get to the point, I'm not going to still care when the author finally gets there.

** While it was good, the flashback scenes, where it was a literal copy and paste of past chapters, were a pain to read through and was generally confusing. I had several headscratching moments that had me wondering if I was reading a reposted chapter. Most of the length of this fic was because of copypasta.

Would love for the author to redo those chapters and just delete those or briefly mention the flashbacks and non dedicate a whole new chapter for a copy pasta with a few lines added in.
