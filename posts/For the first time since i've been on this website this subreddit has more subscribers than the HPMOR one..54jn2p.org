** To be fair, that story was enjoyed by a lot more people than just fan fiction fans. And I suspect that your title is correct only because hpmor is now completed and old.

****** oh god, I swear i'm not this slow usually but I'm completely lost. What's a marmite story? Google gives me the history of marmite. And DAYD is dumbledore's army and the year of darkness? I've not read that one, I don't think.
