First, lets define Gary-Stu A Gary-Stu is a male protatagonist who does not face any challenges in the story.They are commonly fully developed characters in the beginning of the work. A Non-Stu is a Character that does not face any challenges like a gary-stu however is not developed.

My question for you is thus; Would you rather read a character who is a Gary-Stu, or a character that is defined as a Non-stu?


** I want to read a good story with an interesting and carefully thought plot which has believable and likeable characters. Well written is a plus... but I'm usually ok with average written skills.

If you tick all these boxes I probably won't mind Mary Sues/Gary-Stu characters. Unless they are too annoying and irritating - but then, I guess they wouldn't fit the true Mary/Gary stereotype, right?

However, my advice is stop to worry too much about what people might want to read. Write what you would like to read and write instead and I'm sure you will find some people that have similar tastes along the way.

*** I am not asking for me, Im asking out of curiousity. I see so many "Gary-stu is evil" posts, yet in my mind I am giving a worse option. I want to know if posters hate Gary-stus or if they hate badly written characters.

**** Both are crap, so there's no point in asking which of those is worse.

Because both of those are characters who face no challenges and who remain static throughout the story, which makes them just as shitty regardless of the so-called “stage of development” they start on.

Have the character challenged by something, best if it's at least partially his own shortcomings (or what he thinks to be ones), and have the character develop /some amount/ in /some way/, any way, and you'll probably end up with something readable; don't do it instead and you'll end up with puke pudding.

**** Would you rather freeze to death or burn to death? Trump or Clinton? Let a skunk spray you or go for a dip in a septic tank? Yeah, one is worse, but neither are good.

** Neither. I want to read about a character who does face challenges.

** I'd argue that both characters are not developed. A cutout character a'la Non-stu is just an hour of "character development" short of being a Gary-Stu. Both are bad writing and would be carried by the surrounding story, if at all.

** Depends on my mood really. I have read some gary-stu's that were good only because you knew going in what it was. Mostly humor stories.

Generally no I would like the characters to develop and not be all powerful. It takes away too much from the story.
