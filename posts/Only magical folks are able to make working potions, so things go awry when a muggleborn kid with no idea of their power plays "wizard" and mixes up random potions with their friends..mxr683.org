It seems like every kid ever at some point will mix a bunch of random crap into a bowl or bucket and call it a potion. So what could happen if that kid was magical and didn't know it?

** Deep in the ministry of magic, there is an astounding amount of paperwork. Some of it gets checked out daily, some is filled once to never look at it again. Belonging to the last group, deep within the misinformation department lies a Red folder.

If you were to read it, you would find a collection of accidents and magical events that got buried away from the muggles. About half of it is made of wartime events: Giants rampaging, terrorist strikes and unexplained murders. The other half... well...

Potions are an extremely complicated and dangerous subject. Most of the advances in the subject was made by squibs, because their minimal amount of magic that keeps them away from the wanded arts allows them nonetheless to brew potions like normal. Any potion master can tell you about their best recipes, using strange magical reagents. What potion making squibs know, is that potions only need the magic of the brewer to work, and most, if not any of the reagents can be swapped by mundane elements.

The Aforementioned second half of the Red folder, deep within the ministry of magic archives, then, contains a disturbingly high amount of muggleborn witches and wizards who don't manage to reach schooling age. Potions are volatile after all...

*** Doubtful. It seems like the trace doesn't apply before they get their wands otherwise kids would be getting in trouble for accidental magic. I'm sure it would be classed as accidental magic if the magic in potion-making was even detected at all.

**** Yeah it seems like even after kids start attending Hogwarts, using magical objects and things at home doesn't trigger it. It has to be a spell. For example, lots of kid have brooms and practice on broomsticks at home. Harry even had a broomstick when he was a toddler. My brain kinda remembers Draco saying something about a potions kit at some point but maybe that happened in a fanfiction and my brain mushed it together with canon.

***** I mean it wouldn't have to be chemicals. There are all kinds of mundane things that are potion ingredients in some potions. See bananas, aconite, bone, dandelion root, etc. on this list:

********* One time I was a kid we dug a hole and found a cat skeleton then made a potion out of it with manroot and all kinds of crap.

My point is, potions go really wrong all the time if you do wrong steps or use wrong ingredients. Like look at Neville jacking them up constantly. There's probably thousands of combinations of plants and animal parts wizards just don't mix because it explodes, or turns into magic cement and fouls up the cauldron, or melts your tools etc.

******* A cauldron is just a vessel made of a specific metal. Nothing inherently magical about it unless it's been reinforced magically. Muggles also /do/ have cauldrons, it's not unheard of.

As for magical ingredients, the actual recipes that we do know have mostly mundane ingredients in the list. Are we really claiming it's impossible for muggles to unknowingly have access to magical plants? That kids never get into neighbors' gardens/yards and pilfer things they think look interesting? Accidents, no matter how unlikely, happen all the time in the real world.

********* Pewter was what was on the list. Pewter is just an alloy of copper, tin, and antimony, nothing inherently magical about it.

I've got practically an entire essay on another site that hypothesizes the relation between potions and chemistry and why cauldron metal *type* might make a difference in potion success or efficacy, but we don't have canon facts that say a potion actually needs to be made in a cauldron (as in, the shape of the vessel) versus a large kitchen pot made of similar metals. I mean, they still write on animal skins (parchment) instead of paper with quills instead of pens, cauldrons could be another relic that stuck around because they don't seem to change what still works for them.

(At least, if we do have something that explicitly says cauldrons over any other vessel type is needed, I haven't seen it or don't recall and would love a point in the right direction!)
