After Voldemorts defeat, there is a Dark Lady who intents to take the Power and she seems to be even more powerful than Voldemort. But instead of kill Harry, she intents to tempting him to join her. Either he is resistant from the very beginning or his resistance is going weaker with any try she does (something like a Poison Ivy or a Veela). If Harry is married with Ginny, the marriage will get destroyed (since harry feels attracted to her and/has even visions about him having sex with her) or Ginny will get tempted as well.

The story is about a humanized fem!Voldemort attempting to manipulate Harry through his heart rather than simply trying to kill him. No romance/sexuality so far. I do find their relationship to be somewhat unsettling, though competently written.

Minor warning: The fic isn't finished and has about a chapter a month pace.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** What motivation would she have for focusing on Harry, though? Harry is, at this point, a celebrity and an above-average Auror. Is there another prophecy, or something?

*** I can think of a couple reasons:

Harry was Voldemort's end. It would take an exceptionally stupid or arrogant person to ignore someone who ended a previous Dark Lord that otherwise had the British Ministry dead to rights.

Harry also has an enormous amount of political capital. If anyone could get a large quantity of wizards moving in the right direction, it's him. Especially against a Dark Lady.

Depending on how much information is public, Harry could also be seen as Dumbledore's protege. Certainly people will talk about Dumbledore giving Harry private lessons in his sixth year, after which Harry ends Voldemort. Aside from magical prowess that implies, Harry could be a keeper of Dumbledore's secrets along with following in his footsteps.

**** Interesting... It sounds like setting up a comedy of errors, rather than anything serious, though. Harry's victory was a consequence of a very specific set of circumstances, Dumbledore's planning, and a large amount of luck, none of which are likely to recur; he isn't overwhelmingly better than his peers at magical combat, or general magic, for that matter; and he hadn't learned anything from Dumbledore anything that is applicable outside of fighting Voldemort.

On further thought, a comedy of errors could work pretty well, if framed right: you have this brilliant Dark Witch bent on world conquest, and she's worried about Harry Potter, the downfall of the last person to attempt it. She investigates stories about him, including how he brought town Voldemort with a Disarming Charm, came back from the dead, wields the Elder Wand, etc.. In light of all this, she is not confident that she can simply kill him outright, so she tries to get close to him to ferret out his secrets and get him when he is vulnerable.

Harry might be reluctant to talk about the past, which she interprets as him being secretive, and things like a sarcastic jibe ("Enough with the Voldemort questions! Are you trying to follow him in his footsteps?") she interprets as him possibly being on to her.

This could go on for quite a while.

***** Comedy of errors is how I would describe the wizarding public and their Ministry in general. It doesn't matter whether any of the things I mentioned in my post are true; those are the things that will get reported because people don't want to hear the details.

For example, even the people in the Great Hall as Harry and Voldemort are having their discussion aren't going to follow the conversation well. Almost none of them anything know about the Elder Wand, its journey from Grindelwald to Draco, or that Voldemort was even having issues finding a wand to work against Harry in the first place. Combined with battle fatigue and distractions, all people are going to remember is that Harry appeared from thin air, saved Molly Weasley's life, and killed Voldemort in a duel.

To be honest, the only two people that can follow events from beginning to end are Ron and Hermione. Dumbledore's and Snape's portraits can guess at a lot, but I can't imagine any of the above talking too much to anyone about it.

With no one to provide clarity, I could see even someone intelligent and serious about researching Harry to be victim of bad information. They might know things don't add up, but with enough verifiable events that /are/ scary (basilisk, tournament, Gringotts), I wouldn't blame anyone for being wary of him.

Aside from all that, someone had to manufacture those specific sets of circumstances. Sure Dumbledore had a large hand in it, but Harry saw it through after almost a year and plenty of work of his own. Who is to say he couldn't manufacture more circumstances and make his own luck, as he does in pretty much every book?

****** That's my point. She could have just crushed him all along, but she gets a mistaken impression that he is more dangerous to her than he actually is.

When openings and opportunities drop in his lap through no merit of his own, he is generally good at taking advantage of them. He doesn't really plan ahead or prepare contingencies, however. That's usually Dumbledore's and Hermione's job.

That might make for a good ending, actually: the Dark Lady is foiled by Hermione and Ron. They'd become suspicious of this floozy who's been trying to break up Harry and Ginny and investigated her, setting some traps along the way, all with Harry being none the wiser. After all, the more people would overestimate Harry, the more they would underestimate his friends.
