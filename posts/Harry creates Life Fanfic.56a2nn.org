  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

  Oneshot from Ron's POV. Ron tries to explain to the twins just how Harry made the Ministry of Magic make a new classification for magical creatures, and why the puffskeins were now considered the scariest magical creature of all time. No pairings.

** I have a hiatus story where harry asks "what if a phoenix sat on a dragon's egg like a toad on a chicken's egg?" and it results in a faerie dragon with ornate feathered butterflyesque wings about the size of a person. They'd end up being a high-status pet.

I may add them to my sttng/hp story or my darkness!harry story if I ever figure out a reason to add them. I really loved the idea of them and want to but they have to be plot relevant.
