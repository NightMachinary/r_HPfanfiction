Sorry to bug you all, but for the life of me I cannot recall this story. Here are key scenes:

Most vivid in my memory: 1. Lucius Malfoy and other DE's attack Harry at Privet Drive. 2. Harry fights back, doing fairly decent. 3. Harry conjures some large creature that can't see be destroyed 4. Dumbledore Marvel's over the creation

Harry survives the fight with the DE's (I can't recall if Lucius does) 5. Dumbledore and Harry have a friendly duel and where Dumbledore destroys this special construct with a single spell, leaving Harry flabbergasted.

Definitely Post GOF, might even be Post OOTP too. Any help would be marvelous. Thanks in advance
