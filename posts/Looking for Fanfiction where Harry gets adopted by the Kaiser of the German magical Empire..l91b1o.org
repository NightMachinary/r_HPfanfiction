This story got deleted off F[[https://fanfiction.net][anfiction.net]] a few years ago but i havent been able to stop thinking about it nor find it. If i remember correctly it's about Harry being adopted by the kaiser of the German magical empire which survived the ww1. Making him the Crown prince. That fanficiton had the word Kaiser in the title, it was rated T or M. But unfortunately i dont remember much else. Big thank you if any of you manage to find a copy of the story and link it to me.

** Is this the one you were looking for? I found a Harry Potter Kaiserreich story on a Russian archiving/translation site, though the link to FFN is dead.

**** No, unfortunately. The author appears to have vanished alongside their story.
