Inspired by the H/Tonks one-shot request post earlier, I cannot find a fic I remember reading a few years ago. I am pretty sure it is post-war and Tonks survives obviously, then she and Harry turn to some magical drug to recover from the war and become increasingly addicted. Tonks then goes to Romania to get clean with Charlie of which Harry is super jealous so Harry lies to her about trying to get clean as well. Thanks in advance!
