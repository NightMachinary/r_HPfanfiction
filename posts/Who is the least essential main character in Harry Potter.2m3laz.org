** Don't get me wrong, there are some great stories featuring her and fleshing out her character, but I always thought that, in canon, Tonks was a bit superfluous. It really felt like Rowling didn't quite know what to do with her. She was kind of an Exposition Girl in Book 5, then was crushing hard on Remus out of nowhere in Book 6, then got kicked-off screen with pregnancy in Book 7 and then died.

*** She added character to the Order, making it seem like more than just a bunch of Albus' old friends being dragged out of retirement. Her troubles with convincing Remus of her earnest attraction highlighted the plight of living with a disease. She explained a bit about the operations of law enforcement without getting weird about it, and helped to develop Hufflepuff House into more than a recycling bin.

What kills me (and probably others) is how much of her character goes to waste. At the height of the war when her skills and special ability would be most useful & interesting to hear about, she's sidelined for a pregnancy. When she rises out of that penalty box, she's murdered off-screen in a death less meaningful than that of Colin Creevey.

Way to devalue the amazons, Miss Rowling.

*** That's true of many pairs of characters. You could condense the series into Dumbledore, Voldemort, Harry, Snape, Hermione, Sirius, Pettigrew, Malfoy, Hagrid, Buckbeak, Umbridge, Skeeter, and Fudge.

You could even condense Hermione and Harry into one character, resulting in a hero of the wizarding world who is studious and conscientious, which would be appropriate and expected, but that would be a bit problematic from a narrative point of view -- the protagonist would not have anyone to converse with during their adventures.

You could also condense Umbridge and Fudge into the same character, but having a major politician / head of state type figure take control of a school would be too bizarre for anyone to believe. ... Not at all believable. Not even slightly. Nosirree.

#+end_quote

And what was that character? I hear this a lot, but I don't see it backed up by strong arguments. Start actually mapping out the adjectives you'd use to describe him, and how that changed over the series. It is sort of bleak.

--------------

We know what the twins were into because people were always talking about them, what they liked and didn't like and what they did. Their grand ambitions were eventually revealed and they even had their aristeia, their moment of greatness. Which was ruined (like a lot of things) by DH off screen, twice. But they still had something strong to ruin, is my point.

They worked hard and had obstacles to overcome. They achieved goals and had strong internal motivations. Their unique personality was well fleshed out and they served a very specific purpose in the story. They even had adventures before the story started, gaining a reputation and a super-powerful magic item. They came into the story as people, not cardboard cutouts. Ron was a blank and boring slate, and remained so, not so much as a character trait but because it was easier and quicker than making him a real character.

At least Harry goes from Mickey Mouse everyman dishrag to angry dishrag. Ron doesn't even do that. People don't talk about him, except in the negative. He doesn't talk about his own life or goals. He doesn't seem to even have goals until the year he tries out for the quidditch team.

It is only then, at the last moment, that he gets his brothers to help him practice to be good enough to be a keeper. That is the first time that is ever mentioned, not because Ron is a shy and interesting person, but because it was the fastest way to shoehorn him onto the team. But this is still one of his strongest character moments in the series.

The rest of Ron's strong character moments are negative ones: he badmouths someone, he gets mad at a bully and overreacts, he steals a car and crashes it, he abandons a friend, he badmouths someone again, he ignores his friend's feelings, he abandons two friends. He is, in one story's climax, literally dragged from one point in the plot to the next.

He does not show a deep character because Ron isn't written to be deep, last book fumblings aside. He is the buddy who explains things about the plot to Harry. His feelings represent conflict where there would otherwise be none. He is the one who shows that the stakes have been raised by explaining that they've been raised. He's the one who randomly acts like a jerk because that's what happens between teenage male friends and it adds realism, or something.

--------------

That's why I said /Hogworts, a History/ was the most essential main character. Compared to the three main characters plus their books, it is as useful to expanding and explaining the story world as the trio are. And it is overall better written than they are, and isn't dragged through the murk in the last book.

JKR's secondary characters are clearly more interesting than the main characters. Sirius Black, Luna Lovegood, and the twins are all more interesting than Ron. They don't have as much time to grow and change, but at least the secondary characters have objectives they work towards.

Sirius wants to make up for past mistakes by protecting Harry.

Luna wants true friends and to fight for a good cause.

The twins want their own business and to tweak the nose of authority.

Ask yourself this: what does Ron want? Consider where and how is it described and expanded on in the canon story, then compare that to the other main characters, or even the secondary characters. Could he just as well be replaced by another secondary character, or even just a book? If you get a different answer than I do then fine. That's clearly a matter of opinion.

But don't claim that being a boring clam for five and a half books out of seven makes for "realism" in a character. Much of Ron is currently constructed from the scraps of canon and lots of fanon masking tape, not the actual contents of the series. When you read the books, you see that he exists as a thin construct, not a well mapped out person. And that is sort of sad, because instead of being a character just as strong as Hermione (the strongest of the human main characters) or the twins, he is a plot sockpuppet.

But those attributes weren't clearly intentional or designed to be important to the plot or him as a person. No one ever said, "Oh look, there goes Harry again. I'd be worried about him, but old Ron is grounded and normal, keeping him from doing stupid shit."

That never happened. A single instance of that per book would have gone a long way towards redeeming his character.

Not...really. And you seem to realize this, as you pointed out that she was previously an important part of the plot, and had certain character attributes for a reason that she'd moved away from in later parts of the series. Dawn was an intentional stereotype, and other characters even commented on that, but she quickly became something more. Ron's characterization never went anywhere or mattered anywhere near as much.

Dawn was:

- Cute
- Sassy
- Little-sister-moment inducing
- Totally unexpected, confusing, and previously vital to the entire world, then suddenly having to deal with not being any of that.

Far more characterization than Ron ever had. Other characters talked about Dawn and to her, and she was part of the world -- hilariously more so than Ron even when she was the Key. She had hopes and fears and dreams, and she talked to people about them. They came up in the plot and in her life as it appeared in the story.

And, most importantly, Dawn wasn't set up as some series-spanning main character. So you are comparing a secondary character to a main character, and it still fails to support Ron's characterization as being anything but a huge mistake.

******* I don't really agreed. I would suggest Ron makes up the silent majority of people just living life as it comes. Anyone with drive (which I suspect you feature) will dislike him purely because its hard to sympathise with someone who seemingly lacks clear goals or distinct motivation, much like the people who dislike Molly for being a house wife. Ron just wants a simple straight forward life centred on family and moves to the tune of that, and there's nothing wrong with that its just a different way of living. He's an average bloke who /knows/ he's average. Everyone in his life far out shines him in every area of proficiency, he has nothing to himself that /only/ he is special at/destined for. As a result his greatest development is the subtlety in which he comes to terms with being average and unimportant and finding strength in that (coming back to the tent/war). Granted its easy to miss if your focused on the bombastic/tragic/extreme/driven characters. But in a way that's kinda of the point and that's why his small achievements have the most profound effects on him as a character.

But this is never said, or even strongly implied. We don't know why Ron does what he does, or what he thinks about what he does.

You mention his finding strength to return to the war. He only does so through Dumbledore's Taboo Curse (Blessing?) on Ron's name on the Deluminator. Not any actions Ron actually takes, or deep soul searching he does. Ron runs away, has a bunch of trouble /immediately/, runs back, and finds his friends are gone. Then he goes +to continue the fight+ to his family and just hangs out for weeks. Ron eventually hears his friends say his name while he's listening to the radio, safe in his room on Christmas day. What a hero. And then he follows a light and eventually finds Harry and Hermione.

Why did he do that? We're never told, and we're certainly not shown. You're just reading an everyman trope into a weak character. Average people still have lives that are important to them and things that they care about more than passively. What is important to Ron? It isn't shown, and that's why he's a bad character.

********* I haven't really got time to go in-depth right now, but I kinda feel like you don't really /get/ Ron. As a whole Ron makes more sense if you read The Casual Vacancy and the way JK explores the mindsets of Middle-Englanders. But as I said some people find it hard to sympathise with Ron because they want him to be more. He's the most ordinary person in the book and that's what's important about him (perhaps thats why you dont like him? or why you consider him to be weak?).

I think you might benefit from forgetting your hate for Ron and rereading the books from his perspective, its kind of eye opening in regards to how insane/chaotic everything is, how it all builds and why relationships seem so strained/stressful at times (I would not like Harry as a friend that's for sure). The "never said, or even strongly implied" in regards to subtlety is a bit tart, directly stating character development is a poor way to write /(looking at you Twilight)/.

******* I thought of countering this point by point, but I think you're missing something essential about Ron so I'm just going to explain it the way I see it.

One of the most important aspects of the series is discovering the different layers to characters -- discovering not only what they do but why they do it. In book 1, things are set up in a very black and white way. Voldemort is bad. Dumbledore is good. Malfoy is bad. Ron is good. This is to be expected because it's from the perspective of an eleven year old. But as the series continues, we discover that the characters, their decisions, and their motivations are not as simple as black and white.

We begin to understand that yes, fighting Voldemort is the "right" thing to do, but not fighting against him, or doing so for unscrupulous reasons, does not make someone inherently evil. So, for example, you get Mundungus who is technically on the Order's side, but who is really only in it for himself. Is he a good guy? Is he a bad guy? Well, it's unclear. Then you get the Malfoys -- all certainly unpleasant people, and mostly on the "wrong" side of things, but their motivations (to protect each other) don't seem entirely evil.

The point of all of this is to illustrate that it's not only what people do that matters, but why they do it. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all have different reasons for fighting for good, and they all matter in different ways. Harry fights largely because he is forced to. He certainly would fight anyway, but there's no doubt that from the moment he enters the magical world, he feels the weight of destiny on his shoulders. He fights, I would argue, in large part because he is the poster child for the war. Hermione's role in the trio is also clear from the beginning -- she is smart and practical and can thus guide the other two and keep them all alive. Her intelligence is useful. Then there's Ron.

Ron is important because he is not special. He is not destined. He is not smart. Of all the main characters, Ron has the least reason to fight. He really is just an average joe. But he does fight. And that's what makes him special. He fights out of love, out of loyalty. This isn't to say he's useless. I think he provides a tremendous amount of emotional support to both Harry and Hermione (but especially Harry). He is the glue that holds them together. His contributions are hard to pin down, and that is actually part of canon. One of the reasons Ron leaves in DH is because he feels like he's risking so much (his family) and providing so little. But he realizes his friends actually do need him, and that's why he returns.

You say Ron doesn't matter as a character because he doesn't grow -- which is incredibly ironic. Ron believed he didn't matter at the beginning either. He was just a sidekick to Harry and bug under his brother's feet. His growth is the very fact that he realizes this isn't true. He does matter. He can provide something, even though he's an average guy.

I think JKR created Ron for a very specific reason. It's easy to look at Harry the Hero or Hermione the Braniac, and think, well of course they would fight, of course they would have a great destiny. But I'm no one. I'm not a hero, I'm not smart, I'm not talented...why should I stand up for something? Ron teaches us that we are all useful, if for nothing else than being a shoulder to lean on.

*TL:DR* Ron's growth is the very fact that he realized he matters even though he's an average guy.

******** We're not talking about morality here. We're talking about bad writing, specifically plotting and characterization.

I'm not even sure anyone ever calls Ron average throughout the entire series. This seems like entirely ex post facto characterization, not one based on the actual canon. If no one in the series says it, if it isn't a strong subtext that is implied multiple times, it doesn't really exist. How you /feel/ about a character doesn't matter in this discussion.

There are a couple of other points where I have some problems with suggested themes and interpretation.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  We begin to understand that yes, fighting Voldemort is the "right" thing to do, but not fighting against him, or doing so for unscrupulous reasons, does not make someone inherently evil.
#+end_quote

Average people not fighting evil being bad is the point of books five and seven. If anything, the slide is towards showing how much great evils benefit from people not being willing to take a stand on issues actually sometimes being black and white. Even- no /especially/ Dumbledore and his mistreatment of Harry's adolescence. Child abuse and even passive acceptable of it is bad. Black and white.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Then you get the Malfoys -- all certainly unpleasant people, and mostly on the "wrong" side of things, but their motivations (to protect each other) don't seem entirely evil.
#+end_quote

Except for the choices which they made, like /at least/ standing by while innocent people are murdered just to save their own positions in society. That's the most simple and banal of evils.

One's choices making one good or evil is the point of the entire series. It was reemphasized at the end of book five. Then sort of shat on in book seven's epilogue, where everyone who helped torture and murder people and run pogroms gets off scott free, apparently. Oh well.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Ron teaches us that we are all useful, if for nothing else than being a shoulder to lean on.
#+end_quote

Then JKR did a very poor job explaining this, because his actions are never justified in this way. He is simply declared Harry's friend in the first book, then accepted back after every event that stresses that friendship. He is once more declared as important in book seven, even though he never does anything to justify his presence. Why is Ron a better choice for this quest than Dean or Lee or Bill and Fleur Weasley?

Because Ron was declared Harry's codependent friend and he keeps coming back. Why does Ron do this? We don't know and are never shown. And that hasn't changed, from book one through book seven.

Ron is always loyal, that's his primary (only) personality attribute -- except when things get rough and then he's a backstabbing chickenshit with a terrible temper that he never tries to learn to control or deal with. Unlike, say, Harry. But Ron's reactions didn't change throughout the entire series. Because Ron is a terrible, paper-thin character who was poorly written.

In a well written story, when things are tough and people have personal failings, it is recognized and worked through. And when it happens again, that's a huge tragedy that colors people's perceptions of a character forever. Which is why Ron's book seven antics fall flat and tons of people hate him.

Because people expected him to have grown and changed, or at least other characters to have acknowledged that he hadn't, and then for that to have mattered. But it didn't matter. Because Ron doesn't matter to the story, and *isn't an essential main character.*

******* Dawn is technical made of mystic magical energy as in her whole existence was conjured by the monks so that Buffy could protect Dawn from Glory. However she doesn't have any magic potential other than existing as the Key for that exact moment in time when her blood could be used to breakdown the walls between dimensions, at any other time she is a perfectly ordinary (and somewhat annoying) human being (as was the monks plan). There was at one point plans to give her psychic abilities but Whedon scraped it because he liked the dynamic of the Slayer (special) sister and the ordinary average sister.

** Ron. I mean: He adds close to no additional depth to the story and has absolutely no feature that makes him irreplacable. Comedic relief? The Weasley Twins. Contrast figure to make Harry look better? Literally 90% of his class. Someone to guide Harry within the wizard world? Just use another wizard child.

Ron adds so little to the progression of the story (relative to what other main characters bring on the table) that I mostly cut him out of fics I write. I mostly make him a squib, he doesn't have much more magical talent anyway.

God, writing this makes me realize how pissed I was about JKR getting him together with Hermione. It just doesn't fit. But the decision she made for her characters for the time after the books are pretty worthless anyway in my opinion, so yea...

*** Ron has every reason in the series to run for the hills with his family and not look back. He has no reason to fight at all, except that it's the right thing to do, and because his friends are at risk. Ron is the purest example of loyalty in the entire series*. He teaches Harry a great deal about friendship, love, and forgiveness.

He is interesting because he's normal. Moreso that almost any other character, he feels like someone you could know.

He's important to the plot because he is probably Harry's biggest emotional supporter in the series. Harry has no family - no parents, no guardians. He has no one to turn to. Hermione means well but she has zero emotional tact. The few times we see her try to comfort Harry in the books she usually just pisses him off. Ron is Harry's family. He is his support. He gives Harry a reason to fight.

And really, Ron is kinda the voice of reason in the trio. Harry is an impulsive martyr who's always running off half-cocked. Hermione is book-smart but absolutely clueless when it comes to people and thinking on her feet. Ron is the one who balances those two extremes.

But he didn't /say or show/ what he was feeling well at all. Unless it was childish jealousy or blind loyalty, his unique feelings didn't come across very clearly in important situations.

Such a character should show the reader what things are like emotionally, and Ron was always so...flat. Hermione exploded and fumed and stomped around. If anything, she was the one who did the best job of showing emotions. Harry even got to sulk and rage silently more than Ron did any of his own emoting.

It was always so basic, too. The situation is scary, so Ron's...scared. A feast, he's hungry. Classwork, he's bored. Sports, he's excited. Hardly deep views into the human psyche.

Symbolism isn't an excuse for poor characterization or plotting. Ron was more blind id than ego, the usual point from which the heart character springs.

I don't hate Ron. It is a fictional character. I'm a writer and I am looking at the way the character of Ron is written. It is written poorly, and I've tried to explain why I think this is true.

And what I get is downvotes from people who disagree with me (poor reddiquette) and emotional arguments from people who identify or sympathize with the character.

That's not the point. The point is, Ron is a poorly written main character, and the /least essential/ to the story.

My recollection, from reading the books, is that he isn't written significantly worse than Harry or Hermione. And, that opposed to those two, who frequently have a kind of tunnel-vision focus (to their benefit, most of the time), Ron is a far more useful emotional sounding board for what the general reaction of the public will be to canon events. Thus, through him, we pick up on the emotional "flavor" of canon events.

Yeah, that makes sense. That makes for good character development, with a strong moment at the end when he guts up and smashes the locket with the sword.

Ron kept that moment of realization with the Mirror in his heart because he was insecure and wanted to shine on his own merits, and so he secretly worked hard to...and then at the end, after a moment of weakness that he works hard to repair, in a shining moment of...

No, wait, he actually told Harry about the Mirror thing immediately, and then they /never talked about it again/ and it was never shown to have influenced his actions /at any point in the story/.

--------------

I like your version of the story, and I'd read that fanfic, but it isn't supported by what was actually written. So that wasn't really part of his character development at any point. Because Ron is a poorly written character.

The claim that it was woven throughout the series is simply not supported by a moment at the beginning and a moment at the end, with no development inbetween. It is contraindicated by every important event he is part of in the rest of the story.

As for not influencing his actions, did I not just give an example? We also don't see inside him head but the locket scene proves it's been on him mind.

You say you've read the fanfic but lets be honest here. You've read so many belittling the character and mocking it you've lost the ability to read the originals and see the character for who he is.

First book - sacrifices himself for his friends.

Second book - goes into the Chamber of Secrets to fight one of the most feared creatures in the magical world for him family (bearing in mind Harry probably didn't fully appreciate the Basilisk being muggle rasied). Also faces his worst fear in the hope it will help save his other now petrified bff.

Third book - stares down a man he probably grew up hearing about being as bad as Voldemort "If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us, too!" and then curses his teacher to hear the truth

Fourth book - shows his insecurities but ultimately overcomes them

Fifth book - Fights the Death Eaters, trains all year with the DA, trains for Quidditch in secret and makes the team and wins the cup.

Sixth book - Fights Death Eaters again, more overcoming fears of Quidditch

Seventh book - The entire Horcrux hunt, he comes back, kills the locket, fights Death Eaters, stares down Voldemort.

There's a load more but i'm not going through his every action.

You really just seem to hate him, and that's fine but don't pretend he has no character development or that the rest of his family have any more as you've said a couple of times ITT. Frankly he has easily the top 5, whether you like the character or not that's undeniable.

That has nothing to do with my "hating" anything. This isn't some shipping argument. Ron's character being or not being a bad "person" and my opinion on that has nothing to do with my opinion on the content of the story. That is a fallacious argument.

The reason I'm still engaging in this pointless factional analysis vs. opinion thing is people keep ascribing incorrect motivations and making wild claims.

I've said why Ron is a weak character from a considered literary standpoint. The counter arguments have been:

- No, you just hate him.
- No, Ron is a symbolic everyman, which is an important archetype.
- No, at specific points in the story, Ron does things with Harry that shows he's an important character.

None of these arguments present a view on Ron's story arc. They don't illustrate the flaws he has and how he overcomes them. They don't show his motivations and how JKR fits him into the narrative. They address the person not the argument, declare things that simply aren't supported by the actual story, or are irrelevant to the point of his characterization.

There is so little factual support for Ron as a well explored character because, from the early late-children's level story to the YA fiction of the last three books, Ron wasn't important /as a character/. He /was/ a symbol, an archetype, a vehicle to progress the story and connect Harry to the magical world.

JKR can do better, and she does with other characters. But not Ron. Because he's the least essential main character.

Which is a shame, because you've actually made a point worthy of debate.

#+begin_quote
  Him leaving and coming back is probably the deepest character moment in the entire series. *How many other characters develop more?*
#+end_quote

Several. As I've pointed out elsewhere in this thread. But that's not the most important issue. That would be, does that scene develop Ron's character as strongly as you claim?

That scene is widely considered the weakest part of the entire series, in the weakest part of the story (the camping trip), and is in what is often cited as the most poorly written book in the series (which, with GoF existing, is really saying something).

That defection and return has spawned more fanfic explaining and deriding it (that's the reddit sub we're currently in, after all) than any other single moment -- except possibly the confusion surrounding the Goblet of Fire and why Harry had to compete at all. That suggests it has not been well received by the audience, raising questions about its quality. But there is another problem.

The reasons Ron ran off could have been one or more of many, and the possible character resolutions to that event were also multitude. But instead of it being written as developing Ron's character, it was simply a thing that happened, part of a series of things that happen without strong contextualization or resolution.

He said "sorry," literally said that to a (rightfully) furious Hermione, and that was it. No one talked about it with him afterward, finding meaning in what happened. No one compared how Harry welcomed him back compared to Hermione. Ron never said what he'd learned from his mistake or the experience after, nor is it shown to be important to the rest of the story.

It didn't /develop/ the character of Ron. It was just, as you said, /a moment/. Just that. A thing that happened. We don't see how it changed people, because it didn't. It has literally the same resolution as his defection in GoF, with even less lead-in and resolution afterward.

I'm making some huge, sweeping, almost certainly incorrect claims here. And I would hope to be corrected, because that would be informative and make this worthwhile as other than an exercise in organizing my own ideas.

--------------

As for the other point, examples of character development done better (obviously in my opinion) in the series include:

- Harry dealing with the loss of his Godfather, which changes him basically for the rest of the series. His godfather doesn't matter much in the last book, though, because it was terrible.
- Harry ignoring his fame in up through GoF to him finally dealing with it head-on while running the DA. His fame doesn't matter in the last book, because it was terrible.
- Hermione finding friends after the troll attack, dealing with pure-blood prejudice and seeing the difference between pure-bloods like Ron and Draco, learning to balance classwork and friends (which isn't possible before even with time travel), dealing with friends being stupid without splitting her loyalties, and even growing throughout the awkward HBP romance. Not much happens with this in DH, because it was a terrible book that didn't wrap anything up from the earlier books' characterizations, but simply tacked on more tatt.
- Ginny going from a shy damsel in distress to a bold and outgoing person with goals, objectives, and a life outside the plot. Except in the last book, where she was doing things so awesome with Neville at Hogwarts that we couldn't safely view them. Or maybe because the last book, Deathly Hallows, was */terrible/*.

So what, at least three characters who /develop/ more?

Five, if you count what I've already said about Fred and George's ambitions and them joining the OotP while still running a joke shop.

Six, if you allow Luna's terrible book seven stuff to represent the difference between giving up passively like her first appearances, through the DA, and then standing firm in the face of the impossible while making the best of things and even helping others through the same.

Seven if you count the book six and seven's reveals of Snape's actions as counting retroactively throughout the entire series. It almost works, too.

Eight if you count Dumbledore's hidden past and his change of heart regarding Harry from five through seven. That's actually some really powerful stuff. Not the DH stuff, of course. That was drek. Still, drek that developed him as a character, even though he was already dead.

Nine... well, do you see where I'm going with this?

Saying "this moment means this" doesn't explain /why/ it has the impact you're suggesting. If you don't expand on those opinions, presenting your view of them, then the argument doesn't stand up well to ones that do.

Character development is important, and is something I have to do as a writer. It is, quite literally, serious business.

** I hate to say it, but almost everyone.

For Harry, for the first couple books are just a child's fantasy. He's written as what the reader would do, or what the reader wishes they would do. In the middle books, he doesn't have much of a personality. He reacts to things exactly as we'd expect someone to react in his position... if we knew nothing about them (with a little of the fantasy thrown in). In the late books he has /some/ personality, but its a bit overshadowed by teenage angst.

For Ron, I don't think I need to say much. He does have some personality, namely over his feelings of inferiority and jealousy of Harry. However, most people would have a lot more going on internally than just that. His defining traits aren't very redeeming either.

Hermione has pretty decent character development. She develops from a austere self-restrained character to the most empathetic in the trio (empathetic as in she understands and cares about others) with some idealism thrown in and a bit of loyalty to her austerity. This development is good, but she isn't very fleshed out. We don't know about her family, and her empathy means she's mostly concerned with/attending to other people's problems in the series, so we don't see as much of her internal life as the other characters.

I think its a me problem though. I want characters to be like real people--really complex. Real people have lots of issues going on, have a wide variety of "defining" personality traits, a multitude of goals, a wide range in belief systems, etc. I don't blame Rowling for not having this in her books--each character would take up five to fifteen pages of outlining to describe.

She could have done it. Characterization can be as simple as a single sentence, or even a single word. But her style was alike to Jane Austen -- hardly a master of the modern, short-but-strong writing style. And it was an advanced-level children's story (like say, C. S. Lewis), at least at first, and only later wandered into YA fiction.

So the style was suited to the audience at the time, I think. It is only later when the expected YA characterizations never appeared that people started grumbling.

There's nothing he did that couldn't just have easily have been done by anyone else. It would have been relatively easy to take him out of the series all together and not change it very much. The only important thing he ever did that would be difficult to reproduce was introduce the Weasley's into Harry's life, thus giving him something of a family. Even that could have been worked around by making the twins closer to Harry in year one or setting it back a year and have him become good friends with Ginny in year two.

The girl's eyes flicked to the numerous long, hairy legs sticking out from the box Lee was holding.

George shook his head and pointed to Harry. "No, this one is our pet. They did say in the letter you could bring a cat, an owl, a toad, or a boy-who-lived, right?"

"Quite right, brother of mine."

They both turned simultaneously to grin at the increasingly apprehensive-looking bushy-haired girl and the chubby boy hiding behind her. Lee rolled his eyes and pushed down on the lid of the box holding his giant spider.

Harry smiled shyly at the girl, trying to signal an apology for what was clearly about to continue to happen. The wave of chaos would now consume her as well.

"I think we've got a spell that might help out," Fred said.

"One we've been dying to try," George added.

"Might as well help, eh Harry?"

"Yeah, the quickest way to a girl's heart is through her toad, as the saying goes. Watch and learn."

"That's- it's not my-" the girl tried to protest as the twins lept to their feet and started waving their wands around wildly.

Harry hid his face in his hands, letting the disaster just wash over him. And he'd been afraid he wouldn't make any friends at Hogwarts.
