I used to be a fairly good writer when I was in high school, excelled in English classes and was highly involved in a fairly intense writing club. I've reread some of my fanfics/original pieces from back then and I still can't believe I wrote them since I was actually good back then. I got really burnt out from writing from a combination of the internal pressure and just general depression burnout.

I want to write again as least as a hobby but I don't know how to enjoy it anymore since everything I write just sucks. Everything feels like a cliche and stilted and I keep comparing it to my old writing. It's not reasonable, I recognize logically that I was writing constantly for years with my old writing and I need to practice to get good again. It's just hard to write and hate what I'm writing, especially since I just want to do it as a hobby.

I just don't know if I can even write like that again and it makes it an less then great experience when I know it can be such a great emotional release for me. I'm numb and miserable and I need something to wake me up.

It's just sad, I woke up with a great idea for a fic just like I used to, and I was so excited that I had a dream idea since it's been /years/ since I've actually been inspired. The general gist of the idea is that Hermione dies in the troll incident, some sort of accidental magic hinted at causes her to imprint some of her personality/thoughts to Harry but in a more subtle way then it sounds here. I planned on making it a one shot and just focus on doing snippets of the first and second year, not too overwhelming I thought. But it sucks and I don't even want to look at what I have written because it makes me mad that even the first draft of the first few paragraphs just aren't even close to my personal standards.

Advice on ways to be less hard on myself here? Because logically I know I'm being silly but emotionally I feel sick to my stomach that I neglected the one talent I really did have to this point.

*edit also ignore the capital A on Atrophied. I'm not sure if it's the layout or what but when making the title every word was capitalized and I accidentally made that A a capital without being able to see it. And now I can't change it, ugh.


** Your brain has matured. I think that is the main reason why your stuff reads weaker than what you wrote as a teenager. Second guessing, even subconsciously, leads to a clinical and emotionless writing.

For a first I want to underline the advice you got from [[/u/cavelioness]]. [[/r/WritingPrompts]] is the place to be if you want to practice your writing while having zero to nothing to loose if you suck. Plus, you get valuable criticism from a very humane community. That sub is writing practice heaven.

Second advice is the annoying and exhausting part of it all. Analytical practice. Check your writing for weaknesses and work on them. If your dialogue sucks, write the next practice completely as a dialogue. Do so until you /git gud/. If your descriptions suck, a very good practice I do sometimes is to get onto [[/r/MattePainting]] or [[/r/ImaginaryBestOf]], pick an image and describe it as good as you can. If your text paints a similar picture in your test readers brain, you've won.

At last, I think its horrible advice to give, really, but it worked for me and maybe it does for you. Drink a beer before you write. Just enough to get your brain into "I need to talk about anything and everything right now" - mode. It helps a bit with stiff writing because you simply don't second guess yourself as much. Its also a great way to use hangovers productively.

*** Can't drink alcohol on the medication I'm on but I'll follow the rest.

It's been a long time since I've gotten constructive criticism on my writing, it'll be refreshing I think to not just be constantly praised like my family does. It never motivates me to be better.

Part of me does worry I'll never be good at dialogue since I'm an Aspie. Dialogue has always been a weak point in my writing though. My memories don't actually include dialogue so I can only use references to really get dialogue right. And I hate using references as I don't want to steal somebody else's tone of voice with the dialogue and not have it fit with the rest of it. Maybe that just means I need to write some scripts or something to completely focus on dialogue for a while.

My descriptions aren't horrible but they used to be stronger and more precise, I think they can take a bit of a backseat to the dialogue problem though.

Though if I get really frustrated with one thing I can always write some poetry as a break. Despite not being too popular it has always been my favourite genre and a small piece takes only a little bit of time. And writing anything is better then nothing.

Also what do you mean by test reader?

You know, people who you send your stuff to and they send you some criticism, feedback, praise back. For me, those are my friends. They're all avid fantasy readers, so their opinion on the matter means a great deal to me. You could also check out some subs on here. [[/r/fantasywriters]] has a lot of good people with great taste on it. You could also just get some people on your friendslist and send your stuff to them.

** I have the exact same problem right now. I got a story idea that I really want to see finished because it's everything I want to read but haven't found, but when I put fingers to keyboard I struggle to get words out. I've been planning it off and on for /two years/, but it's so hard to make it happen. I used to write more when I was in high school--I was able to just sit down and write a chapter in a day or two, and it turned out fine.

Stress is one factor for me, I think. When I have to plan and teach classes, it takes all of my creative energy. My new job has much less teaching, though, so hopefully that will come back. I'm thinking I should try doing a writing prompt at least every few days just to get the flow going again.

*** I wish us both luck! It might be hypocritical to say but dont be too harsh with what you've managed to write down. Even if it isn't your best work, it's better then nothing (even if it feels like it's practically nothing). And you can always edit it until it's something you want.

** You might try [[/r/WritingPrompts]] and try to respond to at least one a day with a story. You get some feedback and praise and it's a good way to get back in the game. For long things, just try to write as fast as you can to finish, don't re-read along the way. Accept that your first draft will suck and that's what re-writes are for.

*** Trying [[/r/writingprompts]] would be a good idea, I did a lot of that sort of thing at school and it probably helped with my writing skill. It'll be good to just write something and be done without stressing too much about it.

Practice makes the master, they say.

** Do you remember how you used to write? How exactly has your writing deteriorated?

If its a matter of vocabulary and grammar variation, that naturally comes along with maturity. But being able to express yourself well takes lots and lots of practice, and there's no real way to avoid it.

Instead of this sub you should probably ask another, such as [[/r/writing]] or the fanfic authors one.

*** I would say it feels very stiff, maybe in the grammar because I don't think it's with the vocabulary. Dialogue is rough (it's always been a weak point in my writing though), I'm struggling with scene shifts and natural flow of words.

I didn't ask [[/r/writing]] because I'm writing fanfics and I wasn't sure if advice about that would fit well there. I didn't know there was a fanfic author's one though.
