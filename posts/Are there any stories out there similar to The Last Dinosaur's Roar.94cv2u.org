** A time-traveller comes back from the future to stop muggles from destroying everything? Let's see...

Well, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas]]\\
It's about Luna Lovegood ending up back in time and ending up raising Tom Riddle to be good. Much more light and fluffy though.

**** Actually, I also once wrote a snippet of my own, where Tom Riddle comes back from a future war-torn by muggles. The snippet is actually focused around making horcruxes eviller and justifying Tom's decision to create one, but most of it is taken up by describing a muggles-exterminate-wizards war.

****** Oh, and there's also this: [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/The_End/The_End/]]

It doesn't have any time travel in it, but it goes into quite a bit of detail (with Harry narrating) about the causes of the muggle-wizard war. I still haven't gotten around to writing it, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6fou0c/opinions_on_the_quality_of_draco664s_the_end/][but I have this idea to write a sort-of-continuation of it]], that would feature a unknowing muggleborn in a third-world country who narrates the state of the world (killer satellites, witchcraft hysteria, unnatural mist) until he encounters a dementor in the mists and soon after that encounters a time traveller from the past come to rescue him...
