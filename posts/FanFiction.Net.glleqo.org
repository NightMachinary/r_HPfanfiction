So, I have received 3 reviews in the past few days, however only one is actually showed on my story info and none of them I can actually read on the site?

Is this a common issue, or have the writers deleted their reviews? I am slightly worried that it will continue to be like this and I will not be able to respond to any of them properly because I can only see them on the email.


** I never had this problem when getting reviews. I'd wait a couple of days to see if the problem helps itself or if the same happens with future reviews, and then contact the site.

** Happens from time to time. They will show up in a few days usually. I am having the same issue right now.

** As somebody who has wanted to delete a review I wrote on FFN but failed to find a way, I would like to know if this is actually possible. I haven't found a way to delete or edit my reviews.
