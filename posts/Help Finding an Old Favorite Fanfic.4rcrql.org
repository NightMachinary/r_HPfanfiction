Hey folks,

I'm getting back into Harry Potter fanfic, and haven't been able to find one of my old favorites ever since restrictedsection.org went down. I know the original author whose name escapes me had posted it to other sites as well.

The story was basically an alternate timeline where Harry starts up Dumbledore's Army in secret in Grimmauld Place. It includes a ton of characters. Highlights of the series include: Neville using his knowledge of herbology to help the fight, an interesting Neville/Pansy pairing, Ginny escaping her parents to join the fight, and Harry taking Snape and Draco prisoner.

Any help would be appreciated!


** Probably looking for Metafrantic's 'Harry Potter and the Return of Dumbledore's Army' which is the second story in his 'Harry's Seventh Year' series.
