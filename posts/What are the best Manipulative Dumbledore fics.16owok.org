** I love me some good manipulative Dumbles.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142024/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorting-Hat-s-Gift][Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat's Gift]]: This one is the first part of a series, which is still being written (but the first three parts are completed). It's a twin-fic, as in, Harry is the twin of the supposed Boy Who Lived. Dumbledore is manipulative/evil.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5270746/1/Harry-Potter-and-Godric-s-Legacy][Harry Potter and Godric's Legacy]]: This is somewhat of a super!Harry, but not ridiculous. It's been a while since I've read it, but I believe Dumbledore is manipulative but NOT evil. Harry/Ginny pairing.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]]: This is a work in progress, but it's being updated regularly. Harry is raised by the goblins, and Dumbledore isn't happy about it. It's Harry/Hermione (I KNOW, but it's good, I promise).

I may have some more in a bit, after I go through my list of favorited fanfics. I hope this helps!

**** Nothing, per se. Most of them involve a LOT of Weasley (and Dumbledore) bashing, which I can take in small doses, but honestly I LIKE the canon pairings. I mean, what's the point of liking the books if you hate almost all the good guy characters? And they also have to be a bit OOC because the Harry and Hermione from the books just feel like brother and sister so much more (to me at least).

**** Aside from the Weasley bashing, a lot of H/Hr authors have their relationship move *way * too fast. Like, within a month of Harry realising he has a crush on Hermione he's asking her father for her hand in marriage. Too often they're both OOC so that they can exchange vows of passionate, true, eternal love...at thirteen.

Also, oftentimes none of their other friends exist, even if it's a sixth-year AU. The Weasleys get bashed, and then the author just kind of ignores Luna and Neville.

***** I hate that so much. I actually like H/Hr, but I'm considering writing my own fic after I started reading yet another fic that initially appeared promising and then Harry and Hermione declared their love for one another and were able to read each others' minds by the second chapter.

**** I have yet to read one where it was actually interesting due to the fact the relationship is so straight forward. No tension since they are already good friends to begin with, no challenges since they have plausibly good ways to hang out pretty much all the time and nothing really that would stand in the way. Nothing "new" from character perspective since they already know each other so well. There doesn't really need for there to be any character development for it to work either, since in canon they are already pretty well matched.

It is just too simple.

If you are a fan of it, I would be interested in a good one to overwrite my poor experiences.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/1/Partially-Kissed-Hero]]

Most MD fics for some reason portray Dumbledore as a complete doofus, just standing there speechless while all of his schemes fall down around him.

This portrays him as an actual force to be reckoned with.

The basic premise of the plot is that Harry wasn't near Lupin on the train in PoA, so was kissed by the Dementor, but, as he has two souls inside of him, he survives and the Horcrux is destroyed. Oh and he gains access to Voldemort's memories. This doesn't suddenly turn him into Super-Harry or anything, he's still a 13 year old, just with a lot more knowledge.

I'm only on chapter 29, so I'm not sure where the author takes the story, but at the moment it's pretty awesome, and I'd definitely recommend it. Oh, and it's H/Hr/L, if that matters to you.

It's not Harry returns to his childhood, but he does a bit of time magic. It's Harry/Hermione, and Luna and Neville are also really important in it.

** I'll toss this out there. It's a bit less MD than Severus-knows-Dumbles-chess-maker-and-twarts.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4923158/1/3_Slytherin_Marauders][3 Slytherin Mauauders]]

Info: Nearly at 500k words, WIP, AU, very very non-cannon pairings, but believable in this setting. It's a Severus rescues Harry fic. There is the Dumbledore side, the extreme ministry side, and the Harry side. Not so much black and white, but while it loosely follows the plotlines, how things happen is radically different.

I really love it. It eases you into all the changes and doesn't just toss it in. Dumbledore does some really shady stuff at the beginning, and isnt an idiot. There is a lot of playing nice and playing the game, power-struggle in this story. Not Dumbledore focused, but multiple POV's.

If you dont mind having no life for a few weeks-months, go read it! It can probably be read in a weekend, with little sleep. It's roughly the size of the first 4 books put together. LOL

Happy reading!
