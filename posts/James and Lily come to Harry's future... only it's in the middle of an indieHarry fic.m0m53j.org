It could be one of the bad cliche ones, and they walk into the Great Hall to see this weird firstie that looks a /lot/ like James shouting at the professors about how evil Dumbledore was. Harry at this point has claimed all of his titles, and is using the Chamber as his lair. Idk what else, but basically as Harry tries to do his thing, he has to deal with Lily and James parenting him at every turn.

"Harry, you know we don't have a problem with you being in Slytherin. But you should really stop hanging out with that little git Malfoy, I literally just saw him push a Hufflepuff down a staircase. No, don't laugh; it wasn't /that/ funny. What do you mean you're using him like a pawn?! You're eleven!"

"Harry, sweetie; your ancient evil chamber is very cool and all, but I don't think it's best for an impressionable boy like you to spend all of your free time here. Your shadow phoenix, basilisk, and nundu can go for a walk with you, go get some fresh air!"

Harry of course goes along with it, they are his parents after all. They're very understanding and nice about everything, and Harry decides that maybe relying on an adult isn't so bad. He still tells them how totally evil Dumbledore is, and how he's going to sacrifice Harry for the GrEaTeR gOoD.

Whether he's right or an overly paranoid child with power is up to you.

There's also the route of them popping in on one of the better ones, where the trauma from his life has made him him into a soldier thats only purpose is to kill Voldemort. This one would be more heartfelt and angsty, James and Lily could help him see that there are people that love him and down see him as a chess piece. Harry would probably fight this more depending on his age, but eventually fight the war with the goal of giving his parents a better future in his mind.

Then there's the path where they have do deal with a full on evil, megalomaniac, eleven year old Harry. Like no, go to your room, you're grounded. We've talked about taking over the wizarding world via government, no reading your ancient magic tomes for a month.

*** Would be funny if he was doing so like Han from “Reformed, returned and really trying” as in, misinterpreting everything they tell him so that he thinks they are supporting and offering council to him, like:

J&L: “Harry! No conquering the world!”

Harry: “So, clearly what you mean is that I can't be seen as being a conqueror, but as a savior who is taking control to protect the people from a greater evil. Ok, so I will break Grindelwald out of prison, resurrect Hittler, put Lockhart at the head of a movement to Obliviate all muggles into slavery, get every piece of Voldemort's soul a body and then convince them the others are after their power and then fund Hermione's crusade for equal rights for all beings with the conditions that I make the marketing and that she start calling herself a dark lady. The world population will be begging me to take over in no time and will do absolutely anything I tell them to. Great idea mom and dad, couldn't have done it without you!”

J&L: /face meets palm/

/Bonus scene:/

Harry: Oh, thanks for reminding me! You can't have a proper semi-apocalypse hell of a society without people running around convincing others to practice the worse habits they can, such as self-harm. Ok them, will have to fund a wireless program of health-tips from Snape at some point, have Lockhart start a course on healing on the side to get people on self-medicating, get Umbridge made into chief of the department of misuse of muggle-artifacts -or maybe as liaison to the goblins and other beings...

J&L: /Look at each other in speechless bafflement/

James: I blame your sister!

Lily: I!... can't really fault you for that one.

** AAA I cant not recall the name. There was this fairly big fic where Harry and his friends started killing off Death Eaters with support of the ministry, while his family was in hiding and raising his brother as the boy who lived.\\
Harry's team and ruthless ministry policy wear down Death Eater forces over the years, and during the battle for the ministry his parents show up, expecting a hapless and innocent boy, instead they see harry snap Bellatrix's neck, get disarmed and captured like they were nothing and witness Harry fight his way to Voldemort in a hail of Death Eater body-parts. Of course his 'family' and Dumbledore were in cahoots and were expecting a warm welcome worthy of heros, instead they get sidelined and ignored while no-nonsense Harry is taking care of business.\\
He later declares them in failure of their parental obligations and almost executes his father for failing to fulfill his 'lordly' duties of taking care of 'the family', tries to re-establish connection with his brother though...\\
Anyone remembers what was the name? PLEASE))!

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

** Lily and James from their fifth or sixth year are surprised (mostly the former) on learning that they fell in love, married, and had an adorable son. Lily, surprisingly. is ecstatic on finding out she had a kid: she's always wanted a family.

Until they both meet, interact with, and come to understand Harry -- how cold, ruthless, and downright nasty he can be at times.

When they ask how this could have happened, where did they go wrong, et cetera, it all comes down to one thing at its root: "You both died".

Thus, once they get sent back to their time (maybe as sixth years or seventh years), they realize that if Harry is still born, or any future children they may have (butterfly effects), they need to do what they can to stay alive and raise him well, otherwise they'll have someone who'll eventually be worse than Voldemort running around.

...You know, Charmed kinda did this with Wyatt and his brother Chris, with the latter going back into the past to make sure his older brother doesn't go full on evil overlord.

**** A horcrux is implied to be a heavily esoteric piece of magic, even if references were known to be in Hogwarts/among certain wizards. I sincerely doubt that it'd be something common to discover/do.

Plus, there'd be the character development angle: would James and Lily feel desperate enough to do something like this? Or would they vehemently shoot down the very notion.

Rule of cool tropes are bad, especially Harry Potter ones. :)

***** Right, so let's see how we can flash it out so the indy!Harry angle goes beyond merely cringe as hell to pure evil in such a way that J&L are not likely to just make an unbreakable oath of never having children but still desperate enough to make an Horcrux to prevent this outcome. So, first thing first, Harry has to be evil, but still repeatable in a “okay, I get where you are coming from” kind of way, easiest way to garner sympathy from his kindoff parents would probably be upping the abuse angle, their best friends both have been in abusive situations and they will probably give him some sympathy for it, however it is also a double-edged sword since neither Sirius nor Snape have gone fully batshit murder hobo genocide yet, so they would be far more likely to hold Harry to this standard, meaning that merely a tragic childhood won't be enough by itself, we need something more. Another thing that generally gathers sympathy, even with assholes, is the idea of inevitability, the sense that no matter what you do or chose, you are simple not in control of your fate and your only choice is to either capitulate to a terrible fate or lash-out violently to put the world out of your misery, if done right even genocide lunatics can come out looking like tragic hero's; the easiest but laziest and less appealing way of doing this would be to take the manipulative!Dumbledore stereotype and then make him downright demonic/monstrous in his plots; for a more pleasant scenario we could have the Horcrux be far more active instead, having it be able to talk constantly with Harry, affect his behavior and even possess him sometimes, it could either be known about or not, but either way we can expect a lot of social-distancing for Harry plus the particularly stubborn idiots trying to bully the dragon to predictably horrifying results that make him even more of a pariah.

Now that we have made it so Harry is not a complete monster let's make him more terrible instead of merely edgy as fuck. First of all is obviously upping his murdery factor to the maximum power, having him ruthlessly kill the Death Eaters would be somewhat excusable since they are the enemies on a war, so instead how about getting him to kidnap and torture/kill their children as both blackmail and revenge, no matter how hardcore anti-Voldemort J&L are, they would definitely be horrified at having their son animate a 9 years old and clearly tortured to death kid as an inferius to make their parents suffer. Also having him be more casual with reasons to kill someone would also work, like, instead of killing only the enemy he stars killing people who merely talk bad about him or that try to stay out of the fight. Having Dumbledore be grudgingly willing to let him keep at it because he feels responsible for how Harry turned out to and then eventually have Harry kill him could provide the bottom of the well for Harry that pushes J&L into being willing to do anything to stay alive so they can prevent Harry from becoming so evil.

** Harry just follow Dumbledore around like we do and get your self killed just like we do and also do it for the people who abandoned you to 10 years of abuse and let your godfather rot in Azkaban for years with out even speaking to him once.

Honestly depending on on what happens in this AU they may even join him and help him after they find out what happened to him, I doubt they would want to join the people who left their child to years of abuse
