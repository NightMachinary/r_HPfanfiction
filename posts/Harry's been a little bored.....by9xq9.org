"Welcome to Sirius' family home, you'll love the library, Hermione, but be careful, some books are cursed. Very interesting, just yesterday I found an ancient book about the predecessor of the killing curse, I think I've got a better understanding of how to survive it now. About the house, it used to be pretty grim and old-looking before we redecorated, and Sirius has a weird taste, that's why it looks a bit strange. Let's take a look at my private lab and I can show you my latest projects, okay? Alright, over here's the fundraising setup, contains the Philosopher's Stone that I nicked and replaced with a fake back in first year before I destroyed it in the battle with Quirrel, Kreacher's busy making gold. A bit slow, but enough to quintuple my allowance. Over there in the gold-, lead- and plastic-lined magic shielding box is the diary that caused all our troubles in second year, a locket we found here, a ring we found in Tom's parents home town, a diadem that I found when messing around with my lab room at Hogwarts and a cup Sirius inherited after the Lestranges' mysterious deaths in Azkaban. They're all connected to Voldie, I'm trying to figure out how they work exactly so that I can cut my own connection to him. Then over here is where I make the rockets I use to boost my Bolt. Basic enchantment of a self filling bottle, some hydrazine, dinitrogen tetroxide and control charms. Right there, that magic mirror is connected to a counterpart in Number 10 next door, attached to the screen of a computer with internet access. The keyboard there is protean charmed to remotely control the one connected to the computer. It's running Windows 95, but I didn't really have time to come up with something better. Over here's the entrance to the snake pit, where I breed and train basilisks to take out Death Eaters, might as well use my language talent. Dobby's currently buying more goats to feed them. And finally, here's my second alchemy setup. I've just managed to complete a system to magically seperate isotopes. Give it a few more months and I'll be able to test if Voldie's new body can survive a mini-nuke. Winky should be back from the uranium mine in a few hours, then I can demonstrate how it works. What do you think?"


** Apparently, the block of text is an issue for a lot of people, but I like the rambling feel it gives... Makes it seem like Harry has been deprived of human contact (sans Sirius) over the summer and is just super excited to share all the stuff he's been up to.

Pretty sure this is the exact wrong thing to say to Hermione!

But well done, you've definitely written a much more scientifically-minded and forward-thinking Harry than in canon.

*** I kinda mixed all the craziest ideas partially from my own ideas (trying to write a full length fic but it's hard) and partially inspired by other fics into this.

Basilisk breeding is done in linkffn(If looks could kill)

The rocket assisted broom appears in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality), although in that fic Harry's using a much more primitive solid rocket booster instead of a bipropellant liquid engine.

Harry living at Grimmauld with Sirius instead of with the Dursleys happens in quite a few fics.

#+begin_quote
  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** Hey question? Just to shut everyone up, was you making it one big paragraph intentional to, as kyella14 said, give it a rambling rushed feeling. I ask, because apart from it being all one paragraph, the grammar is impeccable. I feel like soneone who can write at that quality wouldn't make such mistakes.

*** I originally wanted to write a dialogue but then I decided to leave Hermione's reactions to the imagination of the readers, so it turned into a rambling monologue.

I'm not a native English speaker, sorry for any mistakes.
