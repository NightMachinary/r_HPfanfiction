I have always been exceptionally dissatisfied with how Umbridge is dealt with in the books. As much of the fandom also believes, I think she is more evil than Voldemort ever was. He was a murderer and a power-obsessed monster, but Voldemort was humanised in a way (we got his backstory in an orphanage) that Umbridge ever was and I don't believe that there would ever be a story that would make me sympathetic to her. So I'd love to read some piece of fiction where she actually gets what she deserves and gets fired in the most brutally embarrassing way possible. I never thought the centaurs were enough considering she's just as evil in DH and clearly still has her job at the beginning of the book under Scrimgeour.

Also if anyone can sum up that feeling about Umbridge being so much more vile than Voldemort - would be really great to hear opinions on either side!


** Personally, my favorite way to see Umbridge fired is out of a god damn cannon. The woman was horrifically evil. She tortured kids for fun. Not to prop up a failing regime, but because she got off on it. She took PLEASURE in torturing children.

But you know what really gets me? She actively sabotaged kids education. Now, as teacher I have a real problem with people who do this, but I can understand when people are well meaning idiots who just suck at their jobs (but please get the hell out of the classroom). Umbridge though? She was knowingly destroying kids ability to defend themselves in a war, a war she likely knew was all too real because she was high enough up to know it was a cover up. She was condemning children to DEATH, and did it with a smile.

*** Yup that's it. Voldemort was evil with a purpose and a backstory where we got to see some of the evil develop. Umbridge was just a monster who should've been put down. I'm currently reading an AU retelling of the books and reading the bits where Umbridge forces her students to say "good morning Madam Umbridge" in that mocking kindergarten way just made me realize that she got off on using her power for acknowledgment. She could manipulate children because of her power into doing anything she wanted. In many ways, where child molesters sexually abuse their victims - Umbridge physically abused her victims. Anyway, I could rant for days about my hatred for her. I have always been pissed at Jo for not giving more vindication. I honestly gave two rat's asses what happened to Voldemort- Umbridge was the one who deserved to be strung up (but not die, no it'd be better for her to live through mockery and torture, she doesn't deserve death) and made to feel small and alone.

I will be reading your story with the utmost pleasure. I honestly can't think of a villain I hated more in any book I ever read.

***** If you're into James and Lily living it's linkao3(8973463) That's OotP. Follow the link to the series and you'll see it starts with a one-shot establishing the premise to how they survive and then the series goes off following events with some big changes that keep it very interesting. As one would expect, as the books go the divergences from canon get larger.

After reading the Innocent series as well as a bunch of other fics where Harry gets raised by Sirius or a competent loving adult, I stumbled onto this gem. It's been going through all of the series as an Everyone Lives AU. Not going to spoil, but more than just James and Lily survive. I really like reading fics where Harry was raised in a different environment and we see how it impacts the story/his character/his decisions/his friendships. The Everyone Lives AU is perhaps the best written Jily Lives AU out there imo.

  Nighttime was the worst part of Harry's summer. He'd fall asleep, prepared for nightmares. He'd find his nightmares, and when he was startled awake, he'd lie in bed, thinking his mother or father were downstairs, probably having similar nightmares. There was nothing about sleep anymore that held comfort for him.--- --- ---  How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived?  Ships not listed because I am unsure if they will deviate from canon. Character tags added as they appear.

******* But the "procreate through rape" idea is just from Greek mythology, and again, Potterverse Centaurs are markedly different from mythological centaurs in many ways and I don't think that idea applies to them.

*** Considering she just got worse after her being taken off by the centaurs I would say she was probably just taken away and shaken up a bit. Her whole experience with Hogwarts, Hermione tricking her into the forest, and getting investigated, would only reinforce her world view about muggleborn/magical beasts and her hatred toward Harry and his fight. Before the event she enjoyed watching the children in pain from those blood quills, and was quick to use the Cruciatus on children. It seems like that just escalated into enjoying and relishing in entencing (suspected) muggleborns to prison/death and actively helping Voldemort's administration in the Ministry.

I would argue that it's possibly one of the worst case scenarios for her storyline because it just makes her even more of a heartless monster.

It would be cool to see a story where she actually starts undergoing some physical change into a Kronenberg like monster during her time at Hogwarts to reflect her monsterous soul.

**** Not really what I meant about wanting to see Umbridge get hers. I don't believe she's raped or anything near that amount of trauma in OotP. If anything its clear nothing happens to her. We know via Harry's comment to Scrimgeour that she was still working at the ministry during HBP/DH and was obviously involved heavily in the Muggleborn Registration horseshit.

So I would just love to see her on trial and humiliated more than anything. I don't think she deserves death and I don't think physical pain would be as satisfying as watching people mock her and make her feel small and powerless. She was a vile woman. Though I'd probably shown up to her public execution. ;)

#+end_quote

That's kinda silly. IMHO a back-story for Voldemort isn't about being sympathetic with him at all.

"boo-fucking-hoo I had a poor upbringing so now It's understandable to become an insane murderer". Yeah no, that's not how it works.

#+begin_quote
  Also if anyone can sum up that feeling about Umbridge being so much more vile than Voldemort
#+end_quote

How is she more vile than Voldemort? She just tortured school children a bit. He's not above murdering babies and would probably not be opposed to eating them alive if it helped him in some way.

Of course Umbridge is easier to hate because she's supposed to be a normal person and not some kind of insane villain that has already pushed all possible envelopes of humanity and decency.

*** I don't think Voldemort's backstory makes me "sympathetic" - that's not the right word and I'm sorry I used it. But you also didn't need to be so rude in your response. A backstory makes you understand him and it humanizes Voldemort. Just like Snape's backstory doesn't suddenly right all of his wrongs, it simply opens up new aspects of his decision making and who he is.

Riddle was a violent child in the orphanage (seriously he frightened a bunch of the children silly in that cave and returned there to hide a Horcrux) and exceptionally lonely as evidenced by his desire to return to Hogwarts in the summers and become a teacher there - but obviously while this is going on he opens the Chambers of Secrets, he hides a Horcrux in the school while he goes for his interview. Why Voldemort chose to go on a blood purity line of thinking is beyond us knowing. All he really wants is power at the end of it. And immortality obviously. But Voldemort is a normal person (isn't that the point of the ending of HP? He's human like everyone else?) who also does exceptionally evil things. He's a multi-faceted character who does horrible, atrocious things and clearly spares no mercy and enjoys torture, while Umbridge is just evil and spares no mercy and enjoys torture. She's Voldemort + Fudge. Or to put it better she's a bureaucratic Voldemort. Or an evil Fudge. Take your pick. She believes that everything and everyone that isn't a pureblooded wizard/witch should be blasted off the face of the earth and has no qualms about doing just as much as Voldemort is (she is happy to crucio Harry, actively takes part in the Muggle Registration Commission). She disowns her family in order to keep up appearances that she's a pureblooded witch, in a similar vain as Voldemort who changes his name to hide his muggle father.

I think Umbridge is just as evil as Voldemort but doesn't have 1. the drive for power and take over the world spirit as he does and 2. a backstory that makes things complicated (again that's not the right word). Umbridge wants to bring about change as she sees fit through the Ministry - through rules and regulations, through being an upstanding and influential member of society. She doesn't seek the power and glory Voldemort does, perhaps because she's not talented in the ways Voldemort is? Who knows. Those are the only two big differences I see in them.

Voldemort doesn't care about murdering random babies or inflicting pain on people who are unimportant to his cause. I'm sure this is a leap, but he doesn't seem necessarily interested in torture for torture's sake. She doesn't just torture school children a bit - she finds pleasure in finding many different ways to torture and humiliate children of /all ages/ at Hogwarts. Not just Harry and his cohorts, but anyone she finds displeasing. She targets people who are weaker than her or who stand in her way. I don't believe Voldemort would've gone to Seamus Finnigan's house and killed him as a child. Or any child that he deemed a threat. She gets off on seeing Harry's hand bleed and his helplessness as the book goes on. She terrorizes the first years and is condescending to everyone (even those who are on her side). Quite honestly, I don't know if Voldemort would give a rat's ass about anyone unless they did or had the potential to royally screw things up for him.

Anyway, basically I think she's just as much of an insane villain who will push any envelope of humanity and decency, but in different ways than Voldemort. If anything I find him more human than her - Riddle had weaknesses, he was exceptionally frightened of weakness, itself. He was scared of Dumbledore. He believed the prophecy and I think he was scared of Harry too. He clearly did not understand love because he'd never had it. His fear humanizes him in a way that I've found nothing about Umbridge that does.
