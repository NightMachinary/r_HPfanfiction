In the Universe that is Harry Potter are many side details and small facts, given in short asides in the books, interviews with JK Rowling, and through Pottermore. Then there are the little facts that deep in through the cracks. Things that start out as headcanons, small details added to fanfics to flesh out the world, or plot points that all too believably fit into the canon universe?

I'm not thinking about the common tropes that might irritate you in other peoples fics, but more of the things that you have to work to remember aren't canon or have to look up to confirm. So, what are the easiest traps to fall into as a writer with fanon facts that sound like they could easily be canon? Or that are hard to remember as being fanon over time?


** That Hogwarts letters arrive on a kid's 11th birthday. They arrive mid-summer before 1st year. Even the movies got that one right. Otherwise, a kid could be born the week before school starts and not get his letter until it's possibly too late for him to get all his supplies.

**** There's also the fact that Madame Rowling first said that the limit is the kid's 11th birthday, and afterwards took her word back and said it's sometime during the summer of their first year. So as far as “word of god” goes, she did say both, and it's one of the reasons why there are people who take nothing she said after the last book got released seriously.

** I've read in many, many fics recently where Hermione is called, either by other characters or by the narrator (author), the "brightest witch of her [the] age/generation" with some including "...of our time." Only Lupin made a reference to this in Prisoner of Azkaban, where he said that Hermione was the "most cleverest witch of her age he ever met." I understand that Hermione is popular but to heap this type of praise on her, while somewhat understandable, irks me greatly.

*** From what I remember, he meant it as a compliment regarding her work ethic and talent, and likely was comparing her to other children in her class (of her age). She's smart and dedicated, but not a super! genius! prodigy!, which she is often portrayed as in fanfics. And her being smart and dedicated, but not some child savant, is what made her such a likable and relatable character in the books! I hate when authors/fanfic writers take that aspect of her and replace it with some prodigy character that has an eidetic memory and never had to try--clearly, she tries so hard she almost keels over from exhaustion in book 3, and is shown to test her ability to the limit--and only stops when she literally CANNOt study and learn any more. She's motivated, driven, etc. and has an above average intellect and level of talent, but she is not some genius kid.

It's similar to her opinion that Snape redeemed himself. It's not a fact of the universe, it's a personal moral judgment. You can disagree with her on it, based on the facts of what happened, if you have different moral values.

In the same way you can disagree with JKR's assessment of Hermione as a borderline genius if you have a different standard of genius.

She seemed to be running things on zeal not brains, what with her public speeches calling muggles normals (Implying that the wizards were abnormal), the fact that she was shortsighted reforming laws after muggle laws (something other characters noted). Sure she was portrayed there smarter than she was shown in canon, but starfox kept her negative traits and in some ways amplified those as well.

***** JKR never showed her a such though. I see Snape as being borderline genius with his ability to modify potion recipes and create variety of new spells. I see Riddle as full Genius for everything he has managed to do. Dumbledore too i see as genius for the heights he has reached and some of his past achievements.

Hermione is shown as a hard worker. She doesn't make anything new. Her most creative is placing a prothean charm on coins and an extension charm on her handbag. Don't get me wrong, hard worker is a very admirable trait and it certainly allows her to reach considerable heights but she is never shown to have much in the way of genius. Shes fairly Intelligent yes, but far from what many fanfics portray her as.

******* I feel like this video perfectly sums up why I dislike Hermione being portrayed as perfectly awesome in fanfic: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IETG9vuHf58]]

we already have a fanfic portraying Hermione as perfectly awesome; all of the Harry Potter movies. In the movies all of Ron's good traits are transferred to Ron, and all of her good traits are amplified. And that, for people like me who read the books when they were young and then watched the movie when they were older, leading to the movies being fresher in their minds, led to confusion. I didn't get why JK Rowling wrote a story about a main character who so blatantly has to be carried on the back of his best friends superior intellect, and why Harry or Hermione bothered with Ron. And then I watched that video and I understood; JK Rowling didn't write hat story, the film makers did.

And I can see clearly how this has affected the culture of fanfiction. I can think of plenty of stories I've read that portray Hermione well, or extrapolate her intelligence. I can think of plenty of stories that portray Harry well, and extrapolate his badassness. But when it comes to the Ron I remember from the movies... what is there to extrapolate, really? His ability to whine? His inferiority issues? The shakiness of his friendship with Harry, that led him to, unlike Hermione, abandon him twice? I think the reason people get mad at seeing Hermione portrayed as so awesome in fanfics, is because the movies have already created a story where it makes no sense that Hermione is amazing, and Ron is a piece of glorified comedic relief.

PS: If anybody got any recs for fics that show Ron being badass or awesome or even just kind of clever, or unique or good in his own way please share. I can't even really remember what good personality traits Ron had in the books anymore, other than being great at chess.

Maybe because that is Harry's world. To him, Hermione IS the brightest/smartest girl.

We must not forget that Harry is just a 13 year old boy, and as such, may be prone to exaggerations.

****** Certainly! I always enjoy tinkering with ideas, even if my own ideas may be subpar themselves at times. it's fun to think at least!

Perhaps following the spirit of how it was originally used in the fic that spawned it, you can only use notice-me-not type spells to obscure specific facets of a thing, rather than the whole shebang. Say you randomly sprouted horns, a tail and perhaps a snout. You could only obscure the tail OR the weird shit going on with your face; it's limited to a very localized area. Cloaks however hide everything, generally speaking.

Possibly the charm only works for a very limited amount of time versus the indefinite time of a cloak. So you hide some aspect of yourself to enter a situation where revealing yourself as magical or having those traits would be taken poorly, or where casting a renewal on the spell would be seen as suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. A distinct disadvantage, unless you're only needing to be somewhere that hiding something is needed for a short period. A get-in and get-out in less than 30 minutes or so type deal rather than a long-term 'I need to hide in plain sight for several hours" scenario.

Maybe the spell was "in fashion" in an earlier time period before cloaks became more widespread, even ones inferior to Harry's Hallow one. They fell out of usage due to being more cumbersome and annoying to recast compared to the more stable discreetness of invisibility cloaks or even newer and more reliable charms. Or maybe counters to it became so prevalent that even casting a notice-me-not was deemed useless and was no longer done. Over time, because no-one used it anymore, people stopped learning the counters as a matter of course and so now they are semi-viable again until the counters also return to wide usage.

Perhaps, when compared to a cloak in modern times, the spell is just too much of a hassle to use, even considering how uncommon invisibility cloaks seem to be in canon. maybe it takes a while to cast, or requires a very complex type of casting, etc. It can still be used but it makes you stop and think if its worth going through that whole mess for just a short time-frame of use.

There are plenty of ways to limit them; it's just situational I think, in how you can implement them.

All this being hypothesized however, I do agree it is a very easy to abuse fanon mechanization, and in general it IS OP and should be avoided in wide usage. Edge cases are always going to be a thing of course; theres likely at least one magical core fic out there that's good, and some-one somewhere can probably write a decent usage of a notice-me-not charm. probably, in any case.

****** I personally like the approach that the charm only has effect if you don't stand out in any way---you pass if you are just one thing in a pile of rubbish and don't move, or if you are just one person in a line and don't do anything unusual, but if you pull attention to yourself with whatever you are doing it fails on the spot and if you stand alone in a corridor then it fails too because there's nothing to throw the attention of the observers to when it latches onto you---and the person looking at you isn't already looking /for/ you, so basically the charm is /trying/ to say “I'm insignificant” for the thing or person it is attached to.

Total fanon, and it came from a Snarry fic back in the early 2000's I believe? To hide a pregnancy or something.

And whether or not it invalidates the cloak depends on the author interpretation; I've seen it where the spell can be detected by wards or just by powerful magic users if they know what to look for, where as the cloak slides under the radar so to speak.

A less annoying brand of pedantry that would be appropriate here is to speculate on exactly how the charm determines what a fixed location is. For instance: It obviously doesn't track the greatest source of gravity on the location it's cast at; that's the sun, and the charm's affected location changes distance from the sun. Some people have invented ward stones; maybe if you dig up the ward stones and move them, you can move the area covered by the charm. But ward stones aren't mentioned in canon.

- All Potter men love redheads. Well, James and Harry did, but there's no word on whether or not this is considered a family trait or not.

- Fabian and Gideon Prewett were twins, and Fred and George Weasley were named in their honour.

- Silver is lethal to werewolves. This one is understandable, as it's a very common trait of werewolves in myths and other canons, but in the HP canon this does not seem to be the case, as Remus Lupin is never seen worrying about silver, and silver is pretty commonly used in the wizarding world.

We, (humanity) spend a lot of time and resources trying to make our lives easier and more convenient. Why can't Wizards do the same? A world that does not innovate becomes stagnant.

Maybe an oath can only be made in presence of a licensed DMLE officer? That way you eliminate the "11 year old politics swearing on their magic" trope.

I don't argue about its canonicity, instead, I say that there are ways to make a fanon fic more "realistic"...

******* I'd rather say it's more about inexperienced writers.

Even more so, I even dare say that new bad fanon is a *good* thing. Young people interested in the Potterverse means more people will eventually evolve to become decent writers, and maybe even authors of their own work.

There was this girl from my country, she started writing X-files fics, and then wrote a very tropey HP fic. It became national news, praising her for "making kids interested in reading"; and eventually published her own original book.

My point is, there will always be bad tropes and bad fanon, and Sturgeon's Law will have to be considered at all times. But maybe we should ask ourselves, why is this bad? Not /this is bad because it's fanon/, but instead /this is bad because it's badly done/. (You can't tell me that there are zero bad canon fics)

If a "good"/experienced writes makes bad fanon, it sucks, but it can be enjoyable under the right circumstances. Or it can be improved.

But if some high school kid writes some fanon, and the canon-eaters +crucify+ crucio him on the spot... Not good.

******** Sorry, but there are fanon ideas that I absolutely will NOT accept can ever be done well. Especially when they become so integrated in the fandom that fans start thinking they are actual canon and start complaining what a shitty writer JKR is for not adhering to her own canon... when that idea wasn't even canon to begin with. Or even start attacking other fanfic writers for not following that fanon.

I'm not saying fanon is inherently bad, or canon-compliant stories are inherently good. But that wasn't the original point with this post, it was just to point out "fans tend to think this is canon but it isn't," nothing said about quality. (My comments about bad fanon were mine, and the original poster had nothing to do with them.)

As for the thing about mean canon-eaters that destroy the confidence of high school kids that write fanfics, thereby hindering them from becoming real writers...

Most fanfic writers, at least most fanfic writers I've talked to, aren't interested in becoming professional writers. "It's just fanfiction, you're taking it too seriously, it doesn't have to be that good" was something I constantly heard back when I actually tried reviewing fanfics. Because I made the mistake of treating the story as if it was written by someone who wanted to become a professional writer and was genuinely interested in improving.

Now, I like to think I wasn't mean in my reviews; I tried as hard as I could to be constructive -- if I saw something good I praised it, if I had a problem with the writing, I tried to explain why I didn't think it worked, and offer suggestions on how I thought it could be improved. From the reactions I got, you'd think I'd have come in swearing and threatening to kill the writer; all those names I was called, how MEAN I was told I was, and "it's just fanfiction!"

So, I stopped reviewing. Unless I was specifically asked for an opinion I adopted a "no reviews" policy. But since then I'm a little wary of complaints of "mean critics."

There are several degrees of AU. You could make the arguments that all fanfic is essentially AU, as no fanfic writer can really make it canon. But it varies to which degree, and the degree of AU determines the rules of the story.

Say if you want to make a single-departure fic... I don't know, have a fic that diverges in fourth year so that something goes wrong with Crouch Jr.'s goblet plan and instead of Harry becoming the second Hogwarts champion, Ron does. This obviously would change the story a lot from hereon and send the plot spiralling in a new direction -- but since everything up until that point happened as in canon, the fic would still be bound by canon rules. So if the same fic all of a sudden claimed that, for example, Snape was a pure-blood and everyone started saying "so mote it be" and "I swear on my magic," and it was revealed that Harry was in fact Lord Potter-Black, everyone could Apparate on Hogwarts grounds, and there was a quick and easy spell that could raise people from the dead... then that fic would not adhere to the rules it was setting up for itself.

For stuff like that you need to go further with the AU. Say you want to do a fic where the rules of magic are different; maybe a story where the entire "I swear on my magic" oath is an accepted and established thing that can't be faked or fought against; then you'd need to do a lot more work to see how it would change the story and the world -- let's say there's one world where it's just THAT easy and convenient to prove that you're not lying.

Okay, then, how would this change the story? The Death Eaters would need to operate differently. There couldn't be any spies or double agents, because they could be found out at any time. All of a sudden, Snape's story AND Pettigrew's story are different, as is Sirius's. Because if you introduce such an easy convenient spell to the mix and then cling to the canon plot with no explanation to why this easy and convenient and completely unfallible spell did not work, then you're turning the entire cast into idiots. Essentially you're doing the "idiot plot," which usually only works in comedy fics.

At least Veritaserum and Pensieves have a reason for why they're not common procedeure to use (Veritaserum isn't infallible, Pensives are incredibly rare).

So this one change would have led to a different set-up from before Harry ever entered Hogwarts.

AUs aren't a bad thing, but you need to be consistent with them, otherwise it's a crappy story.

************* Of course, assuming that the authors respect the rules that they have set for themselves.

If a writer makes a consistent AU fic, then of course it's different that if the rules just go out the window by chapter 3.

In that case, is not really a situation of badly done fanon, but a case of bad writing skills.

You could even make the case for Rowling herself making up rules as the story moves. (Or new powers as the plot demands, as TVTropes says.)

It's her sandbox so she sets the rules... and despite what a lot of fans insist, she's a good enough writer to pull it off -- not to mention, she keeps the tone and the feel consistent. None of the new powers or magics introduced actually overturn the old story.

I'm a lot more lenient with going away from the canon rules if the author commits to creating a separate AU. That's saying from the start "I'm playing by my own rules here." As long as they don't then go on to say "because JKR's rules suck and she's a terrible writer and this is how it SHOULD have been!"

****** Not exactly. Fanon often enough is included by inexperienced writers without a second thought because they mistakenly take it to be canon despite the fact that ... well, often enough the fanon in question is just rubbish. And while you will find me agreeing that a lot of canon stuff is also woefully underexplored in terms of limitations, many of the things in fanon seem ... easier to break everything with if you don't know what you are doing. This means that while fanon is not inherently bad, the fact that it's not clear that it is fanon often enough makes it worse than it could have been; I mean, there absolutely are writers who did include canon stuff that completely didn't fit and introduced plot holes into their stories and they did it only because “hmm, I think that's canon so it has to be in”.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Blasting_Curse][Here]] the wand movement for a very powerful spell is literally "point and say", and for many other spells on this site the movenets tend to be fairly simple.

The only good descriptions of wand movements I've ever read tend to be from fics with a focus on combat. In some fics I feel like the person is actually executing complex patters purely on muscle memory and instinct which makes combat seem a lot more impressive.

Hell, you /can/ have machine gun magic that way, but only in the form of spell-chains which are specifically designed to work in conjunction with each other and need to be trained strenuously for optimal effect.

#+begin_quote
  So, what are the easiest traps to fall into as a writer with fanon facts that sound like they could easily be canon?
#+end_quote

Okay, I'm going to be the contrarian here, but it needs to be said: The most insidious thought in modern "fanon" is the devout praying at the altars of canon (in particular if it is concerning "extended universe" stuff like Pottermore, just a bunch of heartless facts that absolutely needs to be adhered too, because it's signed off by JKR). I'm not saying this to entirely undermine your point, because it's important to be at least aware of what is actually canon, in order to *cleverly* deviate from it, but the unimaginative-ness that has developed in this fandom is seriously hurting its fiction. Oh, and that's also true for relying on old fanon-cliches too much, which we will probably be in agreement about.

All these fanon things that we almost treat like canon (glamours, etc), which are being pointed out by everyone in this thread, come from a time in early HP-fanfiction (around OotP) when people weren't afraid to invent new stuff and really expand on the lore. Sure, not everything is going to be for everyone, but it's really upsetting to me how stagnant the community has become. And - IMHO - a big reason for this is that if you decide that Harry's grand parents should be Dorea and Charlus (because Blacks are cool and who gives a shit about Fleamont Potter, really?) there will be a bunch of foaming-at-the-mouth canon-worshippers blowing an aneurysm.

I won't speak for everyone, because I know a lot of people just want to see faithful canon-adaptions, but I've never been interested in the adventures of James Potter at Hogwarts 2.0, doing all the same shit in a different way. Please, give me all the Fanon Facts that you can come up with and add your own ridiculous ideas... don't forget about the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool][Rule of Cool]] while doing it.

*** Thank you so much for this.

Mistaking Fanon for Canon does kind of bother me (I've met people who thought the helpful Gringotts goblins were canon), but in the grand scheme of things I feel like ignoring canon is only a negative when it hints at a lack of care/attention. In that sense I mean fics like the ones that have a weird mix of real world events and available technology that just don't fit the 90s setting, in a fic that isn't making any attempt to actually shift the story's timeline.

I do miss the older years of this fandom. It feels like there used to be so much more variety, even if it was just out of necessity. Heck, I know most people hate them, but I'm beginning to feel nostalgic for all the self indulgent OCs instead of the current status quo of using rarely mentioned canon characters as empty shells.

Right. Because the HP-verse is becoming more and more well developed (through existing fanfic cliches and Pottermore), authors are becoming lazy and complacent. All the wild theories like "Oh, maybe Harry will become some kind of prodigy with wandless magic?" pushed Fanfiction in all kinds of directions. Sure, Super!Harry is lame, but you can still have him do or learn something new, no?

***** Part of the problem, I think, is that a lot of the people writing fanfics around OotP-era were also people who were around Harry's age (in the books) and could thus write believable/more believable characters. People who had grown up at the beginning of the internet age, circa mid 2000s, and before most of the movies (I think it was only through the 3rd movie then?) had gone and changed the characterization that Rowling had in the books (far superior to the movies, where Ron is gutted as a character, etc.). The writing quality tends to be superior, and the ideas were more developed. There was simply less crap to read, so people writing tended to write less crap.

There is a glut of crap writing now. And crap writers don't usually bother to come up with their own ideas but read a few (or a bunch) of stories they like and try to "write" a new story that is really just an agglomeration of the stories they've read/liked. And that sort of thing just doesn't work.

You pointed out the glamour, and in theory I do like the idea. However, and here is where most authors jump the border to "worse than canon" is when the charm is so easy, while being incredibly powerful in its illusion, that the author doesn't need to use any creativity to solve a problem the protagonist has. And personally, I'd like to see the "Glamour" as a Transfiguration, not a charm, with all its dangers included.

In other words, if the fanon used is just an easy cop out, then its not good fanon. (Same is true for canon, to be honest).

Sure... you already pointed out some big plot-holes if glamours are too easy or too useful. But then, don't forget that canon has time-turners too. So I don't really agree with the idea that there's some kind of standard in terms of "cop out" or "making sense" when it comes to canon. There's so much shit in canon that, if you think it through, would totally break the narrative (time turners are really just the tip of the iceberg).

If the glamours in your fic are way too useful and easy and make me wonder why they aren't used all the time, by everyone, for all kinds of things, I'm just as happy to give your fanfic the same benefit of the doubt that canon gets: Witches and Wizards just lack common sense and haven't thought about it yet.

I mean, I'm not going to write a review about it, but if I think something is just awfully convenient all of a sudden, then I tend to get a bit twitchy with my finger over that "x" on the tab. Then again, that also depends on what type of fic I read. If straight out of the gate the fanfiction makes clear that its a crackfic/Lord Potter roflstomp/ whatever... then I'll be more willing to look over these things, maybe even have a good laugh about them.

But there are also fics out there that take themselves very seriously, and there is where I get picky with this stuff. Especially when those fics are creative and entertaining, with great ideas, and then suddenly they have some "lol, I'll just snip this problem away" moment. There are fics out there that were just /broken/ after such a scene. At least for me. I've stopped reading some often recommended fics because they have some scenes in there that I just can't get over.

Anyway. Its always a question of where the limits of the individual reader is. I'm probably a bit pickier than a lot of people in some ways.

Absolutely. I refuse to demand more sense-making and internal-consistency from fanfics than I do from canon. And that's pretty close to zero for canon. The qualities of Harry Potter are absolutely not in the realm of "This is a rational story with a plot-line that makes sense and is consistent". Why would I require this from fanfiction then, when zero of my original enjoyment of HP comes from such things? (Though I thoroughly enjoy the attempt at fixing all the plot-holes).

******* I can already see that we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.

Frankly, I don't think just because canon has problems, it gives every other story out there a default pass to make equally as much plotholes and cop outs and just /mistakes/. I have to admit that I am not sure if I would enjoy the HP books nowadays. It has been a /long/ time since I read any of them last. I would think somewhere around 5 to 6 years. And there would be no sense in it either. I read every single one of them at least 4 times. Thats enough. Its enough that I have so much fond memories of it that I actively seek out more of it.

In any case, I hold writing in itself to a more general high standard that isn't necessarily relative to HP canon. A plot hole is a universally bad thing in storytelling - no matter what level of professionalism that storytelling is at. But canon and many fics have proven that you can have plotholes and still be enjoyable. It really depends on what the plothole is, and how jarring it is for your story. The puzzles in Philosopher Stone worked because they were a genuinely fun thing to read about, with a great sense of urgency and danger to it. I remember that I absolutely loved it as a kid and even enjoyed it as a young adult (which is when I read it the last time). If your plothole is enjoyable - I don't care much. Chances are I won't even notice it because I'm so thoroughly entertained. But if your plothole is just there to handwave a problem away, its just annoying, since it often also handwaves away any challenge and therefore any tension.

And just as a sidenote: I remain my opinion that the trap was quite ingenious, had it not been ruined by someone (Harry) who fulfilled the locking requirements. Had he not been interrupted, maybe Quirrel and Voldemort would've been captured by the Mirror's effect on them. It still /endangered a school full of kids/, thats not even a debate, but technically the trap would've worked very well.

And just for the fun of it, I'll argue this point anyway.

According to Newt Scamander there hasn't been a recorded Basilisk in 400 years on british soil. Furthermore, even Newt Scamander, one of the, if not /the/ greatest magizoologist, has no mention of the petrifying abilities of the basilisks gaze, only of its utter deadliness. The very fact that something was petrified and not just straight up dead may have led to a wrong path of research all along.

But that aside, it is this forceful setting of the stage for our protagonists that I came to resent a bit in literature. It doesn't just happen in Harry Potter - its quite wide spread actually. YA novels are especially fond of it.

**** I kind of like the idea of a glamor as being something very surface-level, where a finite (or a more complicated or annoying reversal charm) can just get rid of it--and where it doesn't do all that much. It could be like makeup---it can change the appearance, and people that really understand lighting and contours, etc. can do a lot more, and maybe arithmancy and understanding the spell better plays into that, but it's limited in what it can do. And if someone touches your face or you get water on you or something, the 'glamour' won't actually make it look like the water is where it should be, but the water/etc. will actually follow the shape of your face. So people tend to use it more like makeup to give the illusion of a different face shape or hide imperfections. And like makeup, a glamour needs to be reapplied and can only do so much.

And I like the idea (idk if i read it somewhere/where i read it?) of having to take into account sub-surface things like sinuses, facial cavities, where your facial muscles and cranial nerves and cartilage and tendons, etc. lie in your face in order to transfigure it to change how it looks. As in, you can't just give yourself a smaller 'pert' nose, you have to change the shape of your sinuses, your nasal cavities, the way your nerves fit on your face and the bone's shape and cartilage and how your facial muscles sit around your 'new' nose and everything MUST be taken into account. Or you fuck up your face/nose and can't breathe and need emergency medical attention.

And that is why human/self-transfiguration is NEWT level work.

How do you manage to Apparate to a place you've never been? How long does Portkey travel take? This is where fan fiction authors can fill in the gaps, but the trick is doing it in such a fashion where it enhances canon rather than distracting from it.

A hot-air charm is a tool you can use to address cold weather. It has downsides -- you're going to be melting snow, for instance, and that's going to refreeze and make the ground slippery. You warm the air around you, so you're going to stay uncomfortable while snow melts out of your clothing. You probably have to maintain focus until you want to stop heating up the air. There's going to be a decent delay between applying the charm and feeling warm, and it's going to be closer to standing by a fire than an even warmth.

The second most common version I've seen is permanent and applied to clothing. That version can be used to highlight someone's wealth or poverty, or their knowledge of the wizarding world -- perhaps it's cheap to enchant clothing like that, so only muggleborns dress in layers. Perhaps it's expensive, so it's a sign of wealth to walk around in light clothing in winter. That would support a story in which those issues are prominent.

*** u/Taure:
#+begin_quote
  Without arguing semantics, wards are technically canon if we don't argue semantics thanks
#+end_quote

It's not really semantics, in that it has an impact on how the magic is written.

In HP, magic is generally grouped into branches which share similar properties: Transfiguration, Charms, etc. By using the term "wards" the natural implication is that the magic within that area is a branch of magic in the same way that Charms, Transfiguration etc are.

But "wards" are not a distinct branch of magic. They consist mainly of Charms and Curses. It is a category which does not fit in with the rest of the HP magic classification system, organising by function rather than by magical nature, and overlapping with the true branches of magic.

In doing so it can lead people to forget that "wards" is not a distinct magical field but rather simply a shorthand way of referring to magic which more properly belongs to the other branches of magic. That in turn will generally lead to these items of magic being mistreated (said abuse generally involving runes).

Ultimately this isn't about being /different/ to canon, this is about being /worse/ than canon. Like many fanon inventions, wards take something which is interestingly complex in canon and make it simple. Having magical protections be composed of a mix of magic of different natures and governed by different rules has a messiness to it which makes it feel more realistic - the real world is a messy place. I don't understand why anyone would want to get rid of that in favour of neat categorisation.

TL;DR: the problem isn't the word "wards", the problem is people treating wards as a branch of magic. Which happens in basically every fic which has ever used the word "wards".

In the original draft of "Philosopher's Stone," the Grangers lived near the coast, and Crawley is not near the coast. (Then again, in that draft, the Potters lived on an island, and that was changed for the final version of the story, so...)

In the first "Deathly Hallows" movie, the scenes where Hermione leaves her house after having modified her parents' memories, were shot on-location in Hampstead. This doesn't necessarily mean it's supposed to be Hampstead in-universe, but still it's the closest thing we really get to any canonical hints about the Grangers' residence.

** I think the biggest thing about HP canon and fanon blurs are we're dealing with a universe that is set in our world.

And while we suspend our disbelief to an extent we still bring our notions. And since it's set in our world with at least our calender and time sets we sorta expect certain things.

So why aren't runes a thing beyond a throwaway visual? Why aren't wards their own thing? They can conjure a shield from their wands that can take some beating so why can't we extrapolate from there?

How does spell creation work? There seems to be some magic based physics at work here (refer to Gamps Law of Elemental Transfiguration) but how does that actually work when magic itself renders physics laws silly.

So when we distance ourselves from canon and stay in fanon, the basics of the world will blur because the answers aren't there.

In case it wasn't apparent wards bother me for not being canon explicitly. Yes I understand semantically they're actually there but given what the purpose of a ward is it really should be it's own thing with a clear definition.

Or rather, things not covered by Gamp's law (things that cannot be transfigured, kind of like how Newtonian physics breaks down at relativistic speeds, but works well enough for everyday interactions).

Further, of those, there is only direct reference to one: food. We can infer that currency is another (or else the vaunted Galleon [indeed, anything] would have no worth whatsoever). Also, we know that true resurrection (of humans, at least) is impossible. Not sure how much (if anything) that would have to do with transfiguration, though.

New life can be easily created, though. See: /Avis/. JKR did state that nothing that is conjured is permanent, though, so either the birds created by /Avis/ just disappear (and die) after a while, or they were never alive to begin with.

Apparently water conjured with /Aguamenti/ is not a conjuration, or else drinking it would mean that at some point in the future, some molecules would randomly disappear from your body, when the conjuration ran out.

Next, we know that magic cannot create true love, only infatuation (from the Amortentia passage). Again, not sure what that has to do with transfiguration.

Lastly, transfiguration cannot replace that which has been lost to dark magic. This is why Moody is missing an eye and a leg, why Bill's face scars aren't healed, why George is missing an ear (this one is weird, because Harry attacked Malfoy with Sectumsempra, and Malfoy was healed, while Snape attacked George with it, and George lost his ear permanently.

b) She was part of the Potter family. Consider this, Lucius Malfoy was an incompetent fool but he gave Voldemort advantages. He was filthy rich, well-connected and socially adept.

  MA: What about the three times-- The thrice-defying of Voldemort?

  JKR: Of James and Lily?

  MA: Of Neville's parents. Well, James and Lily, too.

  JKR: It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting. Also, James and Lily turned him down, that was established in "Philosopher's Stone". He wanted them, and they wouldn't come over, so that's one strike against them before they were even out of their teens

****** How could Lily do anything wrong? She even apologized to owls for opening letters late! She always befriended the underdog and didn't lie at all! She can't over exaggerate anything! She was always in the good and never teased Petunia. Petunia was the one who always provoked her!

Lily Evans could cast the patronus charm wandlessly and nonverbally at the tender age of nine. Lily could defy all of Gamp's Laws of Transfiguration because she's just sooooo powerful and the second community of Merlin. She was the best girl in her year without actual evidence but it's okay because it's Lily! Sirius and James were stupid, yeah? They didn't receive straight 'O's and no one described them as the cleverest students in the entire school.

Lily was described as very pretty so that means she was the hottest girl to ever graduate from Hogwarts, can make a dozen veelas look like hags and trolls (I've seen this... a lot) and is just so flawlessly perfect and beautiful, all guys want her and all the girls want to be her. They view her with green-eyed envy and are just sooooo untalented compared to the goddess Lily (all hail Lily full of grace and you'll be spared from entire darkness forevermore!).

Lily is just very kind. Veeeeeeery kind and brave and selfless and popular but she's very quiet, a bookworm (where did this come from? Seriously? Can't you get a little more creative with her hobbies and interests? Maybe she liked Quidditch, sports or music? Maybe she was a big fan of TV shows? Movies? Traveling the world?), academic and is basically Hermione 1.0.

Did I mention that Lily was Hogwarts' darling? Yes she was. All the professors loved her and she was /EVERYONE'S/ favorite student. She was also everyone's best friend and she held the best tutoring sessions in the library.

But of course, you told me that Lily must have some flaws and she does! She has a lot of flaws and is not a Mary Sue and I have just proved that she is not perfectly portrayed by the fans.

On a more serious note though, I think Rowling intended for her to be a mix between Ginny and Tonks. We can gather from canon that she was: extroverted, a daredevil, bubbly, vivacious, cheeky, a ball of happiness, sunny, very funny, chill, selfless and curious. Doesn't sound like Hermioen to me. It sounds like [[https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality][this]]. It doesn't sound like this: [[https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality][this]], or [[https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality][this]] and certainly not [[https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality][this]].

Now, from the etymology of her name I think it backs up the 'innocent ball of sunshine' personality but the [[http://www.whats-your-sign.com/animal-symbolism-deer.html][doe]] for a patronus doesn't fit. Now, I firmly believe her original patronus was not a doe and it became one after she fell for James. One of my friends says that a hummingbird (or an otter. To this day I can't understand how an otter could be /Hermione's/ spirit animal) would fit her personality.

My other friend, however, believes that her patronus was a unicorn. Hear me (her) out! She said that when looking at her name's etymology and the symbolism of the unicorn plus her canon personality it made perfect sense and I grudgingly agreed (more special snowflake! Yaaay!).

I believe Rowling intends for her to be a pure ball of happiness (I have a problem with pure but not ball of happiness). Her name's [[http://www.whats-your-sign.com/lily-meaning.html][meaning and symbolism]] certainly supports it.

** Point and shoot spells for combat are very common.

Cannon does not get too deep into magical combat at all simply because the author needed flexibility, and most of cannon mostly supports this to a degree; but it is also not specified and their are counter examples such as Harry summoning his Firebolt from well out of line of sight (and thus the ability to aim his wand).

It is very unrealistic considering the specific mentions of complex wand motions. It would be one thing to train yourself to be able to aim a wand properly, but to arbitrarily begin and end a complex wand motion based on an opponents location would be several orders of magnitude more difficult. It is also common to have the main character(s) learn to dodge spells, but any such training would be rendered useless the moment someone invented new spells that are aimed by thought/name/willpower/etc... or one that was not bullet/beam based.

*** Adding to this, we get to see in both the Dumbledore-Voldemort duel in book 5 and the McGonagall-Snape duel in book 7 that duels between powerful wizards aren't just them shooting spells at each other like bullets.

In the D-V duel, Dumbledore uses spells to animate statues, make a flaming whip and cause water to attack Voldemort and even though V mostly uses the killing curse and a silver shield spell, he does turn the fire whip into a snake.

It's more apparent in the M-S duel - M uses the fire whip which S turns into a snake (again), and then M blasts the snake to smoke and turns it into knives, so S had to summon a suit of armour in the way. Flitwick then arrives and animates a suit of armour, causing S to flee.

I think the reason so many point and shoot spells are used in Fanon is since so many of the iconic spells (Stunning spell, Disarming charm, Killing curse) are all like this. So much potential for cool and interesting duels, and authors just go with lame point and shoot spells.

** I think the actors changed our view of canon. Alan Rickman made Snape a stern taskmaster, rather than a cruel and bitter man who bullied children. Daniel Radcliffe was good, but they gave a lot of Harry's best lines to. Hermione to make her seem more intelligent. Harry in the books was a sassy little shit who was pretty intelligent and easily the best dueler in his year.

Wizard logic. Logic is a set of guidelines that help us operate based on the world around us. Magic is a game changer and thus, wizards logical actions would be far different. So many authors see this as a plothole to be changed. Biggest example is neville. "Omg neville your family is abusive". Magic can fix any non magical injury as long as his heart is beating. To wizards, dropping him out the window to trigger his magic is like letting go of your kid when he's learning to ride without training wheels.

Lastly, Luna. Luna is not a seer, or a veela. Luna is special because she's a weird and empathetic character that likes Harry for being Harry. She's also a measure of his emotional maturity. At the start of OotP, he's embarrased to be seen with her, but doesn't care by HBP, when he realizes her value. Don't ruin her character by needing her to be "something" to increase her value
