Hi, I'd like fanfics where Harry is trans and a girl, preferably also a girl who is into girls. Thanks.

*Pranking The Tournament*

Harry takes a potion to turn into a girl, no real pairing.

*A Fair Life*

Harry is originally a girl, but was transfigured into a boy for the greater good™. She becomes a girl again after going back in time to fix things, so it kinda fits since he (or she) lived as a boy in her previous life. Also, her soulmate is a girl so she is into girls.

*** I read Pranking The Tournament and thought it came off pretty cringe. It literally just kinda went " Oh I Harry Potter have been entered into a tournament against my will and nobody believes me? Well have I got the best PRANK to pull on them, I'm going to physically change MYSELF into a girl, and wear girl clothes, and makeup etc, and I'm going to act like a girl and stuff. That'll totally PRANK them won't it? Hey Hey teachers and staff look at me I'm a GIRL now, don't you feel so fucking PRANKED right now? Well do you? Hey Hey STUDENTS and PEERS I have turned myself into a GIRL. Isn't that FUNNY? Do you feel like totally PRANKED from my awesome PRANK that I have pulled on you? Oh yeah this PRANK that I Harry Potter am currently pulling is certainly making everyone feel real PRANKED" and kinda just kept doing that. Honestly the whole "prank" part kinda ruined the entire thing, if they had shown a Harry Potter with gender dysphoria and then have Harry use the tournament as an excuse to transition and wrote the results of that it would have been a better story.

**** Yeah, a prank like that is only good for its initial shock value of making his point about the whole 'entered into a 4th school' thing, after which it's just an excuse for Harry to transition.
