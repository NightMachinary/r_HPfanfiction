So I've noticed that nearly all soul-bond, soul-mate fanfics have Harry as one of the two (usually with Ginny or Hermione) or failing that, Draco (usually with Hermione).

I'm wondering if there are any soul-bond fics where Harry is NOT one of the bonded. Ideal situation would be Ron Weasley and Hermione for maximum fun as he would be right in the center of it without being it. However, I would be willing to accept other pairings save anything to do with Snape.


** How about Trio soul-bond as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167)?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

Well, usually Ginny - Hermione is much more rare from my observations.

** I never understand the appeal of soulbond stories. Could someone explain what's so good about that? To me it sounds little more than forced get-together and borderline sanctioned rape.

*** In most fics, your soul mark is nothing more than an indicator. In a way, it is kind of like fate is arranging marriages, but they usually gloss over this by the two people being "perfect" for each other. I've seen some where people are able to combat it as if it were just a biological suggestion because they're in love with someone that doesn't share their soul mark.

Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. [Currently Being Updated.
