A few years ago I was really into fics that included a time travelling Harry and the founders. So I thought I might give it a go once more. But I have no idea where to start.\\
Looking for good fics that include Salazar Slytherin. Idc if he is paired with Harry (I have a preference for Slash so these fics are welcome) or if Harry is somehow Salazar. But it can alsp simply be a fic in which the founders play are part.

Doesn't have to be time travel. Generally more interested in completed fics but if it's a good one feel free to rec a WIP or so.


** So many times this and this and then this again. Though the more important character is actually his brother, there is plenty of Salazar in the third part. Time travel a-plenty, but the complexity of that takes plenty of time to realise.
