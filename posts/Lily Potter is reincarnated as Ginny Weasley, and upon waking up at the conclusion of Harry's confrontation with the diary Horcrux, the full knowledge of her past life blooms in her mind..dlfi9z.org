Think of this as a bit of a piss-take on the "Ginny is just like Lily" trope, where here she literally is, along with an alternate take on Ginny getting a knowledge/power boost because of/from the diary Horcrux.

*** Not quite the same but there is a snippet in Rorschach's Blot's Odd Ideas collection. The twins convince Harry that Ginny is his sister hidden away for her protection, the problem? She still wants to marry him. The snippet was titled Sick, I believe, if you want to check it out

**** Absolutely NOT! There will be no incest story on my watch. Ewwww! Why are so many fanfic fans such perverts (that has been already suggestion of the incest story - first on pink and fluffy HarryGinny subreddit). Cannot you imagine brother-sister relationship without an incest? Really?

***** Sounds like there's no incest involved. The twins lied to Harry, and Ginny has no idea he thinks she's his sister. I haven't read it, so I can't be sure.

***** You have an odd definition of incest. Harry and Ginny are not biological siblings and they have not been raised together either. Unless Lily is a secret Weasley and Harry and Ginny are actually cousins, there can be no incest in this situation.

**** The problem (and the reason why I haven't posted it to AO3 yet) is that I have no clue where I am going with it. Basically my idea is that Harry (& Ginny) would be in better position than in the beginning of HBP, but probably not different enough to make much dent in the story of HBP. I strongly reject any ideas of super!Harry or super!anybody, bashing anybody, superRich!anybody, or some kind of mythological whatever, so I am afraid that the result would be just rewrite of the last two books, which is not enough. Probably will leave what I write for adoption by anybody who cares.

** There's the /minor/ problem that canonically Ginny is born /before/ Lily dies. That's simple enough to change for such a story though.

**** I suppose. In that case, why not have /Ginny/ be reincarnated as /Lily/? Or you could even go [[http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html][a step further]].

** Lily immediately jumps on Harry and hugs him, which he assumes is because of the rescue thing, but once she finally lets go she starts talking rapid-fire trying to tell him everything. She doesn't really know where to stop and ends up rambling quite a bit about embarrassing topics to an increasingly stunned Harry.

Harry ends up in shock, so she gathers everything up, stuns and obliviates Ron when she notices him, stuns and obliviates the already mind-wiped Gilderoy, looks thoughtfully at Fawkes before deciding that obliviating a phoenix is a bad idea and probably unnecessary, drags everyone up to Dumbledore, frees Dobby, catches up with Dumbledore in front of an increasingly shell-shocked Harry, reassures the Weasleys that everything is fine but doesn't tell them anything about being Lily, then everyone's off to bed.

She notices Ron's rat the next day, hits it with at least four different confinement spells, sends a patronus to Dumbledore, gets Sirius out of Az, then tears into his hide for letting Harry get left with Petunia before they both end up turning into a sobbing mess.

Dumbledore briefly tries to suggest Harry go back to Privet Drive but Lily gives him the evil eye. He hesitantly starts to try another argument at which point she tears into him with a rant about how having her actual /soul/ around to anchor any protections will be far more effective than using blood as a mere proxy. Sirius and Harry move into some random Potter property, Lily is disgruntled when she realizes she's twelve and isn't going to get to move out of the Burrow, so she ends up apparating over when Molly isn't looking and spending the majority of the summer there anyway.

Lily!Ginny quickly freaks everyone out over the summer and then at school by taking normal!Ginny's fangirlish stalker tendencies to eleven, which Harry is both too mortified to explain and still doesn't want to upset the Weasleys by telling them about her memories. Ron is increasingly disturbed, Fred and George figure it'll be fine and decide to fan the chaos by giving her the map instead of Harry.

Over Hogsmeade weekend, Lily!Ginny is sitting around unable to go because she's a year younger and starts sulking about how a bunch of skanks will probably be trying to drag her Harry into Puddifoot's. She then realizes that since they're not biologically related, it wouldn't technically be incest so there's no reason she can't ship herself with Harry and get to raise the next generation of Potters after all.

She keeps this mostly to herself at first while going back and forth about it and giggling creepily around corners, which Harry gets chills over but assumes is just more of the same. But then the Yule Ball happens and somehow she makes him take her as his date, and a month after that he happens to notice a note sticking out of one of her books where she's been scribbling plans for fifth year and later.
