Could the Sorting hat have the power to recall any of the main items from the four founders and not just Gryffindor's sword? Maybe it's a storage for important items that each Hogwarts headmaster leaves behind as a secret tradition? Or perhaps it's connected to the room of requirement and it's many curious and forgotten objects? After all, the Sorting Hat is sentient and it's main job is to match people's personalities into places (and with things, wink wink) that would help them succeed and flourish (or to survive a battle with horrible odds, the sorting hat is just versatile like that)


** He accidentally pledges to Minerva McGonagall ("I swear, if I get out of this, I'll never skip my transfiguration homework again!") and the hat ends up summoning the ancient Banshee-Skin Bagpipes of Clan MacGuffin, the original rulers of Hogsmeade when the founders were around (and McGonagall's magical ancestry.) :D

**** /shrugs/

First thing that came to mind. I grew up in Scotland - I friggin' love bagpipes. :D

And yep. Honestly, pledging to do my homework if a teacher saved me from death is probably something I'd do - feels like a fair trade. Especially for Maths homework. Ugh. :D

I'm adding this prompt to my to-write list for a full series of one-shots with different things coming out of the Sorting Hat. Even got a name for it - "What's in the Hat?!" :D

** Loyalty to Dumbledore brought Fawkes to Harry, just being a brave Gryffindor was good enough for the sword (and only the sword works this way because the hat was Godric's, and it is meant to be a play on magicians pulling swords out of hats).

Perhaps Harry could pull a rooster from the hat.
