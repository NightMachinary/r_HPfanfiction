Maybe that's just it; Dumbledore arrives in time to rescue Harry when he's injured fighting Quirrel. Fawkes shows right on time to help Harry against the basilisk. Harry saves himself from a hundred dementors right on time with the help of a time turner. The Order of the Phoenix is right on time bursting into the Department of Mysteries.

** He can kill Snape with a single touch because the life debt was not repaid (and Snape was the reason why the Potters were targeted).

On a more serious note, it would be interesting to read a story where Harry can talk to his dead parents and they help him out with all kinds of issues, like Lily answering Snape's questions and James being the equivalent of a sci-fi AI when Harry plays Quidditch (Beater at 9 o'clock, dive right) or helping his son flirt without it turning into a real character mash-up like in "The lie I lived". Imagine Lily and James as Harry's Cortana.

** Buying time, hm?

The closer Voldemort gets, the more time starts to distort between them. As they try to combat each other, they end up fighting each other at different points in time over the course of a few hours, fighting past and future versions in a confusing four dimensional battle. It's like a Benny Hill doorway chase with applied combat.

It's nearly useless if you're not doing stuff that involves reactions to rapidly changing physical situations.

In a duel in the HP-verse, its effectiveness depends greatly on how spells move (instantaneous vs tracking vs ballistic) and how well the assisted person can recognize and counter spells based on wand movements.

It would be fairly useful in duelling against most spells (if you are at mid-distance you would probably have a decent time to dodge/ shield but probably not counter) it might be gotten around by transfiguration or something else that is unconventional as while you have increased reactions that doesn't help if there is no solution that you are capable- 2 Mistborns all have the exact same abilities, but Flitwick, MGonagall and Snape all have different specialties and therefore things that the others cannot do.

** I have no doubt that many people would have tried to save their loved ones, mothers like Lily. The difference here is that a prophecy was made, and that changed everything. That made a "normal" sacrifice magically different.

I think your priority should be the sacrifice in relation to the prophecy, which means that James's sacrifice could mean something more substantial.

I've always wondered at the prophecy behind. How did it come to be? Why does the ability to forsee the future exist? Is it a cosmic stabiliser? Did Trelawney get it by magic, or just random? What would've happened if no prophecy existed - does that mean free reign for Voldemort?

In many stories, it seems that magic is almost sentient.

What was magically different was that Voldemort offered to spare Lily if she stepped aside and let him kill Harry. How often do child-murderers do that? Basically, the events go like this:

1. Voldemort kills James. He does not offer to spare James, so no special consequences.
2. Voldemort offers Lily to step aside and be spared (as a favour to Snape).
3. Lily refuses.
4. Voldemort kills Lily. Sacrificial Protection for Harry is created.
5. Voldemort tries to kill Harry, Sacrificial Protection makes the spell backfire.

Notice that if Voldemort hadn't offered /or/ had rendered Lily unconscious or just tied her up, then there would be no Sacrificial Protection.

*** I do need to note that technically, the prophecy has no magical power behind it at all, at least in canon; Trelawney's first prophecy only comes true because Voldemort heard the first couple of lines and (being muggle-raised) believes in it. The notion that said prophecy is somehow magically binding and gives Harry special powers is a fanon invention.

If you do want to make prophecies immutable, I came up with this idea that they could be a deliberate kind of fate-bending magic where the prophet utilises their magical power to force them to come true (Sleeping Beauty and that spinner's wheel prick thing, anyone?).

Centaurs could predict the future, but most would lack the power to make it come true. Sybil Trelawney isn't necessarily a powerful witch, so her prophecies rely on exploiting human nature and random chance to get the job done. Voldemort's malediction on the Defence Against the Dark Arts position might be a particularly powerful prophecy, altering the fate of the world and the minds of hundreds of people just to ensure someone will eff-up the DADA post every year.

This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

** There is a massive problem here in that it expands a plot hole in the book.

Lily's sacrifice granted magical protection? How is this not super common. The type of war they were fighting involved regular home invasions. There should be a whole hoard of people lying around who only got out of a life threatening situation because a loved one sacrificed or did a last stand.

This is usually addressed in fanfic in one of two ways:

1) Genius Runemaster Lily found some complex ritual to give her son protection and was running a Xanatos Gambit

2) It only worked due to the particulars of the circumstances (ie, because she died right before)

Both of these get undermined if you have James also involved. 1) weakens by reducing the uniqueness of the caster. 2) weakens because by expanding the particulars of the circumstances you end up back at "how is there not a dozen people walking around with this protection"

If you wanted to do it with James, wouldn't be better to have it be instead of Lily, instead of as well as Lily? That would fit either model a lot better....

**** I believe I covered that under #2.

Although I still consider it a plothole. No one found themselves in a situation they could have escaped but instead turned around, dug in, and bought their loved ones time to flee? Or if it requires intent of the killer, there are no reluctant killers out there saying to themselves "please just turn around and go I don't want to be forced to kill you"?

Anyway, for this discussion it falls squarely under #2. The circumstances around it were special and specific. If you expand that to James you undermine the reasoning

Edit: I mean, it isn't as bad as some of the major oversights (/cough money cough/), but it is still rather... Loosely defined. Perhaps plothole is a bit too strong of a term, since loosely defined yet believable can be good for a story, let readers fill in their own logic

Thanatos would work as well though. I would imagine that would be less "I am planning for all possible outcomes" and more "She heard the prophecy and realized that it would likely result in her death regardless of what precautions are taken, so let's make a plan for that"

One way to address it:

In the magical world, love is rare. Parents might value their children (once they're proven to be capable of magic), and they might be attached to their other family members, but love is just not really a thing. Hagrid's shunned in part because he openly loves his animal friends. Love is the power Voldemort knows not because he simply hadn't encountered it growing up or at Hogwarts. A self-sacrifice driven by love just hadn't come up before.

It also falls squarely under point #2, that the circumstances are unique, and trying to make that apply to James would weaken it :)

** I feel like James's protection would prevent any active attempts to get at Harry and actually could clear up some discrepancies?

Harry entered the bathroom with the troll himself. He did the same for Quirrel. He never had contact with Riddle or the Basilisk until he went down there himself. Sirius could find him because he wasn't actually tryina harm Harry - Pettigrew just wanted to live, not harm Harry. Harry had to grab the portkey himself after actively trying to get to it. Harry did cause the detentions with Umbridge by his actions (although it was hecka unfair) and she was there vs Dumbledore rather than him specifically. 6th year, Death Eaters attacked the castle specifically when he /wasn't there/. 7th year, Voldemort tried to get to him when Harry just wanted to go somewhere, and Harry's wand personally smited Voldie. The only time he was actually caught was when he broke the Taboo.

There was nothing that happened to him without him instigating it in some way shape or form. Lily's protection sets Voldemort on fire, James' protection prevents any active assassination attempts.
