I stumbled on this fic today, which has seventeen chapters filled with great, clever ideas and a lot of creative energy and... four reviews, two follows (whomp whomp). Here's the linkffn(12588405)

I'm currently thinking about what to post as my review, because I want to praise this person's writing a lot but also give them some tips about how to edit out the boring bits. I think they could bring in more readers if they edited a bit, but then again... OC-heavy stories just don't do very well (which is a real tragedy, IMO). So it might not be worth it for me to tell this person how to write (something I never feel entirely comfortable doing anyway) if it doesn't result in many more eyeballs anyway.

Anyway, I wanted to draw attention to it because I think it's great.


** It's not a particularly gripping opening. Loaded with Americanisms, too much description and writing as though the reader doesn't know about the magical world - I know that Rowling does this for the first few books, but fanfic writers need to remember their audience.

*** I agree. It's very good-natured and energetic but it's got a lot more problems than just OCs. That said, it probably wouldn't matter about the writing style and lack of research if Harry was the main character.

** I definitely think you should review if you haven't already (and so should I obviously). Every chapter in fact, if you can face it. The writer deserves massive credit for keeping going in the face of such soul-crushing indifference, and believe me, when you're in that situation every review is like fairy dust. But you're right to think that the writer needs to know where the problems (or at least some of the problems) are. It's not fair to let them think everything is just fine as it is, but be gentle. In seventeen chapters there are opportunities to gently point out seventeen problems without overpowering the positives. Maybe spread it out over a couple of weeks though so you don't overwhelm them. If they are receptive to your reviews, maybe you could offer to beta, though that would be a pretty big job.

*** I'm struggling to articulate /what/ needs to change, exactly. You and Floreat are right to point out the odd American-ness of this story, but I want to focus on the story's pacing. The “flow” needs to be adjusted, somehow. I want to tell him/her to streamline the dialogue a bit, maybe have the characters get to the point a little faster... but I'm not sure that's the problem, actually.

Floreat may be right about the fact that there's way too many chapters which are just introduction to magic at the beginning, which is what is causing me to /skim skim skim skim skim --- oh that's really cool --- skim skim skim skim --- oh what a creative idea --- skim skim skim skim --- oh that was funny ---/

(I'm rambling a bit here, just thinking outloud)

**** I think people get confused about the whole show vs tell thing and they forget to write concisely. In depth description has a place in good prose, but there needs to be a purpose to it beyond simply setting the scene. It needs to be saying something about the character or advancing the plot, and for the most part less is more.
