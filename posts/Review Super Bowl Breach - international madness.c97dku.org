Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

I haven't even finished reading it yet and I already have to recommend this awesome fic.

Basically, Harry accidentally flies past a camera, they forgot to wipe the footage because they have to worry about more important things and assume that the obliviators will handle it.

Unfortunately, the obliviator doesn't manage to destroy the last copy of the footage before it's broadcasted as part of a Super Bowl advertisement with millions watching.

It's 1996, and the statute of secrecy just went down the drain.

The magical countries manage to scramble together a somewhat decent introduction of magic to the world, but now that magic is known, problems start to appear.

Voldemort is no longer satisfied ruling over magical Britain and tries to take over the entire world.

Osama Bin Laden realizes the potential of jihadist wizards.

Vernon's cousin in Westboro starts preaching against wizards.

A North Korean witch starts to openly use magic, and the glorious leader gets interested.

MIT students immediately try to mess around with flying brooms.

Harry gets house arrest for his role in the breach.

Someone starts a "wizard for hire" company.

The Pope gets in theological arguments with the ghost of a 3000 year old biblical character about why there's three religions for the same God.

Bentley Motors unveils the world's first mass produced flying car, powered by Magicâ„¢.

And that's just a tiny fraction of the madness from the first part of the story.

The entire work is over a million words long, has awesome worldbuilding, the story focuses on what happens all around the world and not just in Hogwarts, and it's absolutely great.

There are no common tropes, almost every chapter introduces completely original ideas.

If you like worldbuilding, creativity, competent villains and catastrophic terrorist attacks that make 9/11 look tame, you'll love it.


** I will offer an opposing opinion. The fic contains a lot of cool moments, but as many severely underwhelming ones, and if I were offered an opportunity to get the time I spent reading this fic back, I would take it.

The fic loses its soul somewhere in the second act. Some canon characters die in two sentences with little fanfare (McGonagall dies in a raid in two sentences with no description of how or why--it's more or less 'when the dust cleared, McGonagall and others were dead'--and the author claims that it doesn't make sense that she's a competent fighter in canon because she's a schoolteacher), while others manage to come back from death entirely and completely contradict the themes of canon (After studying Buddhism, Hermione manages to do Lily's sacrifice but for the WHOLE WORLD, and then comes back as a ghost (although apparently in the original version of the story she came back to life outright)).

I think the author tries to be gritty, dark, and realistic, yet also tries to pretend he's still telling a Harry Potter Story. In the end, neither goal is met. If this world were truly gritty and realistic, there is no sensible reason for an American religious fundamentalist to be related to Vernon Dursley except to tie the story back to Harry Potter, a character we actually care about. There is no real reason for most of the magical world's activity in America to focus around the author's college, MIT. There is no real reason for most of the plot to happen.

The fic also remains depressingly filled with plot-holes, like canon, by having Voldemort try to take over the world, yet in attacking the premise of the Harry Potter series in this way damages its own narrative structure. The Middle East falls to Lucius Malfoy's Imperius curse. Middle Eastern wizards are mentioned and promptly swept away. This begs the question: if it's so trivially easy for a single Death Eater to puppet an entire Middle Eastern country, why didn't wizards conquer the world in 1692 instead of going into hiding? This is still a canon problem, but at least in canon you can imagine that there are some protections around world leaders.

Finally, a lot of the middle-end consists of descriptions of wars between various hidden magical nations, ripped from Gulliver's Travels. There is A LOT of this, and it is not as interesting as it sounds. My personal problem with this is that I don't care about fictional nations from Gulliver's Travels when I'm reading a Harry Potter fanfic, nor do I think the average fanfic reader would either. Alas, there is little character work done in this entire piece, and for this and the aforementioned reasons I must warn other prospective readers away from this fanfic.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** This one does go off the rails.

I think this was also the one with magical slave states still existing and about to be revealed... That plot seemed like it had potential
