Generic-Polite-Goblin-Number-23 (or just Griphook) directs their mark to the "special" accounts reserved for Lord/Lady Lotsoffaketitleshere, meanwhile neglecting to mention the many fees involved. Then, after they've signed all the paperwork he sends them off to the lovely corner of Diagon Alley where they can get all their special enchanted items at a discount. Harry plays the role of the overly helpful shopkeeper who is perfectly happy to give "good prices" to Lord/Lady Gulliblemoron. By the end of the day they've scammed a dozen or so wizarding idiots and they split the profits over a pint at the pub.

Cracky idea that wouldn't leave my head until I posted. Bonus points if several of Harry's former classmates are in on it and run their their own shops. Extra bonus points if they get away with it for so long that they accidentally create magical noble houses where everyone is convinced that's a thing.

Alternatively, Harry isn't involved initially but discovers it and tries to shut it down.

Sorry for the rambling, I'm severely sleep deprived.


** Inspired by American Gods:

"So," Harry said, as they entered their eleventh minute sitting in the minecart, apparently heading to some obscure vault that he'd never known he'd had. "Why don't you tell me something?"

Griphook grunted. "Like what."

"I dunno... do you go out into the surface much?"

"I did before, when I was younger. I used to have a friend that looked quite like you, actually." Griphook gave a fanged grin.

"You had human friends?"

"Is that so weird? Not everyone is as xenophobic as the average one of your kind." Griphook smiled fondly. "Oh, the tales I could tell you..."

"Can you tell me one?"

"You want me to tell you a story?"

"Yeah."

"Then shut up and don't interrupt."

Harry said nothing, and Griphook nodded approvingly.

"One day, a goblin walks into a tavern. The owner of the place is a wizard, naturally, and he's never seen a goblin come into his tavern before. As far as he can tell, he's never seen a goblin outside the bank. He's immediately suspicious of the visibly exhausted, and tired goblin. So he says, 'what brings you to this tavern?'

'I'm not looking for trouble,' the goblin says. 'I just need a hot meal in my belly and a drink to water my throat. I've hit some hard times, but I won't cause anything.'

The bartender grudgingly serves hot soup and a mug of beer for the goblin, who pounces upon it like a starving man. Halfway through, the innkeep looks at him, and asks: 'do you have a way to pay for this?'

The goblin looks upon him with an expression of dawning terror. 'I left my wallet at home,' he says. 'My home's not far, only ten minutes there and ten minutes back. I'll go get it for you, if you'll let me.'

'You think you can trick me like that?' the innkeep asks angrily. 'Many people have tried that with me before. Even kids can do better than that!'

The goblin looks defeated, but he knows he has no choice. So he sets down his tools on the counter of the bar. 'These are the tools I use to ply my trade,' he says. 'I can't leave these if I don't want to lose my income. I promise I won't rip you off; can I go get my wallet?'

'Fine,' the innkeeper says grudgingly, and he props the old, scratched and dented tools up on top of the cabinet behind him, where the goblin can't reach, because of course they would. 'You have twenty minutes.'

So the battered and wearied goblin goes back out to fetch his wallet. The innkeeper continues tending the bar. A well-dressed young man comes in looking anxious, and orders a shot of firewhiskey.

'What's going on?' the innkeeper asks.

'Oh, I'm just meeting with the woman I love,' the young man replies. 'She's supposed to be here soon, but I might have come a tad early.'

'Ah, a woman,' the innkeeper nods wisely, as if he's ever had a woman fall in love with him and his early-onset balding. 'Perhaps one more drink for luck?' he suggests.

'Sure,' the young man replies, and as the innkeep turns to grab a bottle of something stronger, the man's eyes linger on the tools on the counter. 'If you'll pardon me,' he says, 'may I see those tools up top?'

Since the customer is paying, the innkeep doesn't think much of it, and places the tools, as well as the drink, in front of him. 'What's so interesting about these?' he asks, as the man pushes his spectacles back onto his nose and frowns. Then an expression of realization flashes across his face.

'It can't be,' he whispers.

'What do you mean?'

'Sir,' the young man says, 'I may look young, but I am one of the leading experts on goblin archaeology. What you have here? These tools, look on the side - they have a signature to them. They belong to a legendary artisan called Griphook, who lived seven hundred years ago. The enchantments of these things have been forgotten in time! By Merlin's beard: I must speak to my superior about this.'

'What - what do you mean? Speak in plain English, won't you?'

'Sir, I am willing to purchase these tools off of you for fifty thousand galleons,' the young man says confidently, and the innkeep's jaw drops. He's never seen that much money in his entire life, and if he sold his inn, he doubted he could get even a fifth of that money. 'I don't have that money on me right now, of course, but I will discuss my findings with my superior and come back tomorrow. Here's my business card. Don't let anyone else have it, you hear?'

'I - of course,' the innkeep stammers. At that moment a young redheaded woman walks in, and smiles at the young man; the young man pays for his drinks and leaves, telling the innkeep once again, not to let the tools go.

Five minutes later, the goblin comes back, waving his tattered money-purse and a triumphant smile on his face. He lets the right amount of coins - knuts, mostly - fall onto the counter and asks for his tools back. The innkeep shuffles a bit and tells him the food is on the house. Confused but pleased, the goblin takes his money back and once again asks for his tools.

'About that,' the innkeep clears his throat. 'I have a son who's wanting to be a carpenter. Would you be willing to let me buy your tools off you?'

'My tools? But sir, they're my living. And I've stuck with them my whole life, after my father handed them down to me. I don't think I can give them up.'

'Listen, I'll - I'll pay you one hundred galleons for the lot,' the innkeep says. The innkeep doesn't miss the way the goblin's eyes widen, and he thinks he might have got him - but the goblin shakes his head.

'I'm sorry, sir, it just has too much sentimental value. Is there a reason why you can't just buy him a new toolkit? It must surely be cheaper than a hundred galleons.'

'I'm no connoisseur of tools, but they look like mighty fine tools to me. Let me buy it off you for a hundred and fifty galleons.'

The goblin is tempted, but he shakes his head. 'Sir, I'm sorry, but I'll just go. I'll pay for my meal; I don't want to cheat you of that.'

.../fifty thousand galleons/, says a dark voice inside the innkeep's head. 'No, wait!' he calls, 'I'll pay you three hundred galleons.'

The goblin looks like he wants to cry, but how can one so down in his luck turn away three hundred galleons? He takes the three hundred galleons in cash and walks away without his tools, not looking as happy as should be expected of someone who had suddenly become three hundred galleons richer. The young bespectacled man's business card weighs like it's made of solid gold in the innkeep's pocket, and the innkeep locks up the tools in his private safe before going to sleep. He wakes up, he polishes the bar, and he brags to all his regular customers that they might have to find a different bar once the day is done. He waits, and he waits, and he waits, and at the end of the day, the young man doesn't show up."

Harry was silent for a moment. "Then what?"

"What, then what? Then nothing." Griphook pulled the handbrake on the cart. "We're here. Hop out, place your hand against that panel there."

Harry was confused, but nonetheless obeyed; the huge stone doors opened with a groan. Then he stepped inside to find a small pile - nowhere near as big as it was in his trust vault, but still large nonetheless - of glittering Galleons and sparkling Sickles. And, in the corner of his room, he noticed an even smaller stack of seemingly identical, old and battered hammers and pliers and chisels. They all had an identical 'signature' them.

Harry looked at Griphook, who was wearing a large smile and had just wiped a tear from the corner of his eye.

*** Dude! I love the idea that James and Lily are/were scam artists, especially during the war! What if, in this timeline, one of the times they went against Voldemort was when they scammed him and this was the last straw that made Voldemort think "well I'm going to kill both kids anyways so I'll go after the Potters first" (not wanting to admit the Potters had pulled one over on him he tells his death eaters its because they are magically powerful).

Years go by and Voldemort has his body back, he goes to a pub in a glamour, its been a long 13 years he wants to have a drink, when He's approached by an oddly familiar Man. He's too drunk to remember who. They strike up a conversation, the man leaves, and suddenly a goblin walks in looking panicked. Voldemort thinks rationally, although drunkenly, that the goblins would make a good ally so offers to "help" the goblin (not mentioning it might cost him something later but implying it).

"A man, Black hair, he stole my tools!"

At first Voldemort doesn't understand but then the goblin goes on about the enchantments on those tools, how they where untrusted to him by the current goblin lord when he first started in his profession. They're priceless.

Voldemort recalls the young man from before and points the goblin in that direction, after making sure he could handle getting his tools back of course. The goblin grabs him in a strange hug, but he's too drunk to care "I'll get what I want later just grin and bare it," he thinks.

The goblin runs off and the man returns from a different direction. Voldemort, now knowing he's capable enough to steal from goblins tries to get on the young mans good side to, strikes up a conversation about the odd goblin he just met. The man looks nervous but explains that the goblin tricked him out of a couple hundred galleons so he stole the goblins tools to make the money back.

Voldemort gets an idea.

"I'll buy it off of you, but I have no use of tools so you'll owe me one later," the young, 'and foolish' thinks Voldemort, man takes the offer (he can get all the money he needs from his followers, this amount means nothing) and leaves with his money.

A few drinks latter the Goblin returns and says he couldn't find the man. Voldemort explains that the man came back after the goblin left and he tricked him into giving the tools back, pulling up the subtle hint from earlier of being owed something in return as he spoke. The goblin collected his tools and thanked Voldemort profusely, giving him another strange hug. He left the pub saying he owed him one, just as the man before had.

'Just as I planned,' Voldemort thinks as he finally blacks out from too much to drink.

When he wakes the next morning he has no idea where he is, but he does know his wallet (more of a coin purse really) is gone, and so is his wand. He has only a blurry recollection of what happened that night.

Griphook and Harry, however, remember it well. And so do their bank accounts.

  Merlin's Blessings be upon you! You have been recommended to me as a wizard of honour who can be trusted with this sensitive transaction. I am the nephew of the former Potentiate of Rhodesia, who has discovered that my late uncle had a Gringotts vault of ten million (10000000) galleons, but the goblins are not willing to let me access the money until I come in person and pay a modest fee of one thousand (1000) galleons...

** I read a fanfic that had a similar premise, but no scamming. Gringotts inheritance test proved that Harry was heir to several vaults in addition to Potter and Black. Hermione took the test and was found to be Lestrange heir through a Squib grandparent.

*** That's pretty much any fanfics with a powerful harry out there - He of the many, many families (and infinite wealth) and She of the Lestrange family (but no crazy). Featuring really jealous and probably a Deah Eater Ron Weasley, Molly "marry my fucking daughter or I'll slap this love potion up your ass" Weasley, and Fred and George "what's a family you're totally more our bro than our real bro" Weasley.
