Hi all, I'm looking for fanfics that are based on the world of Harry Potter (preferably in Hogwarts) but that don't revolve around already existing characters. So no Harry, no Ron, no Sirius Black or Dumbledore, no Lily or Snape, not even Katie Bell or Fred.

Also, preferably a certain adherence to canon. Just because the characters are original doesn't mean they have to be the Chosen One and take Harry's place in the original story... I want them to have their own story, if you know what I mean.

Is there anything out there for me? Let me know! :)

PS: I don't mind /secondary/ characters. In fact, the more real characters in the story (or their relatives), the better! But the protagonists, the main gang, have to be new (and preferably unrelated to the Weasleys, Blacks, or other big families)


** It's not set at Hogwarts, but the Alexandra Quick series is the best example that comes to mind. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Here]] is the first book in the series.

*** I started it per your recommendation and it's excellent. Completely new characters in the beloved boarding school scenario, with /some/ allusions to the original HP story but almost entirely stand-alone. The one turn-off was that the series is based on America. Charmbridge is a very well-written school, but there's nothing quite like the quiet, quaint mystery of Hogwarts. :)

This is the sort of story I'm looking for, for sure. Completely 100% original characters based on the HP world. If anyone has any stories similar to this, please hit me up!

**** Glad I could introduce someone to it. :)

It's a really well fleshed out version of Wizarding America that is neither a carbon copy of Wizarding Britain nor a MURICA-esque caricature where magical America is so much better than backwards ass Britain, which is what you often see in fics featuring America. I really like it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8596476/1/Starnlicht][Starnlicht]] by Marquis Carabas

In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** Oh, an other one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

  Hockey comes to Hogwarts, but the game has more significance than the students can imagine. Features original character Jimmy O'Bannon, with Fred & George Weasley prominent. Set during Book 4.

Edit: FYI, the author has a few more OC-centric HP stories.

** Do you mind next-gen? I'm rec'ing adventure fics/fics similar in tone to the original series but I also know shorter fics and more humor-based OC stories if you'd like those too.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] is fun adventure fic with Hugo, Scorpius, and a now-Professor Neville, where they go on a hunt through the Forbidden Forest - /If romping through the Forbidden Forest on week-long escapades to hunt for a mythical plant doesn't seem normal to you, then you haven't met Hugo Weasley. Hinkypunks, nymphs, Acromantulas? Not a problem for this ragtag team of ordinary heroes./
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290483][Morocco]] is a Rose/Scorpius action fic with great writing quality; reads like a film - /The world is in chaos. Fear reigns and the Wizarding world is in danger of falling to its new enemy - muggles. The Ministry has become a paramilitary organisation, determined to go down fighting. Sent to Northern Africa, Rose must help infiltrate the group responsible for such terror. War is imminent. The only question is, when?/
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=272808][Al Potter and His Very Epic Plan]] is about Al wanting to be sorted in Slytherin as part of his... epic plan! /Al's dad told him that Slytherin was all right, and that means it isn't fair how people treat them. Al's realized he has to fix this, and the return of the Triwizard Tournament to Hogwarts after 23 years might be the perfect opportunity to do so./

*** I don't mind next-gen, but I'm not a fan of reading about Hugo or Scorpius, or any of the next-gen characters. If you have a story set in that time-frame that follows the life of a random Hufflepuff fourth-year, or a Ravenclaw sixth-year, or perhaps a group of Gryffindor friends or shady Slytherin bullies... that's the sort of stuff I'm looking for.

In other words, if the character was mentioned /at all/ in the novels, he can't be a protagonist. This includes characters as minor as Fabian Prewett, Avery, Benjy Fenwick, and Hagrid's father.

**** Ah! That's much harder to find. I like to rec [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil]], set in Salem during the witch hunts and reads like a historical fiction (but not set in Hogwarts unfortunately). A far far sillier fic is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]], which has a few canon characters flitting in and out, but is mostly about the woes of the next-gen era's Muggle Studies professor.
