I've already read the Carnivorous Muffin's stuff, but feel free to link it anyway in case others are interested!

(One of my favorites, cohesive and quality albeit the author doesn't update very often I still find it a really really good work. TW: manipulation, violence, infanticide and more)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24970723]]

(This one is absolutely exquisite work, very very long but extremely well-written so you should really check it out plus the author has a steady rhythm and updates very often!)

The two following stories are sadly on hiatus but not abandoned .

(If you are looking for a very long story with quite a strong plot to say the least this one is for you. The author is dealing with some personal stuff so not able to write at the current moment but she said that this won't be given up. This is quite a hefty work so I think this should suit you)

(I hesitated a bit on this one as it's quite short but the work is amazing nonetheless. This one is on hiatus but I know that the author said that she intends to finish it properly one day ,she also seems to work exclusively with female Harrys so feel free to browse within her other works her writing is amazing and mind-blowing .)

I am not quite sure if my answer is of any help as none of them is complete atm and only two of them are really long but I still hope this will helps lol. Gender swaps are very hard to find .
