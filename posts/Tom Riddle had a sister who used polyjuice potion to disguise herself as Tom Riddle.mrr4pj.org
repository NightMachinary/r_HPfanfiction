After Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort, her sister became disillusioned with him, so she kidnapped him and put him into a suspended coma, and has been keeping him alive for the sole purpose of taking his appearance and running the war.

She forced him to kill Harry, which obviously backfired and left fem!Voldemort on her own. Nobody knows who she is or that she was behind everything. In a desperate attempt, she takes Harry and raises him.

Also she isn't aware that her brother had made horcruxes and is still out there.


** Small problem- What hair is she using for poly juice?

*** What do you mean? I wasn't talking about snakeface voldemort. Tom Riddle before he "died" had hair. And according to lore, you can also use toenail clippings and other stuff instead of hair. Unless you mean how she would get hair if Tom Riddle died? She wouldn't and would resume her normal identity.
