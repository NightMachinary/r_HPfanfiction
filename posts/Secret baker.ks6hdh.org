Ok this is gonna sound weird but at 3am my brain came up with this so harry has always loved baking and sometimes when he doesn't have class and can get away from Ron and hermonie he sneaks down to the kitchens to bake. Now here come the good part he doesn't eat all this stuff so what does he do he ask the house elves to put it out on the table for him at first its just cookies and pies and everyone thinks it was just part of the everyday food. Then one day someone gets a birthday cake (harry got bored and wanted to do lettering idk) then it escalates from that everyone gets birthday cakes even the summer bday kids but there's are like in June and such. Your sad here have some cookies or cupcakes (im not entirely familiar with British slang sorry) oh big achievement heres a small cakes or a large cupcake. Won the qudditch match the whole team gets a cake. Noone knows who it is- and they take to calling them Hogwarts secret baker harry even starts signing thing with HSB- until Hermonie being the queen she is figures it out harry never gets a cake near the end of the year or when he's upset infant when he's upset the cupcakes and cookies and such look not so good as usual she confronts harry about it and he denies immediately. But Hermonie being the annoying girl she is must know who it is then so she hides in the kitchen and waits to see who it is. She catches harry as he's mixing and he admits to it. Since she's dating Ron she of course tells him but he's cant keep his mouth close and tells everyone. None cares, except a few slytherins, and harry takes to signing things in he now I haven't really worked out the ending

So should I write this or is there something already like this out there already


** - ongoing “A Pinch of Salt, A Dash of Magic by Kgfinkel” linkao3(27454828) the latest chapters are slightly loosing the steam, but at least beginning is completely delightful.
