It was not Dumbledore who was manipulating the masses like everyone thought, it was Madam Pomphrey all along. She was the one who suggested Snape as a potions professor as she claimed she needed someone Dumbledore trusted to make her healing potions. She was the one to create the defense curse, by cursing every pupil that passes through her infirmary, as an inept defense teacher increases the likelihood of pupils being put in her care. It was her who recommended that Dumbledore test Harry in first year in a 'safe' way so he will inevitably end up in her care. Every time someone was put in her care she could hear private stories and secrets talked about among friends at their bedside through her listening charms. Every diagnosis charm cast on a pupil gives her knowledge of what they did in the past 6 weeks. Every life saved by her is another life debt under her belt. Until she finally has enough blackmail and life debts to take over the wizarding world.

** i have the personal believe that if you put somebody in danger in some type of way and then directly or indirectly save them you don't create a life debt

*** There are three possible solutions to the problem you have provided: 1. Ignore that part of the prompt 2. Pomphrey doesn't know this 3. Remember that this is fanfiction and anything can happen

**** My take: Life Debts are purely cultural things and there's no magic that compelles the one owing the debt to serve the one who saved them.

***** Aye. Debts of gratitude and words of honor are powerful in certain real world cultures.

** ...that's not how life debts work. you can't accrue life debts by doing your literal job. or if you engineer the situation that caused their life to be in danger in the first place.

*** Says who? All we know about them is when Harry pointed out that Wormtail had his life saved by Harry, Wormtail hesitated and the magic of the hand killed him for helping the enemy. Life debts are almost purely a fandom thing. Why can't an author alter the perceived rules slightly to fit a fic?
