Found this sub so figured I'd post. Looking for fics where Tonks and Remus or at least one of them survive the Battle. Maybe they can look after Teddy or something. Can be short stories or long sagas I just want the chars to be believable but with a happy ending.


** I'm assuming you're asking this because you love their interaction more than anything related to them living correct? If so, you should read linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky) because they are quite big characters here and their interactions as friends (though both are attracted to each other, but Remus is in denial.) is fantastic and hilarious (mostly cuz of Tonks, she's a weirdo but in a fun way) The rest of the story isn't anything to scoff at too. Its definitely in my top 3 fanfics overall. There are some issues with it, but it just feels like those types of story that you can't help but miss the characters when you're finished with it.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.
