** You might have some luck if you tried looking for Ted/Andromeda stories, since they're the only canon couple I can think of that fits that description. I'm pretty sure I've seen some one-shots doing a take on that, but I regretfully can't remember what they would've been.

** It's older but you might like this Theodore Nott/Hufflepuff OC series that begins with [[https://sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=1710&chchapno=1][Distractions]].

  Theodore Nott would like to forget a future he doesn't want - and music has always provided a distraction. Anne Fairleigh just wants the chance to practice her flute in peace. But a chance friendship between a Pureblood Slytherin and a Muggleborn Hufflepuff soon raises the very questions Theodore has been avoiding and Anne never thought to ask. (Altenate Point of View) This story was written prior to the release of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince".
