** Hope and Healing: linkao3(13855500)

Relatively slow-burn Harry/Fleur, with emphasis on hurt/comfort. Tone varies - overall it's fairly light in tone, but with a few darker chapters.

Trigger warnings for a few chapters behind spoilers: Chapters 13 and 14 have Very Abusive Dursleys. Chapter 30 has Fleur being tortured by Umbridge/Polyjuiced!Barty Crouch.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers.

**** At least you have very clear trigger warnings before the chapters where it happens, and it's not the whole fic that's like that.

** I can think of two stories that are similar to what you are looking for.

The Stand and the Flower - linkffn(13132670) - A story that I enjoy a lot.

A Veela's intrigue - linkffn(13261043) - A decent story that I found entertaining and is similar to the premise you are looking for.

  Fleur came to Hogwarts to compete in the Triwizard tournament. Her mind was filled with expectations of glory and honour, instead she finds a messy haired student by the name of Harry, who is different to every other student in the derelict school. A Veela's curiosity is a dangerous beast and Fleur's demands that it is sated.
