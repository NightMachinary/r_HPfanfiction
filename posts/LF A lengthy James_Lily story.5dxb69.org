As the title says, I'm looking for a nice lengthy romantic James/Lily story. It would be nice if it was canon compliant in terms of their relationship during Hogwarts where initially Lily despises James but we get to see his change and the change in their relationship.

Bonus points if the marauder's dynamic plays a role in the story. I'd love to read about the rest of the marauders interacting with each other, Snape and/or even Lily.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!


** linkffn(5200789) I personally never read it because Marauder era fics bore me but pretty much everyone i ever talked to about it loved this fic.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

*** Fair warning to anyone about to start: you will laugh, cry, and want to throw your computer at the wall when you realize it isn't complete. It's amazing, but unfortunately, we've all been in limbo for the last 3 years with it.

  Lily & James have hated each other ever since their initial meeting took a wrong turn. After a shocking goodbye at the end of their 6th year, are things going to be any different in the following year when they are forced to work together as Head Boy and Head Girl?

  There's just something about James Potter that always causes Lily to make the worst decisions. That's probably how she ends up throwing away a month of her seventh year on a bet with a boy she can hardly stand. A story of growing up, identity, and falling in love.
