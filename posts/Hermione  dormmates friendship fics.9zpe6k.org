I know that this search will either yield oneshots or parts of larger fics, but I'm looking for stories where Hermione has a stronger friendship with her dormmates (in her year, so someone other than Ginny). Hermione Granger Dermatologist was great in that regard, but perhaps there's something preferably set when they aren't pre-teens.

No Death Eater pairings and preferably no Weasley ones either.


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: After a rough start, she eventually makes good friends with all her roommates. Lavender is especially sympathetic, and the Year 6 'Won Won' episode is hilarious in this fic.

** I've recently discovered linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16304039/chapters/38134826]]). It's a fem!Harry fic, with strong female friendships all around (not just dormmates). Mostly fluff.

Incidentally that fic really made me angry that there aren't many good "The Tonks adopt Harry" fics.

  Harriet Tonks wasn't completely ignorant of her past. She knew that she used to be a Potter, that her Lily-mum and her James-dad loved her very much, that her mums had been good friends, and that her ‘Dromeda-mum and Ted-dad had taken her after her parents had died.She knew how they had died, and why, and what people were calling her, even though she didn't like to think about it very much.And she also knew that she was supposed to be living with her aunt and uncle, but they hadn't wanted her. And that technically (“The technical sense being the most important, when you're trying to get out of trouble, pet,” Ted-dad always told her) her mum had stolen her.
