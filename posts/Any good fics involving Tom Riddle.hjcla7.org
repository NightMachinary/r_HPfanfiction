I've been really into Tom Riddle centric fics for some time but most are either written poorly or just abandoned. So I was wondering if there's any good Fanfiction with Tom Riddle as either the protagonist or as a major character.


** umm. Motivation on wattpad is a romance one, but it's really good.

nope sorry i meant modification

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia SoteloHer door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

  Tom Riddle hates going back to the orphanage for the summer. He might have spent the days quietly, but an incident makes him more than willing to challenge everyone. (1st Person PoV, gen fic.)Excerpt:My heart quickened to see it, for it was not me hurting. The beginnings of a smile tugged at my lips. To see him so...I knew then who held the power, and it was not him. It never would be again. I turned away, knowing he would follow. He could sense my amusement, and that is what cast fear to anger. Oh, come and watch. This is how a petty man falls.

** I've really been enjoying The Incantation of the Oak-Priest and I never see it recommended on here, which is a damn shame, really. It's a time-travel fic where Tom accidentally catches a ride with Harry to an alternate and seemingly idyllic future where both boys are taken in by the Potters. It's mostly gen, but there is the beginnings of a romance between Harry and Tom. linkao3(The Incantation of the Oak-Priest by relic_crown)

  A fifteen-year-old Tom Riddle slips through time, pulled by a strange boy into a seemingly idyllic future. Harry Potter is thrown sideways into a different reality, one untouched by Voldemort's war.Taken into the Potter household, the two of them form an unlikely bond -- but between centaur magic, government conspiracies, and the darkness at the heart of the Forbidden Forest, this new world is not as it seems.
