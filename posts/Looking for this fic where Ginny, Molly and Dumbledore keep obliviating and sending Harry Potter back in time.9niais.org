:FlairText: Fic Search Harry Potter is obliviated or discovers a plot
:END:
I also do remember a fic where Harry receives a letter from Severus Snape alerting him his life was a lie...it might be part of the plot of the fic where he is literally running away from Ginny and manages to retian his memories as last time resort before she sends him back....

So, any help appreciated!
