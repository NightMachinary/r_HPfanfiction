Not sure, but i think it was titled "The Gift" or something. The authors site is down so i dont know where to look. Just to clarify, Im not looking for the rewrite "Alurias Gift". Any help would be appreciated, thanks.


** Do you have the authors name? I have the fics from Lucifael, but I think those are the ones that are not looking for.

*** I'm pretty sure Lucifael was the original author, he didn't put any disclaimer in his AN about it being another person's work. That's the problem, I read the fix a long time ago and remember it being significantly longer. Alot of his links are down and hes removed some stuff so I'm not sure.

**** I have both of Lucifael's story that have 'Gift' in the title, one is called "Alurias Gift - Book One: The Gift" and the other is called "Aluria's Gift - Rewrite - The Gift".

If you think that these are the ones that you are looking for I can figure out how to get them to you.

***** Yeah after doing a little more looking, I believe that "Alurias Gift - Book One: The Gift" is what Im looking for. If you could that would be great. Just PM, cheers.
