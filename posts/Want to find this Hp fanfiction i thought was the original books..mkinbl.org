** I've never heard of this but I can't stop laughing at the idea that you thought this was the original and then the movies came out and you must've been like “what the fuck, the directors are being really bold with these changes”

*** Lol. I legit thought that J.K. Rowling gave the directors a new storyline for the movie to keep the suspense. But honestly I really liked the Dudley as evil plot. They were completely different books but with the same name.

** I remember that there were e-books circulating on the internet that were fake (before the new ones came out). My brother even read one, which was strange since he didn't read HP at all.

Never read any, so can't help you there. But I can confirm that what you read was distributed as genuine Harry Potter leaked books over the internet.

** Were you in a bathroom when reading those? Because it sounds like you got trolled.

Sorry, I have no idea where to find the fanfic you read. Good luck, though!
