September 1st, 1991, was an anxiously awaited day. This was the day that many children would attend Hogwarts for the very first time, including the Boy-Who-Lived himself, Harry Potter. No one was as anxious for this boy's return to the wizarding world than Tom Riddle. The now 65 year old professor had been keeping an ear out for any news about the boy, but Albus had managed to hide him well.

He'd had an interest in the boy ever since the supposed defeat of the dark lord known as Voldemort. Albus Dumbledore had spread the word that Harry had defeated the wizard shortly after the explosion that had killed Lily and James Potter. Tom knew it was complete nonsense, of course. He worried how the child would take to the wizarding world as not only an orphan, but also a famous child with no parents to lend advice, or kind words. He wondered what he would be told about Voldemort.

Voldemort had been an alter ego of his when he had started exploring the darker nature of magic. It wasn't a good idea for one who taught children to advertise their interest in the rather illegal, and dangerous spells and potions. He was only really interested because it was part of his job. He was the DADA professor, after all, if anyone should know about the dark arts, and how defend oneself, it should be him.

But soon rumors started going around about a man called Voldemort, who was taking too much interest in things dark, and next thing he knew, he was apparently a dark lord. And also a blood purist, of course, why not throw everything in there. Eventually most cases of petty crime, things like burglaries, and disturbing the peace were blamed on Voldemort's order of dark wizards.

Then a spring of fires in muggle London (in poorly wired houses, no doubt,) were brought to the wizarding worlds attention, and out of nowhere, there was a war. Tom found the whole thing a ridiculous mess, but he did have to appreciate the dramatics on both the minister, and Dumbledore's part. Bagnold didn't want another Grindlwald, and with the headmaster whispering panic in his ear, things just escalated. Some of the more radical purebloods had taken up his name, and proclaimed themselves his soldiers, taking the mass hysteria as an open invitation to try and force their beliefs onto others.

Tom was shaken from his thoughts as the doors to the great hall opened, and a stream of eleven year olds walked, single file, towards the stool where the sorting hat rested. He sat back a bit, eager to see who was placed where, what names he recognized, and whether the headmaster would try to interfere.

***** Just a little something I thought would be fun. Feel free to add on! I plan on perhaps making this an actual story in the future*****


** Interesting idea... What you've got so far leaves two major questions (and a host of minor ones) yet to be answered:

1. What happened to James and Lily Potter?
2. Why did everyone conclude that "The Dark Lord Voldemort" was suddenly gone?

It's quite possible that the answers to the two questions overlap significantly. I'm also guessing any fic based on this would bash Dumbledore pretty heavily, as he'd have to be pretty senile/delusional at best and actively instigating/manipulating things at worst for it to work.

*** Nah, Old age is affecting Dumbledore Tom knows this and spends most of the time managing stuff so dumbledore can feel like a proper hero and die happily

James and Lilly are both in on it, Dumbledore only thinks Harry was raised by the dursleys, but nope he was raised by his loving parents

The whole 'war' is just tom's way of thanking dumbledore for his mentorship and friendship

Dumbledore is still a good guy, he is just very old and having Issues.

Tom goes along with it as well as managing it, because he doesnt want dumbledores legacy to be destroyed.

** While there's crack fic potential in Voldemort being a massive misunderstanding (even though it would never work in canon- the guy was murdering people as a teen), this is too Dumbledore-bashy for my taste.

*** Eh, not necessarily? I mean, Dumbledore can just see this as a prank that got /slightly/ out of control or him just going senile. And it can be made to sidestep cannon by as the whole Secret Chamber thing being a bunch of students playing around with some variants of the petrifying jinx and Myrtle just having had an allergic reaction or something like this (Hell, Hagrid was raiding an Acromantula at Hogwarts, maybe Aragog managed to slip away and bite Myrtle?). Would be fun if Tom had found out the chamber soon after but couldn't tell anyone for fear of being accused of setting the Basilisk loose upon schoolchildren.
