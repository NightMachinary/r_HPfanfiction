*** I said, a fic starting from year one, but from a first person point of view. It has to be good of course.

** You will find a much better selection by doing searches on FFN and checking the communities, then sorting by number of favs. This subreddit is more geared towards those who are looking for really specific fics or genres, or for advice about writing or discussing plot devices. That's not to say that you can't use the sub to track down fics, only that with such large requests, it is always more efficient and effective to just search for it yourself.
