When I started reading fanfics in general I read anything (unless it was so bad that you couldn't even tell what was what) but as I kept reading more fanfics I found quite a few authors that writes extremely well (good grammar, sentence structure, dialogue, etc...). But the problem cam when I started looking for pairings or general fanfics that I read to kill time and realized that I couldn't bring myself to read it because I am now used to reading fanfics that are very well written. So I am wondering if anyone has the same problem?


** Yeah, I have this issue somewhat too. If I sort my favorites/bookmarks by when I added them on AO3/FFN, I can read and enjoy most of what I added in the last few years. But if I go back to what I liked well enough to favorite in 2010, most of it is absolutely horrible garbage. My tastes have changed, I got older, and I've read a much broader range of stories, so I have a much lower tolerance for what I'm willing to sit through and read.

*** When I started fanfic I started with Naruto x Hinata (before the manga ended) fanfics and back than I thought the things I read was really well written but now when I go back to it I can barely stand it (even though i still like the concepts that different authors have). I think the first author that made me not want to go back to those stories is Kur0Kishi (End Game Version R). What's yours?

** Yeah... I can't even remember the last time I finished an HP fic that wasn't a reread. Most times I struggle to even get through the first few chapters. After a while, they all start looking the same, and then you realize that they really are almost just the same, and that the vast majority of fics suck. But it's that .01% that you keep searching for.

** It's natural when you are first getting into fan fiction to read the most popular and well-reviewed fics, which generally are well-written and engaging. Then, out of a desire to want to continue reading more about your favorite characters, you find yourself reading worse and worse fan fiction. I'm at the point now where I will willingly put up with grammatical mistakes or flawed prose if the story concept is interesting. I've just grown to accept that most of the actual writing won't be good.

** Eh, whenever I get that feeling, and it is something I want to read, I do one or more of the following:

1. Read a Dragon Ball Z crossover (terrible all of them)

2. Remind myself that I own or have seen /Plan 9 from Outer Space/, /Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter/, /Conan the Destroyer/, /Fury of the Wolfman/, /Billy the Kid vs Dracula/, /The Star Wars Holiday Special/, /Blood Tide/, /Sssssss/, /Death Wish V: The Face of Death/ and many, many, many more absolutely terrible movies.

Those really get me past the quality barrier outside of the absolute worst ones.
