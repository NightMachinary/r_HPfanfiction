:END:
This fic involved time travel I believe. Bellatrix Black from a young age always heard "voices" but it was aggravated by the dark arts. Hermione's motherly presence soothed the voices.

She defended the three black sister from their parents abuse but when Hermione was sent back to her time, all three spiraled into what we know.

They may have called her Mum.

*** Honestly, I read this so long ago I wouldn't have clue. Not sure if this information will help but ffn used to be where I read all my stories so I would hazard a guess that its over there despite using ao3 a lot more now.

*** I have read this fic before but it is not the one I'm looking for. Bellatrix was significantly younger than Hermione.
