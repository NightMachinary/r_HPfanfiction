Pretty much the title, it was a silky crack fix where Draco wakes up to get some cookies or something in Malfoy manner and without realising mistakes Voldemort for an intruder and kills him. From their I think he ended up having to hide out at Hogwarts and I feel like it eventually turned into drarry, and it might have involved the Malfoy parents getting divorced and the having to square off against Umbridge, and their was also a Yule ball which leads me to believe it might have been set in fourth,

Anyone I've crammed this with all the details I could remember to hopefully jog peoples memories but for the life of me I've been completely unsuccessful in finding it

** Manor. Manners are things that not many in manors have, but many have manners without ever having been in a manor. Of course, that said manners are exceedingly rare, whereas mcmanors were becoming more and more common before the crash in '07, and aren't being built at all during the isolation where most seem to have regained their manners.
