The site requires a login, doesn't work well on mobile, and the author has a stick up their arse crafted of the things she accuses readers of. Good writing though, there are 3 stories off the top of my head that have domHarry/subHermione.

** I don't really buy that characterization, but linkffn(The Reluctant Lord by SmallBurnyThing) has the interesting property of hitting almost all of my non-technical pet peeves (including submissive!Hermione), but doing it in such a rich and interesting way that I enjoyed reading it and was genuinely sad when the author gave up on finishing it and posted the outline for the rest of the fic.

** A really well written one is linkao3(959572)

It's very long but extraordinarily written. The main pairing is Dramione, however it does eventually morph into a polyamorous relationship between Hermione, Draco, Harry, and Ron. There's lot's of BDSM (like a lot!). To be totally honest, I haven't even finished reading it yet. So far it's amazing though! I'm about half way through.
