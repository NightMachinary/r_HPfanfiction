** linkffn(8551180) is the first one in a trilogy, vanilla HP, BUT second installment is crossed with SG-1 and the third is crossed with Mass Effect. Strongly recommend to go through them in that order as it won't make much sense otherwise

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20), of course. Also dropping a link to linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon). Probably not the best crossover out there (it gets a bit wonky towards the end), but still not as well-known as it deserves in my opinion.

After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends.

** Crossovers are some of my favourite stories, but it is annoying difficult to find good ones. For bleach my favourite 2 are linkffn(Retsu's Folly by nuhuh) and linkao3(There May Be Some Collateral Damage by metisket).

GoT/ASOIAF there is really very little, the only one I am still hoping for an update for is linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801)

Naruto isn'y my favourite fandom, but linkffn(Itachi, Is That A Baby? by SpoonandJohn) is definitely worth a read even with minimal knowledge of it.

Star wars is probably my second most read fandom, which is unfortunate becuase there are so few decent crossovers with it. The first is linkffn(Equilibrium by Surarrin), where Harry bumps into Ahsoka just after she leaves the order and drags her into his weird life. The second is linkffn(Discordant by Heather Sinclair), where Harry helps Asaaj kill Dooku early on and generally makes a nuisance of himself. Finally there is linkffn(Last Second Savior by plums), it is the only one I really still hold out hope for updating, as he is something of a beta/muse for a couple of other reasonably well known authors. His story is based off another, linkffn(Sword and Magic by bluminous8), though I found his to be a better version, it is at a slow boil. It is supposedly going to be a harem story eventually, but its not really close at the moment. Other than Tsu Doh Nim and kathryn518s story, I really have found nothing worth mentioning from these fandoms crossing.

There is only a single Percy Jackson story that I have enjoyed, but the last couple of chapters have gotten a bit shaky. linkffn(Serpents and Celestial Bronze by Levity Lirum)

There is a real shortage of Warcraft fanfiction in general, I assume because most fans are too busy playing to write. There are a few I have at least been entertained by, linkffn(Wizard Runemaster by plums) is basically a loose connection of vanilla wow story and some smut. linkffn(On Blackened Wings by Respite88), linkffn(Black Rock and Roll by Mage-Alia) are both short and abandoned by at least readable. linkffn(The Stormreaver by Faykan) is the only one still updating, bit of a power creep going on in the last few chapters but it isn't as terrible as most.

Well that was an unexpected wall, but other than what has already been mentioned I think that is all I have.

**** Yeah its starting to get a bit worrying, longer and longer periods between updates until the author loses interest in the story. Completely understandable, I usually change the main fandom I read every month or 2, but it is one of the worst things about being a fanfiction reader.

  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.

** I mostly dislike cross-overs. But an exception is linkffn(3983128) Culture Shock.

The Culture of Iain M Banks' books discovers an obscure, backward world. The extremely powerful and smug Culture than gets a shock when it realizes a small number of the population can do incredable things, and it has no idea how.

Well written and funny.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

** Damn, I really should start favouriting finished stories as well so that I have a better list to recommend from. Here are my favourites:

linkffn(8501689) gets linked often enough and is Harry MOD in Star Wars; linkffn(11154405) is a great little Avengers amd Guardians of the Galaxy xover featuring Hermione; linkffn(12366697) Hermione, meet Tony Stark; linkffn(12005496) Hermione in the world of Lord of the Rings, which I like a lot; linkffn(11115934) Shadow of Angmar is easily one of the best crossovers with harry I've read, also LOTR; linkffn(12466180) Hermione in Game of Thrones...

There are a few that were already completed when I read them in the GoT, LOTR fandoms. Also, there are a few Sherlock/Hermione fics out there that are an absolute blast to read, where Romance isn't the driving factor but it still is kind of there. Man, going through my favs list just reminded me of how many great stories are dead :(
