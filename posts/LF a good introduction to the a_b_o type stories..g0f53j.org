It seems that there are a lot if stories that use this and I have avoided it as it seems strange and out if my comfort zone. What I want is any well written story that includes this concept so I can understand it better and expose myself to a new area of fiction. I would hate for my first experience with this concept to be a poorly written story that abuses it for some twisted smut.


** While i don't have a well written ABO story of the top of my head, i did find this ABO primer a while back: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/403644/chapters/665489]]

There's a lot of different takes on the concept so each story has its own way of exploring it, but that should help.

Now if only someone could explain Sentinels/Guides to me ðŸ¤”
