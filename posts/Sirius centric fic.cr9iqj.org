Ok so basically one where he is the main character and focus and doesnt adopt Harry and isnt trying to. I feel like alot of Sirius centric fic of him as a adult are about his relationship with Harry and being Harry's parental figure. I kinda want one where thats not the case.

He can still be close to Harry but shouldnt be his parent. Maybe Harrys an adult already or someone else is raising him. Or Harry isnt born yet.

He has to be an adult it can be him right after school or him older. But not him in school. I prefer stories where he doesnt die so canon deviation for that.

I really like his relationship with Remus so focus on that is preferred. It can have romance but i prefer more focus on friendship and/or plot than on romance. If there is romace with Sirius M/F or M/M is fine but please no Sirius x OC and no Sirius with anyone from Harrys generation even if it its time travel. And no incest so No Sirius x Bellatrix or Sirius x Narcissa.

This fic has a heavy focus on Remus/Sirius and it's mostly about their relationship.

I would recommend the whole series I absolutely loved it. Sex is graphic in this hope you don't mind it but the characterization in this is great. Very emotional and very mature. Remus is together with Tonks but he has an affair with Sirius because they are something like 'true mates' and Sirius came back from the veil when Remus is already married to Tonks.

It's great to read the emotions and reasons behind everyones actions are very clear and understandable. The fic is Sirius centric and written from his pov. The summarys don't do this work justice and I would strongly recommend you check it out. The works in this series I would rather call chapters since they are only a part of the whole fic. I know it's probably not the thing you were looking for but here's the summary of the first work.

Summary:

“Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.
