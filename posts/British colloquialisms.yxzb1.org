I'm working on a fanfiction, and I'm trying to incorporate British colloquialisms to keep it true to the original canon which uses quite a bit. So I was looking for a new term, and found the greatest colloquialism ever: wanking chariot. I laughed longer than I'm proud of at this term.


** I'm English... what's a wanking chariot?
