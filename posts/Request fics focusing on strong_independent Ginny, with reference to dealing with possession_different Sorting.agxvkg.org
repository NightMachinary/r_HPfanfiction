Any fics where Ginny grows into a strong character in her own right, not focusing on romance or too much on Harry himself?

Looking for anything that has:

- Different House sorting (Slytherin is likely most common)

- The possession leaves a mark on her character and changes how she thinks of people

- exploration of what it's like to be the only Weasley born a girl, how her parents/brothers treat her because of it (quidditch, duelling etc is in canon)

- first person or third person voice doesn't matter overmuch, so long as it's firmly from her perspective

- pairings peripheral to main plot, not main focus

- if there's anything post-Hogwarts that doesn't deal solely with a Harry/Ginny relationship, that'd be awesome too.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

** Personally I think that most of the stuff by Brennus feature a fairly strong Ginny. But I don't think his work meets all your other requirements. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus]]
