A couple days ago, I posted this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/53s7yt/lf_stories_with_sirius_and_remus_a_little/]] in regards to a more realistic Remus and/Sirius. Most of the recs I got were more Remus centric, which is great, but I'd to read some stuff that delves into a realistic Sirius, too. Again, AU, slash, any pairing, I'll take them all! Thanks.


** Linking my own fic, for shame, Scott, for shame. That said, my fic isn't Sirius-centric, but he's one of the prominent characters.

  OotP AU. Dark magic, Death Eaters, politics - and in the middle of it all, Harry Potter. Tested against enemies old and new, he learns that power requires sacrifices, revenge, doubly so. No slash, no bashing, Crouch Sr is alive.

  Twelve Grimmauld Place; early summer 1996. Sirius Black is on the brink of self-destruction when an unwanted and uninvited guest is foisted on him. He just wants her to go away and leave him in peace, but she's got a job to do and she won't let a bad-tempered wizard bully her.

** I already linked mine in the other thread so I won't do it again. I've struggled to find gritty Sirius stories myself, so I'll be interested to see if anything comes up.

** I have a couple recs that can fit your request. One that I liked a lot is [[http://web.archive.org/web/20120127055512/http://www.moonpants.org/txt/darkness.html][I See a Darkness]]. It is the sequel to [[http://wolfstarwarehouse.tumblr.com/post/98382218214/being-an-historical-record-etc][a cute RL/SB get-together fic]] but because it is by and large canon-compliant, it is gritty and sad.

The [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/54783][Survivor's Guilt series]] also fits well. This is an (almost) canon-compliant remus/sirius with PoA and the years before that told from each of their perspectives. Then after Remus realizes Sirius is innocent, the final fic in the series is of the summer they spend hiding together in the Caribbean.
