** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1555645][ever upward]] series is completely written and is posted thrice a week. It's fascinating, and I love this Harry, the characters, the world and the drawings. It's amazing and so magical.

  Harry finds a better life with the basilisk, but that doesn't mean it's easy. From inter-being feuds, to bloody prophecies, to elven unrest, Harry is in the eye of a hurricane that will change the wizarding world forever.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.
