I just had a random thought while reading a fanfic. What if there really is a magical world, and the books were a prank? Like the Weasley twins and Sirius and Remus, got drunk and thought it'd be hilarious to have someone write books about it just to see what would happen.


** It would certainly be high quality shitposting and with the necessary effort, I'd respect that.

** I can totally picture the Weasley twins and Remus and Sirius doing that, and I like to think about the magical world being real because why not? It's hard to prove something's not there, after all

** I mean there is a Theory out there that J.K. Rowling is rita skeeter. that she got banished from the wizarding world and that she wrote the books so she could still have the fame she wished for.

*** I was just about to comment a theory similar to this. I heard it as this: Harry is convinced (probably by Hermione) that someone, either with his input or without it, was going to write books about him so, if he wanted them to be accurate, he needed to tell the story himself. Harry then gives an interview about his life which is made into the books we know and love. They are first published in the wizarding world but a couple get lost into the muggle world and the muggles think the best fantasy childrens book ever so the wizard publisher decides to just publish it in the muggle world as well, just market it as fiction.

I have absolutely no idea where I first heard this theory but I remember finding it really interesting.
