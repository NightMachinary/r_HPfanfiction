So recently I've noticed that 7 out of 10 fanfiction I read have some sort of depressing backstory for Harry, to the point where you wonder how he's even alive. On top of this, once he leaves durskaban he is then sentenced to evil dumbles manipulations, snapes pettiness, and essentially everything that could go wrong goes wrong for Harry. Now I want to clarify, I'm not expecting a story where Voldemort and his merry gang of rapists lay down their wands and sing kumbaya with Harry, but for the love of god, why are there so many angst filled, strife driven, depressing as fuck story's??? This is a world of magic and wonder, and so few fanfic a I've seen actually FOCUS on that aspect, sure it's there, but they're always more focused on how unfair pure blood laws are, or that Harry's life sucks, or that he can trust no one, essentially reducing most story's into drivel about how horrible the wizarding world is. I don't know about you guys, but I didn't read HP or even HP fanfiction to see real life problems translated into this wonderful universe, I came to read about magic, Dolores getting the shit beat out of her, and Harry growing a pair of balls and using his fucking magic! Six years of schooling and he only uses stupefy? Really JK Rowling??

** The Refiners Fire, and its sequel Time of Destiny feature a damn-powerful Harry. Pretty decent stories, too.

**** I felt that, once they return to Hogwarts, Harry gets happy.

Could just be misremembering, though. It's been years since I've read it.

***** /spoilers/ (can't make the tags work on my app.)

IIRC The first few chapters are designed to get you attached to a disposable character who is then disposed of. Then there's some applied phlebotinum to make him mourn faster so the author can get on with the relationship sub plot they wanted to write. It's not incredibly drawn out, but it is there.
