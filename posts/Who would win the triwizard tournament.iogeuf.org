If Harry had not been entered and there was no plot to bring Voldemort back, who would win the tournament?


** Krum would be the most likely victor, in my opinion. He seemed more capable than Fleur and Cedric would fall behind because he wouldn't be receiving outside help like Krum and Fleur.

*** I mean but what outside help did Cedric really get/ need that would have made it harder for him to win? The dragons? Yes Harry told him and it probably helped him get a game plan and maybe let him practice before hand, but if he's almost graduated I think he would know the transfiguration for the dog. He doesn't get help during the second task so he's the only one to finish on time and the third task is where we would need to see if his head start was enough

**** I think not knowing about the dragon beforehand would have been a huge hindrance, especially since Cedric was the first person to go. Going in without a plan and being asked to face a dragon with no preparation would make a person panic I bet.

And he does get help with the second task. Crouch tells him how to get the clue from his egg and while he might've known the bubnlehead charm with the pressure he's facing I bet it would take a bit to think to use it.

** It is hard to say because of the organization of the Tournament, where the 2 first Tasks are only there to give an edge during the 3rd. In the end, the first person touching the Cup win everything, no matter what happened previously. And since the cup in inside a Maze full of obstacles (each of them demanding a different skill set to be passed), luck also play a pretty big role for victory (the "best" Champion may lose a lot of time against an obstacle which focus against his worst points).

If we look at what happened in Canon, Cedric was the closest one to victory since he also got the Cup. But without Harry, Cedric would have had a disadvantage compared to the others, since Dumbledore was the only Judge wanting to play fair (he would have not known about the Dragons, and Moody while he would have probably solved it alone in the end, Moody helped him with the egg's riddle).

For the other 2 participants, Viktor made a pretty strong showing during the the first 2 tasks, but he also seemed to . . . power through his obstacles. Such a mindset may have impaired him inside the maze (I doubt any of the Champions could have taken on the Sphinx as an example), and while it's open for discussion, we don't know if Krum had enough subtility to pass some of the obstacles inside the maze.\\
As for Fleur, she showed a very strong charm against her dragon, but failed during the 2nd Task. We can speculate that her Charm Mastery may have helped, but she could also fail at a more "physical" approach like inside the Lake.

In the end, I will root for Fleur by pure patriotism, but I don't think any of the "true" Champions truly outshined the others, and the Cup could have gone to any of them.

** Hm, excellent question, there are several factors in play assuming everything else stays the same. The way the tournament is structured means that the first two tasks are kind of irrelevant, all that matters is who touches the Cup first.

First task would probably go Krum>Fleur>Cedric in terms of performance, as even with Harry's hint, Cedric still got burnt, so he likely would have performed worse without the heads up. Second task would probably go Cedric>Krum>Fleur, although Crouch Jr. was the one to tell Cedric about the clue, but I'll give him benefit of the doubt that he would have figured it out on his own (but not guaranteed, especially if he failed the 1st task). Viktor would lose some points because he struggled to free Hermione as a shark, but with the addition of Karkaroff's biased judging he's got a solid lead at this point.

Viktor managed to catch up to Cedric/Harry in the maze despite starting after them, although being Imperiused might have actually assisted him with that. But he also defeated Cedric in some form of duel despite the Imperius- whether by skill or by surprise- and without Harry coming to his rescue, Cedric would have been knocked out.

So, I'm giving the win to Viktor. Cedric coming in 2nd and Fleur just unable to make up the distance.

** I don't think Cedric would have completed the first task tbh. IMO without proper planning none of the three would have passed the first trial if they didn't knew beforehand and had to go first. But since Cedric went first the other two had some time to come up with a plan. The second task is easy if they can figure out the clue except for Fleur. So in the third task Krum would have the necessary lead to win.

*** Yeah I can see that , but I'm thinking in depth with the butterfly effect. Like what if without the horntail in the mini dragon bag , fleur pulls out a different dragon and changes the order?

**** Fleur knew about the Tournament so it won't effect her chances that much. But even then Cedric will have to come up with a plan in high pressure situation and even if he comes up with a plan, he would not have practiced it beforehand. So chances of Cedric completing the task are looking slim. If he was a wizard of Voldemort or Dumbledore level, then only I would bet on him surviving the task in those conditions.

***** But what about the fact that with no fake moody, then the real one would be a teacher , and would no doubt be on the lookout for any wrongdoing during the tournament, Kramer would not know about the task because moody would keep an eye on him and I don't think he would be complacent in hagrid showing madam maxie the dragons with his constant vigilance.

****** Hmmm.... Moody was hired to protect Harry, because of the increasing Dark activity. He wasn't there to stop the Judges cheating in the tournament.

** Fleur, by a country mile. The introduction to the dragons feature a dozen dragon handlers - adult professionals who studied and trained specifically to manage dragons - working together to subdue a dragon. The first task featured Fleur, a 17-18 year-old student, knocking out the dragon single-handedly and with little-to-no preparation. Sure, she received info a few days in advance, but I'm fairly certain a dragon reservation would be aware of spells that do THAT MUCH compared to the demonstrated method of a dozen stunners if they could spare people capable of it. This is a major international event with a (restrained) dragon in close proximity to a couple hundred children for at least a week. They're not skimping on security.

Fleur pulled off a stunt beyond the capabilities of almost every professional in a dedicated, dangerous field. Krum's strategy was to poke it in the eyes REALLY HARD and Cedric distracted it with a bit of animate transfiguration, which are both around school-age magics. Upper-level magic, and they probably were better with those spells than the average student, but it's magic that any teenager with a passing interest in the field should be competent at. It's like going to a math-a-thon and two students are doing basic derivatives while another is playing around with Octonions. It's a bit of a skill difference.
