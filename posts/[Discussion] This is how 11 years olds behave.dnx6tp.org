Now compare that to the "11 years old Slytherin master politician" trope.

So my question is, which version of them do you like more?


** I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I don't really mind the political kid stuff. Is it unrealistic? Yes, of course. But do I find the political maneuvering and considerations interesting enough to be able to ignore the lack of realism? Yes, even more so.

I don't particularly want to read about /actual/ 11 year olds having an uneventful year, which would be kinda boring and, well, juvenile.

I'd definitely take some sort of Slytherin House of Cards set in the Wizengamot with adult versions of our beloved characters doing political maneuvering. But without that, I'm willing to stretch credulity for the sake of a mildly intriguing plot.

Maybe would be harder to do if I/friends had kids of our own though, to be fair.

*** What would be fun is a combo. I remember /thinking/ I was making a sneaky "political" plan as an 11-year-old. I just lacked the awareness to realize how childish the plan was. I'd love to see that done well in fanfic, as it was in the original books.

**** That's what I prefer to do. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165448/1/Dance-of-the-Moths][In my au]] I have witches and wizards maturing faster than muggles, and Hogwarts starting at 12 instead of 11. My first year characters are about 14/15, developmentally, which leads to way more interesting storytelling. Trying to accurately portray the worldview of an 100 year old limits you to an almost absurd degree. You have to be a writer of Harper Lee's caliber to effectively write gripping drama from the perspective of a child, and I'm certainly not one.

The worst thing someone can do is to try and take a middle road between portraying a first year's mind realistically or in an unrealistic (but more interesting) adult fashion, and have romance-based plots with eleven year olds. I've only seen that done well [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1137958][/once/]], and that's because the point of the story was to have a flufy, innocent, they-don't-entirely-realize-it-yet childhood romance.

*** I feel like a lot of people gloss over this fact and either wave it away or see a video of eleven-year-olds behaving ‘normally' for a few minutes and assume that is how all of them act. My nephew has yet to learn swearing and offensive racist terms -- or he is smart enough to not say them near adults -- he has long since used sarcasm and mastered the art of sluggishness. Ask him to do something and he will drag his feet for an hour as he does it. We would be 50,000 words in and still in Diagon Alley if we used legitimate eleven-year-olds.

Most pre-teens here talk like they are on the internet. They say bruh a lot, use autism as the new gay, use gay as in gay, are openly racist and quite petty with it. Even if we go back a few years, it was still the same over-the-top offensive remarks designed to get a rise out of people or to seem cool. The giggling after swearing, the muttered racist remarks, and the loud and unashamed declaration that something -- or someone -- is gay.

The upside is that boys still seem to just lose it when someone farts. I guess that one will always be relevant.

I feel like authors need to 50/50 this. They can be decent politicians as I expect most uppity people to have learned manners, greetings, et cetera, but not so in your face about it. No, an eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy should not sway into the Slytherin common room and have all them boy to his every whim as he is a Malfoy. In canon, that family fell from grace quite rapidly, even under the reign of Voldemort, who often used these pure-blood traditions as a vocal point in his reign.

I did not mean that sluggishness would last forever, more that my nephew has hit that point and it is a prime example.

I see that example used a lot. “If I was magical, I would do x and y without delay!” and I have to wonder if people give the same enthusiasm to their current schoolwork. Yes, you have magic, but you still have to attend school. You cannot go off and gallivant around, learning all obscure spells day one. You have seven years of schooling to go through. I gave school about 20% effort. I think I would do the same at Hogwarts, magic or not.

However, we also need to factor in students that would know magic exists. Because that sense of wonder is gone from pure-bloods that have grown up around magic.

I see posts complaining about Harry and Ron not wanting to go to class/do homework because MAGIC! But, at the end of the day, that is their version of school and not everyone likes school. Same context here.

****** I do put /almost/ the same effort to school that I would to learning magic

Yes, but as I said, I would most likely either be scared to death by magic or would do what I said in my other comment, AND that's not even factoring in the fact that if magic was real, almost the only way that the Harry Potter series type magic was real would be if J.K Rowling herself was a witch and the book series was actually an autobiography of Harrys life. That's just because of the millions of possibilities, but lets just talk like it is and we don't know anything about magic yet because you're a muggleborn/muggle raised and professor Mcgonagall or someone else came and told you about Magic, what is the most likely thing to do? For me it would be to ask to prove it so I would be sure it's not a prank, when I'm assured it is real I would probably tell them I want to go to the school and then go to my room to think about the shock of my life that I just received. Then I would probably look over the list of stuff needed and wonder hoq they work and what could be done with them

And even if you are a purenlood, in my opinion its still a pretty cool thing, because they can finally DO magic and they've never been (lawfully) allowed to do that

There are still going to be those that are total lazy asses about school and would probably sleep the time in the hogwarts express and had forgotten almost half their books and stuff home or something

And I don't understand how the kids at hogwarts always had their books with them to classes, like at my school it's just normal for teachers to say ”go get your books, you that managed to forget them again” at the beginning of a class

My circle friends is in their early twenties, and well, the one thing that's changes is behaviour in public. In private, the banter is still about doing the mother of someone else and insults about ones heritage (I'm half Polish, so I'm stealing the cars. The Ukrainian is in the Soviet mob and so on). We have a gay bloke, and he calls everything gay and uses faggot as goto insult.

The thing is, we all know that we're just dicking around. There's a big difference between telling someone random that he looks like he'd suck a dick for a tenner with the intent to hurt their feelings and having some fun with your mates. Context matters a lot, but getting that across in writing is incredibly hard.

She has been sucking before I started rappingor lazy bitch, go to the gym and turn your behind into a (proper) ass just to give to rather tame examples. Because ghetto rap is the kind of music that's popular at school, since it's something children aren't supposed to be listening to. It has been that way when I've been to school and it hasn't changed much, other than that people wouldn't have dared to sing along in public back in my days because German rap was still a new thing.

And yes, such language is offensive, but that's the whole point. You use it when you WANT TO insult someone. An adult might go for a cheeky insult hidden in a compliment, but when you're just out of elementary school, you are rather limited in your verbal arsenal and therefore just use a combination of all the bad words you know.

Then consider yourself lucky and blessed that nobody from your cohort was like that. I'm not sure whether it was a product of time or just location, but the 11 year olds I encountered when I was 11 in my part of North America could be rather mean when the adults weren't looking. Racism and /especially/ homophobia was very common in the area I grew up in, common enough that even many adults didn't think that homophobic statements in public were wrong (public racist statements were frowned upon by adults, but what was said behind closed doors...ugh). Video recordings via phone weren't big back then, but if people had recorded even a tenth of the stuff that was said, most of the kids in my school would've been run off the internet in this day and age.

I can't even think of a single instance in which a gay male was out until during university, likely due to the social stigma of being openly gay in my area at that time. When some students at my high school formed a chapter of GSA, none of the boys wanted to show up because of the stigma of being labeled as gay. The members of GSA would be openly and regularly ridiculed by a significant portion of the student body. I feel like that kind of treatment isn't tolerated anymore at schools (though as I'm no longer a student I can't actually comment on that).

Being in a city likely makes a difference, although I'm inclined to believe it could just be an issue of time. It's been a long while since I was a middle school student and the public's treatment of LGBTQ issues in North America has changed a lot in the interim (I can't speak on other parts of the world). In Canada civil marriages weren't allowed nationwide until 2005. Three years /after/ that, down in California, the electorate /voted/ to /eliminate/ same-sex marriages. These are relatively recent things. So to see the attitudes towards the LGBTQ population that are present in media now stands in stark contrast to what was occurring even just a decade ago.

I grew up playing outside and just being a carefree kid and later in my life i got into the game "Go" and had a friend of the family whose kid was a piano prodigy.

The kids in the piano crowd were usually SUPER serious and so intense about music, though some would still be childish sometimes.

As for go i got very good, best in my state, and got to travel and meet some entire families who were deep into it as well as a guy who sold his business to microsoft and was working on another one while training his kid to learn how to do that.

The kids from all of these things acted much more like the serious, politically plotting, grown up acting kids from stories than many seem to think.

** When I was 10 years old, my best mate and I were using the drill press and lathe in my father's workshop to make a very primitive muzzle loading pistol.

​

It used entirely too much black powder, but we'd fortunately used rather heavy stock, so the walls of barrel were nearly an inch thick. Fired lead fishing weights. Blew some respectable chunks out of the old silo.

​

Lightly supervised children tend to rise to the level of mischief dictated by their imaginations. Also, we'd read treasure island and rather fancied being pirates.

** Well obviously I'd prefer adult characters being all political, but since reason aged-up aus aren't as popular, I'd rather not see the petty things real 11 year olds get up to, and I don't particularly want a canon rehash either. Like that video was cute, but not cute enough that I'd want to read 50 chapters of something like it. Making the kids act like adults brings more tension to the story. What really bugs me about the politicking stories is that they tend to be an excuse for Harry to be super edgy, nobody can match his abilities, sometimes not even Dumbledore.

** It takes a skilled writer to write children as children. Not even children can do that, because they'll want their characters to say and do all kinds of things that children won't. Even JKR didn't often keep the characters true to their ages.

It's not shocking that the most common way to portray child protagonists in an arena of amateur writers is them behaving like little adults.

*** I'd argue that 11 year olds trying to play politics should be done with them not having any real understanding of nuance or subtelty, and a tendancy to overestimate how much pull or influence their parents have. You know, like how Draco Malfoy behaves in canon.

**** That's something about canon that I didn't quite appreciate until I started to read a whole bunch of Political!Slytherin fics. Sure the political fics were interesting, but there's no way that every other 11-17 year old in that house had some kind of "ulterior motive" for /every/ bloody social interaction that they had.
