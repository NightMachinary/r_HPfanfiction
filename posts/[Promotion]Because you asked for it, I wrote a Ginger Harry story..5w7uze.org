[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][In which Harry has no soul, but does get confused for a Weasley]]. For now it's just a one shot, but I suppose if enough people liked it I might write another.


** I would now like a fiction where it turns out hardly any of the children are actually biologically, or even legally, Molly and Arthur's, it's just that Weasleys and Prewetts tend to grow by forming a red-headed league, accepting all bullied and rejected gingers. Possibly because purebloods believe gingers to truly be soulless, or cursed, or bad luck or something, so chuck them out. Anyway, Bill starts with collecting serial runaway Charlie, who in turn, picks up nerdy Percy, who'd discovered Diagon Alley on his own. The twins were found abandoned in St George's Cathedral, with a note saying they were demon spawn and could the Archbishop please take appropriate action to banish them. Poor Molly has a breakdown having just given birth to Ron, and gaining terror toddler twins at the same time, but still takes in a teenage unmarried mother's baby girl a year later.

  AU. Harry Potter always wondered about how easily the Weasley family accepted him. Turns out, he wasn't the first child taken in. So yeah, this turned out darker than I intended. Whoops.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.
