I read it all in less than a day, and am quite sad that I have finished what has been published so far. It might be the best fanfiction I have ever read, actually. I want to read something similar - something where Harry gets to know Merlin or Morgana or Arthur, something where Harry travels back thousands of years, something where Harry is one of the Founders of Hogwarts, something where Harry is old and immortal. It can be one of these things or all of them as long as the fic is long, I don't care, I just want something to read.

I've already read a few chapters of A Long Journey Home, by the way - I know that one will be suggested.


** The only other two ancient Harry fics I know are Voldemort's Last Spell and The Wizard from Earth. A Long Journey Home really is the best example of Ancient-Harry-Wandering-Through-History there is, I'm afraid. (I've also linked it - I know you've read it already, but I figured other people reading this post might not've).

The latter is purely around the south-eastern Mediterranean and features mostly Egyptian stuff. Interesting fic though.

The former starts off interesting and then rapidly devolves in the last few chapters into a standard Avengers cross-over with no warning whatsoever. Not my thing at all, but maybe you'll enjoy it.

  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20913215/chapters/49716056]] should have some of what you're looking for. Very different setup, but hits some of the same lore-type stuff.

Additionally, there is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/don-dresden-founder-of-hogwarts-dresden-files-harry-potter-complete.790927/]] which is a complete crossover. Harry Dresden gets sent back to the founding of Hogwarts.

** Well, it got a new chapter today. That's not quite the same though.
