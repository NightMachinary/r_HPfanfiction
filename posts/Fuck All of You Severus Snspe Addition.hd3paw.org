** If you disagree with people, that's fine. But if you want to hurl abuse at people for taking a different stance from you, that's hardly appropriate behavior. Whatever Severus gets whatever he deserves, is up for interpretation, and there's really no correct or incorrect answer because he's entirely fictional. He's not even the same character from fanfic to fanfic.

** Tired as shit so I'm only gonna say a couple of things. It's fine for you to have an opinion but if you wanna convince people of that opinion use evidence. I saw a grown ass man taking pleasure from picking on a child for 6 years as revenge for actions said child did not commit. He saves Harry, not because we're given any indication of the kind of person he is changing, but ultimately because Lily is his mother. He abuses Harry and then saves him, not for his own merits but for his relation to his parents? Harry only matters to him one way or another because of his parents. Just like the Wizarding World only sees the Boy-Who-Lived, Snape only sees "that Potter brat" or "Lily's son" in the end. That is the sum total of what I see in the character. You're not going to convince me of anything else if the best you can do is talk shit about people who disagree with you.

*** He doesn't even deserve much praise for saving Harry while Harry's at Hogwarts. He's a professor, he better bloody well save the life of a student.

If he only did it because of Lily, then that counts against him, both as a human and as a professor.

**** The Lily point is definitely an argument. It shows he hasn't genuinely changed from the person he was during the war. He's a bad person and the few good things he did are only good for the world but they don't earn him any morality points because he didn't do those actions becauee he believed in the cause he of the side he was fighting. If Voldy hadn't killed Lily, he'd definitely still be on Voldy side.

***** Why does that mean he doesn't earn any morality points? If you throw out the spying because of Lily, then you also have to throw out the abuse and deatheatering on account of his childhood and upbringing. You're throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

****** As a child and even teenager, he was a victim at the mercy of other people. As an adult, he had power to at least try an improve his life or attempt to find love in someone else but he was caught up in his self pity. His actions were wrong yet he still chose them. And he doesn't earn any morality points because he betrayed Voldemort for "Lily's son" and not "Harry." He hadn't changed from the person who only saw Harry for his parents, it was just in this instance that he saw his mother and not his father. It wasn't for Harry it was for Lily, the target of his obsession. It wasn't because he cared about the morality of what he was doing. It wasn't to keep Harry alive, he wanted to keep a small piece of Lily alive.

Basically, what I'm saying is his actions on their own were righteous. The issue is that the motivations behind them keep them from making Snape himself righteous because they were to further his own ends, regardless of whether or not he would live to see those ends. His ends not being Harry succeeding, but instead they were vengeance for Lily and protecting "Lily's son." He was self-serving to the bitter end. It was just that what he wanted also happened to fall in line with what was right.

******* You're making a good argument, so I'm going to fall back to what I consider the final layer: free will. The argument I'm making goes like this: 1. The only layer of randomness in the universe is at the quantum level. 2. Humans can't control the quantum level. 3. Every layer of complexity from atoms up is deterministic. 4. Humans don't control the basic movements of atoms because they result from basic quantum fluctuations. 5. Thus, everything a human does is predetermined, and thus a human has no free will. 6. The only real form of character/morality becomes the likelihood that a human will commit a good act rather than some special soul-like quality. 7. Snap's consistent pattern of both good and bad actions until the point of his inevitable death means that he is morally grey.

To unpack this more clearly, the argument from motivation is a flawed one because he died and knew he would die. The reason that motivation is important is because a flawed motivation creates a propensity for sin farther down the road, but Snape didn't have a road, so I consider this point moot.

Additionally, I would argue that Lily was more of a metaphorical anchor to the light than an object of love. I believe that he used her as an excuse to be where he knew he should be in his heart, and that she was more of a pure symbol of what he was trying to save than a person he obsessed over. There was no mention of Lily from Snape's perspective during any of the first five books. The point I'm making here isn't necessarily that I'm correct, but rather that the interpretation of his motivations is far more subjective than many believe.

******** I'm a simple-minded idiot so the most of that quantum stuff went entirely over my head so I'll just try my best with my limited understanding of what you've said and end off with a few last things. I don't feel it's entirely valid to forgive Snape's action through a cosmic sense of a lack of free will without also doing the same for Voldemort and the rest of the death eaters.

And I personally do feel that free will I fair to judge Snape by, especially when considering that our choices and the motivations that fuel them are the best measure of morality that's available. From the moment he fucked up his friendship with Lily to his death, the bulk of his choices are selfish or outright malicious and the vastly outweigh the few good actions he has to his name, especially since those actions are also selfishly motivated.

I agree that Snape is grey, but only because I believe everyone is a shade of grey. But Snape is a very dark shade. It's like the fact that even Hitler liked dogs. Neither person is without their good points, but their bad points are too numerous and/or significant to place them in the middle of that grey area. At least, that's my best take on it.

********* I put more weight on his spy work, and I do forgive the Death Eaters and Voldemort in a cosmic sense, although according to my probabilistic moral argument they still bad. I think we've reached the root at this point.

** This about the 3rd time this week where there are multiple Snape posts within hours of each other. There are reasons I tend to avoid /that/ sub.

#+begin_quote
  HE'S A GREY CHARACTER
#+end_quote

That doesn't entitle him to appreciation or fondness. He's an awful human being who loved someone and did good thing(s). That describes both Narcissa and Petunia.

** I personally think that Snape is bitter, first of all : he lost everthing he may care about in the past, so clearly he doesn't give a damn if people don't like him now.

In the books, I clearly despised him because he was portrayed as a douchebag who did everything he could to mock and belittle Harry. When we saw his revelation in book 7, I was like 'meh', not really shaken.

But in most of the fics I read, he is much more fun to follow because you see all the idiocy he has to endure from the students

** Oh, we're not going to judge him for the crimes that he committed in the past, eh?

Ok. He bullied a child for six years /just/ because he looked like his father. He bullied another child for six years... just because.

Snape never shows remorse. NOT ONCE. He doesn't show one ounce of guilt for being responsible for Harry being an orphan. He was almost responsible for Neville suffering the same fate as Harry. And he bullies him even more.

Snape wasn't grey. He was a shit person from beginning to end. He was just forced to do the right things because his childhood obsession died by the hands of his master.

Also, the books aren't strictly from Harry's point of view. There are times when we see it from a different perspective. If Snape had done anything useful as a spy, we would've known, even if we only see things from Harry's perspective. Something would've come up. But it never does.

*** If you're talking motivation, it doesn't even matter whether Snape found anything, because the intent of the act was monumentally good, which cancels with the abuse, making him grey. You don't get to decide that the second marks his real character but not the first.

** Grey character lmao.

He is a evil man that did some good things out of revenge. He never did them because they were the right thing to do.

And grey character is just a lame way to escuse evil shitbags. Any person is capable of doing good and bad things, you dont call Harry a grey character and he used the imperious and cruciatos.

*** Snspe 😂. He was a manchild, but also a war hero. That's the whole point. It's like when people criticize green energy initiatives because they hurt poor people. Like yes, they do, but if it's them or the planet I pick the planet. In the same vein, people don't realize how enormously good him being a spy was.
