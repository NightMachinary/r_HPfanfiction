So, here's a brief synopsis.

I've been playing a ton of Fallout: New Vegas lately. Its given me an idea for a fic.

See, the main character, Courier Six, is a package courier shot in the head. This results in them losing their memory, completely. They even have to relearn how to shoot a gun.

The idea I have is for Ginny to wind up in the Fallout universe after falling through the Veil. She then takes the job in order to get some money for food, not knowing if she'll ever return home. It should be noted that due to the degenerative effects of radiation, her magical abilities slowly start to dampen.

She is shot by Benny as usual, and goes through the entire story of NV. But, due to an accident involving an experimental teleportation device, she winds up back in the HP universe, during the events of Deathly Hallows.

The fic then follows her meeting her family, telling them of her time in the Mojave, and trying to get back to the people that need her.

I need some advice on how to write this.

I don't like this. I like the reverse of this.

But as long as you put 16x times the detail with all new writing, editing, syntax technology and make it 4x times the word count of average HP/Fallout fic, I have feeling it would, just work.

*** Well, think of it this way.

If she has no book learning to be able to control her magic, it will just start bursting out of her randomly. She could be in the Sierra Madre with an explosive collar on her neck, and that might cause it to go off.

** She needs to make a new wand out of a Cazadore stinger with a core of Deathclaw Heartstring. Joshua tree wood would be a better wand wood choice, but beggars don't get to be choosers.

** I just wanted to say that I'd totally read this. I don't know why, but I like the idea of Ginny as the Courier. Possibly include the Weasley Family Ghoul? Maybe he'd come with her, regain his mind, and keep her company. Maybe she'd figure out his radioactive origin when she returns. Also, Undetectable Extension Charms, because we all know how Courier Six loves to carry everything on her back! Oh, and her technology (possibly from Big MT) /must/ save Fred.

*** The first two can't happen, since a Ghoul in the HP-verse isn't an irradiated human, and Ginny's magical ability is severely retarded because of radiation. But the last just might work, unless he dies instantly.

**** The second one was more of a tongue-in-cheek joke about Fallout encumberance limits. Besides, if she had the charmed object (like Hermione's beaded bag) with her already, she wouldn't need to perform magic to charm it.

****** Hmm...well, I think Molly would take it all very badly. Ginny is her only girl, and she's very protective of her. It would be hard for the whole family at first, but I want to believe that Arthur would find the technology fascinating eventually, especially all the stuff in Big MT. The boys might also be scared/angry, but I think most of them would come around to the cybernetics after things settled down. Would she bring something like ED-E back? Arthur and the boys would love that.

Like with many unexpected changes, it would take time to adjust, and I think most of them would, with Molly and Percy being the most resistant to it. For Molly, she'd probably have less of a problem with changes that she couldn't visually see, like heartless or spineless, than she would, let's say, a glowing cybernetic eye or some other constant visual reminder. You might have a different opinion on Molly, I know many people do. Personally, I like Molly, but her worry and love for her family can sometimes cause her to not always be the most likable person. All of them would obviously be relieved and overjoyed that their Ginny was standing there in front of them, and at the end of the day, that would help get them through.

A chem addiction, however, would be far more serious and harder to get through. Chems are nasty. Med-X is morphine and Jet is an amphetamine, for example. That's coming home with a drug addiction. It would be a struggle, but the Weasleys, and her brothers especially, would help her through it. I could see Ron, especially, staying by her side through the rough patches.

******* What about the different paths the Courier takes? I imagine their reactions would, on a scale from 'You are no longer my daughter!' to 'I'm proud of you, sweetie,' be this: Legion ending. House Ending. Independent New Vegas ending. NCR Ending(Since the NCR is closest to modern Britain). Now, I am an NCR player, so in my fic the last one is what I'll go for. Can she spend time in both worlds after defeating Voldemort(Or rather blowing him to hell and back a hundred times)? She has a lot of responsibility to the Wasteland, and after learning about her childhood(Since, again, thanks to Benny she only remembers her name at game start), she'd also want to spend time with them. But, she can't just abandon all the people who are counting on her. She might love Neville and Hermione, but wouldn't she like Boone and Veronica just as much? And here's something else: Would they approve of her killing so many people? The Courier has, no matter what path they take, killed tons of people. Granted, most of them were either A) in the middle of killing them, B) About to kill them or in the middle of killing their friends or innocent people, or C) trying to eat them. Still, their body count makes all the Death Eaters look like wimps.

******* I guess my three more questions are:

1. How can Ginny balance her life in the Fallout-verse and HP-verse?
2. Would her family judge her for all the people she's killed, even if it was justified?
3. Would the battle against Voldemort be easier if they had an Endgame Courier on their side? I think getting shot in the head with All-American would be a very poetic end for Voldemort.

** Get back to the people that need her... in the future, irradiated wasteland? Why would she think that she was in an alternate dimension, rather than just the future?

Then, rather than devote herself to studying magic to prevent the Great War, or joining anti-muggle supremacists (presumably, wizards suffered greatly during the nuclear exchange also), Ginny thinks "Total nuclear holocaust isn't that bad, but the idea of New Vegas not charting an independent course just grinds my gears!!"

If you want your Ginny to be remotely likable, it seems like she'd *have* to try and stop the war once she got back to the HP-timeline, or you'd need some sort of omniscient plot device to alert her to the fact that the Fallout-verse was a different dimension entirely from the HP-verse.

*** I could alert her via the flag. She obviously would have seen an American flag at some point in her life, and she could see that the flag in Fallout has Thirteen Stars.

Not only that, but during her time as the Courier, she could read multiple books on the history of the world, and compare it when she got back to the HP-verse.

Oh, and she technically doesn't know anything about magic. Remember, the Courier lost their memory, and radiation damages genes, meaning in the fic she has less magical ability. This is to prevent anything...spontaneous from occuring. Such as her collar exploding in Dead Money.

*** Continuing: I love the Fallout games, and NV was absolutely the most well-written (base) game of the whole series. But remember that they are, at their core, meant to be hopeless. It's why everywhere is an absolute shithole, and even the places that your messianic playable characters enact change (think NCR arising from FO:1/2, or BoS from FO:3), corruption and violent bigotry quickly take over.

It's a fundamental misunderstanding of most Fallout fanfiction, which so often are romances/fix-it fics. Those run contrary to the baseline of the whole series - that human beings are flawed, corrupt, and ultimately self-defeating.
