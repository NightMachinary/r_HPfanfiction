Nobody's quite sure if Harry was always just excited when it came to life in general, or if he started to crack at some point and nobody noticed it happening, but Harry is always enthusiastic... even when it isn't quite appropriate.

Lucius Malfoy aims his wand at Harry with the intention of making the little brat pay for tricking him into freeing Dobby: "Wow, sir! That's some advanced spell work! You almost got me, too! I hope I can learn some big spells like that someday!"

Barty Crouch Jr. reveals his entire mad plan after Harry comes back from the graveyard, Harry stares at him wide eyed a moment before excitedly saying "That... Is... Spectacular planning, sir! I mean, really, so many moving pieces and you pulled it all off in the end! Very clever! Did you have to plan it all out on paper or was it just in your head? Do you have any advice? OWLs are coming up and all..."

I could keep going, but I'm more interested in what other people can think up!

*** Did you know that technically Cerberus is actually named Spot? At least, it's a theory.

Basically the theory is that his name comes from a Sanskrit word meaning 'spotted'.

There's another theory that it comes from something else(I can't remember what right now, give me a bit to find it in my notes) that means something like 'to growl' so you could take it as meaning 'dog' or some other animal that growls.

I'm sorry, I just get really excited about this.

It's just...Hades literally married a flower goddess(well, okay, Persephone is the goddess of agriculture and some other stuff but still...Flower goddess.) and named his dog 'Spot'. He's quite a bit like fanon Snape, isn't he? Or at least, my version of him is.

******* It's been a hot sec since I've studied Greek Myth; I had to drop both that and Latin as they we're eating up too much of my time. But I think it's both. She's the goddess of spring growth separately, but shares the domain of agriculture and all that. She's also called Kore, fun fact.

                                                                                                            So the myth is basically that she spends the months of what we now call Winter in the Underworld. I've heard meany reasons why for this; the most popular being that, when Hades abducted her -which is a whole nother conversation, btw- she saw a promergranic and couldn't stop herself from eating the gorgeous fruit. She only ate about half before something or someone stopped her. The fruit made her stay in the Underworld indefinitely. As for why she spent the months of what we now call Spring above on Earth, there are about two different versions of the story that I remember, although I reckon there are more somewhere. One is that Dementor begged Zeus(her younger brother) to do something and get her daughter back. Zeus agrees(acquiescence but still, he agrees) and makes a deal that Persephone spend Spring up above making the flowers bloom and the plants and crops thrive, but she will spend everything else in the Underworld and Demeter's grief will wither the flowers and damage the crops. Another myth has Persephone and Hades making a deal so she can be with her mother and still belong to him and the Underworld because of the fruit.

******* An important thing to remember is that the majority of these myths were made up by men and told by men. The women's versions are rather different in quite a few aspects and much more interesting to read. For example, in the tale told by women, Poseidon was raping poor Medusa(who was a priestess of Athena) in Athena's temple and because she was a goddess and technically a women and couldn't do much to help her, Athena decided to curse her so she could protect herself and no one would ever hurt her like that again.

In the one told by men, they(Poseidon and Medusa, obviously) were having consensual sex in Athena's temple(by the way, any sex whether consensual or not was a big no-no to do in temple's as they were sacred places) and a jealous and spiteful Athena cursed Medusa so neither Poseidon or any man would ever come near her again.

Of course, it all ended up backfiring but still.

******** I would disagree on your assertions of the tales differencing from men and women.

I would wager they differ based on locations, locations that had a strong athena bias would belive in the version that made athena looked good.

and places where posiden was more popular would make her look like a crazy nutter.

Places where hades was disliked, he was a terrible person who kidnapped poor persephone.

Places where hades was liked, demeter was an over bearing mother and persphone had eloped with hades.

********* Well I still stick with the men/women; we'll just have to agree to disagree. The Iliad and The Odyssey definitely have misogyny and sexism in them. One example: Penelope leaves her room to approach the assorted suitors who more or less occupy her mansion, waiting for her to give up on long-lost Odysseus and marry one of them. When she requests they stop singing such songs, she is met with resistance from the youngest male there: Her adolescent son, Telemachus, chastises her. Return to your room, he tells her; public speaking is for men. Well either way, you cannot deny that the most popular myths have sexism and misogyny in them. Hell, Hercules was a fucking rapist and he's still praised. I have more points to argue my point, but it's 6 passed 12:30am right now. Not meant to anger, but you seem to be coming across as if you believe their is no misogyny in the Greek Myths(and other culture's myths, I reckon, but I can't really speak on that. I study Greek Mythology).

merely that the various myths changed based on what gods the towns recording the myths favored.

a town that favoured posiden would have a version of events that favoured him. and a town that worshiped athena would have a version where she is the good guy.

********* I disagree. 'According to Ovid, Medusa was once a beautiful young maiden, the only mortal of three sisters known as the Gorgons. Her beauty caught the eye of the sea god Poseidon, who proceeded to rape her in the sacred temple of Athena.' So according to Ovid(a poetic from circa 48BC to 17AD) she was raped. Hesiodos(another poetic, this time active from around 1750 BC or maybe 650 BC), however, disagrees with this and states that whatever happened between the two of them was perfectly and completely consensual. Although he is generally attributed to having one of the only surviving records of the myth in which Medusa was neither cursed by Athena nor raped by Poseidon. I could find more, but as I stated below, it's 2-fucking-am and I need sleep. Good-bloody-night. Also, power is of no importance. They are both gods(Hell, they're bloody Olympians), irregardless of power level. There are several stories in which a 'lesser' god punishes a more powerful one. I can't find any at this moment, but it's like 2am so I can't fault myself on that.

********* Here! Also, as for the power play, I remember a time in a myth or something where she attacks two other Olympians. I don't remember who, though...

So as for her reasons, there are quite a few. I'll bullet point my favorites below.

- To humiliation him. Whichever version of the myth you're talking about, it would've been humiliating for Poseidon to have been with someone who is now a hideous monster.
- Because she was wise. She can't outright attack him because A) it would've been bad for her because it would anger Zeus and B) It would most likely start a war which would be shitty for the mortals. As such, she goes the passive aggressive route.

As for my least favorite, there's one where it's just because she was biased. I disagree with this, myths have changed a lot as they were handed down(mainly orally) and so when at the trial she stood up and pronounced that she was a champion of men and not women as she was born from Zeus and Zeus alone(technically), I think it might've been something different but still *shrug*

There are different versions of the myth. It's hard to find exact examples because nowadays people love to focus more on the whole she-was-raped version because, you know, /rape/. But there are. There are versions where it's consensual and their are versions where it's not. There are versions where she was born a gorgon and their versions where /she has fucking donkey legs/. Point: There are different versions. Fucking deal with it.

Edit: the characters are all well built too. The main charector isn't infallible, has his limits, and does get outplayed sometimes. And every book in the series builds on the previous books, so while every book has its own plot so to say, they ALL tie into one giant over arch that's leading up to what Jim butcher, the author, describes as 'the big apoplectic trilogy'
