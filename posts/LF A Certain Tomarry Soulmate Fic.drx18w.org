:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I've been looking for a while and I can't find it- maybe I'm just dumb or something- but it goes like this: Harry dies when the killing curse hits him on Halloween, but Death is there and makes a deal with baby Harry's soul- if he can survive until 11 years old, Death will grant him immortality.

Harry does, and he becomes immortal. But also, Voldemort is Harry's soulmate and he tries to restore him as Tom Riddle, and it works. Harry's boggart is like his soul song? Idk I guess in the fic souls have a song and his boggart is hearing it as it is, alone without his soulmate. No one but Harry realizes what it is though.

I also vaguely remember there being a scene where Harry's dancing in the rain and Tom's watching, either amused at his weirdness or just in awe of his innocence despite being friends with Death.

Its on Ao3, and very similar to the fic A Morte Molestus, but not quite the same

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal?(Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death)

*** Yeah, that's it. Thanks.

I actually found it last night and I felt really stupid because it happened like ten minutes after I made this post. Thank you though
