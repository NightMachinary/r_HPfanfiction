Why does everyone take away the messy quality to harry hair in makeover/growing up fics? I like that quality and literally everyone takes it away!


** Because unruly hair is annoying? It's a pain to keep looking even slightly presentable without using unholy amounts of hair product. You'd literally have to brush hair into place with your hands every few minutes.

*** I had to reread your comment. English is not my first Language so I mistranslated it first but I did get a funny mental image.

Somehow I imagined Harry's hair has accidentally gotten it's own personality. Like the sorting hat, it is capable of commentary and independent movement. It just can't leave Harry's head. The hair became the power he know not since Voldie is now a baldie

******* Hadrian is just a pureblood sounding name that appears at first glance similar to Harry (using the name of a Roman emperor would sound appropriate for a lot of the more pompous pureblooded families, I think). You're right that most of the fics that the name is used in end up classist/racist and just straight up bad, but as a 'true' name for Harry it's not that bad IMO.

(In this case, where 'true' means only for important/formal events and documents, and he still goes by Harry 99% of the time, or there are some crazy extenuating circumstances)

** For some, it might be personal (ie, having messy hair IRL and disliking it). In other cases, it can be because of the plot. If Harry's being put into important/political positions, maybe he needs to dress up a bit more to be impressive, etc.

I do agree that in private, I don't see Harry caring that much about it :P

** Appearance.

In my opinion, especially for that time period, he'd look better with black hair that is longer like shoulder length. Why? The 80s and 90s (early) had a lot of it.

** To say something different than the "messy hair sucks, so why make him deal with it" answers.

Messy hair can be related to immaturity. When people remake/change/grow up a character, they want to get rid of flaws. So to get rid of any doubt that the character might still be acting childish, they change his hair

Its harder to imagine a mature and responsible person with wild unruly hair, but very easy to imagine a person with a nice haircut being more mature.

** I have the same thing but with his height. I've read stories where he has to use an obsence amount of product and it works with the story and was appropriete. I've never read a story that had him miraculously become taller, or even average that wasn't the author trying to get harry to fit a "nicer"image. Harry is short, Whenever they make him tall it frustrates me.

even worse when he's a teenager and a few nutritional potions magically have him shoot up. I guess it is magic and all, but it feels like the writers are uncomfortable with a main character that has disadvantages. It feels shallow too, almost invariably, when an author wants a "powerful," "handsome" Harry they always make him taller. I really don't think height matters much when it comes to magical ability, even if it does effect confidence and that garbage. What makes me like Harry is his determination, not his ability. That he comes in fun size reminds me of Hobbits and the whole thing of great things come in small packages. Him being tall reminds me of adolescent writers salivating over fictional characters.

*** I totally agree that whenever fics make Harry taller he's usually on his way to becoming multi-trillionaire/Lord-of-Everything/sex god with a harem of 400 girls, but canon doesn't actually describe him as all that short. He's said in DH to be the exact same height as his dad and is described to be about average height (which in the UK in the late 90s was about 5'9). I think the 'Harry is short' trope comes both from him being described as shorter than Ron, but Ron is definitely a few inches taller than Harry (at least 6 feet), and because Daniel Radcliffe ended up being 5'5 and by the time HBP/DH rolled around they couldn't really recast Harry for someone taller so they just went with it. Canon Harry isn't the 6'6 that some fics make him with nutrition potions and rituals and whatever else, but he's not a midget either.

**** him being short in my head is definitely because of Radcliffe. But I also like there being real consequences for his mistreatment via the Dursleys.

***** Years and years and years ago I read something to the effect of "men who are tall in high school remain more confident than their peers who were short, even if both end up the same height". I don't have any idea what the basis for the confidence thing is, but the important point here is the idea that "tall in school" and "tall" aren't the same.

For a specific example, my brother must've grown nearly a foot because he was teeny tiny when he started (I remember thinking he was probably shorter than a friend of mine who was 5'2") but he's a little over six foot now (184cm vs 183cm for 6'). Of course, we can question what counts as tall or not (see: [[/r/tall][r/tall]]) but there you go. (For reference, my brother considers himself "not particularly" tall but categorically said "no" when I asked if he felt short.)

Harry's definitely meant to be small and skinny when he started Hogwarts (at 11, admittedly) so my point is his being (at least somewhat) tall when he finishes isn't the same as there being no consequences to the Dursleys' treatment. I imagine it's something like my brother... steadily getting taller until some arbitrary point in time when he's "not particularly" tall.

Does that make sense?
