So, the premise of the real us (I'm not linking that.) was interesting enough. the whole "You only know what we wanted you to know" Or something like that, was a fun concept.

If we ignore the... activities of young Harry and Hermione, of course.

So, do you guys know of any other fanfic with a similar premise?

** linkffn(When Harry Met Wednesday)

This fic has some of what you're looking for. You find out pretty early on that what Harry remembers, and what we know from the first 5 books, isn't necessarily the truth. The author has done a few bonus scenes showing what really happened.

All around its a great fic if you don't mind the macabre.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

at 11/12 years old.

Not a fan of that part.

The rest of the fic is entertaining though.
