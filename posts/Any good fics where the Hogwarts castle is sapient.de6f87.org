I just have a rather sudden desire to read something where the Hogwarts castle is intelligent, sapient, and preferably powerful. Like a character basically. Nothing sexual, please.

  In a time where house rivalries are at its deepest and most volatile, it seems impossible these two would find a way together. This is the legacy of their time together, but how will they get through it?. Harry/Daphne. Starts from GOF. Dumbledore is good (sorry if that annoys anyone). Harry will have different friends, which isn't the usual ones you see in fanfic. Enjoy

  Salazar Slytherin did not have an easy life, and he finally died alone after an argument with his dearest friends. Then he was reborn. Somehow. But life as the Boy Who Lived might be too much even for him. At least he doesn't have to do it alone.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

I fully recommend it, it's been high on my favourites list from the beginning, and there's a sequel being written right now that deals with the aftermath of the war.
