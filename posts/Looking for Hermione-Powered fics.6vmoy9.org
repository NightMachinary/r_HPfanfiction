I am a huge Hermione fan and wondered if there are fics featuring her discovering additional powers, or some kind of magical "accident"/destiny is activated, or undiscovered heritage that will give her additional powers? I prefer long fics, with NO Ron pairing, it can be either slash/femslash. The story doesn't need to be perfect grammatically, but enough that it flows, and doesn't read like a pre-teen wrote it.


** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) Hermione is a math prodigy, and it turns out that math is the key to spellcrafting. The Arithmancer covers Years 1-4, Lady Archimedes is 5-7. By third year she's inventing her own spells, by fifth she's giving an Unspeakable a run for his money.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** One of my absolute favorites is linkffn(Keogh by ChelleyBean). It is grammatically perfect (an occasional typo notwithstanding), and is extremely unusual being a crossover with a not well-known series (familiarity with the original is not required). Unfortunately it is incomplete, and never will be, from the look of things. Fortunately, it stops at a point in which it would not be inconceivable to end a book before, say, posting a sequel, so there is really no "argh" feeling when it ends.

  In 1991, a child came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with obvious gifts, but which few suspected would change the world... Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically. I expect events to diverge fairly quickly. ;) *** cover image cc by-nc RooReynolds @ Flickr

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, like tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids... Everything was wrong. 1950 was never her intention.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
