Haven't seen any fiction like I described above and was wondering if there were any good examples that people have read ?


** If there are any good ones, I have yet to find them... Most of the ones I've seen are like a previous poster said... Involving insane deus ex machina. Off the top of my head I remember Harry living in a secret bunker under Easter Island sending his consciousness back in time, Another had Hermione living on a moon base committing ritual suicide in a ritual to send a message back to her 11 year old self. And one truly forgettable one has Luna commanding the space military.

** linkffn(8514243)

Zarkham's stuff is generally great, but the world-building behind Harry Potter and the Thin Blue Line had me hooked. Know that, unlike most other fics dealing with modern technology, the timeline is actually delayed rather than brought forward by ten years (as in, canon happens in the seventies rather than the noughties) . Add some magical idiocy, muggle Britain's 1984-style surveillance shenanigans as of late and mix with a badass Harry and you've got close to what you are looking for.

The only thing is that, despite playing a defining role in the setting, technology is not (yet) the star attraction here. That honour goes to a Harry Potter who has more in common with Max Payne than any of his fellow Law Enforcement Officers.

PS: Only downside-the cover photo. Aims for badass, hits kinda cheesy. Otherwise, all's good.

It's a shame something like this as a solution hasn't been written as a fully fledged story - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3j7d96/whats_a_story_youd_really_like_to_read/cunn2lu]] but there have been a couple of fics where magical girls anime and cosplayers are mentioned as the cover for the wizarding communities in Japan.

** There's really no good way around it without a ridiculous deus ex machina in my opinion. Something like magic being an automatic all powerful SEP field that affects through technology as well. Or that computer/internet technology is entirely created/maintained by wizards and it automatically censors magic, though that option is like saying non-magical people literally can't do anything. I have seen zero fics that do this well or even at all.

*** One thing to keep in mind is that HP magic generally works by ensuring a result, not a means.

For example, the killing curse doesn't stop the heart or sever the soul or whatever. It just makes you dead, like flicking a switch.

Similarly, we know that the Muggle repelling spells on Hogwarts don't achieve a specific means. Rather, they do whatever is needed to make the Muggle turn away, whether that's remembering a fake dentist's appointment or seeing a "Danger: Keep Out" sign (both of these are mentioned in canon as examples).

This means that it's going to be rather hard to use technology to get around magic, because there's no specific mechanism of action that you can target. If a Muggle tries to approach Hogwarts with a calendar in hand and a big note telling them that they don't have any dentist appointments, the magic will simply manifest in some other way to keep them out.

Another thing to keep in mind is that spells are often attached to conceptual targets rather than physical ones. One example is the Defence Against the Dark Arts curse, attached not to any physical person or place but rather the abstract concept of a teaching position. Another example is the fidelius charm, which isn't cast on a physical place but rather on a secret, i.e. a piece of information. Another example is the Taboo, which is cast on a lexical item.

If an anti-Muggle spell is cast on a concept rather than a physical location (i.e. Hogwarts per se is hidden from Muggles, not the physical area that Hogwarts inhabits), then it's hard to see how any technology could allow Muggles to pierce it. The spell would be active even if a Muggle were looking at a satellite photo of Hogwarts, because "concept spells" have no physical boundaries. It's impossible for someone to perceive a place under the Fidelius charm no matter where they are - the spell does not have an area of effect. It affects the information itself, and you're subject to the spell no matter where you are in the world.

The only thing I can imagine threatening this is true AI. But even that you could easily handwave: true AI would be a mind, and a non-magical mind at that. It could very well come under the definition of "Muggle".

A third thing to remember is that wizards have already penetrated the highest levels of Muggle government. It wouldn't be hard to do the same for the media. In the very unlikely situation wizards were exposed, they could simply get the world's governments and all major media outlets to declare it a hoax.

A fourth thing to remember is that HP Muggles actively delude themselves into thinking magic isn't real, even when they directly witness it.

A fifth thing to remember is that we don't know all the methods the Ministry uses for guaranteeing secrecy. We don't even know the limits of the Obliviation Charm. The fact that two wizards were able to Obliviate an entire beach of Muggles seems to imply that it can be cast on a relatively large number of people quite quickly.

**** I think this has to be the answer, because it also explains why wizards haven't accidentally killed everyone on the planet. Think of all the genie stories where the ill-fated wisher ends up getting /exactly/ what they wish for; it never ends well. Rowling even lampshades this a bit in the Tales of Beedle the Bard charity book.

Magic has to have some sort of "oh well /that's/ not what I meant" safeguard built in to protect the caster. Imagine some half-clever muggleborn hears about antimatter and is like "Oh I wonder what that's like, let me transfigure some." Oops, where'd that strange crater in Scotland come from?

Even canon magic provides evidence for this: When Harry summons his broom from a long distance in book 4 how does it "know" not to impale anyone as it whizzes towards him? How do people not regularly apparate into each other, or random objects, or for that matter how is the air displaced when they do? What if it's raining where they're apparating to? How do people not asphyxiate when paralyzed by petrificus totalus? How does waddiwassi "know" to remove a chunk of gum but not tear apart the lock it's stuck in? There has to be a conceptual result-based mechanism.

(Not to bring up this subreddit's favorite flamebait but one of the great disappointments of HPMOR is how it promised to create a scientific rationale for the mechanics of the magical world and then, after a couple token efforts, gave up on that and became several hundred thousands words of author insert rambles about his philosophy.)

**** This is a really interesting theory. It would put science and magic on two sides of a coin called 'Change.' Science affects change by focusing on Cause, whereby an action is taken to obtain the desired reaction. Magic affects change by focusing on Effect, whereby the change itself is the action rather than the reaction, and the means of change are the reaction.

*** IIRC Taure's headcanon document has something relevant here. Magic isn't on the same plane of reality as science. You won't see Hogwarts through a camera or a satellite, it's literally impossible to see or comprehend for non-magicals.

Sure internet and phones help you share pictures and videos quickly - imagine someone publishing a video of *real* witchcraft in action. I bet you it wont take ten minutes before you are put down as a prankster or a conspiracy theorist, based on how serious you are taking it.

Sure, you can't efficiently memory charm the entire populace, but you don't need to. Even a single person could probably keep an entire populace under control by careful appliance of /really fucking overpowered magic/ to people in key positions.

Give me a wand, enough skill for obliviate and imperio and possibly an influx of veritaserum and no opposing magicals, and I'll puppeteer the government and the media of a nation around in a week.

I don't think technology can even compete with the HP breed of magic. Just go read a Star Wars crossover - HP magic is outright ridiculous. Too versatile to ever counter without being able to use it yourself.

If you try to answer the question with any detail inside the fic, you open up too many questions and possibilities for incredibly overpowered magic. To ask the question is to put yourself an a position where the rest of the story is meaningless.

***** I don't think you're using the phrase "deus ex machina" correctly. Deus ex machina is a fortuitous, previously unknown factor that comes out of nowhere, generally to save the day.

The use of HP magic to fool Muggles is firmly established, as is the infiltration of Muggle institutions of power by wizards. It's rather the opposite of coming out of nowhere.

If anything, Muggles suddenly having a technology that could get around magic would be the deus ex machina.
