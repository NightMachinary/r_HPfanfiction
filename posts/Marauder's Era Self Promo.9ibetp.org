Hey guys! Just published the first chapter of a fanfic I've been writing for a while that my friend told me to put up. Looking for any and all reviews! Don't be afraid to let me know if it's a piece of shite!

** It's nice. However, allow me some criticism :)

I feel like you are suffering from the same issue I did. Your prose is very detailed, yet incredibly static. It conveys the information but it fails to set up the mood and really immerse.

My personal solution is going over the chapter once I'm done, asking whether or not the scene I see in my head is the one the reader will see. Here's my shot at your opening:

#+begin_quote
  The house was old. The wallpaper, once delightfully emerald, faded into a sickly green. The walls themselves grew hollow, and most nights Remus could not sleep due to the busy life of mice going on within them. But on that night even the mice were laying silent, showing for once some respect. It was nice to know that the moonlight scared them too.

  Instead, the room was filled with soft, yet heavy singing. A male voice casually interweaved the words, following the ridges on the old record. The phonograph had seen better days, but Remus would argue that it added to the experience.

  The boy himself laid on the bed near the window, with one leg hanging off the side, tapping the floor to the rhythm of the song. The music wasn't really made for tapping, but Remus relished the challenge. It distracted him from thinking --- about Hogwarts, parents, Marauders and thousands other things.
#+end_quote

While I took many more words to describe less details, I think that this version sets the mood much better than yours. It also avoids the death by thousand adjectives and other infodumps.

*** Thanks so much! Moving forward I'll keep this in mind. It really does add a layer of depth that seems to be there without really trying. Thanks a ton for taking time out of your day to read this. Cheers!
