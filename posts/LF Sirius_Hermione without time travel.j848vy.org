I've just stumbled upon 'Sirius' Sacrifice' by caughtinblackseyes linkffn(4891502) and now in the mood for some Sirimione without Hermione going back to marauders' time

Maybe Sirius didn't die in OoTP or he got back to live somehow. And it would be lovely if Sirius was in character -- meaning showing the signs of PTSD and his other mental problems and not just being a nice and helpful happy-go-lucky womanizer.

*** Honestly, this is pretty tame compared to even what ends up on the front page of even just HP FanFiction.
