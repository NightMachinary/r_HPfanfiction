** Muggleborns grow up to become tax-paying members of society, and we can assume that the proportion of muggleborns to magicalborn children usually stays stable. Like most taxes, you're usually not paying specifically for yourself, but for the generations above and below you. In the same way new migrants to the UK are automatically entitled to the NHS and education, despite not having paid into it before. The intention is that within time they'll become contributing members of society.

** First we'd have to know if the Ministry even collects taxes. Obviously it has to fund itself in some way, but they may have alternative revenue sources to taxation (e.g. cursebreakers).

** Is it? I never knew that.

If so, I'd suggest no, they'd continue paying their taxes as is, but the Ministry would claim the money from the muggle government.

Yeah, I didn't think so either for a long time. But there you have it.

Of course, we still see students having to buy supplies (robes, cauldrons, wand, books, etc) so it must just be things like teacher salary and room & board that are covered by the Ministry.

The redirection of muggle taxes is interesting. Maybe the MoM sets up a shell school in the muggle world and draws funding from the government for the enrolled Hogwarts students? It would have to be done with help from the muggle government or some frequent obliviating and watching for people snooping at the paper trail.

(Note: I respect JK's right and control over her stories, and I'll accept what she says is canon. But I hate learning about canon over a tweet. It's cheap and sad for an author to add things after the fact as they become topical. Even if it brings attention to a worthy cause. End rant.)

Wholeheartedly agree. I wish she had carried through with her original idea to publish an HP encyclopaedia instead of the never-ending Pottermore updates.

****** There's only references to having to pay for school items: books, robes, cauldrons, potions ingredients(?), etc. It's basically like a North American public school (no fees, must pay for other supplies; except you need your own books at Hogwarts), or a university with no tuition (like in Austria).

That sounds interesting and reasonable. I have no idea if the economics work.

I wonder how much muggleborns actually contribute to the economy?
