  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

*** Hermione wank where Neville is bashed is a better way to put it.

**** I wouldn't call it that. Neville is somewhat out of character from canon, but that was to be expected. No one is really bashed, and the whole point of the story makes sense when you get to the very end.

** In linkffn(to fight the coming darkness by jbern) Neville gets pretty dark, full blown school shooter and iirc he gets rapey too. He doesn't join the death eaters or any "evil" group since he believes himself one of the good guys, but he /is/ convinced to grow darker by exploiting his insecurities and his parents.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.
