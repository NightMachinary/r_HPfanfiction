Could be something like The Amulet of Time linkffn(844334), something like linkffa([[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=761]]), or something like that fic were Harry is the origin of magic and ends up as wolverine


** linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) sounds like it could work

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  Harry was abandoned by his parents at the Dursleys only for them to abandon him in New York a few years later. Luckily, Harry met a strange magician under circumstances only Harry could consider normal. How would the Marvel Universe and the Harry Potter world change now that he's being raised by Dr. Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme? Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived. Powerful Harry. Harry/harem.

** Other than Rakesh I have nothing to add, but I just wanted to mention that amulet of time was published in 2002, which would make it one of the oldest fic I've ever seen.

** linkffn(Basilisk Born) had Harry getting sent back a few millennia and he ends up essentially immortal until he gets back to the time he went back. Loads of him interacting with ancient people like Merlin, the four founders, the peverells, etc.

** In The Lone Traveller Series, on one of his stops he gives a Blood-Replenishing Potion to a injured cavewoman who was pregnant, and because he used the normal dosage instead of the modified one, the child gained magic. The narration indicates that that is the origin of all magical humans.
