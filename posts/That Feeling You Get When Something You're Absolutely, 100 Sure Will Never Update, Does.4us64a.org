** I saw and update on a story that had been dead for 18 months. Got excited and reread it because I didn't wan't to not get what was happening. Got to the update... and found that it was an announcement saying they will probably never finish the story.

Hopes and Dreams = Crushed

** Weird thing happened when I reread HP & the world that waits like 5 years ago. It had gone a year without updating, but almost as soon as I finished the last chapter, it got updated. But, I think I jinxed it because it hasn't been updated since.

*** Yes, I posted my effort without explicit permission from Doghead_Thirteen, as he had turned off private messaging on ffn. We exchanged a couple of messages on a yahoo group afterwards, and he posted all his notes with permission to use what I wished.

*** 65,000 words, you say?

/Cracks knuckles/

Challenge accepted.

Should it be about the former Slytherin class of '98 being exiled to an oil rig off Madagascar after the Battle of Hogwarts? The Golden Trio leaving the British Wizarding World? A 'rich!Harry' story that isn't riddled with cliches? A Sailor Moon/Doom/HP cross? Or an MGLN one with Starship Trooper vibes?
