Could a group of magical make a pact to help each other create a horcrux and then useing someone that has already been sentenced to death as the first kill to make the first Hocrux and then the wizard with the Hocrux lets the next wizard in the pact kill him to make a horcrux before being resurrected and then the wizards in the pact with horcrux take turns being killed to allow the rest of the group to make there horcrux? So one death could be used to allow an almost unlimited amount of Horcruxs


** I don't think you can cheat or use clever loopholes with this one. The act of murder tears the soul, but if you know that the person you murder isn't actually going to die, then I'm pretty sure it won't work.

Creating a Horcrux IS called one of the most evil things a wizard can do; if it was that easy to cheat your way into one, it would not have the huge stigma it does.

** You're missing the point of horcruxes entirely.

Horcruxes and other ritualistic dark magic are much more in the vein of other magic systems in which there is a cost for power. I would argue that the price of this kind of magic has as much (if not more) to do with the acts of sacrifice they entail as much as the physical components of the rituals. Think about the words spoken during Voldemort's reincarnation ritual: bone of the father, /unknowingly given/, flesh of the servant, /willingly sacrificed/, blood of the enemy, /forcibly taken/.

*** We don't have much background for the ritual, we don't know whether or how much the conditions matter. For instance, if Tom Riddle Sr. had been alive and Voldemort ground that bit of bone out of him while he fought it, could you just switch the words to "knowingly given"? We have no idea whether it'd make a difference.

*** I'm not sure that's how Horcruxes work. OP is obviously taking the whole thing a little too literally with his chain of Horcruxed victims, yes, but I don't know if the victim is really sacrificed in the ritual. It seems more to me that the Horcrux ritual is about committing the most soul-tearingly awful things a human being can do, so as to willingly maim your soul, allowing you to then cut the cracked bit apart and put it in the container. If there were another way to crack your soul, a murder wouldn't necessarily be required.

...But, going off what some of the others have suggested, I could see a dramatic version working too; a puppetmaster who doesn't want his pawns to be killed too easily, arranges for one of his less reliable minions to commit a murder and create a horcrux.

Then, imprisoning that minion, this puppetmaster goes through each of his more loyal pawns, teaching them the horcrux ritual and giving them his now-immortal slave to torture and murder in the process. Carefully remove both follower and slave's memories of horcruxes (and the latter's, hide the created horcrux someplace safe, then rinse and repeat with the next pawn until all of his followers are immortal (and only the puppetmaster knows why).

*** I was more thinking of a story were are the end of World War Two after Grindelwald is defeated a wizard summons the burning legion from world of Warcraft leading to the wizarding haveing an outside enemy for the magical world to unite against leading to a a world were Grindelwald is free because they need him to fight the legion.

In the story I imagen that just haveing a skilled wizard die is to great lose for world to take .

So the most skilled minds of the wizarding world like Grindelwald, Dumbeldore,Tom Riddle, Nicola's Flamel with a lot of other brilliant magicals use all the knowledge of the Creation method from the restricted section of the hogwarts and family library's like the black family library join together and revamp and perfect the horcrux creation method in a way that has never been done before.

so that when a wizard dies fighting against the legion the person that dies could be back on the battle field quickly.

I image the story to following a young Harry Potter after he has graduated hogwarts and joins the fight against the legion.

** From what I understand, it's the thoughtless act of killing someone that causes the soul to tear, making a pact would probably defeat that, thoughtlessly trying to kill someone who has a horcrux without making a pact would probably do the job though.

*** I don't think it's thoughtless, or maybe I'm not understanding the way you're using the word. In my mind, the perpetrator needs to very deliberately commit the murder---akin to premeditated murder vs manslaughter. If I purposely drive my car into the little old lady intending to kill her vs hitting her because I was distracted on my phone, for example. (Don't phone and drive, kids!)

** Resurrected how? I mean, Voldemorts resurrection ritual was more of a "I'm barely alive thanks to my horcruxes, but I need a better body". the point of horcruxes is that you DO NOT die. So not only can you not be killed by somebody else who wants to make a horcrux, nor can you be resurrected in order to make another one.

There is no magic know that can resurrect anyone who is truly murdered to death. One kill creates one horcrux, because one life has been lost beyond resurrection. No more, no less, no loopholes.

**** But other than that ritual, there is nothing in the HP world that comes close to resurrection. It's simply not possible. Once your victim is truly dead, there is no true coming back. Even the resurrection stone didn't do that.\\
So there's a crucial part in your feedback loop of infinite horcruxes that simply cannot work.

****** A new body, yes, but he was stil half alive, drinking unicorn blood ans skipping from body to body. Between the first and fourth book he got himself a babylike body by other means, maybe even the same body he had in the "Kings Cross station" where Harry met dead Dumbledore again. Maybe that's his true shape after enduring two deaths but being kept alive by horcruxes.

But all attempts at resurrection that he did were attempts at regaining power, not at regaining life. So at no point someone could've dropped baby-voldie out of a window and gotten a horcrux out of it, after which he resurrected voldemort by whichever means, because:\\
1: horcruxes keep voldemort alive, though in a humiliating and suffering state. He never died, so no new horcrux can be made. 2: death is final in HP world. If Voldemort DID die, his horcruxes apparently didn't work, and no attempt at resurrection could've helped him or any other ally at creaing another horcrux beyond the one created from his death.

One life can only give one horcrux, and there are no loopholes here. You are either alive, even when you are kept on earth as a collection of shards of souls in a weird bunch of trinkets hidden all over England; or you are very much dead, which means your murderer might make his horcrux out of you, but then you are lost beyond resurrection.

** That probably wouldn't work, because as someone else already mentioned, it's not so much the actual murder itself as the murderous intent that tears apart the soul. If you're killing for a generous motive, your soul won't tear, because you'll feel as though you're entirely in the right.

Of course, that's all just to disprove /your/ thing. I don't find it entirely implausible that a Horcrux made from Harry's death in the Forbidden Forest would stay "valid" even after Harry comes back through his Mother's-Blood-Deathly-Hallows mumbo-jumbo.

** I'd guess that it requires destroying the victim's soul, similar to how the diary coming back to life required effectively destroying and consuming Ginny Weasley's soul.

The obvious next question is, are there any creatures that we don't mind farming that have enough soul to power the horcrux ritual? Can we substitute multiple creatures with a bit of soul each for one creature with a lot of soul? Can we use a bucket full of flobberworms in place of a human when creating a horcrux? Can we shield people from deleterious mental effects of the ritual and the splitting of their soul? And what happens when everyone has a horcrux?

*** I Expect it would be a bit of a feedback loop if some lowered the cost of the ritual to a large animal sacrifice then more people would look at the ritual leading to more improvements of the ritual with the negative side effects and sacrifice needed for the ritual getting smaller as the ritual got more social acceptable because more people would be trying to make it better t leading to the ritual being acceptable to more people's until eventually all negative side effects of the ritual are completely gone and you only need to sacrifice a rat to make a Hocrux.

As for the effects of all magicals being able to make a Hocrux it would probably lead to more magic experimentation like what led to Lunas mothers death because if you die in a magical accident you are just brought back.so magical reasearchers could take bigger risks.

Considering how small the magical population is it wouldn't cause many problems.

** No magic can truly bring back the dead.

- Since raising the dead is impossible in canon, what you're suggesting wouldn't work anyway

- Even if you pretend that truly rasing the dead is possible, it still wouldn't work. I think you're suggesting that the person who already has the horcrux would let himself be killed so another can make one. But the point of having a horcrux is that you can't be killed. The person would probably just experience what Voldemort did; find himself with a dead body, but staying around as a spirit because his horcrux anchors him to the world of the living. He wouldn't really die.

- And lastly, Rowling refused to say explecitly what's involved in creating a horcrux, since it was apparantly too horrifying. But it sounded like there's a lot more involved that simply killing a person and using a spell to transfer a piece of soul into an object. I have a feeling that the corpse of the victim doesn't make stay in one piece.
