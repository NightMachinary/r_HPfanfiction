Hi everyone!

I was rereading the fics in my downloads when I came across [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1124764/1/Web-of-Lies][Web of Lies by Star Polaris]], where HP is disguised as Dumbledore's young grandson.

Does anyone know any fics which are similar to this one?


** It depends of your meaning of similar. If we go with the main theme (hidden in plain sight), I read a few fics through the years.

The only one I could find in a decent time is linkffn(3995826)

The fic you mentionned is something of a prequel to linkffn(579544) which uses another trope (marauder-era time travel). There are some continuity issues between the two.

  AU What if Harry knew he was a wizard and about the prophecy before he went to Hogwarts? What if he was kicked out of the Dursleys and decided to attend Hogwarts disguised as a muggleborn? Harry Ginny
