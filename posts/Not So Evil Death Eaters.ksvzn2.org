I'm looking for some stories where the Death Eaters (or maybe just the Slytherins at Hogwarts) aren't all blood purist fanatics, but actually have some reasonable goals and/or are greatly misunderstood by the wizarding public.


** I am ok with them being pureblood enthusiastic but less cartoonishly evil south be nice

*** Sure, i suppose i meant more gray area in the beliefs. I just don't real like the one-note nazi or kkk type death eaters that often.

** You'll find this idea to be very much prevalent in the Albus Dumbledore Bashing tag-section of AO3 (and perhaps in similar fics on FFnet as well, though they don't use tags there).

Seriously, just filter fics by that tag and you're very likely to come across a pro-Dark (often with HarryMort, Tomarry, Snarry, or Drarry ship) kind of fic.

** For reference, I really enjoy the portrayal of one or both of those groups in The Green Girl by Colubrina, and the Sarcasm and Slytherin Series. (Sorry I didn't link them, I'm a little confused on how that works)
