Any fic in which either the ol' Canuckle head is a teacher at Hogwarts, a member of the Order, or any fic in which Harry has the powers of Wolverine: With the claws and the healing and whatnot. Preferably sans the memory problems and advanced age, but I already think the results are gonna be few and far between already, so I'll take what I can get.

I also wouldn't mind any fics that take the basic premise of a Wolverine/X-Men story arc and apply it to Harry Potter. Examples include: Enemy of the State (Wolvie gets brainwashed to be a bad guy and almost brings down the entirety of SHIELD) and Days Of Future Past (If you don't know the premise of this, I have no words, but I'll tell you anyway; mutants are hunted by sentinels so they send someone---in the comics it's Kitty Pryde, the movies it's Logan---back in time to the present/past to fix it.

Any of these would be great. Thanks in advance!


** Not the main character, but he does mentor Harry.
