** I don't know anything about the CW Flash, so I wouldn't know how to set up this kind of story.

At the very least, it'd have to be adult Draco post-canon; I can't see a pro-Death-Eater young Draco Malfoy hanging around with a muggle superhero...

You've got me wondering something different, now, though.

What if Harry Potter met Ignatius Perrish? The one with the magic horns who attracts snakes and causes people to spill their secrets?

** I would take a shot... but most of my writing is sub-par at best and i hardly get time to write so everything is a WIP...

** no, because they are two different characters with different ideals and would act different from each other. It's also incredibly hard to write Draco as a protagonist without making him OOC.

The only connection or similarity the two characters have is they are played by the same actor, which leads to drawing connections between them.

***** Honestly, at this point in fanfiction assigning one character a personality is useless.

****** That's fair, but then what's the point in wanting to see a character in a situation, to see how they adapt and react, if they are out of character.

******* If you write a good story, it will /seem/ as though they are in character.

*** The way Julian was mad at Barry for getting away with breaking the rules because he was the "golden boy" (not sure if that was the actual words but at least something similar was said) also seems to work quite well with Draco Malfoy. Running to an authority figure to try and get a colleague into trouble for rule breaking? If that's not something that fits well with Malfoy character wise, what does? He was good at potions and that could be seen as being kind of similar to forensic sciences. We don't know Julian that well yet but I think they actually intentionally played with similarities to Malfoy because it's pretty funny.
