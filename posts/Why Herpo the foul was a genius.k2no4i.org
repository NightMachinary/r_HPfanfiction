One day I was thinking why a chicken egg hatched on a toad would produce a basilisk but then I remembered something dinosaurs I remember hearing that chickens have dinosaurs as ancestors somewhere anyways herpo figured this out and developed a way to bring out that dinosaur dna and manipulate it into a snake thousands of years before Muggles even thought of the theory of dna

***** No, not enough rambling about random stuff. I can mostly understand this, but I can't make heads or tails of Faulkner most of the time.

I think they just can't grammar.

** If you want something else that's nuts, look at the animagus process. Do you think its some long process of meditation and transfiguring yourself? Hell no! You make a potion, do a ritual and get lucky enough to have a thunderstorm before the potion goes bad.

How the bloody hell did the person who invented that ritual even discover that?

EXACTLY!

******* Yeah, but it makes the whole "Wow they were geniuses to do it by their fifth year" seem like a load of horseshit doesn't it? None of that seems to require any skill whatsoever. It's a bunch of hard to find ingredients mixed with an annoying, time consuming process.

******** And the RNG of a thunderstorm happening before the potion goes bad.

I'm of the opinion now that this whole schtick was invented because the African magical school (that specializes in the animagus process) is located near the place that has the most thunderstorms in the world: Lake Victoria. It's like... 240 days of the year are thunderstorms?

On the other hand, this whole process breaks canon. If the process is this easy, there would be more than... 7? people on the registry list and closer to a couple dozen or so. then you add even more illegal animaguses. Animagusi?
