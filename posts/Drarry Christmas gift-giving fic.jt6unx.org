:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have been trying to find a fic I read that was set after the war when Harry returns for his final year at Hogwarts. I believe it was a 12 days of Christmas thing where he secretly sent Draco gifts each day. I remember one gift was a special potion stirring rod that Draco then used to make cinnamon candies. Anybody know what fanfic this is?
