I don't remember all too much but it was on Ao3, I know the giant squid came in at the end bc someone taught it how to play music (?) Snape had like a fluffy pet that wouldn't stop following him around and there was a chapter where they all made cakes. I hope people know what I mean ahaha


** I think this is The Wizarding Times by Icewolf2190 on ao3
