** That dragon is MASSIVE. It makes the image I have always had in my mind for the first task look actually like a reasonable challenge for children in comparison.

*** I like the idea that this is a nightmarish perspective of the Task that represents how Harry must've felt facing the Horntail. It's not actually that big, but for a 14 year old boy? It would've seemed larger to him then anything he could've imagined, the poor bugger.

**** Fourteen or not, it's basically impossible to portray how big a large animal /feels/ in person. What you see in a picture, or the description you read, is nothing compared to standing close to a large beastie in person. The canon horntail would seem so much larger and scarier in reality.

*** Totally makes it believable that it'd take several trained wizards to subdue though doesn't it?

**** Nope that makes it believable that a country worth of wizards working together could maybe kill one

**** Not really, but in the opposite direction. Most wizards honestly aren't really any good at magic, or so it seems. I'd imagine a dragon this size requiring a dozen or more Dumbledores to deal with, or a veritable army of regular trained wizards.

** - + massive dragon
- + Hufflepuff colors in crowd
- - weird doomsday background color/clouds (looks like three meteors hitting)
- - tattered flags

*** LOL. Perhaps, but it'd be an interesting spin to put on things for a fan fic don't you think. You thought facing the horntail was insanity as it was.

** Awesome.

I'd imagine Harry would have more than a bit of trouble carrying a piece of gold the size of this behemoth's eggs.

*** Kinda, but on the other hand, isn't fanart just another reflection of fanfiction?

**** I like to think so. Also, plenty of people draw inspiration from art.
