*Let's talk about this story: opinions, stories, parts you liked, parts you didn't like.*

Personally loved it. It's been a wild ride; I joined about halfway through the story. Read everything that had been put out in a couple of bus trips on the way to school, and got quite confused at /what the heck was happening with Moody./ I think I read that part while getting distracted by other stuff so it didn't really get through my head. I kept getting "Story Updated" notifications from my FFN app so I was like 'why not' and went and kept reading it, after ignoring them for a few weeks. Was honestly shocked at the quality of writing, I didn't remember it was so good.

Adrian's insanity and illness was so well written and it was a joy to read. I try so hard to hate Skylar but the way the author writes, there is no bashing and every character has faults and virtues. These last few chapters have been a rollercoaster, with Adrian coming back via Resurrection Stone, I want to say I'm excited for the end but also /I never want it to end./ This is my first time following a fic all the way to completion and /I don't want it to stop never stop I want more!!!!!!!/


** The next chapter posted will be a double chapter with a shortened epilogue added in as well! There may be other smaller things posted later on before the next big work starts up, but it's certainly been one absolutely crazy ride!!

**** In the most recent chapter he came back via the stone, so it looks like he's now in the land of the living! Not sure how long he's going to last, but at least he gets to insult Skylar for a bit before things go downhill again!

***** Sooooo looking forward to reading that conversation!! I really don't want him to be stuck with fake Luna. He really wasn't happy there. After everything, Adrian deserves to be happy ^^

** I appreciate it for how they portrayed Harry and Skylar living together with the Potters in the early chapters. So many Potter twins stories feature the Potters abusing/ heavily neglecting Harry just because the other twin is BWL. There is still some negligence in Anthithesis but in a believable amount.

****** I'm super super happy you liked it!! It was a Horcrux thing! It's so strange now to think that it's over, it's been going for such a long time. Thank you!!! I think I'm going to try a more psychological thriller approach next time and do less body horror and poetry!

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
