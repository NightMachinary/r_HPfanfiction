:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a specific fic about Neville's 7th year at hogwarts. He restarts dumbledores army, but I specifically remember mentions of magic from other cultures, like Seamus teaching Irish magic and the Patils Indian, and so on. Its quite long, a lot of secondary characters like Romilda, Susan, Ernie are involved. It's so good that I forget it isn't canon.


** I believe it's called Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness. Seems like it's been deleted off the major sites with the author getting into some form of drama
