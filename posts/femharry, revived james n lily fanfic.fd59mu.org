HELP ME FIND THIS HARRY POTTER FANFIC. i remember one scene and other pretty vague details, such as how it was unfinished last time i read it, had 27(?) chapters, the name of the protagonist was something like charlotte? but they didn't like their long name and corrected people telling them to call them charlie(?), the scene where they find out their parents came back to life is set in dumbedore's office im pretty sure. i've been trying to find it for a year now. its making me go insane. please help.
