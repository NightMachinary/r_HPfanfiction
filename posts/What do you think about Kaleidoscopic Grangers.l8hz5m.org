It's still unfinished and I'm only 35 chapters in. I know some stories are really good bu then towards the end it just messes it up. Kinda like the victim blaming in A Marauders Plan.

Should I continue the story. Or is there a point where I should just drop it.

For context it's a Blind, trans Harry who is adopted by the Grangers


** I haven't read it but if you feel like you don't like it anymore, I'd suggest you don't read it. Fanfic reading should be a relaxation and not a chore. I discovered this the hard way after struggling for months to read some of the more popular yet really long fics set in this universe (Prince of the Dark Kingdom, Prince of Slytherin, Basilisk Born, HPMOR and other similar stories), only to realize I have already forgotten part of the plot.
