** linkffn(Exile by bennybear) Draco is sentenced to be without magic for a period of time after the war. He runs away from the malfoy mannor to the muggle world. Interesting perspective of a wizard trying to understand the muggle world.

linkffn(The Malfoy Case by natida) Draco/Astoria fic that focuses on Draco's trial after the war. Really good portrayal of the court system and the trial.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

** I honestly don't read a lot with Draco featured prominently so these might be the worst Dracos in the fandom but i enjoyed them.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5378440/1/The_Potions_Masters_Nephew]]) Snape gets de aged in a potion accident, A lot of the fic is about the friendship between Draco, Ginny, and Snape.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4923158/1/3-Slytherin-Marauders]]) I'm pretty sure features Draco prominently. It is to quote myself

#+begin_quote
  a long(582,712 words!) and Interesting fanfic featuring dragon worldbuilding, magical Dudley Dursley, a brother like relationship between Dudley, Harry, and Tom R, Lucius Malfoy falling for a muggle, and a grudging respect between Lucius and Arthur Weasley.
#+end_quote

Draco in Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]]) and its sequels is an interesting character, as Snape and Narcissa manipulate him into being a light-aligned gryffindor. His inner turmoil as he struggles between his old self and what he is becoming is Intriguing.

** I second The Malfoy Case, probably my favorite Drastoria

I just finished the first half of linkao3(The Sacred 28 by kcthekat) and really liked Draco's characterization, I think its about 70% from Ginny's POV (who has excellent characterization as well) but in this one Draco is still an outright coward and admits he's just doing what he's told but he has good development over the length of the fic

** I don't like Draco centric fics myself, so my recommendations are where Draco is more of a side character than anything else.

One of my favourite good Draco characterisations is from Linkffn(Our Mercurial Selves). This is an AU fic where Lucius and Narcissa are forced to adopt Hermione as a baby. This causes Draco to grow up very family focused, but unlike canon in a health way. I enjoyed this Draco thoroughly since we see the reasons for the differences and he's actually a likeable character.

Another fic where I really like the characterisation of Draco is in LinkAO3(From Ruin). This is a fic where Draco is siding with Harry, but the author doesn't try to make excuses for him. In a lot of fics Draco gets away a little easily in my opinion, but in this fic Draco is scum but due to circumstances Harry needs to use him.

** Another recommendation for The Malfoy Case, The Sacred 28, and Exile. The first is one of my all time favorites but the other two are also great. I'd also recommend:

linkao3(5344298) The Dragon and the Moon by aTasteofCaramell is an eighth-year Draco/Luna fanfic with a refreshingly unromanticized Draco. He's realistically impacted by the war and loves his family but is still pretty awful to start with and has some great development.

linkao3(877946) Certain Dark Things by coffeehigh is another great post-war Draco/Astoria with an emphasis on Draco's character arc.

linkao3(2639639) On a lighter note, Slytherin Squad by HalfBloodDragon is just... fun. It's post-war Draco/Ginny and considerably less serious than the above, while still having some enjoyable character beats.

linkao3(927466) Within These Walls by sara_holmes is a Draco/Seamus fic taking place during the seventh book. It's a good take on a rare pair and keeps Draco a compelling coward.

I'm not a huge Drarry fan but I've read a little here and there. fourth_rose and lettered are both good starts for decently characterized Draco, from what I've seen.

Only this time he is entirely on his own.----In which Draco is an angsty prat, the family feels are strong, the politics are complicated, and Luna Lovegood is basically an angel.
