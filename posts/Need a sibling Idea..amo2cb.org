Writing a new fanfic and I have Harry as a sibling/twin/etc. and I can't decide if he has a brother, sister or both.

It's literally stonewalling my fic idea rn.

Basics of the fic. Harry Potter with things from The Gamer manwha but NOT Gamer Harry. -has The Abyss and things like that but no Jeehan, too early in the timeline.

Was left at the Dursley's by Albus doing something shady to the Potters (specifics tbd)

Someone from the abyss found the protections and broke in, captured the fam and Harry, used them as resources and experimented on Harry.

Harry broke free and is about to start his first year at Hogwarts about to get on the train.

Ideas??


** I have no idea what "The Gamer" is, and don't really have a good idea of what your concept is. You're a bit all over the place with your post there.

In general I can just say that I dislike it when the Potter siblings don't get along well. I hate it when James and Lily play blatant favorites to the point of neglect (the worst trope of the Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived genre).

*** The underlying premise is that neither James or Lily know about Harry being their son. He currently has no last name after being removed from the family.

If you don't know what ‘The gamer' is then don't worry about it and I would recommend looking it up. It's a pretty good webcomic to read.

**** So then how does Harry come to care for, or even interact with his sibling(s)?

If he is just one more Hogwarts student, and the sibling is just one more Hogwarts student, what is the driving factor that brings those two together to interact?

How will Harry find out about his family? How will it be revealed that Student X is his sibling?

What, in general, is the overarching conflict anyway?

***** Haven't decided the whole plot yet.

He knows exactly who he is, the child of Lily and James Potter. He knows that he has an older sibling The (boy/girl) who lived.

At the moment he treats them, in my mind as they have yet to meet, with cold indifference.

He doesn't truly care if they talk to him or not, but he knows that there are bigger things in the world than his family situation (after getting away from the person that has been experimenting on him for years)

Though he treats his sibling/s with indifference he hates Lily and James.

As far as he knows they both abandoned him which resulted in him being experimented on, so it's ultimately their fault.

He knows that Voldemort is still around (or he will at least) and that he is the real target of the prophecy. He uses all his resources, both from Hogwarts and other places to his advantage.

****** And if I extrapolate that, he'll also never consider asking them, or letting them explain what happened. He is perfectly comfortable wallowing in his hate, and I'd also wager that you'll write it as if thats something the reader should understand.

This sounds like one hell of an angsty fic.

I appreciate honest feedback, so I'll do that here too. Disclaimer, of course, is that you have yet to explain any of the Whys, the Hows,... anything, really. I can't judge what isn't there. However, the way this feels right now is like Harry's family is only in this fic to produce more angst. It painfully reminds me of the many, many fics that did this only to have Harry walk away the victor from some utterly useless screaming match in which each and every one of the participants seems utterly incapable of empathy. He hates his parents. He is indifferent towards his siblings. Why have them in there then? Harry has plenty of people to hate. Harry has armies worth of people he is indifferent about.

A conflict that can be resolved by Harry asking "Why?" feels superficial. If Harry asks "Why did you abandon me?" and they answer, "We didn't, who are you? We don't have a son named Harry." then any intelligent character would think there is something fishy about this. If Harry follows the answer up with a woe-is-me attitude, retreating back into his hate without any change to his person, then we're in the usual Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived circlejerk of angst that denies the protagonist any character development.

I mean, you even admit yourself that his family situation is only a thing on the sidelines.

He doesn't care. There are more important things.

Why have them in there then? Why bother?

******* I will freely admit you have already given me things to think about for this fic.\\
Mostly the interaction.

It may not be hate between Harry and his parents but i don't honestly know rn.

​

There will be a "revelation" so to speak of who he really is to everyone, planned for fourth year currently as he will be chosen by the goblet instead of the supposed "BWL as stated by Dumbledore' of course this will lead to some revelations of his past and many of the strange things that have happened over the years within the fic being answered.

I'm hoping that i'll be able to avoid the cliche 'Why?'

He won't care if they talk to him, but as i stated before in another comment i was thinking of having Harry look out for his, it was younger sister in the comment, sibling from a distance. So that may change in the fic.

Truthfully without describing everything and having all the background info explained it's kinda hard to explain everything, But just from this conversation i can say that it'll be a better fic after going back and looking over a few things with the things here.

​

For siblings i'll probably go for a brother and a sister a year younger.

This I just don't get. What happened to him to make him so utterly cold, and why is it that he cares for his sister, but not his brother and parents?

Imagining this, I come to the conclusion that you can either have a Harry who cares for all of them, or a Harry who cares for none of them. Both of these Harry's are completely different characters.

Maybe this would be cleared up if you'd explain what actually happened to him to make him so. Right now he sounds emotionally dead and that rarely (Í'd say /never/) makes for a good protagonist. If there is no emotion, there is no empathy. Why should I care for the fate of a machine?

*** I was leaning for a sister, though perhaps as a younger sibling, and having it more as a guardian angel sort of thing.

Protecting her without revealing who he is and keeping it a secret from her.
