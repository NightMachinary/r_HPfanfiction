  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Maybe he now actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well...

I'm in chapter 10 and it's basically just a Dumbledore bashing fic right now. The author also has some extremely wrong views on his power levels lol

**** NoFP is still being written. Matthew (the author) had health complications that left him needing tons of physical therapy. His writing speed was, for obvious reasons, severely compromised, but I think he's improving and is a lot better now according to his FB page.

NoFP was deleted from FF due to being flagged for song lyrics, which is stupid because NoFP never had any song lyrics (except for the Sorting Hat IIRC).

As of right now I think his Patreon is the main way to access it? Or you can try [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry_potter_and_the_nightmares_of_futures_past/index/][here]]?

**** I have yet to see the series in full but I love the Harry Potter and Stargate/SG: Atlantis crossovers. So refreshing at times. Sure they usually consist of Harry finding advanced ancient technology and exploring the galaxy, rebuilding old alliances and making new friends while fighting a common enemy. Most have Harry popping into Stargate Command and playing the odd prank or helping in various ways (usually humorous). And some have Harry rebuilding a society on another planet while continuously being Fates punching bag.

I read one recently (can't recall title, alas) where Harry falls through the Veil instead of Sirius, and ironically winds up on a planet circling the star Sirius. A couple years later (after battling Guaould and Jaffra) he's rescued by SG1 and returned to Earth, where he proceeds to smash up the usual Harry Potter continuity. It was fun.

** Not a do over, but I remember an extremely interesting one where Harry's transported back in time to the first wizarding war, into the death eater headquarters. He manages to stay alive by becoming a death eater, but Voldy instantly knows somethings off and interrogates Harry. Harry is forced to tell voldy that he was from the future, and was the child of james and lily, but didn't have the best childhood (And brings up images of the cupdoard while looking into his eyes), tricking voldy into beleiving that James wasn't a good parent.

​

Anyways, Harry is tricked into taking an modified dark vow that makes it so that he's physically incapable of telling his true origins to anyone. Poof, there goes his plans to fix things. Then, on a mission, he calls out to dumbledore, and the death eaters instantly know he's a traitor. He gets captured, Sirius interrogates him with HATE, and things go downhill from there ( Because Harry can't explain a thing)

  Then Harry's mouth went completely dry.  His captor struck a tall, imposing figure, black locks neatly framing his aristocratic cheekbones. The relaxed line of his mouth did nothing to soften the furious, slightly maniacal glint in his cool gray eyes, fixed unwaveringly upon him. “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.” *Harry and Teddy accidentally time travel to 1979, where they are immediately captured by Voldemort at his prime. After months of posing as a loyal Death Eater to protect Teddy, Harry is then captured by the Order. Misunderstandings ensue.

  When Harry offered himself up to Voldemort, he discovered the people in the Ministry of Death are not happy with him at all. To make up for his years of blunders, Harry is sent back in time to correct everything that went wrong and to get some revenge. Harry/6 girls, Bashing of Dumbledore, Snape, and certain Weasleys. Written for humor only. Lots of cliches. Reviews welcome.

  When Lord Voldemort attempts to kill baby Harry Potter, Magic decides that "this won't do" and thus creates a bond between the two. Voldemort's body is still destroyed by his Avada Kadavra, Harry is still raised by the Dursleys. The only change is that Neville becomes part of his group. At least that's how it goes, until Fourth year, and Harry is entered in the Triwizard Tournament. Harry is exposed to Voldemort, gives in to the bond, and helps him regain a body.Now, with a bond that needs them to be close to each other for some time before it settles, Harry has to come to terms with his actions. Mix this in with Voldemort not really being Voldemort but rather Tom Riddle, past lives, potion Masters being a pain in the ass, the Ministry not Understanding Anything and a budding romance between the Boy-Who-Lived and one Dark Lord, and Harry's pretty sure his Fifth Year and Hogwarts will be interesting.

  Turns out Harry's got a bit of an exhibitionism kink. Unfortunately (for someone), Voldemort's both happy to play along, and has plenty of servants to serve as an audience.

  "Who are we killing today?" Voldemort asked from just inside the doorway; Harry might look terrifying covered in flour, but Voldemort did not.

  When Hermione and Ron finally go to save Harry, after the war has ended and Voldemort has won, they unwittingly get caught themselves. The situation in which they meet Harry again, is not one they expect at all.

  Harry's never had someone smile so nicely at him before. There's always a look of disdain or disgust, or maybe something in between the two whenever the adults in his life look at him. The stranger doesn't do any of that, only smiles, then asks if Harry wants a better life. Harry, who's only known his cold tiny cupboard, who barely knows what a full meal is like. Harry, who's been told to never trust strangers---but this man can't be a stranger, he knows Harry's name. The stranger asks if Harry wants a better life, and who can fault a little boy for saying yes? Lily and James Potter die, but their son doesn't become fate's latest casualty.A story of reprieve.

  Severus Snape's loyalty has always been to Harry, not to Dumbledore or the Order. When he finds out that Harry is a horcrux and Dumbledore intends to have him killed, Severus goes to the Dark Lord with the information in an effort to save Harry's life, and in doing so changes the fate of the world.
