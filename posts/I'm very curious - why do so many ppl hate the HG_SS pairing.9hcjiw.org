There's tons of pairings with big age differences, not just Snamione but I feel like they get a LOT of flack on this subreddit - how come?

(I'm genuinely curious, please don't just call me names.)


** Going to list a few, but certainly not an exhaustive list of reasons:

- Student teacher relationships are almost never healthy, especially when the student is not an adult. The power dynamics at play make it hard for it to be a true partnership and when the formative years of the relationship were when the student was a minor, that's textbook grooming.

- Snape was a real dick in canon, but especially to the trio, among them Hermione. It takes a LOT of handwaving or straight up ignoring of canon to somehow twist that into a healthy relationship.

- From what I've heard, it used to be much more popular, especially in the 'oughts when the last few books were coming out. People may be sick of it because it's so overdone or all the new works featuring it are just pale imitations.

Personally, I just get frustrated by most stories that are focused around a specific pairing, so with the above reasons and that reason, I automatically filter out anything classified as SS/HG.

Let's not whitewash this. Snape was an abusive shit in canon. Funnily enough, I don't have a problem with how his classes were set up, just in his behavior.

**** Snape was never a good person and I don't understand why so many people are getting that wrong. Yes, he was trying to protect Harry, but only because he was obsessively in love with his mother. He joined the death eaters out of free will before the events of Halloween 1981 and was an abusive, cruel prick to a lot of his students. I would have semi-understood if he'd disliked Harry, considering he's the result of the love of his life marrying the guy who made his life at school hell, but he was cruel to Hermione, Ron, Neville and many, many others as well.

*** Never understood cannon where Harry just up and forgives Snape for 6 years of Harassment just because he gives a little help at the end(which he complicated the help even, I.e leaving the sword in the frozen water like why?) I'm sure there's a deeper meaning JK wanted to convey but I didn't catch it.

**** We only really get a couple of views of this though, right? Immediately after the battle (when I imagine he's totally drained of emotion and would find it hard to hate anyone) and the epilogue 10+ years later, where we know he named Albus after him.

There's a lot of space for complicated feelings about Snape in that time period. My headcanon has always been that he didn't forgive Snape, but came to understand who he was and why he was the way he was and made peace with the memory of Snape. But I imagine in between those times there was a lot of well deserved venting about how Snape was a dick, even if he sacrificed himself.

***** I suppose you're right I myself just can't see myself naming one of my kids after someone like that, even though you're right there is a lot of time between where Harry presumably comes to forget the bad and remember the good a kinda time heals all wounds sorta thing. Never really thought about the time between the battle and the epilogue which is when I was really basing my opinion.

** For me it's an age thing, and it's a teacher-student thing, and it's a Snape is a terrible person thing. I don't really like draco-hermione either, because they were both /so/ cruel to her, and they both hate who she is , hate who she is enough to become a death eater. Snape loved Lily, also a "mudblood" but hated who she was more than he loved her. There's no redeeming that, especially with the vivim of both Snape and draco's incessant bullying and cruelty. As someone who was bullied as a kid, you don't really look at that bully in a good light when you're older. That amount of cruelty does damage and it just doesn't seem plausible that someone like Hermione would ignore that history and get involved with either of them, especially when she can have pretty much anyone in the world, many of whom have been nothing but kind to her. I don't really "get" her with Ron, either, but that's more plausie than forgetting what Snape and/or Draco put her, and other muggleborns through and falling in love with them.

Honestly, any pairing with Snape is enough to make me nope out- he's a miserable bastard and I can't see him ever being happy with /anyone/.

** There are so many reasons why I hate that pairing, but since I'm at work, here are just a few:

1) Snape was her teacher. There's rarely a situation where that relationship dynamic can be healthy (especially when her character was so young when he was a teacher).

2) Snape was a bully. He terrified Neville to the point where Neville's worst fear was Snape. Not Bellatrix who had tortured his parents. Not Voldemort. But Snape. I understand that this is about Snape/Hermione pairings, but it speaks to his character. While I have my own personal issues with a Hermione/Ron pairing, I find it to be unfathomable that Hermione would end up with Snape.

3) Snape was a Death Eater. While he may have repented later, he was, in fact, a Death Eater. Of his own will. And from what we're given, the only reason he wasn't still a Death Eater was because Voldemort went after Lily. Not because he realized it was a toxic and horrible ideology, but because it was going to impact the woman he loved. Hermione appears to be a forgiving person (look at her relationships with the other two Golden Trio over the years) but I find it difficult to believe that she would be able to get past that. This is also a big reason why I struggle with Hermione/Draco pairing fics.

I don't necessarily mind big age gaps. While I can't personally see myself in that type of relationship, I know that they can work and be good relationships. I just find Snape's character too toxic and the teacher/student dynamic too problematic to be able to read any of those fics.

** Probably because Snape's not exactly any kind of ideal love interest. Grumpy, greasy, snarky git. He's not well liked as a character on this subreddit.

More specifically to Hermione, he was a dick to her as a teacher, and not everyone thinks he really gave up his anti-Muggle attitudes, and others think he's too obsessed with Lily to ever fall for someone else.

I ship it myself, but I can see why people don't like it, and it's certainly a difficult pairing to make plausible, which IMO makes it all the more fun to ship.

*** I think Snape is a well liked character on this subreddit, but I also think there are a lot of us who are just tired of seeing stories that either whitewash his actions, ignore his actions, or even ignore his personality and replace it with one someone could actually fall for.

That's my issue with Snape, I've never seen a fix that has a romance that doesn't either take him or his love interest completely out of character to make the romance work. If you can't get your characters to fall for each other without breaking the character from who they were, then I don't find the ships unplausible, but completely unrealistic.

Of course we all have the built in defense that it's personal taste, so in reality this was all a waste of time to type.

** Well, student-teacher relationships are already extremely problematic: the "ew" factor is valid since Hermione is a minor and way younger so it's weird too, he didn't exactly repudiate his anti-Muggle views (his assisting the Order and sacrificing himself was, according to JKR, to assuage his guilt for his one love and because Lily held those ideals which the DEs repudiated), and his was just generally unkind to even completely sympathetic and out-of-the-way characters like Neville. Hermione had plenty of faults, but her vast differences with Snape make it nearly impossible to seem realistic if they're anything like canon.

​

Also, Snape's not well liked here so it might just be a local thing. I personally don't care for Snape so that's my reason.

** u/Hellstrike:
#+begin_quote
  Age difference
#+end_quote

The issue is not the age difference, or even the imbalance of power due to the "teacher-student" thing. If you want to break it down to the simplest terms, Snape is someone who voluntarily joined Voldemort's Brownshirts. He had a dark arts boner even during his Hogwarts days. He had no issues with Death Eaters as friends. Shipping him with a muggleborn or Harry is on the same level of wrong as Heinrich Himmler/Anne Frank.

And before anyone objects with him changing his ways, there is no redemption for the countless war crimes any Death Eater commits by the virtue of being an illegal combatant who targets civilians. A good deed does not wash away a bad one.

** 1. The age difference. I'm not a big fan of couples with an age gap so big that person A could be person b's parent. However, I could still forgive them if they are both adults, Which is not the case of SS/HG, since he died when she was barely an adult, so she is a minor for most of their interactions.
2. Snape despise muggleborns and joined the death eaters, it's like shipping a Nazi and a Jew. For the very same reason I dislike Snily and Dramione.
3. He bullied her, even thought he was a teacher and she was a student. Which makes it even worse than Draco calling her names.
4. There are way too many fics about them for such a cringe worthy couple, so I kinda get tired of seeing so much of them.
