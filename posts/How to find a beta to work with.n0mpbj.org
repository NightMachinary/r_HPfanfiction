I am asking how does everyone find their beta's for writing, I use FFN and have sent a few PMs/request to beta's on there but no response. Besides using the method provide is there another way you have found that works?

Sorry if I used the wrong Flair


** Just mention that you want a beta in the AN and someone might PM you. It can take some time. If tou PM random people yourself you will only annoy them. You will probably find better help on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]].

*** There is also a weekly beta bartering thread on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] and people are pretty good there.

** I've found betas thru discord servers as well as Facebook (there's a Harry Potter fanfic alphas/betas finder group).

My understanding is the ffn beta database is pretty out of date.

Good luck! Finding a first beta is really difficult but it does get easier.
