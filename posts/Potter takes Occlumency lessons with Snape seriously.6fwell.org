Canon Potter didn't try so hard as he wanted to know at least something about Voldemort

But what if he would? Do you know fics where he really tries very hard on them? And preferably Snape is impressed with his efforts?

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** What? Snape's was a terrible teacher that gave Harry no instruction prior to attacking his mind during the lessons.

**** Regardless of the method, Snape created a pretty acidic learning environment, no encouragement, and no help. There was no discussion about improving, etc. Regardless of the content and the necessary method, there were many things Snape could have done. JK has also said that Harry never truly masters Occlumency, even in the future

***** this is true, i dont like snape either, however harry also should have atleast picked up a book on occlumency if he thought snape was that bad, and also if you look at it that is snape's teaching style, In potions and DADA he does the same thing, no instruction, acidic learning environment, no encouragement. Snape is just a bad teacher overall.

**** When you learn to fight, your teacher doesn't beat you half to death every lesson until you learn to defend yourself without giving you any technical training.\\
Besides, choosing a teacher the student doesn't trust and is hated by to teach a skill for which the training involves to read the mind of said student seems like the perfect recipe for disaster.\\
Let's face it, Dumbledore was just plain stupid in this instance. Especially since he could have trained Harry himself if he had done it sooner. He did suspect a connection between Harry and Voldemort and knew very well that Voldemort was a master of the mind arts.\\
This is also one of the points where Dumbledore comes off as someone who has very little humility. He's so sure of himself he doesn't even bother to chek if his plans are working.

***** the reason dumbledore didn't train harry himself was because he did not know if voldemort had a one way connection into harry's mind. Dumbledore did not want voldemort learning his plans.

****** It's not like Dumbledore will be risking his plans thogh, Harry knows fuck all. Teaching Harry to protect his mind won't be risking any plans except teach him occlumemcy. And Tom already knows this as Snape reports basically everything. Unless Snape was "ordered" to weaken his mind furthur. At which point we get to either Snape is the bitch, or both him and Dumbledore are.

****** In this case, asking his spy to do it is completely stupid. You certainly don't need Voldemort having a peak in Snapes' mind.

Actually, it could be one of the reasons Snape botched Harry's training. If Voldemort was aware of what happened to Harry and knew Snape was actually training Harry correctly, Snape could've been killed.
