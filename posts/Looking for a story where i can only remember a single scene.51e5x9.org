The story I'm looking for is a Harry/Ginny story. Near the end of the story, possibly the last chapter, Ginny and Hermione both meet with Professor McGonagall. She is trying to decide between them for Head Girl. Ginny admits she mostly wants it since Harry will be Head Boy, and offers Hermione an opportunity to be Head Girl if she'll allow Ginny to spend extra time with Harry. Hermione wants to be chosen for her own merits, but McGonagall chooses Ginny because she is more well-rounded. McGonagall also invites Ginny to return to her office with Harry, as the couple are newly engaged and she wants to share stories of his parents.

As you can see, I remember this scene fairly well, but can't recall the full story it belongs to.


** Linkffn(Ginny Returns by kb0), the scene you are remembering happens on the last chapter.

** I don't know the story but the scene seems odd all around. Why would McGonagall deny Hermione who is clearly the best choice, especially after Ginny said she just wants it so she can spend more time with Harry? Also why would Ginny need to ask Hermione's permission to spend more time with Harry? I imagine the story hopefully explains it all but it still just feels really off for the characters.

*** Having re-read the scene after someone else helped find it, I can explain those oddities a bit better. Ginny admitted to McGonagall that Harry being Head Boy was an added incentive, but it was only to Hermione that she admitted it was her primary motivation; she was comparing her reasoning to Hermione's, whose motivation for it was because she wanted the prestige and wanted it on her resume. Ginny needed Hermione's permission to spend more time with Harry because it was a story with separate rooms for the Head Boy and Girl, so Ginny asked Hermione to turn a blind eye to her comings and goings from Harry's room if Hermione was Head Girl. And Hermione was not clearly the best choice in this story, because being the top of the class did not necessarily make her a great leader, as she wasn't as friendly with students from all the other houses.
