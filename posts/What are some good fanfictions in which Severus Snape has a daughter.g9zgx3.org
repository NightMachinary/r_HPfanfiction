  It's back! A new formulation of the story I started awhile ago. Snape discovers that "The Girl Who Lived" is his daughter. Will loosely follow the books, but the premise will disrupt canon quite a bit.

** Can I recommend my own series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/952881][Family Branches]]? Severus has more than one daughter and acts in parental-like capacity to a much younger sister in it.

** This is part two of a series - At the end of part one (The Problem of Potions) Snape brings the baby out of hiding, and in part two he actually raises her.

  Harry Potter, recent vanquisher of the Dark Lord and potions apprentice to one Severus Snape, is absolutely certain he is going to have a peaceful year learning the secrets of the most elegant magical art. The mysterious baby girl Snape declared his daughter after the Battle of Hogwarts can't possibly cause any trouble, surely? She's a baby. Babies are easy.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1784066/1/Armilla][Armilla]] by Coral Grace is another one I really like. Technically it's about Snape's much younger sister, but I highly recommend it. It also has an unfinished sequel that's worth the read even though it's probably abandoned.
