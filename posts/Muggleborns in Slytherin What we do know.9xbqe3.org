Even though Salazar Slytherin didn't want muggleborn students, there are hints in the series that a muggleborn Slytherin is possible. I am not only talking about that comment by Scabior which could be considered sarcasm.

1) In the Prince's Tale, Snape tells Lily that he hopes she will be in Slytherin. Now kid Snape seemed to know a lot about the Hogwarts Houses, so why would he hope Lily (a muggleborn) would be a Slytherin? This shows that maybe muggleborn Slytherins are not impossible.

2)Slughorn said that he used to tell Lily that she should have been a Slytherin. Slughorn was a grown up man, it's not like he was ignorant about the Hogwarts Houses. Yet he used to tell Lily that she should have been a Slytherin, but why? Could this show that there are cases of muggleborn Slytherins after all?

I personally do not understand how a muggleborn Slytherin would be possible when Salazar explicitly did not want muggleborns. Is the Sorting Hat not following Salazar's wishes? Any theories?

You can abuse the "equal distribution" statement Rowling made about the hat (each house gets the same number of boys and girls). Let's say the hat starts sorting and has the other houses already filled, so now only Slytherin is left. This can even result in a full Muggleborn Slytherin year if you want to ignore statistic probabilities.

Of course, you might argue that the whole Statement is bullshit due to exactly this reason, and I would not disagree, but it is nonetheless a word from the goddess.

I think she just meant that there wouldn't be a situation where Hufflepuff gets 20 students while Ravenclaw gets 2 - if a student could go either way, then the Hat would use them to even out the numbers. For example, without Harry and Hermione (both of whom could have fit in other houses) Gryffindor would have only had six of forty students as compared to Slytherin which had nine named students in that year.

Or is the sorting relative, i.e., taking into account the student and the (toxic) culture of the House that they would be sorted into?

If it's the former, then surely there are (relatively) many muggleborns that have been sorted to Slytherin. Did they survive the year? Mysteriously die during Christmas break due to a gas leak (killing curse)? Who knows?

If it's the latter, then the Hat would probably decide that even though Slytherin is the best trait-fit, their happiness and long-term survival is best served by going to another house.

Not liking Muggles... that had been around a long time, but it didn't seem so extreme from the hints we get of things.

Maybe I'm completely wrong, and I totally misread stuff, but I like to think that Muggleborn Slytherins exist in canon and did historically at Hogwarts as well.

Everyone must have thought he was a muggleborn when he was first sorted into Slytherin, the Hat included. Most of the well written fics about him tend to portray him as someone who was loathed by most of the Purebloods around him, for being smarter then them, and a mudblood at the same time, basically proving everything they stood for wrong.

Ofc he must have told some of his eventual ''friends'' about his Gaunt origins/Parseltongue ability, but that obviously wouldn't be widespread information in the Slytherin common room, given how no one bar Dumbledore ever suspected him of being the heir of Slytherin.

** It's very important to remember that blood purity, as a political issue, didn't arise until around the time of the Statute of Secrecy in 1692. It probably would have become something people were concerned about somewhere around 1484 when [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summis_desiderantes_affectibus][Summis desiderantes affectibus]] was published and shifted the witch-hunts into aggressive high gear. Hogwarts was founded about 990, /centuries/ before that would have been a problem. So we should think about Salazar's era purebloodism as more about how muggle students were actually filthy smell peasants who literally lived in the mud, who might someday drag their ravening hordes of barbarians through the hallowed halls of Hogwarts looting and desecrating as they went. Putting in the Chamber of Secrets to purge the school of muggleborns would be like building a nuclear bomb into a high school in case someday someone wanted to get rid of all those gangster wannabes with sagging pants. It makes much more sense to use the basilisk as an anti-muggle army defensive measure in case the school came under seige from those repulsive animals. Did you know they actually burned the Library of Alexandria and the Baghdad House of Wisdom? We shouldn't even be letting them inside the school, what if they get cold in the library and decide to start a bonfire with the priceless manuscripts?

I disagree. In the Prince's Tale it was implied that he did know about the bigotry against muggleborns before he went to school. There is a scene where young Lily asks him "is there any difference if you're muggleborn?" and the text describes him as hesitant when he replied "no there is not". Why would the text have him hesitate like that? I think it was meant to imply that he already knew there was bigotry against muggleborns but he lied to not hurt Lily's feelings. Also, don't forget that Snape was already prejudiced against muggles before he went to school as we saw in how he talked about Petunia.

** Canon portrayal of Lily (A Prince's Tale) and usual fanon (I mostly read SS-centric fanfics, but I can't imagine her as being /more/ Slytherin if read from Gryffindor-centric fanon) implies that Slytherin wouldn't have been the right house for her (personality-wise, e.g. not even counting the prejudice) -- I'd rank it Gryffindor>Ravenclaw>Hufflepuff>Slytherin, I think. Just saying, given what OP mentioned.

I don't believe for a second that Snape would advise Lily to become a Slytherin if he truly knew how rampant the prejudices against Muggleborns most Slytherins held (I think he'd have advised Ravenclaw in that case to avoid the infamous Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry) -- thus, I would see it as entirely likely for Snape to not know of a lock-out of any kind. Yes, he is selfish and would like Lily to be in the same house as him even at the possible expense of her own enjoyment, but he clearly holds a desire to protect her from danger to some extent (it is unclear how far this desire goes during the first train ride). Slughorn's similar remarks is a better point, though.

With that aside, I think there is indeed some bias against muggleborns in Slytherin, if not a complete lock-out. Consider this: muggleborns are (usually) "fresh" to the Magical World. This means they haven't been exposed to the Slytherin prejudice that seems to prevail among other houses (especially Gryffindors). Thus, there is really no reason for them to avoid Slytherin in their mind, and yet they seem to not really make it there. Has canon mentioned any muggleborns there at all?

One point that speaks for Muggleborns in Slytherin being a possibility is that I believe canon (at least it is a very common fanon trope...) Slytherins during early Riddle years believed him to be a muggleborn, until he found his true heritage. Why would they believe that if Slytherin muggleborns is an impossibility?
