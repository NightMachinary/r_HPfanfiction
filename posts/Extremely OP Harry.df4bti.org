If someone could write something where Harry is just so powerful, even a lumos can blind someone, and he can't get anything right because he accidentally over powers everything


** "Maybe try using your wand with your left hand," Hermione suggested helpfully, rearranging her blindfold over her eyes again. "It's your non-wand hand, right? It'll stifle the flow of magic better."

Ron did the same with his. "C'mon, mate. We believe in you. Think...calm thoughts. Happy thoughts. No violence, okay?"

"Thanks for the confidence," said Harry dryly to the two of them, but he did as Hermione said and switched hands. At this point, everyone in the common room had already hastily filed outside, not entirely willing to spend another week with Madam Pomfrey regenerating seared retinas. They'd had enough of that after the joint Gryffindor-Ravenclaw Charms class last time. Professor Flitwick had also been caught in the terrifyingly blinding light show, which meant that he was out of commission for the whole month due to his more-sensitive-than-average eyes courtesy of his goblin heritage.

This also meant that the three of them now had a convenient block of time each day to help Harry /not/ accidentally murder everything in his path if he so much as raised his wand.

"/Lumos,/" Harry whispered, pointing his wand directly at the ground, where theoretically no one would be in harm's way.

Of course, as one probably knows, to rely purely on theory with Harry Potter was an terrifically terrible idea (Voldemort would be the first in line to vehemently testify to this).

What happened next in the Gryffindor common room was much akin to what happened when God said "/Let there be light,/" except perhaps a tad bit brighter.

It was so bright, so eye-piercing, so...full of light that it was absolutely indescribable.

What was describable, however, was the ensuing conversation in the Hospital Wing.

"Don't you dare," said Ron threateningly, pointing a finger at Harry. Or rather, he pointed a finger in Harry's general direction, because his optic nerves were currently fried and he was getting them reattached. "Don't you dare use your wand with your left hand again."

"I wasn't planning on it," mumbled Harry. He was also very put-out by his untimely hospitalization. Oliver had scheduled practice, and he wouldn't be able to make it.

From her corner, Hermione sighed. "Well, Harry, at least we found out that you're ambidextrous." She, at least, had managed to figure out a text-to-voice charm that allowed her to listen to all of the assigned readings for class, because God forbid Hermione miss her homework due to the vaporization of all liquid in her eyeballs.

"Couldn't we have found out some other way?" whined Ron.

"Well," said Hermione. "At least Flitwick is still out for half a month. We can probably figure something out before then. Harry, maybe we should try having you hold your wand in your mouth next time."

Harry wanted to roll his eyes, but he couldn't, because he didn't have any at the moment, so he settled for a massive groan.

Life kind of sucked.

*** This is great. It would be fantastic if you would consider expanding this to a full story. Harry could maybe try to get a wand that was extremely incompatible with him to limit his power. Power as an obstacle. I haven't seen that before I think in HP fanfiction.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

** In Meaning of One by Sovran, which is a Hinny Soul Bond fic, there are three types of spells. In the first and second, you can't really over-power them, but the third you can. So Harry (and Ginny) has to worry about the Bat-Bogey Hex blowing people's noses off and Bluebell Flames causing massive deforestation. Unfortunately, Lumos and Wingardium Leviosa are unaffected.
