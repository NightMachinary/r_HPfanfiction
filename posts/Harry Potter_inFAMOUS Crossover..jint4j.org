Harry gets a part time job as a bike courier during the summer. During a supposedly normal delivery, the item he's carrying causes a massive explosion, killing thousands, causing a plague, and granting Harry electric powers. When the area goes into quarantine, Harry is forced to step up and be the hero the muggles desperately need while also trying to find out who or what caused this.


** This sounds amazing. I really hope someone does something with this. InFAMOUS is one of my favorite games.

Plus later in the story he could end up taking on Voldemort and the death eaters with Cole's powers and getting his powers could get rid of the horcrux in Harry's scar.

The reactions of Harry's friends to his new powers would be fun too.
