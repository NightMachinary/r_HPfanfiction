I've seen some people say that they don't consider Pottermore or even Fantastic Beasts as not canon.

I'm just baffled by such statements because this is what the HP Fandom has been asking for. For more of the Wizarding World.

Fantastic Beasts is suppose to show us how Grindelwald was defeated, more of Wizarding schools and more information on certain characters like Tom Riddle.

Fantastic Beasts has given information on MACUSA, why Dumbledore didn't fight Grindelwald from the get go, and wizarding schools.

Pottermore is suppose to fill in the blanks JK couldn't when she wrote the books. It has given us information on Wand woods and cores, filled out wizarding famillies and answered questions the books left us with.


** I'm a book purist, and only consider the original texts as canon. Anything else is supplementary and I'll pick and choose the bits I like best, especially when there are contradictory/problematic elements of the films/Pottermore/interviews etc.

*** Yeah, the Star Wars approach, with varying tiers of canonicity

Books are canon, no ifs, ands, or buts.

the original series films are canon except where they contradict the books

The TMB films and other supplementary materials (Pottermore, FB and QTTA books) are below that

Then there's noncanon area with all sorts of fanfiction

then there's the Cursed Child.

**** Just off the top of my head, from the last FB film:

Dumbledore teaching a boggart class (Defence Against the Dark Arts) when we'd previously been told he was a Transfiguration teacher

McGonagall being a teacher, when according to previous information she should have been a child or not even born - I can't remember exactly, I'm pretty sure her previous birth date was wiped from Pottermore when the second FB came out

There's also the matter of Credence/Aurelius Dumbledore. I'm assuming that he is not actually a Dumbledore, and it's just Grindelwald manipulating him, but that left a sour taste in my mouth after watching it

******** And thus you have hit on why I - personally - refuse to accept Pottermore specifically as canon. It can be /changed/ far more easily than Books 1-7. Books 1-7 have been printed and while there were a few alterations based on edition (Enervate changed to Rennervate, an OOTP change based on whether prefects could take points etc etc) stuff can't be added or taken away without a complete reprinting and even then, that won't affect people who have older editions of the books. Pottermore can have stuff added and taken down.

The 1935 birthdate wasn't /stated/ on Pottermore but it's easily calculated from information taken off there.

In OOTP McGonagall says she's been teaching at Hogwarts for 39 years. Prior to that she worked for the Ministry for two years, starting right after finishing Hogwarts. There is no other career information given to us. You do the maths on that, you get 1935.

If she had been an adult and a teacher in the early 1900's, she would have either taught for considerably more years than 39 or would have had a massive gap in her teaching career.

Also Crimes of Grindelwald was a demonstrably bad movie and that is more than enough for me to ignore it.

** honestly I just can't be fucked watching the terrible movies, and never really engaged with Pottermore, so I just try to go off of the books.

it is what it is.

I pretty much always write AU though, so it isn't crucial.

But I mean, with an author that loves as retcon as much as Rowling does, I don't think you should get too stressed over which canon people choose, as Rowling herself set the precedent for just changing things whenever she damn well pleases.

** The word "canon," /in this context/, doesn't really have an agreed-upon definition, to my knowledge. It's a weird, complicated, murky, and ultimately kinda meaningless thing that we could debate all day without accomplishing anything. I, for one, don't consider anything canon to the HP series other than the books themselves. You can disagree with me, but, like, I don't care, because why would I? Death of the Author is a thing that exists. Also:

Each Harry Potter fan does not speak for every Harry Potter fan. The fact that some people wanted more content in no way contradicts the fact that some people disliked the new content. Hell, even if we assume that the same people who don't consider CC, FB, Pottermore, etc canon are all people who were clamouring for new HP content, it /still/ isn't contradictory, since, presumably, they wanted /good/ content that feels in line with the original stories, both of which are /totally subjective/.

As for JKR, if she wanted her absurd addendums to be part of the Potter universe, she should have put them in the books. If someone has to read a bunch of interviews with the author after the fact to gain the correct 'interpretation', it obviously isn't canon.

** We live in an era where, more than ever before, people tend to hold the view that everyone is entitled to their own opinion which is not to be questioned, criticised, or described as untrue. The post-truth era, they say.

I think this applies equally to the HP fandom. Increasingly people reject the idea of an objective authority in favour of every individual person determining their own HP reality.

It's not hard to see that the core motive behind people rejecting parts of the HP universe is the fact that they personally dislike those parts. Properly analysed, this is not so much a rejection of the canonicity of specific sources, but rather an attack on the very concept of canon itself. The whole idea of canon is that it is not subject to the personal preferences and whims of individual fans: canon consists of the facts of the universe, whether you like those facts or not.

In the past, if you disliked those facts, you just shrugged your shoulders and wrote an AU fanfic. Now, however, people increasingly assert that their personal preference is sufficient to allow them to define their own personal canon. But a subjective canon is a contradiction in terms, because the core concept of a canon is that it forms an objective authority.

Rather than admit this contradiction, however, people seem to persist in asserting their subjective canon. Ultimately I think this is an act of denial: for some reason, people are unwilling to just accept that they dislike parts of canon, but instead try to maintain the idea of canon and simultaneously bend it to suit their personal preferences.

*** I disagree.

I have yet to see anybody actively reject Books 1-7 as an objective authority. Disagreeing with them, disliking them or simply ignoring parts of them for the purpose of creating fic, yes, but not seriously denying that they are canon.

Everything else is it's own massive kettle of fish. In part because it's far, far more subject to change.

Let's say JKR tweets something which might radically and retrospectively change how book canon is interpreted. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that she says that Remus and Sirius were in love during the HP books and Harry simply didn't notice. Fandom explodes a bit. Wikis are edited etc etc. By your definition, that would be canon on the same level as the books.

Then, a week later, she deletes the tweet. Is it no longer canon? Even though people have screencaps or an archived web page of that tweet, it is no longer live and JKR clearly no longer thinks it is canon.

The level of often unthinking, apparently random additions that are made via social media or are simply put in the background of the movies, never expecting some eagle-eyed viewer to spot them, should they be considered the same level of canon as Books 1-7?

I'd also like to know whether you've encountered any of JKR's various additions which you vehemently disagreed with and how you felt about those? If Pottermore posted tomorrow about how magic was actually just like a muscle which could be exhausted if you did too much powerful magic, that magical cores were a thing, that magic could be categorised numerically and that Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort all had absolutely massive magical cores which is why they could perform really cool magic would you accept that as canon?
