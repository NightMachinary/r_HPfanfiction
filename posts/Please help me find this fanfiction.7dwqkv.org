I read this fanfiction few years ago it is about Daphne Greengrass i cant find it anywhere.It's from Daphne's pov.Daphne thinks about suitable males around her age and their family traits how they affect their spouses how suitable they will be with each other etc...At the near end of the fiction Daphne looks to Harry and thinks about his family traits and how much she loves him then decides family treats doesnt matter.Sorry for shitty summary English isnt my native language and its all i can remember from this fanfic.


** Can you tell us anything else? How long was it? one shot? 50k words, 100k?500k?

Where did you read it? fanfiction.net?

have you looked at fics with daphne in them rated by favorites? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&c1=5549]]

there is the link for that.

was it a romance? can help narrow it down. was it year 7? or later? earlier?

other than daph did harry play a major role? can narrow the list down a little with that, anyone else? tracy?

you say a few years ago, is that 3 years? 6? can help narrow it down.

** It was oneshot but i can't remember if it was a part of oneshot series or just a oneshot.I already looked to fanfiction.net and fanficauthors but maybe i'm missing something.As for length i'm sure it was longer than 1k and shorter than 5k.There was no conversation in this fic just Daphne's thoughts.I don't remember specifics about what year they are in but it was later than 5th or 6th.More than a year ago last time i read this fanfiction.Harry and Daphne in same bed and in room of requirement and Harry is sleeping but we read about this in the end.Daphne thinks about Oliver wood,marcus flint,weasleys,neville and some more.Thats all i can remember.
