** The Mauraders weren't the only students to find the Hogwarts kitchens. A lonely Slytherin also would often join the house elves for dinner or a snack. And if he would occasionally offer suggestions or new recipes, the elves were happy for the new dishes they could make for their young charges. Severus' recipe for treacle tart would be enjoyed by students for generations to come.

** I don't have a story to suggest, but I am currently writing one where the lead character is both a talented baker and a Potions Master. In the story there is a category of baking where the baker uses potions. The recipes requireÔøº emotional attunement to a potion, where half goes into the mix and you drink half.

I love the connections between baking and Potions!

** Here's a short AU story I came up in the span of an hour. Hope you like. I've never written fanfiction before.

Prologue:

In a world with no house elves, it all started when Dumbledore asked the newly appointed 5th year prefect, Harry to gather some sweets for the headmaster in the kitchens below... If only Dumbledore had picked one of his staff, but noooo it just had to be him.

/Damn my luck/, thought Harry, keeping a brisk pace towards the kitchens. /If only there was a means... or a creature of some sort that wizards could boss around.../ /well whatever... better just get this over with./

Eventually, Harry arrived at the place the headmaster had told him about, near the Hufflepuff common rooms, the long hallway had expanded into an even wider room. To others this would seem to be a dead-end, with a very peculiar set of paintings along the rooms walls. But to Harry, it was the entrance to the Kitchens.

Quickly he cast a quick /lumos/ spell, as the room, lit with torches as it was, was still rather dim, and Harry needed the extra light to find the painting he was looking for. He thus began his small trek to find the portrait.

One would think this is easy, but no, they had to put 14 exact replicas of the painting in the room*. "*Thank Merlin none of my friends were here to see me do this," Harry muttered. /Just think how Ron would react if he saw me down here, near the basement/Hufflepuff common rooms, fondling painted pairs... you know what? I don't want to think about it./

By the 14th replica, Harry was starting to lose his patience. /Damn the person who made this blasted, mind-bending entrance! Damn Dumbledore for sending him here! Damn this neatly stacked bowl of fruit! Damn this--- wait what?/

Next to the 14th replica, off to the side of it, there was a bowl of fruit. Harry stared at it.

And stared.

"..."

He reached out and fondled the pair on top.

The 14th replica's pear turned into a door handle.

"F*ck you." Harry walked through.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chapter 1:

He was in. The smell of yeast permeated the air and there were a menagerie of kitchen items strewn about the place. The place however, unlike the rest of the castle did not look it's age. It looked brand new, in some ways looking similar to some of the muggle kitchens Harry had briefly seen on the telly before being screamed at by his aunt not to. He ventured forward.

As he made his way around a rather old table which lay in contrast to the rest of his crisp surroundings, he heard the distinct sound of humming. A low, baritone humming. Funny, he'd never heard anyone who's voice matched it. The humming continued, and as he edged closer, he saw a conjoined room, it's door closed but an almost ethereal glow flowing from underneath it.

Suddenly, nearly five feet away from the door now, the humming turned into song. The man singing, sung in a voice as soft as silk, but as powerful and deep as anything he had ever heard before. Harry was enthralled. /Why would anyone with a voice that godly stay and work in a place like this? This doesn't make any sense./

He was now close enough to the door to grab the handle. /Should I do this?/ He wondered? /Well, I've gotten this far. No point in turning back now. Here goes./

He touched the handle.

Immediately he knew he must have tripped a ward as soon as he touched the handle as he heard the distinct sound of the grand singing turn into a growl, with pots and pans clattering to the floor which were then followed by a rather loud and colorful string of words. Words in which if Harry hadn't known any better, would have been interpreted as an incoming spell, been quickly /expelliarmussed,/ and then would have set off a second set of security measures... but alas, this was a kitchen, and the young man entering it knew better.

Instead, as soon as he heard the clattering along the floor, he frantically looked around, locked eyes with the nearest cupboard, and barged his way into it. /This is ironic. For the first time I'm actually willing to stay overnight in a cupboard. Well, home sweet home I guess. I wonder if----/

All thoughts were shattered however, when he heard the door he was near not even 5 seconds ago, slam open! He stayed absolutely still, hoping to the gods above that whoever it was wouldn't come his way. Fate however, had other plans.

Slowly but surely, he came to the realization that footsteps, once quiet were getting louder with every step.

About five steps away, Harry stopped moving.

Four steps, Harry slowed his breathing.

Three steps, Harry stopped his breathing.

Two steps, wand out. His only hope of escape disintegrated. The only way out of this was /through./

One step... His wand was already going through the motions.

The turning of the handle...

*** Chapter 2:

"EXPELLIARMUS!!!!!" shouted Harry, with the earsplitting force of 10,000 dragons all roaring at once!

As quickly as it had begun, Harry knew, that with the cupboard door flying off it's hinges and the sound of a thump on the ground intermixed with a short yelp, that the battle was over.

Whoever had been on the other end, was now laid about in a heap near the table, unmoving, yet caked in flour. Harry was frozen in place. He didn't utter a sound.

Seconds ticked by...

A full minute...

Five minutes. Harry started to panic. /Should be enough time. I hope... Oh god! I hope he's not dead./

Harry slowly but steadily crept up to the now prone, flour caked man. He couldn't tell who it was, but it had been around 10 minutes now, and the man hadn't even so much as stirred. Harry was starting to get really worried now.

/Have I actually killed him?!/ He tried to calm himself, but the pounding of his heart wouldn't go away. Knowing that this could back fire horrendously, but still worried about the unmoving mass on the floor, he had to check to see if he was alive. So, hoping the man would forgive him for his actions, pointed his wand at the man and cast a whispered, "E/nervate."/

The man grunted. "Damn whoever it was that interrupted me. I'd almost done it. Perfected the treacle tart into something better than the original."

/Strange/, thought Harry. The man sounded somewhat familiar...

Harry suddenly felt a part of his soul being ripped from him, not unlike how the Avada Kedavra curse would have if Voldemort had hit him it with last year. /Oh Merlin no!/

The man, not noticing the boy, as he thought his eavesdropper had already fled the premises, got up, looked down at his robes, and must have cast a /Scourgify/ on himself as the flour started dropping off in waves.

Harry's heart dropped, and the hope of forgiveness along with it... and what he saw that day would be burned into his mind forever.

Snape.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Conclusion:

"Snape?"

The man in question stilled, and spun around, wand at the ready. He locked eyes with Harry. The air cooled, and time seemed to slow down.

"..."

"..."

Suddenly, Snape /smiled./ Not the usual sneer but a real, genuine looking, smile!

Harry started to tremble as he said, "H-h-hi P-p-professor... F-f-f-f... F-fancy m-meeting you HERE?!"

His voice cracked. His f*cking voice cracked. /God. What have I done to upset you?/

More silence...

Snape shifted suddenly, making Harry jump. He moved out of the way, and gestured to the door with his hand, all the while keeping the smile plastered on his face. He uttered a simple, three words.

"You may go."

Harry didn't need to be told twice. He pushed off, nearly running towards the door. He tripped on a pan, slipped on the flour, but nothing would stop him from reaching that door! Except that as soon as he was near the door, he found he was frozen in place.

Snape was already right behind him, and whispered into his ears, "*/If yOu TeLL aNyone... I WiLL DROWN YOU IN THE DaRkESt PiTS OF THE CASTLE."/*

/"Finite Incantatem..."/

Harry stood there, nearly pissing himself out of sheer fear. In all of his years of fighting Voldemort, in all his years of fighting monsters, he had never come across something as scary as a smiling, but equally furious Severus Snape.

"Leave."

He left the castle and stayed over for the next two weeks in Hagrid's Hut. /Never again/. He told himself.

/Never again./

*** Not saying you're wrong in because I agree that Snape would be a dope chef and baker, but I view potions to be pretty similar to baking. While the proportions do matter, how you treat your ingredients will determine your finished product. Take cookie dough for instance, melting the butter will yield a chewier cookie whereas keeping it softened at room temperature will make it more firm/fluffy. Similarly to HBP when Harry crushes the sopophorous bean (totally googled that) rather than chopping it to release more juice. Another example would be how you handle your mix. Coming back to them cookies, if the dough gets overmixed you'll probably get flat, tough cookies or if you pop that baby in the fridge you can get some thicker floof cookies. In HBP adding an opposite stir every so often effected the maturation/development of his potion. This is quite long! If you couldn't tell I'm quite into baking and have spent too much time pretending to be a potions master while sprinkling chocolate chips into dough

*** I went with baker because potion-making seems more similar to baking to me. There's more need for precise measurements and perfect timing, whereas with cooking you don't necessarily have to be that accurate. But either would work, I think. Both cooking and baking have enough room for Snape to put his own spin on it.
