** Alright, I know that I won't be able to help you. But I highly doubt anyone can without more info on each one. Those don't seem like particularly distinct and unique plot points.

** A and E sound like something I've read, but it's got a lot of possibilities in general. If you want help finding it, you'll have to add whatever information you can to help narrow. Like mostly complete, or over x amount of words, or on this site likely. Etc.

However, B through D aren't familiar to me at all.

** B sounds extremely familiar, while E sounds vaguely familiar. Is there any other information you can add to help narrow down your query?
