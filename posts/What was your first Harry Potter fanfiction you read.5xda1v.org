** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867), was the first HP fanfic I finished reading.

"Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness" was the first HP fanfic I had found. I made it to the Ministry execution chamber scene before giving up in disgust.

My first AU fic was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]], linkffn(4101650). Since then, I've had my issues with it, but I would still recommend it to people who are looking to get into HP fanfics.

** It was a really bad Drarry fic written by my sorority sister shortly before GOF came out. She wanted me to edit it. I think (hope) that it never got posted to the net. I actually read this before I had read any of the books. The first fanfic I remember the title of is Irresistible Poisen by Rhysenn sometime in 2001. I had read a dozen or so fics (and the books!) by then but IP is definitely what turned me into a fanfic fanatic. Strangely, I can't stand Drarry anymore even though it was my OTP for several years.

HG/LM, super dark. The first AN isn't lying, but at the same time, it's a must read for me at least. It made me want to read more of anything, really. Light, dark, happy, fun, sad, smut... I'm really glad I stumbled upon it.

Fun fact : I discovered fanfiction because of an imgur post of a guy posting a pic of what the girl in front of him was reading on her phone in the bus, it was a very smutty HG/H/SS fic, and the pic was of course of a very smutty paragraph. I was curious (and a bit disgusted, really), I found it, didn't like it, but then found Eden, and the rest is history :)

** Damn, that's a good question.

I think my first was a discontinued series. It was a Next Generation story, /The New Trio: The Helion Wands/ or something along those lines.

Long story short, Albus and Rose and Scorpius are all sorted into Gryffindor and turn out to have been chosen by the Helion wands--three immensely powerful wands developed by Ollivander and Gorgovitch /together,/ as a way to test the limits of wandlore. There wasn't much in the way of OP--all three of them had to have their wands touching and they only learned one OP spell a year.

Their DADA teacher was a vampire and the main bad guys were a group of renegade vampires who were similar to Greyback, and sought to turn children.

** For me it was Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness. Linkffn(4315906).

When I first read it I was absolutely transfixed - I'd written fanfiction before but for open world things like The Elder Scrolls games. The idea you could do it for a fixed text honestly hadn't occurred to me.

DAYD seemed perfect at the time but it's dropped quite a bit in my estimations as I've read more stuff. At first I thought you were only allowed to fill in the gaps - so describing what happened at Hogwarts while Harry et al were away fit perfectly. I have no idea why I thought that.

** I don't think first story I've read is even around anymore. It was a pretend Order of the Phoenix. For a while I didn't even know it wasn't the real deal - I seriously thought it was the real one. It had all the tropes we know now - evil Dumbledore etc. but I think it was pretty well written.

Plot as far as I remember: Harry's fifth year. Dumbledore turns out to be evil Harry gets some weird ring that allows him to feel secret keepers or smith like that. Not much romance. In the end Harry uses AK on Dumbledore and Albus only gets a nose bleed (he congratulates Harry on successfully giving him a nose bleed). Story ends with Harry returning to Dursleys for the holidays, Dumbledore is now in hiding and exposed.

Anyone knows the story? Wouldn't mind reading it again, but no idea who the author was or what the exact name of the story was.

  Harry Potter has the weight of the world on his shoulders. He's deserving of some enjoyment, isn't he? Well, he thinks so, and he intends to act on it. The strange gifts he has, and isn't going to question, should help in that regard.This is a story in which Harry has sex with just about everyone. Any necessary warnings will be at the top of each chapter, and a little summary will be there as well if you're reading this for the meagre plot included (There's no discernible reason you would be, it's first and foremost smut) and don't want to read that particular chapter.The background story will basically follow the books, and won't bother restating everything that happens. There might be included a very basic recap just as a reminder in the notes, though.Can't promise especially quick updates, it'll depend on how often the mood strikes me.
