** What portion of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11197701/1/][Yule Ball Panic]] do you want similar things to? characters having to confront their sexual preference? Coming out of the closet to a friend? coming out of the closet to a friend you have a crush on? Being forced to do so by the yule ball?

I'm probably not going to be able to help you once these questions are answered because I mostly read Harry/Hermione, but I think it will help others if they know what your asking.

*** I mainly mean taking a same sex partner to the Yule Ball or considering it.Coming out to a close friend” and “having a crush on a close friend” are a dime a dozen.I also already read that Harry/Ron one that had the line”why cant we go together?”

** I am currently working on a fic that will probably include one of the main characters who is LGBTQ+. She will choose to come out to friends/family as the topic of the Yule Ball comes up. That doesn't do you much good now however as it's not anywhere close to ready, and there is an alarmingly high chance that'll never publish it, because, I consider all my writing to be trash.
