I've got a hankering for well written fics where Harry is adopted/looked after/mentored by a responsible adult. Preferably starting at some point during Harry's Hogwarts years, but prior is fine if there's a well written reason for wizards being near him.

I'd particularly love to see a mentor Minevra but I know those are thin on the ground. Severitus or time travel are fine as ways to get the mentor too.

Gen or any pairing are fine, although no smut.

I'm not interest in Harry turning dark or or being raised by Voldemort/Belatrix, etc. Nor a genius Harry.

I would prefer no insane Dursley abuse and appearances of random American characters aren't my thing.

Thanks in advance - I thought now would be a good time to ask with most of us bunkering down inside.


** linkffn(12797831) Hope and Healing has him taken in by Fleur's Family and later adopted by Sirius.

linkffn(13274956) Harry Potter, Squatter has him basically adopted by Hestia

linkffn(13388022) Albus and Harry's World Trip has him mentored by Dumbledore after year 2.

linkffn(13407891) Archmage of Arda has him raised by Elrond

linkffn(7287278) Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone has him being mentored by the Sorting Hat.

linkffn(9203082) Harry Potter and the Knight of the Radiant Heart has Harry mentored by a knight.

linkffn(11576387) The Katarn Side has Harry mentored as a Padawan to Kyle, Mother fuckin, Katarn.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

**** This fic is beautiful, currently making my way through it. I really enjoy how it doesn't follow the typical plot of this genre (as much as I love them). I'm currently on The Meaning of Dandylions which I am not enjoying quite as much, due to the lack of Remus, Snape and Harry interaction but I've just got to the 4th book and am hoping there will be more action with them soon. Harry is basically perfect in not being over clever or known adult scheming.

** linkao3(10021610) In its sequels, Harry is adopted by the Malfoys and due to time travel shenanigans, it's actually wholesome. Also, Mentor!Draco.

linkffn(12924292) or linkao3(16237082) Sirius being a parent, but also some NSFW tangents along the way so be warned.

linkffn(8550820) has Mentor!Founders but especially Salazar.

linkffn(13169380) has Adult!Harry mentoring alt-universe Fem!Harry for the Triwizard Tournament.

linkffn(6413108) Mentor Future!Snape

linkffn(10101403) Parent!Snape

And there's all the fics where Harry gets adopted by the Weasley's:\\

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

*** Very excited to start reading these. I love 'To Shape and Change' so I'm hopeful the rest will be just as great. So many of them are new to me - I thought I'd pretty much run the genre dry and clearly was wrong.
