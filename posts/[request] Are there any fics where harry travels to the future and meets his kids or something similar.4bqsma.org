** The vast majority of those fics uses the time-turner approach, which strongly limits travellers' actions or else would cause paradoxes. That's one major reason why the best time travel fics such as *Delenda Est*, *Oh God Not Again!*, and *Backward with Purpose* don't use time turners.

I would very much like to see a next-gen time travel story using the alternate dimension/universe approach. For most shock effects, make Albus, Scorpius and Rose the protagonists and have them travel back between 1995 and 1997. Can you imagine what reactions Harry and co are going to have?

** I've not seen any with him traveling into the future, but there are quite a few with the next generation traveling back in time. Almost all of the stories I've read were pretty similar, but you might find a gem or two if you look hard enough. Most of them have the exact same plot and get abandoned before the kids get back to their time.

Here's a link to a collection of these stories on ffn.
