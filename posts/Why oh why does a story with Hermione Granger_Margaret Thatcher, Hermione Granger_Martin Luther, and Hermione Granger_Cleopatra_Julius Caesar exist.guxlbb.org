NSFL, especially the explicit dirty talk between Margaret Thatcher and Hermione (“Now that's how you pay a bedroom tax!”/“Fuck me like a family of six on a housing waitlist!”)

To make this count as a review, I will say that the prose is well-written considering the absurd nature of the topic. Yes, it's explicit, but the humour and choice of dirty-talk between the characters is cleverly thought out, even if it did require me to bathe my head in bleach for several hours afterwards.

For some reason, if you're interested, it's linkao3(1398646)

*** Or as a joke. I've written some really weird one shots in real time on a discord I frequent because the discussion got into a really weird topic and it sparked an absurd idea.

Not all smut or erotica is written because the author thinks it's titillating. Sometimes it's written because the author thinks it's funny or absurd.

*** My introduction to fanfic was a Harry/Hedwig fic (Hedwig was an animagus, I heard about it being a "horrific" fix over on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]). I later saw one that was Hagrid/Hedwig. She was not an animagus in that one. It hurt.

** Ok, but this line was hilarious

"Hermione laughed gayly--things were about to get very gay indeed--and turned around to greet her friend."

** This is the funniest shit I've ever read. It's either the most disturbing thing I've ever seen or the second most brilliant satire in the fandom (assuming the Christian mom one is actually satire).

** This is the best satire I have ever read and I can't believe it hasn't gotten more love. Then again, I am not exactly sure how else I would have found this fic.

Favorite line: "All wizard diamonds are ethically-sourced and cruelty-free, but only because gnomes aren't considered people."

** There have been over a millions stories written about HP. It's by far the most written about fanfiction topic out there. Hermione is the primary female protagonist of HP.

It should really be self explanatory.
