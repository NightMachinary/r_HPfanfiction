Or the boys Harry, Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean in retaliation ended up having a stag night and went with each other. Or some sort of variation. It can be a crack fic, or played up in a serious way, either is fine.

Feel free to write it, if you'd like. There's a lot of different ways this could be done. Can be one shot or longer. Just post the fic when you're done with the first chapter, or if it's a oneshot the story.

Or it can focus on the Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaw, or Slytherins deciding on a stag night or a variation.


** I wrote a fic where Harry and Ron go to the Yule Ball as friends: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18143687][put it down in the pleasure of your company]] linkao3(18143687). Gen, oneshot.

If you want Harry/Ron, you probably can't do better than [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8274067][Or the Look Or the Words]] linkao3(8274067). Also a oneshot.

  Harry needs a date to the Yule Ball, and Ron is free. The solution is obvious.

  Goblet of Fire AU: The change in their relationship happened during fourth year, when an exhausted and dateless Harry groaned out the important question of, “Why can't we just go together?”Pure fluff for the 5+ AU Headcanons game.
