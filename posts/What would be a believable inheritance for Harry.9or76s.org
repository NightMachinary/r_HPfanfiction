The three most common scenarios with inheritances seem to be:

- Harry gets to Gringotts (alone) for the first time

- Sirius died and left Harry everything, together with some instructions (and more often than not, a hologram)

- Harry ends up in the past and needs gold

And I think we all can agree that his inheritance should not rival the one of Charles V (Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, the Spanish colonial viceroyalties, Burgundy), but what would be a believable amount of gold/properties/power in each of those situations. Especially the time travel one requires one unless you want to write "Harry Potter and the Hustle in the 40s/70s".


** Well, the specific amount really depends on how you position the wizarding economy more generally, but as a general principle I would say he should inherit an amount that makes him comfortably upper-middle class, whatever that is in wizarding terms in the fic in question.

In Victoria Potter, I had her inherit an amount equivalent (at nominal exchange rates) to around £400,000, plus the Potter family home (which is /not/ a manor and has gone feral) as well as the ruins of Godric's Hollow.

But context is king: in the wizarding economy as I imagine it, a person's routine expenses will not be that high, especially once they have acquired some land for themselves (eliminating the expense of rent and permitting them to grow some of their own food) so the nominal exchange to £400,000 doesn't really capture the actual purchasing power of that number of galleons. They will in fact stretch much further than £400k would in the Muggle world... depending on what it is you're buying. Some items, like clothes and books, are no cheaper in the wizarding world, and if anything are more expensive. Other goods, like food and transportation, are much cheaper for wizards.

That was somewhere in the realm of what I was thinking about as well. Harry has no ancestors who spent centuries creating an empire, but there are a few story concepts where an inheritance is nearly unavoidable unless you want to bloat your story.

Is this canonical? The Weasleys have chickens and an orchard at the Burrow, but they're also notably poor so that seems like it's out of necessity and they're never mentioned to have more of a farming operation. I feel like middle and upper middle class families would simply purchase their food, possibly even from muggle vendors (or a wizarding store that purchases from muggle distributors) since most of the foods they eat are muggle anyway.

400K seems a bit low. James Potter's family was relatively well off, and Lily's family was middle class. I'd expect the equivalent of 1-2M GBP, with some portion of that in real estate and the rest mostly invested. Harry isn't the type to dwell on money, so I'd expect it to go almost completely unmentioned in most stories except if he needs a withdrawal or the property becomes relevant to the plot.

**** Wasn't it also stated that the Potter family is responsible for the creation of many well known and used potions in the wizarding world which has netted them quite the amount of money? Also if i remember correctly, Harry's grandfather Fleamont was the creator of a very popular potion, which made the Potter's even more rich than before.

***** It depends on how recent those inventions were, since wealth can be quickly dispersed across many branches in a few generations (like how the richest Rockefeller is nowhere near the richest person in the world now). If those potions were invented in 1600, the money might be distributed or gone.

I've read that Fleamont created Sleekeazy's hair potion. That would obviously be pretty recent but we don't know how large the market is or what share of profits he receives. And there's no mention of an ongoing cosmetics business with the Potter name on it, so maybe Fleamont did it while working as a potions master at some company, or he receives royalties for his patent from a company that produces it. A patent also may have expired by Harry's time.

The main reason I feel the Potters are very comfortable but not super rich is that the Malfoys and possibly other families are specifically mentioned as being wealthy. If the Potters were that wealthy, Harry would be famous for that reason alone, not just for the BWL stuff - yet it's never really mentioned.

His grandparents and parents didn't have a lot of time to blow through that vast profit and it should have been accumulating interest in a bank for ten years before Harry ever even enters the wizarding world.

**** I think you're importing a lot of Muggle concepts into the wizarding world. Population estimates for wizarding Britain range from 3000 to around 30,000, but regardless it's clear that the population is very small relative to the Muggle world. Even the most successful businesses in wizarding Britain are not going to be making a significant turnover due to their small customer base. A "vast" profit in the magical world is going to be nothing like a vast profit in the Muggle world. Remember that 1000 galleons was also considered a small fortune and enough capital to launch a very successful business. I wouldn't be surprised if the vast profit from selling Sleekeazy was somewhere in the region of 5000-10,000 galleons.

Also there's no evidence that Gringotts pays interest (and given that it's essentially a safety deposit box rather than a bank account there are good reasons to think they don't).

** Like magical cores, I think it's an idea that inheritances or talk of how much gold/titles/land Harry acquires should be an idea authors should just stay far away from and never mention, as it always just ends up being a power wank or such, and never providing anything relevant to the story. Even canon Harry has money and at the very least Grimmauld place, so there isn't really much reason to go beyond that.

It's also really not how inheritances or such work, especially in the case of ending up in the past somehow. Even if there is a magical blood/DNA test (another ridiculous device I wish never existed), it wouldn't mean you would have any claim to anything just because you're related to someone. Also, in a society that has as much intermarriage and is as small as closed as HP, EVERYONE would be related to some degree, so it wouldn't actually matter anyway.

In canon, Sirius left Harry all that he did in his will, which is an entirely different thing than going to a bank and saying test my blood and give me stuff from anyone I'm related to. (In the case of what Sirius left Harry, I think canon covers it pretty well, so just Grimmauld place, some money (there is literally zero reason to ever mention a number here, some or quite a lot is enough))

Even in the case of politics or such, that's just not how nepotism works. The purebloods aren't in power just by virtue of being part of so and so family, but because the people already in power are their parents and associates, so they make contacts easier and their name carries weight. A Harry Potter/Black/Peverell/Riddle/Gryffindor/Slytherin/Lestrange/Merlin turning up suddenly wouldn't mean he automatically gets to be in charge of government, it would just be a scandal for those families, or go unremarked upon, as, again, isn't literally everyone related anyway?

I also think the entire "Lord" and family ring and special status etc is just overdone, but that's a dead horse anyway, so eh.

That depends on what kind of story the author wants to tell.

If the plot focuses on politics and/or pureblood culture, then inheritance is absolutely relevant. If it's just a 'Harry kicks Death Eater butts' fic, then getting a powerup at Gringotts does come across as gratuitous.

Most of the pureblood culture/politics fics I've read treat the idea of inheritance less like nepotism and more like lines of succession for nobility. Some of them take a lot of inspiration from period stories such as /Downton Abbey/ in which [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee_tail][fee tails]] were still a thing. Fanon sometimes interprets pureblood culture as being old fashioned, so it could make sense for inheritance to be handled in a way that the muggles abolished in the mid 1920s.

Given that there seems to be a fairly accurate book which keeps track of the inbreeding (Wizarding Genealogy or something similar), it should be possible to trace inheritances like it was done in the days of old (eg someone dies without an heir you go up the family line until someone is eligible to inherit (sometimes there were restrictions on gender/religion).

Maybe there is a law in place to prevent accumulations of power (you may only be head of one family). I agree that it tends to be badly done, but this thread is for finding a solution, not just bitching about bad fanfics.

#+begin_quote

Designating someone as heir was a possibility as well, usually in elective monarchies. So the concept of a "designated heir" is not entirely unfounded (like the division of the Habsburg lands in the early 16th century).

Time travel would be the obvious application. Harry is stranded in the past and needs gold/a place to stay and you want to get to the good stuff, not read ten chapters about Harry working himself up the ladder pushing papers in the Ministry while sleeping under a bridge.

If you're thinking of Nature's Nobility, IIRC it's Dumbledore who points out that much of what is found in the genealogies is edited at best and outright fictional at worst.

As for inheritances, there are legal rules on intestacy, and they don't work the way they're shown to in fanon.

First of all, the furthest back you go is grandparents when tracing relatives. If someone dies without issue, surviving spouse, surviving siblings or half-siblings, surviving grandparents or surviving uncles/aunts or surviving descendants of uncles/aunts, the estate is /bona vacantia/ and goes to the Crown in the UK, and usually the government in other jurisdictions.

The property of the deceased /can/ be held in trust for some person not currently born, but there are limits to how long that can last. Since the 17th century - before the Statute of Secrecy, so wizarding law is likely to be the same on this point - no trust can last longer than 21 years and 9 months past the end of a life currently in being or gestation at the time the trust is settled; if the trust /could/ vest outside that time, it fails right from the start. (Don't ask me to explain in detail, I passed Equity and Law of Trusts nearly thirty years ago and promptly forgot most of it.) So inheriting a vault from someone who died in the 11th century? Not going to happen. (Not to mention that JKR gave out that Gringotts only dates back to the 15th Century)

The definition of the perpetuity period is based on a human lifespan, thelife defined as limiting the vesting of the trust must be a human lifespan in being at the time of the document creating the trust. You'd use the same definition - possibly with seventeen years in place of 21, since wizards use a lower age of majority than 17th-century muggles - and end up with longer times because wizards live longer. Armando Dippet's death could well have caused trusts from Charles I's time to vest...

That being said, the rule against perpetuities pre-dates the secession of magical society from muggle, and seceding nations almost never re-write their laws from scratch. Even if they did, the policy reasons for the rule against perpetuities are actually /stronger/ for longer-lived wizards than they are for muggles. If you're going to have to live three hundred years with restrictions on your money imposed by a dead guy, you're going to lobby the legislature /hard/ for inheritance and trust law reform.

And again in the real world, even the bad guys often support families of captured fighters, widows, orphans and so on. Hamas, for example, have their "martyrs fund" to support their fighters' families when they are imprisoned or killed. So you can bet that the /good/ guys would have something like that.

**** I mean, what expenses do we think the war actually involves? People always throw it out there that war in the wizarding world costs money, largely because this holds true in the Muggle world... but Order members and Death Eaters don't get paid, nor is there need to purchase equipment. They just make use of whatever people already have. Mad-Eye has a magical eye? Awesome, that's a great advantage, but it doesn't mean the Order is purchasing magical eyes for all its members. And on the infrastructure side, you can use some random person's house as your base, or otherwise just enchant some patch of grass in a park somewhere... there's really very little expenditure you need to wage war.

Both sides make overtures to werewolves, giants and presumably other sentient creatures. Suppose that Dumbledore's side offers large quantities of wolfsbane potion to the werewolves in exchange for them staying out of the conflict. Along with wolfsbane, say the werewolves are also given an income on which they can live in relative comfort. All that would need money.

Voldemort could hire mercenaries, that requires money.

Or, the British Ministry of Magic calling in France for assistance in containing Voldemort - France will demand something or the other in exchange.

These are just examples I thought of off the top of my head. It really depends on whether or not the author wants to elaborate about the war, or just keep it simple and stick to HP's stuff.

***** I mentioned two kinds of equipment that they might spend money on: potions and invisibility cloaks. The books mention plenty of other magical equipment that both sides would find extremely useful (sneakoscopes, foe glasses, magical plant or animal byproducts, etc).

As for the safehouses: A competent combatant might be expected to erect their own safehouses on the fly, yes, but the OotP might have helped shelter non-combatant families or individuals that were hiding from the Death Eaters. In those cases they might need discrete longterm locations that they could share on an individual basis without compromising the secrecy of other operations.

I mentioned behind-the-scenes economic/political powergrabs, but I'll offer another example that might be analogous:

Terrorist groups (such as the Death Eaters) often engage in pressure tactics that include kidnapping high profile people or vandalizing businesses. This is similar to gang warfare in the 1920s in big cities in the USA. Gangs such as Egan's Rats and the Hogan Gang would attack businesses and homes of their opponents, which would require that the rival gang spend money to recoup losses and protect their own. I would expect the OotP to spend money as a relief effort to protect civilians and maintain opposition against the Death Eaters.

The Death Eaters are inspired by and act just like the Sturmabteilung, the NSDAP muscle. They were not really into economic warfare, they beat up communists (who were doing the same to the other side) and occasionally with the law enforcement/army.

The only two stores the Death Eaters targeted were the ice cream shop and Ollivander's. The others simply closed because people were scared shitless, not because they were parts in an economic conflict.

Small things are cheap. Those costs are nearly irrelevant when compared to the costs of big projects of war, like a capital ship (thousands of tons of steel, tons or rare material, thousands of workers). The Germans could have build thousands of planes or tanks instead of the mostly ineffective surface fleet, the regular consumables of the infantry (magical or otherwise) are almost non-existent compared to the big projects. An Iowa class battleship cost 100 million in 1944 currency, a rifle merely between 25 and 100 (so 2 million rifles for one battleship).

And there are no big things usable in magical combat. Certainly nothing seven hundred feet long or build over years.

I've read quite a few fanfics that show Death Eaters attacking Diagon Alley shops. It seems to be a popular bit of fanon, same as inheritances. I mentioned it as a possible problem that the OotP would throw cash at in fics where the Potters donated money to the cause.

#+begin_quote

I'd argue that invisibility cloaks are rare and therefore not likely to be cheap. Difficult, Ministry restricted, and/or time intensive potions (polyjuice, veritaserum etc.) aren't likely to be cheap either. If OotP members do the brewing, then funds must be spent on ingredients. If they want to hide their involvement in the OotP then they might need to conceal the fact that they are buying large amounts of ingredients for suspicious potions. That might require underworld/blackmarket contacts, which adds additional costs.

There's also costly items such as brooms and (enchanted?) clothes, along with all of the other operational expenditures that [[/u/notfeelinthistbh]] and [[/u/HiddenAltAccount]] mentioned.

#+begin_quote

You mention the wartime expenditures of the Germans, but here we seem to be talking about the lifetime savings of a couple of "old money" families, net worth unknown. The OotP supporters had smaller wartime expenditures, yes, but also a correspondingly smaller fund to draw from. Did the "Light" and "Dark" families manage their finances well? Aside from the Malfoys' obvious wealth, that question seems to be up to fanon interpretation.

Considering the inventions (and presumably patents) of the Potter family, there would be Harry's school vault which we see, and then the main Potter vault which Harry would have access to upon legal age.

** if we're going by canon or close enough to it:

If it's just from his parent's, he'd likely have enough to comfortably get him through school, and enough to keep him comfortable to a little above average with the help of a decent job after the fact. The potter's were noted as having invented a very famous and well-selling hair potion, so they likely still get payments related to that. James and lily probably had savings of their own put aside, regardless of family inherited savings. Harry's trust vault was likely meant to pay for his schooling and a little more, and that's it. In terms of property, He obviously get's the cottage at Godric's Hollow, and /maybe/ another house owned by Jame's parents and/or Lily's parents (if she or Petunia didn't sell it off once they died). So he'd be a bachelor living above average for a number of years with at least one to three properties to his name, or a family man with a well-paying job living the same.

Counting in Sirius' contributions; he get's Grimuald Place, and anything Sirius had in terms of wealth or possessions both in that building and in his vault. Sirius seemed to be decently wealthy given the broom he bought Harry in PoA. Or perhaps more concerned with getting his godson a gift than finances - which makes it easiest to just assume he had a respectable but not insane amount of funds available to him. meaning Harry /reasonably/ received another property, and was pushed above upper-middle class in terms of wealth, or at the very least was solidly put there based on on-hand funds at least. A good job would see him living upper-middle class or a little higher easily on his own, or just upper-middle class if he doesn't have like 30 kids.

Going into the past would be tricky, but he likely couldn't gain access to anything; this would of course depend on what laws are in place for inheritances, but generally speaking usually you don't get anything unless you specifically are stated to. He likely wouldn't be able to access funds of any kind if he's time-traveled back to any point before his own birth given this. Perhaps if someone outlined that everything should go to the closest living relative, maybe; but then it probably already would have gone to someone else in Harry's family before this point anyway, so he couldn't access it regardless.

*TL;DR:* I think no matter what way you look at it, he'd be middle to upper-middle just based on the savings he'd inherit if he spends wisely and is careful about it. Having a family would stretch this more and he'd likely need a job to maintain that same level of wealth, but it still wouldn't be a big stress on his finances if he's smart, especially if he has a spouse and they also work or have decent savings. Time travel would leave him with whatever is in his pockets most likely.

** I feel like this is kind of a broad question that comes down to exactly what kind of story you're trying to write. But if you're trying to stay as canon compliant as possible, I feel like the real question is, would the goblins even play ball? For them to be so seemingly vital to the economy, they must be willing to deal with the inheritances of important individuals somewhat fairly, but who even is Harry Potter to them?

Canonically, what we know about goblins is that they don't like humans much, and sometimes they rebel. If we're talking after the 7th book, they /especially/ don't like Harry much.

Going off that, I'd say that it's unlikely they'd ever offer him anything he didn't already have solid information on, at the very least.

That's not to say that I don't like stories that do that kind of thing, or that I don't think there's room to build on the idea of goblins as more than warlike misers, but if you're not wanting to branch out and expand things, well... I just don't think Harry's likely to get much more than is already in his own vault. There's a fair chance that other families would pick apart whatever was under the Black name before he can get to it, too (at least provided there's anything there to inherit) -- it's not exactly like the world Rowling created has much in the way of prisoner's rights. Who cares about the will of an escaped con?

Those questions need to be asked beforehand.

​

In my current fanfiction Harry has not inherited anything from his parents aside of the Vault he had access to. What happened to the rest, you may ask? I don't care and neither does the reader, because I do not mention it.

He happened to gain access to the Black Vault after the war but it was mostly empty, except for outdated fashion, furniture and a few pieces of rather nasty jewelry.

He sold Grimmauld Place, as the only remaining property of the Blacks, who have long been in the decline, and made a good chunk of gold out of it.

​

Thats enough in my opinion.

​

I strongly dislike reading about an Inheritance that doesn't even require further storytelling.

Here Harry, take this one atomize-all-wizards dagger and *wink wink* do what you want with it, sitting in Merlin's Manor, reading all the founders diaries.

He didn't pay bribes, he made donations. If you recall the books, it specifically stated that nobody knew exactly who was a death eater during the first war. Hagrid says this. And the imperius curse really does seem like a viable defense if you look at the class demonstration from Crouch - only one student resisted out of a class of forty. That means that the rest of them are vulnerable to the curse. Piu s Thicknesse was also put under the curse for a year. Crouch Jr, a Death Eater (one of the best too), was under the course for over a decade.

This clearly shows that the imperius defense isn't as simple as bribes as FF authors make it look like.

See, what do the Peverells stand to gain from such an alliance? (I mean it as a marital alliance, not a martial one). They possess the true cloak of invisibility, and if their daughter is the last of their line, then whoever she marries will inherit the cloak. What does the Potter family bring to the table in exchange for something as priceless as that? I hope you can understand where I'm going with this.

Of course, from the fact that the marriage happened at all, we can safely say that they're not a noble family by any means. Noble families (and I am using the real world version, not the fanon version) could use matrilineal marriages to ensure that their line did not die out, which would ensure that any children born out of that marriage kept the surname of the woman rather than the man.
