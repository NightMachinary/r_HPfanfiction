** Well the update bumped it to the top of a guys favourite list, thus i discovered it, and spent all day reading till the end of second year. Thus I have a new favourite multi chapter fic, and one of the better Slytherin Harry twin fics in existence.

On a side note, I have gained a huge dislike for the name "Peter". Between Pettigrew and Baelish and others, why do so many schemers and plotters and mastermind wannabes have to be named Peter?

*** 1. They thought Harry was a squib because of honestly good reasons, and thought him being raised muggle would be best for him.

2. It would ensure that at least one of their children wouldn't be killed by Dark Wizards.

3. Petunia and Lily reconciled during their pregnancies.

4. They only mistreated Harry because *SPOILER FOR SECOND YEAR* made them.

**** He didn't 'make them', but he had the effect on muggles that has them dislike him.\\
Saying he made them makes it sound like Harry did something personally to make them hate him.

***** A. I was trying to keep the cause vague.

B. Since we don't know why it is happening, but is emanating off him, it is possible that it has to do with his magic.
