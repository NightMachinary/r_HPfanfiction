Okay before you run away screaming, please hear me out. And I know I'm asking for way too much here

Is there any realistic romance stories with Amelia Bones and Harry? I'm not talking about canon age Amelia, but younger than 30. As in not Susan's guardian. Harry needs to be at least 16. Maybe a story where they are entered in a marriage contract? (Already read whiskey marriage). Or just found that they had very much in common after spending time together. I love Harry/Tonks but the age difference is only 7(?) Years, (and ive read everything) and I think it would be cool to see an age difference with 10-12 years. If there is a marriage contract, I would love to see the struggle with Amelia being much older and in a power position. Maybe Hermione/the Weasleys wouldnt approve and the struggle that comes with it.i want a more sure of himself Harry, not the clueless meek boy we see in other fics

So what I'm asking for is a romance story, with the Voldemort storyline being in the background.

Wondering if there are any other stories where the age difference with Harry and the woman is 10-15 years. Can be a professor as long as they're not canon age. Not one shots or short stories. At least 20k wording. No sex in every other paragraph, but something realistic. Nothing where he sleeps with everyone around him, but one maybe two love interests

Thank you!


** Well, not Amelia, but there's a new one called linkffn(What we Lost) with Andromeda. Wouldn't exactly call it a romance, but its close. There's another with Narcissa, that I think its called linkffn(What are you doing in my Room) but I didn't read it completely.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

** In For the Love of Magic linkffn(11669575) Harry's got a thing for older ladies. He is hooking up for Narcissa Malfoy, one of his female teachers and various other girls a few years older than him.

Maybe it's what you are looking for.

***** Not OP, but it tries to be smut with plot and yet the plot isn't good and the smut is too short in many cases. Same issues like "The free use experience", it has a lot of plot not related to the smut or a lot of smut not related to the plot, which makes it feel weird.

Admittedly, I only skimmed a few chapters, but it does not feel like a coherent story, more like two stories with completely different writings styles and focuses fused together rather badly. The main plot is bland (not good, not bad, not outstanding in any way) while the smut is generally good but could do with longer scenes occasionally (and sometimes it is a little odd how domineering Harry can be).

***** Too much sleeping around for my taste. I'm not looking for stories where there is smut just for the sake of smut, or where he sleeps with everything with a pulse. I'm looking for romantic stories. But thanks for the suggestion. Someone else might love it

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
