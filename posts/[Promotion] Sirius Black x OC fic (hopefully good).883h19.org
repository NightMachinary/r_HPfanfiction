Hey guys! I know from experience that there's quite a shortage of Sirius Black fics that don't involve Time-Turners or Wolfstar, so I figured I'd do a little self-promotion.

Everything went west when Easton Greengrass was sorted into Slytherin.

Easton wasn't ambitious. Easton wasn't cunning. Easton lacked any sense of self-preservation in every meaning there was (she came close to killing herself during Potions on numerous occasions). Easton Greengrass wasn't many things, much to her parents' dislike, and, oh dear Merlin, she most definitely wasn't a Slytherin.

You can check it out on fanfiction.net as well as on wattpad:

**** A second war era Sirius fic sounds pretty interesting. Young Sirius never interested me as much.

***** I'm with you there. There are shedloads of Marauders fics but not many about him post-Azkaban. I've never understood why that is when he seems such a complex and interesting character.

****** I totally agree with you about the complexity of the old Sirius' character, I love reading fics about him myself (though there aren't many, unfortunately). But is young Sirius not complex at all? Given, the majority of the fics about him are shite, maybe mine is too lol, but still I think that there is so much more about young Sirius than silly puns and the 'manwhore' attutude that's basically become canon at this point. Young Sirius is a traumatized teenager who'd never received love or support from his family and only found it with his true friends. Have you guys never thought about what he had to lose during the war? Yes, we were told that he was too rebellious and 'busy' to fall in love and have a relationship but is it really so? How did he take Regulus's death? Did he really never give a damn about his family or maybe at one point he just wanted to be accepted? I'm not trying to convince you guys otherwise, I totally respect your opinion but still i think young Sirius is no less complex than the old.

******* I'm sure he is an interesting character altogether. I have for my sins, even written a one shot about him as a youth though I don't often read them. I have enjoyed a few, but my point is that there is no shortage of Marauders era fics - but there really aren't many that explore what he was up to post Azkaban. Or when he was in Azkaban for that matter. And that continues to surprise me.

******** You're absolutely right here. I've been searching everywhere for a good post-Azkaban Sirius fic and only found about 3-5 (they weren't even that good). And mostly they're about Sirius's long-lost child and etc.etc. rather than about him.

********* I don't think many people look for those stories, so maybe that's why not many people write them. From experience I can say it is very frustrating writing into a vacuum. And I wonder if part of it is also because if it's a canon compliant story there isn't going to be a happy ending. I don't know. I just know he's my favourite character.

*** Wolfstar is the SiriusxRemus pairing:) Nope, it was intentional, "to go west" here means "to go wrong". It's a sort of play of words.
