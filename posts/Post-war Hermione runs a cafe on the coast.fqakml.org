:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic, but a lot of the details are fuzzy. It's either Harry/Hermione or Hermione/Draco.

From what I remember, after the war Hermione essentially runs away to the coast of England without telling anyone and is running a cafe (pretty sure it's a cafe, /might/ be a bookshop). No one knows where disappeared to, but somehow Harry (I think) finds her and tried to convince her to come home (I think).

That's as much as I kind of remember. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.

  After the final battle Hermione turns away from the wizarding world, why? After years hiding in the muggle world Harry tracks her down and tries to convince her to return, will he succeed? H/Hr pairing, EWE, drama, romance & a little bit of fluff.

** I think it was a Draco/Hermione and she got a library because the owners (very cute married couple) got old and wanted to sell?? And so she bought it because she loved it, and Draco was a patron and that's how he discovers her. And they fall in love while he tries to convince her to come back.

*** I think you're right? I know it's either DHr or HHr (because those are the only long fics I've read), and I couldn't remember which it was. But now that you say all that, DHr sounds really right to me.

  Hermione was not expecting Harry to outshine her in Potions, and she was certainly not expecting an unlikely friendship with Draco Malfoy to form because of it. Alternate HBP leading to DH.

  ‚ÄúHermione,‚Äù he said in a strained voice, ‚Äùplease don't take offense by how blunt I'm about to be, but I'm honestly afraid that if I explain this with any type of subtlety it will somehow continue to elude you.‚Äù Hermione's expression grew indignant but Draco ignored it and pressed on. ‚ÄúI am trying to seduce you,‚Äù he said, staring her straight in the eye. Her indignation faded as her mouth dropped open and her eyes slowly grew round. He continued, ‚ÄúI have been trying to seduce you for over two years; ever since I first brought up the idea of our having a book club together.‚Äù

  The Marriage Law, once enacted, has the power to destroy Hermione's perfectly normal life. Luckily, she and Ron are already planning to obey the horrific law together as a team... Until a Malfoy-shaped wrench gets thrown into the works. Dramione.
