** No. It is described as *a* black lake in PS, but not *the* black lake.

  The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. (Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 6)

This really shouldn't be taken as a name, because the same thing is said of the lake in the cave at the end of HBP. In fact, that lake is described as a black lake a total of five times across the course of HBP and DH, so it would be better suited to the title than the lake at Hogwarts, which is only ever referred to as "the lake".
