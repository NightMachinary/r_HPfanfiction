** This completed series meets a handful of the things you want. It's not DH compliant (or even most of canon), and not dark Harry. It's slow building the first story or two, but after that I thought it was fine. Very, very AU, extremely long.

Now.. I always rec linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by EmeraldAshes) and... It kinda does fit 5 out of your 6 points but... It's most likely not what you're looking for... Still, give it a look, read the first couple of chapters!

*** The author's been updating his Patreon semi-regularly, but I think he's also been sick, so if it's not abandoned, it's probably not going to see more than one or two chapters a year.

But yeah, I don't think he's labeled it as such yet.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6463116/1/Lucky-Harry]]) not greater than 100,000 but a good read. There are others, but off the top of my head those three are good to kill a few days.
