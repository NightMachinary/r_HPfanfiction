They appeared fleetingly in the Philosopher's Stone film (I think) and have since cropped occasionally in fanfiction. What are your theories about why in Merlin's name they are part of the curriculum? Both thoughtful and ridiculous theories are welcome. Also your favourite appearances of iguanas in fanfiction.

I recently read a story in which Snape and Sinistra have a sort of frenemy/shut up and kiss already relationship in which he loves to needle her about being afraid of Quirrell's iguanas.


** The impression I got from that film was that it was a fire-breathing iguana, so definitely a magical variation of the normal iguana

** I'm almost completely stumped. If I had to guess, and this is with no evidence, pure guesswork I would suggest that either they can be dissected and used in powerful potions or rituals or that they have some in built reaction to magic, especially dark magic. An organic dark magic detector if you will, therefore they make good pets for paranoid wizards since they can alert people to threats. A foe detecor/sneakoscope/dark magic detector all rolled into one. Quirrel had his under the imperious the whole time to prevent it's reactions and that's why he seemed so trustworthy.

** The only thing I can recall is that the iguana has a peculiar place in mayan mythology. They seemed to believe that the sky was in the shape of an iguana and the roof of the house of Itzamna, the Sky God or, in some translations, a God of Sorcery.

The iguana was also the companion of a Mocha god, called in English "Wrinkle Face".

In Filipino tales the iguana often comes up as the naive, and easily deceived fool.

But to be honest, I guess the iguana only looks somewhat stoic, calm and a bit like a dragon, so it fit the scene.

*** wow, that's actually a pretty awesome answer :o

I like the Filipino angle - it gives a whole new spin to the scene with Quirrell holding one!

** They're telepathic iguanas native to Hogwarts. They have a built in SEP field so that while you can technically see them nobody ever pays them any attention and generally forget that they exist. We only know about them because they were caught on camera.

They were imported by Slytherin himself to kill off the Borrower immigrants he hired to carve micro-runes throughout the castle so he wouldn't have to pay them. Modern garden gnomes are squib decedents of the Borrowers that escaped the Founding Slaughter.

** I think it's that Quirrell basically points out that something as innocent as an iguana could be hiding something dangerous.
