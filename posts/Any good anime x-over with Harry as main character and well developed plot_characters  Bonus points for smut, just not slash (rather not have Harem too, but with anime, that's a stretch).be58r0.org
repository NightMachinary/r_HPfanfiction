Doesn't necessarily has to be anime though, if its a good x-over, I'd like it too. Just not sci-fi fics like stargate or star wars.

EDIT: Oh, I'd def prefer if its older Harry, bonus points if he has a kid.

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees.

  Sequel to The Girl Who Loved. Please read that one first. Harry returns to Hogwarts for his sixth year with his Intended at his side. Did I mention that she's the Crown Princess of the Moon Kingdom? Or that she's dead? HP/Ranma.5/SailorMoon multicross

**** You may want to get some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ranma_%C2%BD_characters][background]] on characters for Ranma, but the following from a wiki gives the basic premise:

"The story revolves around a teenage boy named [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranma_Saotome][Ranma Saotome]] who has trained in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts][martial arts]] since early childhood. As a result of an accident during a training journey, he is cursed to become a girl when splashed with cold water, while hot water changes him back into a boy. Throughout the series Ranma seeks out a way to rid himself of his curse, while his friends, enemies and many fiancées constantly hinder and interfere.

/Ranma ½/ has a comedic formula and a sex-changing main character, who often willfully transforms into a girl to advance his goals. The series also contains many other characters, whose intricate relationships with each other, unusual characteristics, and eccentric personalities drive most of the stories. Although the characters and their relationships are complicated, they rarely change once they are firmly introduced and settled into the series."
