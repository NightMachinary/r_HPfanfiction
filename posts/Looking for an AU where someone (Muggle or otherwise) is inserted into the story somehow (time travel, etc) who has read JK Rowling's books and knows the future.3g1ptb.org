  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4499794/1/Being-Gilderoy-Lockhart][Being Gilderoy Lockheart]]

Again same premise, I'm not sure which one of these it was but one of the two stories has a pretty creepy semi sociopath person who is memory wipe happy and a complete mary sue as an insert (Perfect lionheart tier)

There is also a pretty long one called a matter of force, where the SI is harry's twin sister, but it is non serious and a bit cracky (one plot point is taking like 5 chapters / a few months, in a time travel device with 15 people to learn how to play rock guitars, blegh, no one would agree to that in real life). I didn't really like it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9504631/1/Harper-Potts-the-Girl-Who-Died-Hogwarts-Year-1][Harper Potts the Girl who Died Hogwarts Year 1]]

This one has a realistic SI, not the greatest fic but way better than most in the genre

There are also a bunch of SI's in journal format on spacebattles, I don't remember too much about them other than getting the feeling that the SI's were competent and that I enjoyed reading them.

Here are some links

** There are quite a few of these stories to choose from. Most hinge on dimensional travel, summoning or being reborn into the HP verse. Many, maybe most, are self-insert stories. Your questions comes up occasionally on this subreddit. You can find recent posts about the subject [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=self+insert&restrict_sr=on][here]]. You'll find recommendations that fit your request in those posts. From what I can tell, there are only a handful of stories of this type that are considered to be decent. It's easy for the story to end up as a Gary-Stu or Mary-Sue story.

3 that come to mind are: /My Gilded Life/ linkffn(3695419). Inserted character assumes the life of Gilderoy Lockhart.

/The Perks of Survival/ [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][Hosted on the Spacebattles forum]]. This was also the [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] bookclub's story of the month for July.

/In Bad Faith/ linkffn(9399640). This is my favorite. Slow read, but enjoyable.

I'm guessing he got a lot of negative comments and decided to back out, which is too bad. Yes, self-inserts are a pariah in the fanfic world. But it's not because the plot device is inherently bad, it's just that a lot of horrible writers have used it.

I mean, when I'm in a mood to just veg out and read mindless dribble, I'll even read those ridiculous stories where Harry is sent back in time with every conceivable magical power an author can come up with, put up with 10,000 words of a Diagon Alley shopping trip, and watch him marry 12 girls within his first year. Ya know. After a six pack and needing to just giggle. Raising Atlantis as an 11 year old? OK.

** I never really got these stories, shouldn't they only be like one chapter long? You wake up in the HP universe going to Hogwarts with Harry and it's first year. All you do is go to Dumbledore and say;

"This is gonna sound crazy but hear me out. Quirrel has Voldemort sticking out of his head. Next year Ginny Weasley is gonna be given a cursed diary by Lucius Malfoy. It's a Horcrux that Voldemort made and it will possess her to make her open the Chamber of Secrets. That's in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom by the way, but you need a parseltongue to get in there, good news though Harry Potter happens to be one. Next, Sirius Black is innocent, Ron Weasley's pet rat is actually Peter Pettigrew who is an animagus, you should really work on freeing Sirius. Alright now the Horcrux's, Ravenclaws Diadem is in the Room of Requirement on the 7th floor, I'll show you that. Hufflepuff's cup is in the Lestrange Gringott's vault, Slytherin's locket is actually at Grimmauld Place so we do need Sirius for that. The resurrection stone, yea I know where it is but you need to calm down it's cursed and it will kill you if you use it. That's at the Gaunt shack in Little Hangleton. Sometime between now and Harry's fourth year Voldemort is also gonna turn his pet snake into one. Oh and Harry's one as well... we'll have to figure out a way to get that removed... That's the only important bits, so lets go kill us a dark lord!"

******* Think about how much material you learned in school at 11, now imagine relearning it as an adult, it would be 10x easier since you aren't a lazy little unmotivated kid, same thing for magic, you don't have to have basic concepts explained to you slowly as a child, you can make connections easier, read more complicated books, retain more information, and from the vague knowledge you have from hundreds of fanfics you can see the efficient paths to power when they come up.

You would also study more efficiently, be able to skim better and make more efficient notes. You would be more inclined to experiment with magic and try to exploit loopholes (even basic knowledge that most hogwarts students wouldn't have can be useful, like dry powder clouds causing explosions when lit, some knowledge of physics, etc). SI's have a huge advantage in learning magic compared to normal kids.
