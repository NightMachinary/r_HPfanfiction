:END:
Ok so i am looking for an older Harry Potter story that was on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] The story revolved around harry and his relation ship with Hermione, Daphne, Tracy, Susan and a few others. The most notable things I can remember are The Potter Longbottom alliance being reaffirmed by Harry and Nevile smacking each other with fish, Harry and his friends charming the Armor in Hogwarts to recite Monty Python quotes, and Tracy accidentally making a slime that eats Umbrige. If anyone knows the story I am talking about.

â€‹

Edit: Small fact which i just remembered Haryy wasn't raised by the durslys and only meet them when he and his friends saved Dudly from Vernon

  When Harry offered himself up to Voldemort, he discovered the people in the Ministry of Death are not happy with him at all. To make up for his years of blunders, Harry is sent back in time to correct everything that went wrong and to get some revenge. Harry/6 girls, Bashing of Dumbledore, Snape, and certain Weasleys. Written for humor only. Lots of cliches. Reviews welcome.

**** I have thousands of fanfictions, including probably more than a dozen multi pairings, so I have absolutely no idea. They all kind of blur together over time. But I do remember the Monty Python armor and the slime eating Umbrige.
