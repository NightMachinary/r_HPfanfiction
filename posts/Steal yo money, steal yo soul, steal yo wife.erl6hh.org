So, I just finished the Gentleman Bastard series by Scott Lynch (a phenomenal Fantasy Thief novel series) and now I'm dead inside and want to read about some people stealing some things. Has the HP Fandom (which really sounds like we're all big fans of brown sauce, now I think about it) got anything for that?

As always, any pairing, slash or not, any weird stuff, cliches welcome, tropes of all kinds taken, etc etc. You got it, I want a rec of it. :)


** Linkffn(A Black Comedy) has Harry and Sirius becoming the Death Eater Bandits. It's a crude comedy but if you enjoy that kind of humor you'll like it. I've heard people describe it as an American Bro Adventure Comedy which isn't necessarily inaccurate.

Linkffn(The Lady Theif) is one I've never read but I've seen recommended a lot.

*** It does have a very... Wild Thing vibe to it, yeah. Pretty sure they actually got out some tiki torches at some point, so...

And me neither! Thanks for the rec.

**** No problem. Wild Thing is a movie I take it? I struggle to get into movies and tv but if it has a similar comedic vibe to ABC I might check it out.

***** Reference to an Episode of Quantum Leap, actually. The episode was called Animal House, after the National Lampoon Movie, but the main character was nicknamed 'Wild Thing' after the Troggs song.

Now I google it to check those details though, I think I got the reference wrong. It's in a frat, but it's not very bro-comedy. Apparently the episode is about trying to stop a protester of the vietnam war planting a bomb on their campus. Pretend I said American Pie or House Bunny or something. Those're probably what you're looking for, I think. Lots of raunch and crudeness in those movies.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
