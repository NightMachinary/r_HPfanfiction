Similar to the premise of Shinji and Warhammer 40K linkffn(3886999) (please update soon!) in which Shinji Ikari (from Evangelion, in case you've never watched it) finds a box with figurines of the Warhammer universe and that leads him to pretty much become the Avatar of the God Emperor of Mankind.

With Harry's imagination and a little bit of accidental magic, the whole world could change.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

  Shinji Ikari finds a boxful of insanity and becomes even more unhinged than before. Somehow, this is A Good Thing. As the grim dark future melts into stark bleak present, upon a throne of tropes humanity might find the savior it so requires. [story RESUMING]
