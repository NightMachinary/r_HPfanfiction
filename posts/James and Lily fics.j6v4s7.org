Please share your favorite lily and James fics (or just any good ones tbh)

I wonder if there is a James and lily sub


** Hey there, I rec'd a bunch the other day on this post: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/j2xaor/lf_favourite_marauders_era_fics_wolfstar_is_fine/g79kne5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]]

Also, there isn't a Jily sub, as far as I'm aware. But the fandom is pretty active on Tumblr, if you use that platform.

  If pressed, later, she'd say it was exhaustion that caused her to forget who she was talking to, and it was that same exhaustion which prevented her from foreseeing the inevitable fall-out of telling James Potter, "Ugh, no thanks, I hate flying." / Lily/James, seventh year.
