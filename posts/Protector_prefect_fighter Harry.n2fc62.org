I'm looking a few types of fics that are similar to each other. If a fic contains all I want it's perfect but I accept if it only contains some of it.

I'm looking for fics where Harry is Hogwarts protector, like in Harry Crow for example. Which means the castle tells him about problems and show him shortcuts. In return he protects the students from bullying and danger.

I'm also looking for fics where he's a prefect and taking it seriously, helping the younger years with homework and getting to their classes. While also fight bullying.

I would also like fics where if Hogsmead is attacked when students are there, Harry, and perhaps some friends/DA members, fight. They/he help hold the opponents of while the rest of the students flee to safety.

I would like the DA to be in the fic if possible.

Fics starting in 4th/5th and 6th year is my favourites but for some stories, especially those following the protector story I accept earlier years.

No MC slash but it's okay in the background. Otherwise I'm ok with most pairings except big age differences involving students. Honks is acceptable though.

If you have a fic you're unsure fits, put it down, I'll probably still like it.

Thx for any help.


** If you're okay with self-recs and fem!harry, mine has an mc who basically adopts outcasts from first year onwards :)

  Rose Potter spent twenty-one years as the Chosen One. Reborn as Harry Potter's twin, he alone has the scar after that Samhain night. Harry knows there's something odd about his sister - she's too old, too mature, and knows far too many things she shouldn't - but he loves her anyway. He's been there for her ever since they were born, so Rose'll be damned if she lets history repeat itself.(In her past life, Hogwarts didn't unite until the very end and everyone suffered for it) (Lily Potter was willing to do anything and sacrifice everything for the safety of her family. Rose intended to do nothing less)In which not all Slytherins are evil, not all Gryffindors are good, and the Wizarding World is more than just an extension of the Muggle one.Years 1-3

  When the dementor attack presents Harry with an opportunity to begin to fight back he gladly sets himself on the path to have a hand in his future. But as time goes on, it's clear that not all is the same as it once was. Why has his scar stopped hurting? What are these seemingly random objects he's drawn to? How deep does the connection between him and Voldemort truly run? Post GoF
