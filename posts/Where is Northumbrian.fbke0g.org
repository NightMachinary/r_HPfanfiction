Title says it all, where is he? He hasn't uploaded anything in about a year and a half. I really like his stories and quite miss his writing. Does anyone know? Hope he's doing fine.


** He did an AMA on the Hinny discord a while back and basically just said he's very busy, has been away, and spends a lot of time rewriting stuff when he's not happy with it.

The AMA is still up if you want to join and read through it, just PM me and I'll give you an invite link.

** I was following that AMA, but still my feeling that he is done with fanfiction. Which is really pity, because linkao3(8402590) will probably never be finished.
