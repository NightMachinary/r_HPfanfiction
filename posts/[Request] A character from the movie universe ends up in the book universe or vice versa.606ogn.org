** You know that in the movies, a lot of Ron's dialogue was transplanted to Hermione, to make the latter look good and the former bad.

It'd be funny if you had book Ron in the movie universe, managing to say his lines at the same time Hermione says his lines. That little bit of awkwardness could develop into a snazzy love story.

** Ooh, I just thought of another one; Seamus Finnigan. He apparently becomes notorious enough for his habit of making things explode in the films, why not stick him in the books and see how much stuff gets blown up?

*** "Oops, sorry about that mate!"

Harry climbed to his feet, shaking some debris and stone powder out of his hair as he did so. Luckily, he'd been the only one caught in the explosion due to leaning against the wall Seamus had accidentally hit, although everyone else at the DA meeting was nonetheless looking a little worse for wear. Seamus' sparring partner was as pale as a sheet and looking like he might be about to throw up, or fall to his knees and thank his lucky stars he dodged instead of blocked the spell.

Harry coughed from the settling stone dust as he rose to his feet, staggering around to look at the massive hole in the wall behind him, a somewhat dazed look in his eye. Rows upon rows of shelves were visible, stacked with all sorts of assorted items. Weapons, trunks, old robes, books and wands, all were scattered haphazardly around the place, although they might have been that way before Seamus' spell hit, judging by the dust. Some of the closest shelves were blackened from the blast, with a few of them still on fire.

Stumbling slightly and holding his ribs, Harry just noticed through the ringing in his ears that something clanged against his shoe. Bending down slowly, so as not to aggravate his aches, he picked up a blackened, twisted scrap of metal. It had some jewels embedded in it, but the empty sockets hinted that once upon a time (two or so minutes ago) it might have held more. Turning it over in his hands, he couldn't help but feel this piece of very fine scrap metal might have enormous value, but for what, he couldn't say. It was the niggling feeling, that slight itch in his scar, and instincts honed by constant life-threatening situations that told him to be on his guard.

But as he held it in his hands, he felt nothing from it. Not even the slight tingle one felt in their fingertips from holding an enchanted item, let alone the almost tangible magic some of the greater enchanted items gave off.

"Oh, sorry mate, I hope that wasn't important?" Finnigan spoke up, spotting the object in Harry's hands.

Harry thought for a moment, before tossing the oddly diadem-shaped piece of jewelry back into the storage room.

"Nah, probably not. Now let's all get out of here, there's no way Umbridge didn't hear that."

** Neville Longbottom would look like a tomato for some time after puberty hit. Girls would hit on him all day and night.

Hermione Granger might understand the small brain capacity of teenage males and just not have the jealousy of sixth year be a thing.

Now that I think about it, most of the movie characters look better than book readers initially visualized.

*** That's...oh dear. I just had a bad thought.

You know that kerfuffle when Noma Dumezweni was cast as Hermione? A few racists came out of the woodwork, JK Rowling snarked, and it turned out that Hermione's skin color was never specified in the books?

It would be awkward if a black Book!Hermione, awkward, studious but anti-social, occasionally lacking in knowledge about the wizarding world, and not as brave as Ron, ran into Movie!Hermione, who's braver, knows more, less awkward, prettier, and white.

"Oh my god, my alternate-universe counterpart is a Mary Sue for white supremacists."

Does my train of thought make any sense to you?

******* She might be sheltered but she'd still see racism. Middle class, upper class, lower class: racism happens. It doesn't magically get shielded from people just because they have money and all it takes is one angry kid who's dumb as fuck with racist parents to torment her with racist diatribes because she's intelligent.

*** "I'd like to call this meeting of the Multiversal Bumblebees to order...please stop giggling, people, you voted on the name."

"Our first order of business, the referendum on the formal definition of the Greater Good...I'm afraid we don't have a supermajority opinion on this, but the most popular option was 'Preserve the good health, happiness and culture of all sentient beings', with the runner up being 'Enhance our own political power and destroy that upstart Riddle'...we do have a lot of 'evil' Dumbledores here, don't we? And one 'Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, hear the lamentations of their women'...I suspect that was you, barbarian!Dumbledore, thank you for leaving your sword at the reception by the way..."

"Now, our second order of business, it has come to my attention that a lot of our more...manipulative members have been experiencing a rash of cognitive difficulties similar to the effects of obliviation and/or confounding charms. Upon doing research I have determined that the cause is frequently 'fanfic authors'...yes, I can see everyone shuddering, 'authors' who are purposefully 'dumbing you down' to let their version of Harry shine. Fortunately, since our last meeting I've been able to set up a rehabilitation program to help you all recover to your normal degree of competence. We have open-book theory exams with anti-cheating quills set up to establish the extent of your dumb-ification, and one of our goblin!Dumbledores is standing by with a custom-designed torture device which, I understand, will be excruciatingly painful and humilating but will cleanse you of any artificially acquired bad karma..."
