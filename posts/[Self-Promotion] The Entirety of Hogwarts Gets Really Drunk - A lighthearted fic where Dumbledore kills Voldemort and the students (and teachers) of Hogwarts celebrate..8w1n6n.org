Hi guys! I wrote a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5tl03o/something_i_wrote_because_my_mind_needed/][crackfic]] about a year ago that you people seemed to enjoy, and I've been working on this for a few months. It's a lot less crackficy, but still very lighthearted, as the title should tell you =P I wasn't quite satisfied when I finished the scene with the students, so I decided to add another scene that I felt would just tie it up better. Thanks a lot if you're reading!

Minor edit: I appear to have messed up my formatting because the row of asterisks that I usually use as "scene breaks" doesn't appear on FFnet. I fixed it, but it takes a bit to update. Since there's only one scene break, hopefully it won't be too annoying =x

** Not bad, I enjoyed the first half very much. However I do think your characterization of Snape is a bit off; he gets over his initial reluctance of drinking with Lupin far too fast and then acts out of character.

All in all a nice little one shot.

*** I definitely see what you mean there; perhaps I should have added a little more of a resigned "If Dumbledore wants this, he /is/ going to have it" feeling to Snape at the beginning. The rest, I think, is explainable by alcohol and the fact that, now he's finally achieved his life's goal, he is beginning to think over his life- at least, that was the effect I tried to achieve :x But of course, fundamentally it's a light-hearted fic so perhaps I stretched Snape's character too far.

Thank you very much!

**** Hmmm I can agree with your vision and I can see what you wanted to do. I dont think it's that much of a stretch if that happens /in time/. A day after the battle is too soon for reconciliation, a few months or a year? Much better.

Good point on the alchohol, that may change his actions, but to what extent I have no idea.

Regardless very nice job, would be I interested in more like this.

***** Agreed, I didn't want to stretch the timeline I suppose so I wrote it rather unrealistically.

Thank you, I may write a sequel, whether direct or more spiritual later! :)
