I just finished Vox Corporius and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, some of my favorites are fics dealing with the political intrigue that comes from Harry accepting his mantle as Lord Potter and dealing with the resultant expectations on him. I don't mind heir stories, some can be pretty fun, and I prefer Harry/Hermione as the base pairing though others (Harry/Daphne, Harry/Pansy, Harry/Tonks) are fun too. Do you know of anything like this?

*** What points do purebloods have that they actually need to defend against muggleborns and Dumbledore? If you say "pureblood culture", then please name a canon example of such, and best one that the muggleborns would actually want gone.

***** Well, if we leave canon - I tried to show a pureblood society in "Patron" that is different from the muggle one. In some ways far more liberal than modern western society, in other ways far more archaic, but always more fantastic - a society where magic is used constantly, for everything. I also wanted to show that laws are one thing, custom another, and how things are is different from how things are seen. Though while the story shows the darker parts of that society as well, it's still clearly the "good side" when compared to the Death Eaters.

Cynically, I'd say any story where Harry discovers he is actually the Lord Whatever, and can control the Wizengamot thanks to his birthright, should qualify for your request, since opposing an aristocracy by using aristocratic claims is basically just a struggle between nobles in a system that remains undemocratic and prone to abuse. Even if such stories usually don't touch this inherent contradiction, and gloss over all the problems with having a monarchy or aristocracy, I think that comes closest. Anything more would require you to either drop the racism from the purebloods (which means they stop being a pureblood movement) or make the other side more evil (which is kind of hard, seeing as it would require changing the real world to fit the story).

But as long as you have one side with modern western democratic ideals and one side that's neither modern nor democratic, then even though one side might not be objectively good, the other side clearly is evil.

Basically, I think a conflict between the "good guys" is the easiest way to achieve a political story without clear-cut good and evil sides.

*** Then you should like *Emperor* by Marquis Black.

Imho, there is really no 'good side' in this story, all factions are after their own ambitions and power, without regards for the human cost. That Harry Potter is not that much better than Tom Riddle.

** The one that comes to mind for me is Full Pensieve's /Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion/ ([[http://fp.fanficauthors.net][link]]), which is unfinished and, admittedly, so sprawling as to fit nearly any request thread.

As for why it fits your request: Much is made of Harry's inheritance and his position in a wider world that accepts Voldemort has returned; it's so old that it invented or contributed to a ton of post-OotP "Independent Harry" cliches, but the writing is so strong, and the plotting so inventive, that it actually made me understand why a lot of those cliches were popular enough to become cliche in the first place. (i.e. imagine a "Dumbledore who is manipulative," not a "Manipulative Dumbledore.")

** linkffn(Reign of Power). The quintessential heir fic: classic and unfortunately showing its age. Still one of my favorites though. No pairing.

linkffn(Firebird's Son). Very AU, very grim. Deals strongly with politics, but not really an heir fic; definitely not a Lord Potter fic. This is the first of three in the series, and all are complete. Pairing is complicated.
