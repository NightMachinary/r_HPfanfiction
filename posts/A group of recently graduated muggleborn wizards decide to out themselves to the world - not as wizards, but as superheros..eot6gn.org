Having grown up on a steady diet of superhero movies and comics, they decide to become the real thing. By the time the wizards figure out what's going on, the group is too public to just disappear. They've saved hundreds of lives and been on international news. The world is both thrilled and frightened by the existence of “superheros.” Merchandise is flying off the shelves at a record rate. New movie deals are being signed. The young “heros” find themselves rich and at the center of the world's attention.

Unfortunately, a dark wizard decides to mirror their idea, and becomes the world's first supervillain.
