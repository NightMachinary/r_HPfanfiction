As Durmstrang is a multinational school accepting students from all over Northern, Central and Eastern Europe, I've always wondered which language they use for teaching. I think an argument can be made for French. French used to be the language of continental European nobility. So it would be fitting if Durmstrang, which appears to be a rather elitist school, uses it.


** Though French has its merits, I would argue for German, making Durmstrang a remnant of the Germanic empires --- note that Beauxbâtons is obviously the French-speaking school, and it and Durmstrang appear to be polar opposites, some might assume rivals.

*** I also assumed it'd be German, largely due to the fact the Beauxbatons already exists as a French-speaking school.

*** ALSO (adding in as an Eastern European myself), after English (especially these days), German is the main language a lot of Eastern Europeans learn-- which would fit in with the demographic of Durmstrang.

*** But I would think that the culture of Durmstrang presented to us in Canon is more East European/Northern Slavic than German. Germany isn't that cold. (at least if Durmstrang is in the mountains)

** Since the name of the place is a play on Sturm und Drang - an 18th century German literary movement that contrasted the French Rationalism that had been holding sway, I would infer that the language of instruction would be German.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** I've always thought it was in the Slavic language family. Speakers of Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian Etc. They can all understand each other give or take a few phrases and words. Even Polish, Russian, and Czech. I figured it's a jumble between them because if you know one, the others aren't difficult to learn.

** It is a bit unrelated, but to call the school Durmstrang makes no sense, because the Sturm und Drang is an 18th century literary movement and the school was founded in the 11th or 12th century, also the school doesn´t admit muggleborns and a known deatheater was it´s headmaster, so I doubt they would call a school after a muggle literary movement, if they renamed it for some reason. To be fair it could be a joke on pureblood wizards by someone more tolerant, but the change must´ve happened sometime after 1820 and someone must´ve noticed by then, and if they already changed the name once a second time shouldn´t be a problem. There is however no evidence that the name of the school was changed. Now back to the topic: When we look at the coat of arms it has the name Durmstrang written in some European script and Cyrillic script, so my guess is that it is a bilingual school, one language that is spoken is a slavic language and the second must be either French or German or maybe latin, for German speaks the name of the school, French used to be the language of nobility and because affluent magicians often mingled with muggle nobility, there could be some overlap, then there is a case for latin, because it used to be a widespread language that was used in universities and for trade. Just a warning, I´m not a linguist nor a historian, so take everything I wrote with a grain of salt.

** Probably German or a slavic language. It depends on precisely where the school is, who founded it, and when it eas established.

*** Durmstrang was founded by Nerida Vulchanova, a Bulgarian witch, sometime in the 13th or 14th century.

As for the question about the language, I sort of fumbled my way through it without giving a definite answer in my fic, despite setting a whole year in the school.
