So I was reading this fic, and there was a certain secret a person had, that they were a time traveller. Now the very beginning of the fic its stated that it must be kept a secret. So why do people insist on telling it to every second Jerry that they come across? Like almost everyone whose name is mentioned in the story knows the secret. Why? Similarly if the protagonist creates a safe haven, maybe under Fidelius, whatever, and only they or maybe one other person had access to it, making it the best get away. Why do they insist on letting more and more people in?

What do you guys think of this and do you do it? Or stop reading the fic if it happens? Let me know.

EDIT : Think there is a misunderstanding. See, when I meant revealing the secret, i understand a secret has to be revealed at some point or the other, atleast to one person. Otherwise there really is no point to it. However in this post I'm referencing to those secrets, that everyone would acknowledge as it being best kept as a secret but is revealed half way through the story. By revealing I'm not referring to a shock-factor, open reveal and face the consequences kind, but more of in Chapter 2 : tell one person, make them swear not to tell anyone, Chapter 3: tell 2 more people, same T&Cs, Chapter 4: 2 more and so on, that half way through the story, there are atleast half the school or known population who are aware of the same.


** Frankly it depends on the reason for it; if they have a justifiable reason to let people in on the secret I don't mind - same with the safe-haven aspect.

If they don't I put it on my 'Ban List' of fanfics with the descriptor: "idiotic mc" or "illogical decisions" and never think on it again.

** In most of these fics it's because the author's main motivation in writing the fic in the first place is the "big reveal" moment where people are gobsmacked when they discover the secret. And the writer enjoys that moment so much that they think "let's just reveal the secret to a different person each chapter and do it over and over!".

*** Taure speaks the truth. FanFiction is often cathartic and the writer often wants to hit their own buttons as often as they can. The big reveal, the shocking display of power, the super cool I'm smarter than the world character---common tropes in lots of genres of FanFiction.

** Thats pretty much all of fiction, it's ussually very rare for a secret to not get revealed to tons of people. Think of Persona 5 and the amount of people who know jokers a phantom thief, almost everyone he spends time with finds out on like their 12th time interacting with eachother.

I think this happens because secrets sort of feel like an occam's razor if the secret is revealed to the audience before certain characters, with it feeling like the audience is cheated of payoff if the secret is not revelead to the people affected by the secret.

I dont even think I do know of many secrets that were revealed to the audience early on but never to alot of character, almost every superhero ends up demasking themselves to a good thirty to forty people each iteration, especially of that character is slated for death lol.

*** I think the key is to focus the secret on who it directly affects. Super hero unmasking is about public scrutiny, but secrets like hidden loyalties/relationships, secret knowledge, or secret plans have a narrower focus. So long as the MC is keeping smart about it, maybe they chat with the bartender about their affair/crush but not the affected parties, even though we hope that by the end of the story the tension from the secret gets resolved.

** I have speculations.

1. A writer is writing to share what is in their mind. It can be hard to separate wanting to reveal a story in their writing and also write about not revealing things. Especially if the focus of the story is something other than 'keeping secrets'.
2. Probably tricky to have a main character not sharing a few things but still being open and engaged on other things. This comes into play when wanting the character to have close relationships, etc.
3. Without a full outline that incorporates a secret held for a long time it can be hard to maintain the focus to hold back on the secret when so much can happen if other characters are brought in on the secret, one at a time or several at once.

** The main example I come across is they want to make a safe haven for everyone to be safe in which is why the reveal the secret to them, but it's usually a safe location under a Fidelious Charm. Revealing to everyone that you're a time traveler is usually a bad idea though. They'll expect too much. At the same time, being the lazy person that I am...if I was a time traveler I would find someone trustworthy and tell them everything I knew so that the responsibility/burden could be shared.

** Chekhov's Secret. You never tease a secret in a story without it getting out. You never introduced flaws like a twisted upbringing or a checkered past without exposing them at some point in the story. Secrets that never get out in a story may as well not even be included in the first place if they're not going to contribute to the plot or the drama.

*** I think the MC can keep some secrets to themselves, so long as we can see the character drama in their own mind it can work well. Or a secret doesn't come out because the concerning party/event is no longer an issue. It can feel a little unresolved, but a confession to a gravestone and other such regrets are a big part of real life and should be in stories.

** In my opinion/ preference, I honestly don't like it when the traveler reveals the secret to anyone. Maybe 1or 2is acceptable for me. But if it's the whole gang or team? It's a nope for me.. Or I just drop it.

BUT! It depends on the reason whyyy they reveal it ya know? If they really NEED that character because they have no choice, because they already use ALL resources then, that's alright for me. But if the only reason why they found out about the secret because they accidentally heard or due to eavesdropping. Then obliviate.

I actually look for the importance of the characters that knows the secret.. Because, if they're just there? What's the point? Because they like that character? Or for extra drama? Will they achieve the goal with or without them? Most fanfic that I read that knows the secret is Snape because he vow to protect Harry and he'll be a good ally to achieve the goal because he spies on the Dumbles and to Voldie

This is one of the reason why I don't often read Harry travelling back to the Marauders era as Harry himself and then he use a different name but because they have the Marauders map, then they'll know the truth and in the end Harry has to reveal everything. I just read Harry being MOD because he'll be able to change his name because MAGIC!

sooo yeah! Whattabout u guys?
