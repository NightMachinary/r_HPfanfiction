Right, I am writing a fanfiction about Harry's journey to becoming the slayer of Voldemort, but it's a more epic version, whereas Voldermort expands beyond England, a lot more like Grindelwald.

Now I'm at a convergence point that will greatly affect Harry, I have plans for Sirius so he has to stay alive for a bit longer, but I need someone else to die in his place, but I don't know who's death would truly affect Harry and be a cause of change in his character.

It can't be Hermione or Ron either, so I don't know who to kill.


** Kill more Weasleys, especially Arthur.

It will be emotionally impactful, plot moving, and more fair to other families (such as sparing Tonks in exchange).

** Before answering your question, we may need to know a little more about what are the changes you made from canon in your fic, especially concerning your MC (Harry), and his relations. As an example, canon Harry would be devastated by Hagrid death, while a Slytherin Harry (who was introduced to the Magical World by someone else) would probably not care much, outside of the "Wow, someone I kinda know died".

Now, if we assume that your Harry is the same than canon, Arthur Weasley is probably your best choice (as some people already said). He is one of the few positive adult influence in Harry's life, while not playing the role of the mentor (which would force you to treat him with more care). He is also stupidly lovable (his only fault being his lack of knowledge about the Muggle world, but I personally find his enthousiasm more endearing than annoying), and his death would cause some interesting changes in the whole Weasley family (especially with Ron who would have his first true loose 2 years before canon). Hell, depending of how close you are to canon, you even have a perfect scene to kill him.Arthur is truly a perfect character to kill (there is a reason why Rowling first planned his death before switcing to Sirius).

â€‹

PS: Now that I think about it, Hagrid would also be a nice candidate to be sacrified. Harry first friend (both in the magical world and outside).

** Well I won't be able to read your fic if you are eventually killing Sirius (seriously, I can't re-read the books because I know Sirius dies ugh) but I would kill Molly. The first and basically the only mother figure he has. Arthur doesn't have the same weight. It would force all the Weasley kids to grow up as well

**** I dunno. Snape was running interference to minimize damage. And even then, Dark Arts class consisted of using the cruciatus on each other. For most of the year they were keeping the kids as hostages, killing them was counterproductive. And when they stopped that, Neville got out and hid in the RoR most of the time.

What's unbelievable is that they bought Ron was at the Burrow all year with spattergoit.

**** I think Neville explained it pretty well in Canon.

As a Pureblood, he was one of the "good ones" that the Death Eater wanted to keep alive and convert to their cause, which shielded him from most of their wrath at first (not to mention Snape keeping the Carrows in a relively short leash).\\
When it became clear that Neville would never willingly join them, the Death Eater (still in an effort to not lose a PureBlood) tried to force his compliance by kidnapping his grandmother ( a method which proved its result in the past with families like the Lovegood). Sadly, they didn't send their best and the grandmother escaped.\\
At this point, Neville was deemed unredeemable and should have been murdered or sent to Azkaban, but he learnt about the Death Eater intentions beforehand (maybe Snape helped once again) and he managed to escape them thanks to the Room of Requirement.

Basically, his blood status gave him some leeway, Snape protected the students as best as he could, and the Death Eater didn't know that kidnapping a tough old lady is harder than a child.

** Kill Dennis Creevy- which wouldn't necessarily effect Harry and Co a whole lot but have Colin spiral and either get publicly killed or pulled out of hogwarts by grief-manic parents. Alternatively you could orphan the Creevey bros- and one of of them could get seriously hurt trying to get revenge.
