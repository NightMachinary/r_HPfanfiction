For some unfathomable reason, I suddenly want to see the Potters get bashed mercilessly. So I would appreciate some no-nonsense Potter family bashing fics (Harry centric, so everything's probably going to be a WBWL story. Would appreciate non WBWL stories as well).

None of the redemption bs where they are mind controlled or under a spell or something. Just some clean bashing fics which make you hate the characters throughout the story and in which they get what they deserve at the end.

Preferably without a regretful Lilly, or atleast one where she doesn't just get forgiven. This seems to be a bit rare even within this trope, so it's not really necessary. But I'd like to read one where she is depicted just as bad as James and is not a crying mess every five seconds.

** I feel like I'm recommending Black Princess series a lot recently - take author's warning in the first chapter seriously if you give it a shot. It's only kinda a WBWL fic? And I think the author hates Lily more than James from what I remember of it

** Can't say I've read many well written bashing fics, obviously. There's one weird one that might be interesting, perhaps? Linkffn(Strange Reflections) has a weird premise (an AU Harry + his family appears in the WW post-Voldemort's defeat), and they're definitely bashed in it, caring only about money/fame and being giant pricks. IIRC there is a sister that doesn't get bashed in the process, though.

Other warnings for it are some PTSD aspects, that it's Harmony, some amounts of Ron/Ginny bashing, and the like. I don't know if I'd call it /good/ on the whole (the Ron/Ginny bashing in particular was... eh), but I did find it enjoyable enough to read through the whole thing, and it's an interesting concept. Worth a try, I think!

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.
