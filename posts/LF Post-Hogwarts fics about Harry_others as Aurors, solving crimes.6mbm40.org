LF fics that have Harry or other members of the trio, or Neville or whoever, as aurors solving crimes. I'd prefer to avoid ones that have people as aurors who really shouldn't be aurors, like Draco. I've also already read The Aurors by FloreatCastellum, which was excellent.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] has a few stories about Auror cases.

** Here is one that might appeal to you. It includes Harry, Ron, Neville and a few minor canon characters serving as Aurors, tracking down the fugitive Death Eater Jugson.

*** This author has NEVER finished a novel length story.

This one gets completely outrageous in later part, [[/spoiler][as the squib James Moriarty suddenly controls everything from Downing Street to the Ministry of Magic, from MI5 to the Aurors. And yes, even JK Rowling will appear as a character here]].

#+begin_quote
  Butchered unicorns in London's alleys, witches and wizards vanishing throughout Britain, and murmurs of a rising Dark Lord! With all of this, Senior Auror Ron Weasley can't believe Harry thought it a grand time to take a desk job. He'd always known the bloke was barmy, but embracing bureaucracy? ---Auror mystery, Harry-Ron friendship, and canon ships.
