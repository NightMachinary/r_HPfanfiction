There's two that spring to mind from /Ah, Screw It/, by mjimeyg.

The first one is Pansy Parkinson(yes, that Pansy) when she first sees elephants in person.

The second is when all the girls are holding a mud wrestling match covered in jam to try to get Harry's attention. The adorable part is after they give up on that and move on, Dobby pops in, sees the utter mess the girls left behind(jam covering everything in the room, crushed into the rug, etc). He starts vibrating on the spot, finally shouting “DOBBY IS THE LUCKIEST ELF IN THE WORLD!”

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

This is my favorite one-shot Harry Potter fanfic ever. The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

** FILFY Teacher by Vimesenthusiast is, despite it's name that promises nothing, chock full of adorable moments. Mostly from Harry's daughter and Koneko. And since you read mjimeyg's fics, a crossover should be ok for you too. No previous knowledge of DxD needed.

EDIT: Oh sorry, just noticed this isn't a request thread but you asking for specific scenes. Well, will leave it here anyways.

*** That's fine. I'm not overly bothered by posts being slightly off topic so long as they're not pointlessly negative.

** Do you need to know much about Stargate to read the fic?

*** Not really. Just about any Stargate element is either explained or easily googled.
