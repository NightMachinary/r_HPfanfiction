:END:
Instead of becoming a curse breaker, Bill Weasley follows the path of former duelist, Filius Flitwick and excels at it. He is so skilled and talented, Bill has become the youngest dueling master at 20. Bill is also noted for using his wand as a magic version of a lightsaber.

​

One day, Bill Weasley is searching for a muggle house to live in at Privet Drive. He intervenes when he witnesses Vernon abusing Harry who is 7. Bill senses Harry has magic and decides to take him in as his student. After getting Harry away, Bill begins his new student's training as a duelist. Harry takes on a new name, Benjamin.

​

A couple major things have changed. The first is Harry not attending Hogwarts like in Canon. The second is Sirius Black escaping Azkaban but, doesn't go to Hogwarts. The third is if Harry's name isn't put into the Goblet of Fire, Cedric would most likely be used as part of the ritual that would bring Voldemort back.

​

This prompt will end at the eventual point where Dumbledore and the Order finally locates where Harry is, Paris, France where a dueling tournament is taking place and Bill is also there. In this universe, Dumbledore is manipulative and has traditionalist values such as prejudice against technology or not believing anyone so young could be talented. The same goes for everyone in Magical Britain.

​

You guys can decide what may happen next after the fateful meeting.


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], Harry is very impressed by Bill and wants to become a curse breaker like him. Bill, along with Petunia, Sirius, and Fleur, are the ones doing most of the heavy lifting against Voldemort.

I doubt it. Voldemort would just switch plans since the whole purpose of the convoluted plan was to get past Lily's protection (Wormtail suggests to use other people because it would speed things up in GoF). If Harry is no longer at Hogwarts but out in the open, things become much simpler.

Unlike Harry, the guy was an actual child prodigy so I'm not sure how that would work either.

Otherwise pretty cool idea.
