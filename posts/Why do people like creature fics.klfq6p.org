I've seen creature fics as tropey due the majority of fics that come up when search for them are shit and have one or two chapters which go something like this(I apologize if the is good it isn't meant to be)

Harry heard a voice coming from the walls the basilisk wasn't alive still was it the voice had a ethereal quality to it that encouraged Harry to follow it he thought that obviously the voice be hissy if it was trying to hurt him as all snakes are evil like slytherins the voice guided him to the chamber where he opened it with his hissy snake language and asked for stairs because it's in every other fic why not this one Harry went into the chamber of plot convenience where he met a still living basilisk that told he was a basilisk two basilisk!Harry was then in grin gotttts with account manager master wise big man goblin spunkstain Harry said account manager master wise big man goblin spunkstain may your gold forever flow account manager master wise big man goblin spunkstain was shocked that a wizard knew there sacred traditions and returned with an equally genric greeting (all the spelling mistakes and complete lack of punctuation is intentional) That is as far as I get before I start clawing my eyes out So prove me wrong tell me why you like creature fics and give me an example to back yourself up


** I love how that paragraph read exactly like the average creature!Harry fic, nice touch there.

I don't know what it is with that trope, but it's fics tend to be absolutely fucked. While I have no qualms with the trope itself, I don't think I've ever read a fic of this genre past the first chapter because I swear they're written by the laziest authors. And I really do mean lazy as fuck. They're often just a bunch of random tropes shoved together without any punctuation or coherence to it, just a string of words that may or may not form an extremely long sentence. It's like the author just posted their notes without actually turning them into a story. I'd compare it to running a bunch of indie!Harry fics and some very questionable otherkin erotica through a machine learning algorithm and posting whatever it pops out.

I seriously don't get why it's always so horrible because it's an interesting concept. A well-written creature!Harry fic that doesn't focus on romance/smut is definitely something I'd read. It just doesn't seem to exist.

*** Pretty much why I'm posting. It's an interesting idea but no one ever does it well

** Makes people feel like they could be in the story. Like they could be special. The desire to be special drives most people even if it isn't evident when you look. Also bad taste.

** As a fan of monster girl anime I enjoy them on occasion it just depends. Some of dirtyuncle on ao3 fics are decent. But they're mostly smut.

** Reading that hurt my actual soul. I think I accidentaly created a horcrux.

That paragraph was just something else

I just realized it's 1 sentence. It doesn't even end in a period.\\

** I think the key to a good creature fic is subtlety. I haven't read a good creature, now that I think about it. So that's a bit of a guess. I imagine Harry trying to hide his nature while attending Hogwarts would make for a good plot.

I've had a half formed plot bunny bouncing around my head for a few years. It plays into the idea that Harry isn't actually a wizard but part of a completely different worldwide conspiracy to keep a supernaturally empowered population secret from the mundane majority of humanity. They could be aliens or fae or whatever. The important thing would be that Harry is now in the awkward position of trying to decide what to do with these two important secrets.

Creature fics have potential but are mostly used to enact a power fantasy for the author's stand-in.

** I read somewhere that all the old wizarding lines had some magical creature blood in them which tend to define familial features ( most likely some malfoy veela fic ) and muggleborn was looked down because no one can determine where there magic came from because they didn't had visual magical creature or traits in fam history , likely result squib being normal humans without magical abilities or gene skipping generations. Just a thought
