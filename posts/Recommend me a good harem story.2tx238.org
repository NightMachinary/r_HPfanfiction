** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5790760/1/Searching-For-The-Power][Searching for the Power]] by GinnyMyLove

Hermione is told Love might be the Power-He-Knows-Not and vows to help Harry find it at any cost. Be Warned of some R/Hr until chpt 20 but skipping those chapters means missing out on H/Hr/G goodness. This is rated MATURE for ADULT CONTENT. Harry/Many

Harry Potter - Rated: M - English - Humor/Romance - Chapters: 79 - Words: 573,420 - Reviews: 898 - Favs: 1,430 - Follows: 679 - Updated: Oct 28, 2010 - Published: Mar 3, 2010 - Harry P. - Complete

Has the merits of being a complete story (and I mean that both ways), includes enjoyable and diverse erotic scenes and that this Harry isn't contemptuous of his concubines. On the negative, it has the common harem trope of many witches cooperating in ways you can only find in fanfiction (or some manga, I'm told).

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2841153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][HP and the Sword of Gryffindor]] by cloneserpents

Spurned on by a perverted ghost, Harry stumbles on a naughty, yet very special book. With the rituals found in this book, Harry gains power and leads his friends in the hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxes. EROTIC COMEDY

Harry Potter - Rated: M - English - Humor/Romance - Chapters: 35 - Words: 280,235 - Reviews: 1279 - Favs: 3,093 - Follows: 1,304 - Updated: Dec 26, 2008 - Published: Mar 12, 2006 - Harry P., Hermione G. - Complete

Again, 'respectful' harem/multi fic with some great humor and a few cringe-worthy moments of WTF.

**** Apologies - I was thinking of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045539/1/Crack-d-Mirror][Crack'd Mirror]], by the same author. Though there is this one chapter in Sword involving timeturning...

To make up for the mistake, I'll add another recc;

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][It Could Only Happen to Harry]] by HoosYourDaddy

After defeating Voldemort in his final year, Harry requires a rare ritual to save his life. Luckily, he has friends who are willing to help him. H/Hr, H/Parv, H/Luna, H/Tonks, H/Fleur. Canon personalities. WARNING: comic smut. Not for younger audiences.

Rated: Fiction M - English - Humor - Harry P., Hermione G. - Chapters: 7 - Words: 56,531 - Reviews: 245 - Favs: 1,143 - Follows: 994 - Updated: Oct 22, 2009 - Published: Oct 16, 2009 - id: 5446275

Wasn't on my original recc as it's unfinished, but really is that important when you're talking about this sort of story?

Oh... and [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=13999][it's in the DLP library]], so there's that.

** Radaslab's Not Normal and the incomplete sequel New Normal are okay. Not explicit though.

Hermione's Furry Little Problem by ganfolf's beard is okay and th e smutty version is good.

Honestly Harry by Captain Compass is an incredibly long series that has some unfortunate likeness to Robst and minimal smut.

Hermione's realization, Ginnys insight by Chem prof is pre and post multi and skips the smutty bits. Still one of the best though.

There are quite a few HHRLL stories including Paladeus and Silently Watches, as well as Griefs Wisdom by poetheather which seems to be heading that way.

My personal OT3 and many more harem and multi fix can be found on thequidditchpitch and other sites listed in the HHRRW thread from a few days ago.

Biting the Hand That Feeds by AJT is probably going multi. Incomplete tho.

*** Someone said he died irl but even if that were true it's very unlikely anyone who knew him irl would know to let us know he died so we couldnt know for sure either way unless he posts again, which he obviously couldn't do if he's dead. He's currently just gone but not forgotten.

*** You don't ask the critics at the New York Times to review comic books. That doesn't mean they aren't enjoyable and many of them have something interesting to say.

Or to put it another way, even if you normally dine on filet mignon and caviar, sometimes you just want a Twinkie.
