Lots of real life people with 160+ IQ have several serious problems. Many are extremely unhappy, fed up with having to be dragged behind by others, hate the expectations, can't communicate and are bullied etc.

As well as that, intellegent people don't overcome all problems in a breeze just because they are intellegent. Lelouch from Code Geass had to face SEVERAL heartbreaking tragedies that he could not prevent even with his over 160 IQ.

TL;DR I want to see an intellegent harry with a real struggle, not a op status.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** I love MoR. I went and saw the top fics in Ff.net. according to people that have Fav'ed it. the first one isn't even about Harry (DM/HG). The third one is Poison Pen and its starts with a lame rant (similar to the one of the poster of MoR's rant) and it was just plain unattractive.

Best Voldemort (smart LV) characterization ever.
