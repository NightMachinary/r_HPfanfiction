  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** You want long? Most of my favorites list is long, let's see what I have saved.

Well there's linkffn(tears on the balcony by byebyebirdie) that's about 500k words long, with one complete sequel at 580k words and an in progress (and recently updated) final sequel at 730k words and counting. I really liked this one, but I have to go and reread them once the third one is done. There's some good old fashioned teenage drama in there, but some great original characters and conflict that you'll get attached to. (Fairly certain current one is the last one, going by the timeline).

There's linkffn(the rise and fall of the stag and the doe by siriusuntiltheveryend) at about 380k words.

linkffn(love and other tragedies by fancyeyes) I thought had a good take on it, and it was the summary that made me give it a try. Around 230k words.

linkffn(crazy little thing called love by breanie) is on my favorites list though I'd have to skim through to remember it. Only read it once, but it made it onto my list so I must have liked it Lol. About 230k words.

Hmm, less than I thought, but that's what I have saved for 'long'.

  Moments. They make or break relationships. Lily didn't just happen to fall in love with James. It wasn't an accident, but a long drawn out process that grew out of the relationships of the people around them. And when it came down to it, even Lily and James couldn't fight fate.

  "We don't deserve her," the Head Boy answered thoughtfully. "None of us do. Not even me. Not because she's perfect. She's not. Sometimes I think she's even more disastrously flawed than the rest of us combined. And not because she's beautiful, even though she is. Certainly not for being lovely because she never was.We don't deserve her because she's so much more than we'll ever be"

** I m super excited that my extensive fanfiction reading is now coming to serve a purpose.

I'm going to try and avoid any repeats and this is the first time I've used the bot so we'll see how that goes...

Love, Life, and Sugar Highs linkffn(928550) - This one is 114,253 words, so it's not CRAZY long but it's also not short. They include the Beatles in this fanfic, which I don't understand why that's so RARE. Overall I really enjoyed it.

10 Things I Hate About James Potter linkffn(3555029) - Again, only 115,120 words (girllikecupcake listed off some amazing recommendations, which is great but it means I can't list them xD) but it is cute and amusing. It takes on a different personality for Lily, not just the cut-and-paste 'Lily loves school and hates rule breakers' that a lot of people use.

She Said What? linkffn(5048579) - Hah, one with a lot of words! This one has 313,283 words and is all Lily's diary. It's a more typical fic, but it is written well and I enjoyed it.

Lily's List linkffn(2795240) - This one is 159,618 words and downright the most adorable fic I've ever read. Lily writes a list of things James would have to do for her to love him, and the fic is a lot of him doing those things. It's so cute and it is written well.

You Don't Say linkffn(7012597) - 114,187 words with a super jerk-y James, but he is also a lot of fun and it is a fic I laughed a lot while reading.

Operation Get My Lily linkffn(6337679) - Okay, this one is 110,826 words and the cutest thing I have ever read. Another one with a list, because Lily writing a list just makes sense.

Summer Magic linkffn(7286177) - This one is 123,057 words of meddling from all sides. Unlike a lot of other fics, this one doesn't completely ignore Lily's parents. Plus, we get to see James in the muggle world and it is great.

I can go through and find some more if you'd like, :), just let me know.

  Lily genuinely liked James Potter. He was handsome enough to make any girl swoon, but he was also funny, clever, and secretly kind. Unfortunately, he could also be rude, thoughtless, spoiled, and cruel. Finding the balance was the tricky part. Author note: James is a jerk. Please don't be surprised.
