  Response to whitetigerwolf's Polyjuice Cat challenge. When Hermione is told her Polyjuice problem is permanent, Harry refuses to let his best friend go through this alone. He chooses to drink a similar potion, and the consequences of that choice are unpredictable and far-reaching. Rating for later themes.
