Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13563881/1/Harry-Potter-the-Mutant-Obscurus-Gamer][Harry Potter the Mutant Obscurus Gamer]] is still updating, and has almost 350k words. Last update Feb 7, and the writing is great. However it is a crossover with Marvel, and is extremely canon-divergent.

**** Yeah lol, definitely not one of his. Have you read 'Heros Assemble!'? It's the one with the most reviews for HP/M crossovers on ff. Best Avenger Harry fic I've read, also not Mega.

** On the ffn app; click read, then select harry potter. tap the search button, then tap the flashlight button to get more options.

Keep it on "any" and type "gamer" in the field. Choose minimum lenght and english language. Done! (Tap crossovers to see the crossover section featuring gamer harry in other settings)

There are also quite a few communities for gamer stories :)

** The gamer genre appeals to me, but I think it's cursed. They rarely ever finish for whatever reason. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13563755/1/What-is-a-Game][What is a game?]] by Rotsu is one that I am following. The story features an OC and not very much Harry, but it has been very interesting. Detailed powers lots of AU stuff going on.

*** Most fanfic aiming to be a long story will never be complete. Most of what's complete is going to be in the very popular genres, which through sheer quantity are going to have a couple writers here and there who have written complete works. Interestingly by the numbers on AO3 ~80% of all HP fanfic is complete, falling to ~68% at 3k words or greater, until at 100k+ it's like ~59% complete. But of course that doesn't really say anything about how many are fics that were intended to be long fic. If we naively pretend that all incomplete fics above 3k words intend to be long fic and that all long fic is at least 100k, we get a ~7% completion rate. It's probably closer to like 10%, so given that gamer fics aren't a super popular genre it's a given that so few are completed.
