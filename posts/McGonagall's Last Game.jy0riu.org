McGonagall's last year as Quidditch Captain, she trains her team to ridiculous levels (40 bludgers?) and pushes them too hard. Eventually she breaks them and they all quit. But something happens that rallies them to forgive McGonagall for her last game... then they lose to SLYTHERIN, badly, and on top of that McGonagall is in hospital from her injuries and is depressed.

What do you think? :D
