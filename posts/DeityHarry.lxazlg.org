Looking for a story with Harry as a deity. No super powered Harry, more like he's human, and just doesn't realize his true nature and discovers it along the way. Would prefer a nice, long read. I'm open to ships/ cultures/ religions.\\
Thanks!

  If someone believed enough, it would come true.Magic needed belief to come true, and what was prayer, what was faith but belief? Of course Harry Woke Up.

** How do you have Harry as a deity w/o superpowers? Do you mean like he's effectively a god and not just overpowered?

If yes, then Core Threads might be it. linkffn(10136172)

** While not an outright god, the Harry in linkffn(Blindness) becomes almost godlike, with powers that expand out into the soul and reanimating of the dead into full life. Well written and very enjoyable.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** There was a crack fic where he thinks that he is dreaming and utterly destroys Voldemort, repeatedly. From what I remember it starts with Luna having a good time with Harry and he just imaging's that he is dreaming as it wont happen in reality.

I will look for it but I dont remember if it was a full fic or a ficlet.
