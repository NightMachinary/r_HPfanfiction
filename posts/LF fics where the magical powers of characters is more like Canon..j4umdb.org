Looking for fics where characters like Snape and Draco have magical capability more like Canon. I mean, it's always shown that Draco is a moron who is nearly a squib and can't do anything other than talking and bragging. But I am looking for a fic where Draco is more of Harry's level. I mean look at second year, He coujured a full grown snake!!

Same with Snape. It is always shown that Harry beats him in a duel, but evil though he was, he was a powerful wizard nonetheless. I understand that some think Snape was git and some don't, but he was accomplished.

Also no over powered Harry fics.

Any storyline, I don't particularly care for that.

Thanks!!


** If you want something more in Canon levels then draco is nowhere near Harry Sorry. Harry is't brilliant he doenst know a Lot of spells but Man that Guy has power to back him up. Along with a hell of a battle spirit, he's Just a teenager but os one of the best duellists of the books.

** I'd like to see some fics like this too. It's so impressive how Draco conjures a snake in second year when they aren't taught conjuring until, what, sixth year?

*** Yes. I understand that writers may want to show that Harry is a powerful wizard but undermining others, like Snape and Malfoy gets on my nerves sometimes.
