:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I once read a fic where Harry gets with Daphne, Fleur, and oc who I think was called Natalie. In the story he meets Natalie this dance school that he went to for the Yule ball, and I think I remember slughorn helping him out at some point tho I'm not sure on that. Do any of you know what this fic is called? Cause I remember reading it once and loving it but now I can't find it againðŸ˜‚

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.
