What are your biggest pet peeves? (there's a pun in here somewhere)

Mine is easily characters (especially the Professors) referring to the house members as the animals of the house, in thought or worse said aloud.

It usually comes up in that stupid teacher's conference that is copy and pasted into every bad Hogwarts first year fic where Dumbledore asks each Head of House how there first years are adjusting.

"My Badgers are fitting into Hogwarts nicely" Professor Sprout said.

"As are my Eagles!! said Dueling Master Flitwick.

"My snakes ..."

"My Lions are as brave as ever"

I. Hate. IT. SO . Much. It, like Snape's Speech after the Sorting Feast, is both awful and in almost every single fanfiction on Al Gore's Internet.

** I could see Professor Sprout doing it, maybe Minerva when in informal settings, but not likely.

But Snape? No.

Could certainly see people calling the Slytherins Snakes in his face though, not in a positive way.

Snape speech? Meh. Depends, could certainly see him in a 'Slytherins are mostly regular people who want to achieve stuff and are cunning, not all racists.' fic to warn them about how the school is prejudiced against them, and how they need to stick together.

This is, of course, without all the children politician stuff, that is just weird for me. I know where people get it. (Nobles in both Eastern and Western society teaching politics to their young children). But it's just weird when 11-year-old Daphne just tells Harry about House Politics and strata and social standing. And later Harry learns how to play 'The Game' and becomes mini-Tywin Lannister(the eyes already have the correct color though).

I could totally see Daphne/whoever becomes his first friend in there, teaching him Wizarding Culture and Customs though.

I would find it much easier for Sprout to do a welcoming speech to make them feel comfortable to speak with her, and even Flitwick, where he explains what's expected of them.

** Usually, I can withstand pointless Stations of Canon or rehash to some degree. But whenever I see an author mention that they don't /like/ a particular canonical scene or arc, but they have to include it to "/get it over with/" before focusing on an original plotline, without even /recognizing/ that they have /complete freaking control/ over /their own freaking story/ and don't /need/ to include anything they don't want /at all/, I just rage quit. Like I said, if you are one of those weird people who /like/ reading/writing the same thing over and over again, and obsess over canon-compliance all the time, then go ahead! I respect that (in some way, I guess)! But seeing people who are /so deep/ into the canon rehash mindset that for them /not writing canon rehash/ is /not even an option/, despite bringing them only pain and difficulties, then I just. can't.

Another one: fics that mention the Butterfly Effect, but despite changing a lot of shit in the premise, /the Stations of Canon still freaking stay the same/ all throughout. Bonus points for being a soulless canon rehash with a "Butterfly Effect" or "Chaos Theory" as the freaking /title/. And yes, there are quite a few of those. This stuff is like creating and marketing a new brand of, say, nut butter /without/ any peanuts in it for people allergic to peanuts but not other nuts, /and then adding the freaking peanuts anyway/.

*** It's important to remember that poly relationships exist, and that they are different from harem relationships. So the second part of your comment, the one about "sharing your SO", is bullshit - sorry to say.

A harem relationship is where a lot of women are with (and usually belong to, too) one man. They're extremely shitty overall, massively sexist when written about or existing irl.

A poly relationship is when more than two people are together. But in these relationships, there isn't one dominant member and a few submissive ones, All of them are together with the rest of them.

So a harem of three people would be a V, while a poly of three would be a triangle.

For example, there are a lot of HP fanfics where Harry and Hermione are the “main pairing” while there are 2 or more other girls there to improve his image.

When I said sharing their SO, I meant it in the context that the girls (in most cases) are treated as less important because they aren't in the “main pairing.” I agree that there are poly relationships that work, and have 3+ people that are equal, but my comment was geared towards harem fics where the relationship is inherently unequal.

Recently I read about half a chapter of this trashy Indy!Harry x Hermione fic, and in a letter to Hermione, Harry wrote a whole ass paragraph about his sexual dream involving her. In the obligatory letter reaction scene, she just giggles about it. And even worse, the story's only change at this point was Harry had a more proactive attitude towards learning after the Triwizard Tournament, so this was supposed to resemble their canon relationship.

If you're going the will route, short blurb, bequests in short form, who takes care of Harry. That's it.

I saw one fic where they had a stipulation "To Peter Pettigrew: 10k Galleons. Unless we die in our home from Voldemort, that means he told the Fidelius secret to Voldemort. In this situation, he gets nothing."

That was a paraphrase, but it was pretty close. Can't remember the fic though.

** A growing pet peeve for me is the shoehorning of Dumbledore into being a nuisance to the protagonist. I am not even talking about the classic Manipulative!Dumbledore getting his comeuppance from the Indy!Harry or some such, but rather stories where the plot doesn't really involve Dumbledore in a meaningful way but goes out of its way to show his untrustworthiness and bias against the protagonist. This tends to be taken to a particularly absurd degree in Slytherin-protagonist fics.

Dumbledore's greatest canon crime against Slytherins is that he awarded a bunch of points to take the House Cup away from Slytherin for two years---after Slytherin won it for 7 years in a row thanks to Snape's blatant favouritism---so /obviously/ he is going to Legilimency the heck out of a random 11 year old in green and silver, without any actual reason.

And, of course, the man who risked his own and other people's lives to save Draco's life and soul in HBP is, /of course/, going to cover for those brutes from Gryffindor bullying the poor, misunderstood Slytherins. (This happens absurdly often and is absurd in two ways: 1. no, he isn't actually biased against Slytherins; and 2. the Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump is not going to get involved in schoolyard spats.)

#+end_quote

Well, in PS, giving the points during the Leaving Feast, /after/ annoucing Slytherin victory totally was a dick move (guys had 3 days to do it), but yeah the Gryffindor kinda deserved the points.\\
In CoS, Harry and Ron totally deserved the points, and he gave them right after they told their story. If anything, he could have given more to Harry because he killed a 60 foot Basilisk besides solving a 1000 years old mystery.

​

Concerning Draco's life, I don't think he ever cared that much, or rather, he didn't care more about Draco that any other student in the school. I think the main reason why he let Draco all his shits in HBP was because Snape had been forced to make an Unbreakable Vow to protect him, and arresting Draco would have killed Snape (since he was forced to do anything in his power to protect Draco, including fighting Dumbledore), which would have destroyed all of his plans.\\
Without the Unbreakable Vow, he would probably have tried to help Draco a little, but the second Draco hurt innocent with his plots (Katie and Ron), he would have found himself in a nice cosy cell in Azkaban.

**** On further thought, Dumbledore's greatest canon crime against Slytherin was putting Snape in charge for a decade and a half.

--------------

On point, Snape wasn't forced to make the Unbreakable Vow. Narcissa asked; Bellatrix laughed, saying that Snape wouldn't ever do it; and Snape agreed, profoundly surprising Bellatrix. Given how easily he agreed, I strongly suspect that he and Dumbledore had planned it that way.

In any case, the phrasing was to "to the best of [Snape's] ability, protect [Draco] from harm". Dumbledore is a vastly greater wizard than Snape. Had Dumbledore decided to do something to Draco, Snape would have been able to stand aside without breaking the vow, since it would then be beyond his ability to protect Draco from harm.

In the end, though, Dumbledore went through a lot of trouble to protect a particularly unsympathetic Slytherin, which puts a lie to the many fics that represent him as being indifferent to their fate.

**** To be fair by giving the points after announcing Slytherin's victory he is giving them recognition as if saying that they would have won if not for some rather extenuating circumstances and in CoS if even a fourth of them was acting like Malfoy over the whole chamber business then not giving them an award at the end of the year should be the lesser punishment for rampant racism, fear-mongering and continuously making fun of other students being potentially in risk of death.

- If your Author's Notes are longer than the actual frickin' chapter you're doing something wrong.

** Oh, dear. I saw the "Badgers, Eagles, Snakes and Lions," talk a few times, and it always makes me close the tab.

I refuse to read fics with most of the popular tropes like Harry's shopping spree, lords and ladies of Noble and Most Ancient Houses, helpful goblins, WBWL, Manipulative!Dumbledore or character bashing. Those are most likely horrible stories and definitely not worth my time.

Recently I also grow to hate Sirius calling James "Prognsie", James asking Lily out every other minute and James deciding he's in love with her at 11 in Marauders' Era fics.

Death Eaters whitewashing, like, I understand you want to give some depth to their characters, but giving every death eater a sob backstory to justify their willingness to join Voldemort is bad. The same with ignoring the fact they did join Voldemort and turning them into tolerant and open-minded people (I find it's the most popular with Snape and Regulus).

Love potions - the most popular way to disregard a relationship the author doesn't like.

Rituals that only make characters too powerful and "magic is science" thing. It might work with MCU, but in HP I want magic to be like it is in the books - I like it that way, and trying to explain magic with science for me always takes the magic out of magic.

** Having to read a scene I literally read like million times before, not just the stations of canon but everything, all the descriptions of the magical world, I would say rehashed, but that's incorrect, more correct would be to say: repeated ad nauseum. Most often this makes me quit reading quickly only sometimes I feel like skipping it to get to the real content of a fic. Quite rare is the author who writes his story keeping in mind everybody bloody already knows all there is to know about the magical world and only expands on what's relevant for the story. Another thing that ticks me off is authors being to heavy-handed with Deus ex machinations. I heap a lot of situations in this category. Goblin friends with all the answers, mysterious artefacts that are the answers to all the problems, people being all rational and helpful, situations being all straight forward and neatly explained and accepted by all and sundry...

** I literally hate it when people mix up Parselmouth and Parseltongue. Parselmouths are people who can /talk/ to snakes; the /language/ they speak is Parseltongue.

Another irritation of mine is when people misspell or use the wrong capitalization or lowercase for the blood status of a person. It's Muggleborn (not muggle born, Muggle born, or muggle-born), pureblood (not Pure blood, pure-blood, or Pureblood), half-blood (not Half blood, half blood, or halfblood), and Muggle (not muggle). It's the same for Parselmouth and Parseltongue. It's capitalized or lowercase or hyphenated or one word, it's not interchangable.

*** Huh. Any clue why they're that way? Especially for Muggleborn, pureblood, half-blood, and Muggle. It doesn't make sense to me why they would all be formatted differently when they're all very similar.

And as for Parseltounge I can see why it is capitalized since it is the name of a language, but I don't see why Parselmouth must be capitalized. "Harry is a Parselmouth" looks very strange to me.

** I have a few. I can't stand it when a fic starts with "*Bold* means thoughts, +s+ means parseltounge, italic /means/ signing. Like.. if you've written it well you won't need to make it that obvious?

I also can't stand it when an au fic starts with James and Lily on the night Voldemort killed them. It's always just copied and pasted from the actual books but with a line or two changed. It's unnecessary and it gets boring to read the same text over and over again!

I have more, but the last one that really gets me is when characters start blushing or going red. I know there are people who blush easily, but personally I think I've gone red once in my life? I just feel like it's used as an excuse for cheap flirting or to show embarrassment or anger. Often in fics Harry with constantly blush if someone insults him, flirts with him or says something uncomfortable and I just don't see Harry doing that? Idk if that's way too nit-picky, but it's just something that really gets under my skin!

** Muggle-wank, it really is annoying seeing stories that white-wash petty much every social problem of the real world while making the magical one hellish.

Characters with no emotional spectrum. A normal person isn't permanently serious, angry, sad (the closest is depression and even it is more of a medical condition that doesn't really gets so cleanly translated in a single emotion). Making a character that will always be kept in a single emotional state gets boring really fast.

Congratulating characters for basic human decency. Here is a free tip: if you don't want your character raping anyone than- a) don't make rape socially acceptable in any given circumstances; b) don't make your character fall in a situation where everyone expects him to rape someone c) for /everything's/ sake, don't make it so rape is romanticized by other characters. Making it so a MC comes into a situation where they could potentially rape someone and choose not to do so is the expected behavior of anyone other than a complete douchbag, armed people don't get praised every time they choose to /not/ rob a bank and definitely are not paid for it, parents aren't congratulated over not drowning their children and random passerby's aren't given awards for not throwing old people in the middle of a high-traffic street. Not being a complete monster is not romantic and doesn't make a character a bastion of good.

Having the MC be unreasonably powerful for no reason at all. Being above average at school for no explained reason is fine, being above the average godlike being of the universe is definitely not.

Double standards of the universe's mechanics, ex.: if wandless magic is easy than it should be easy for everyone, if it is hard then it should be hard for the MC too.
