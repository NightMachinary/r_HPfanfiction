I read a fic a long time ago. It had Harry coming into a dragon inheritance and killing the dursleys. He later meets the malfoys in diagon alley and ends up later becoming a wardmaker named Orion Black. He finds out that lord voldemort is his mate and eventually Harry gets pregnant. Throughout the whole story Dumbledore is meddling and trying to see who these people are.
