** That makes absolutely no sense, unless she doesn't tell him because Snape is the father or something, which will turn it into Angst/Drama category.

*** Yeah, I've never understood the points of fics like these, because they always devolve into bashing and horribly OOC protagonists and antagonists.

Like, the above fic by Potato19 sounds like a massive cliche, all it needs now is for Harry to gain a harem with Daphne, Luna, the Patil twins and Tonks and bam, instant powerwank mess of writing.

Luckily that's not what's going on in that story - at all.

It's really dangerous to judge fics by their summary or which clichés show up - I wouldn't have ever read some of my favorites like "Dodging prison.."

***** Eh, the summary is supposed to draw you in, and most clichés are indicative of poor writing.

****** Completely disagree!

All fantasy novels released after Lord of the Rings are full of clichés if they mention orcs or elves. The use or non-use of clichés says nothing about the quality of writing. It depends on how you use those clichés.

Hell, Harry Potter is one of the biggest clichés ever... Young orphan boy has to defeat evil Wizard and discover his hidden powers. Don't get me started about the wise old Wizard mentor, wand-waving. and magic castle

******* While that's true to some extent, it's more those clichés specific to the HPuniverse that you almost instantly know are just gonna be some 14 year old's power fantasy. There might be /some/ well-written ones, but it's not worth digging through 99% shit to find the 1% that might actually be worth something, unless you've absolutely exhausted all other ways of finding more HP fics

That's true for HP-Fanfiction in general. Completely unrelated to the presence of cliches.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4400517/1/Ananke][Ananke]] has a section of its expansive story dedicated to this idea (though the story itself is a SS/LE).
