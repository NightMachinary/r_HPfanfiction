'1. As I've commented a few times before, given that the Dark Mark looks like a slave brand and has a direct connection to the mind of whoever has it (how else did everyone apparate on-target in the Graveyard?), who's to say it doesn't have the property of helping Voldemort brainwash whoever's marked with it?

If it could be used for mind-control or suggestion, forcibly marking a weak-willed member of the Order of the Phoenix to gain a spy makes sense.

'2. We know from Book 7 that if a Secret Keeper dies, the Fidelius Charm will change so that everyone who knew the secret becomes a Secret Keeper in turn.

Suppose that once Voldemort learned that Peter was a Secret Keeper (and that he had, presumably, told Sirius), he had a minion (through polyjuice or glamour) impersonate Sirius, gloat about 'being a spy all along', and give Peter the choice of giving up the secret, or being killed so 'Sirius' can tell it instead.

'3. Blowing up an entire street with one curse, catching 12 muggles in the process, is one heck of a spell; we don't see anything else like it until near the end where Hogwarts comes under attack.

If Peter /was/ capable of using such magic, why was he only sent to be Snape's (and later, Malfoy's) domestic minion during the second war, rather than being recruited for battles?

--------------

So, here's an idea for making Peter innocent (which doesn't even require a brainwashing Dark Mark):

Peter is loyal, makes Secret Keeper, but is captured by Death Eaters. Acting on prior knowledge or just a hunch, Voldemort dresses one of the Death Eaters up as Sirius, to fool Peter into believing Sirius is a traitor, as above.

Given a choice between telling the secret to Voldemort, or being killed and having 'Sirius' tell anyway, Peter cracks, begs for his life, and tells Voldemort where the Potters are at Godric's Hollow.

Being left alive (so Voldemort can gloat and reveal the truth later in traditional villain form), Peter manages to escape using his (unknown to his captors) rat animagus form, and runs to warn the Potters, but, of course, he's too late.

Skip forward a bit, Sirius tracks down Peter (who he thinks willingly betrayed the Potters), Peter accuses Sirius (who he believes was the traitor), and /then/ a Death Eater assassin sent to assassinate Peter before he can learn of the ruse/reveal where he was captured and being kept/etc, fires a Blasting Curse, blowing up the street and killing 12 muggles.

Either by getting up a Shield charm in time, or having a protective thingy (surely the Weasley twins weren't the first to think of Shield Hats?), or just being lucky, Peter survives the blast, but cuts off his own finger to fake his death and prevent future assassination attempts...and the rest is history...

--------------

...Now I wonder. What happens at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban if Sirius and Peter are both telling what they think is the truth? Which one are Harry and co. supposed to believe?


** I remember reading a fic where Pettigrew had wife and kids and Voldemort was blackmailing him into revealing the location, threatening to harm his family. It was a one shot and I unfortunately dont remember the name. I doubt there are many fics that aren't Peter bashing but this does sound like a good idea.

** For point 3, I'd like to state that, as we know, desperation can, at times, increase the power of spells (see super-Patronus near the end of PoA for one example). While normally Peter may be unable to cast such a spell, he believes that Sirius has come to kill him; his plight might have inadvertently overpowered the spell.

I've also seen a couple fics where, during the scuffle, a spell hit a gas main, which naturally caused an explosion. So while it's not /wrong/ to say that a single spell killed 12 muggles, it didn't do so /directly/.

** I always thought he blew up the street by hitting a gas line, or he led Sirius somewhere he'd previously set up with explosives.

As a rat owner, I dislike how he's portrayed as being a stereotypical cowardly, traitorous rat. Rats are loyal, and brave.

I want to write one where his time spent as a rat changes him in a good way, and he's a good, loyal pet. We only saw one glimpse of this, when he bit Goyle. I suppose cowardly Peter was too afraid to draw attention to himself by being a cool pet, which is why he pretended to sleep all the time. I'd like to write one where joining the Death Eaters was a mistake he repented of, like Snape, but he never had the chance/courage to turn back. Then after outed in book three, he doesn't run back to Voldemort.

I have written one where Peter joined the Death Eaters because he believed they would win anyway, and he wanted to earn protection for his friends, and that he asked for James to be spared like Snape asked for Lily. (Voldemort lied)

*** Possibly because even despite the end of the war, he was afraid of being targeted for assassination again?

Or maybe he was just embarrassed/heartbroken/whatever-the-right-word-is at not being able to warn James and Lily in time, and was too afraid to seek out Lupin/Dumbledore etc to tell them what happened?

Or perhaps, as a surprisingly large number of fanfics seem to do, he suspected that if he showed up miraculously alive with a (unwilling) Dark Mark on his arm, people would accuse him of blowing up the muggles and wilfully betraying James & Lily?

*** I thought it was canon that Peter was terrified of the out-of-Azkaban Death Eaters killing him for giving Voldemort information that got him killed.

Bellatrix Lestrange would definitely have gone after Peter for revenge instead of the Longbottoms if she thought Peter was still alive, for example.

** He could have been tortured for the information. I wouldn't blame anyone after having chunks of themselves cut off. I rather thought he had been tortured for information in canon. Life as a rat was all on him though. What a loser/weirdo. Leave the country or something Pettigrew.

Or maybe the Death Eaters captured his mother and held her hostage for the information? Not innocent, but more sympathetic.

*** That reminds me, I did think of an idea once where Peter's finger was cut off during his torture, and maybe he was later Imperius'd to blow up the street and frame Sirius.

If for whatever reason the Imperius failed at that moment (because right after doing a horrible thing is the best time, dramatically speaking), he might have left the finger behind to try and clue people in to the truth, but everyone mistook it for him being vaporized instead.

*** If you're interested, I could recommend Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban.

It's one of the earliest and most influential Harry Potter fics out there, you'd be surprised how many other fanfics use the ideas it introduced. Dementors, Patroni, characters like Lupin and Sirius, unregistered animagi, Ministry corruption/incompetence, time travel, prophecies, the Knight Bus...

Actually, I find that a lot of people consider the various elements from the story canon when it comes to Harry Potter fanfiction. It's a good read, and I'd highly recommend it if you want more guilty Peter Pettigrew.

** What if Peter wasn't guilty? What if someone was handed the password on a piece of paper and then dropped the paper from their pocket while looking for a key?

Peter stays a pet rat to watch over Harry at the Dursleys. This way the confrontation with Sirius could happen differently, or the same.

What if in Sirius' despair he accuses Peter of betraying the potters, and Peter has no clue what he's talking about? What if Sirius loses it and attacks Peter in a muggle area and one of the spells hits a gas pipe? Peter transforms and runs away from him but the damage is done. Sirius believes one thing, Peter doesn't know who the traitor was but Sirius just attacked him, and thus goes into hiding to protect this innocent baby who's left of his friends, and Remus is still adrift in the world being a lone wolf.

** I can never remember if Peter is marked or not, but I do suspect that the dark mark would have additional qualities beyond being a sort of ugly tattooed pager for evil.

I like Peter best when he is explored beyond cartoonish cowardice. How did he, someone who is looked down on as not being very powerful or brave, get noticed by Voldemort? Was it just the company he kept? I wonder if Snape had anything to do with it - he knew who Peter's friends were and he totally fucking hated them all. Using Peter to get to them probably wouldn't be that hard. I am not saying this makes Peter innocent, but I wonder how he was manipulated (if he was).

** linkffn(6008512) A butterfly effect has one of my favorite readings for Sirius tracking down Peter. I don't want to copy and paste it verbatim, but it starts in the chapter from here: Sirius threw himself down an alley

It actually is similar to (one of) your suggestion, he was captured and mind read to learn of the fidelus, then tortured until he broke and told. I rally do recommend reading that passage, it is just beautifully done.

** Here's the easiest way: Sirius Black betrayed the Potters.

Now it just becomes an exercise in deciding why Peter decided to live as a rat for over a decade. Here are some ideas:

- Paternity suit. He's going to wait 18 years (well, 17 in the WW, I guess) until he resurfaces.
- He has inoperable cancer in a part of his body that rats don't have.
- Rat sex is crazy good.
- He's kind of a shitty wizard and couldn't work the spell to transform back.
