Just read linkffn(backwards with purpose) and I'm looking for other fics where Harry and Ginny travel back together. Soulbond is a bonus. I have already read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Bonds of Time) and its two sequels. I have already found linkffn(5251301) so no need to link that one

** linkffn(844334)

Really good series of fics. In the first fic Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron go to Founders' time. In second one they go to 1943 and help to win in war against Grindewald. In third it's 1975, marauder's era. Harry becomes close friends with Severus, btw. In the 4th they return (after 3 years of timetravelling) to 1st September of 1995 (from when they started their long trip) and help to win against Voldemort. The 5th is frozen but in this one the team (with Severus, Sirius and Remus now) goes really deep in time, even before Founders. Main pairings are canon. I skipped 1st and 2nd fic but characters in them seem to have had different lovers (or only Harry does). But Ginny and Harry are in relantionships since 3rd fic.

I'm trying to remember another fic. Harry is back to 4th year with full memory. Ginny remembers everything only on Yule's Ball. Harry has cast some rare spell in prologue... Was he some sort of a time mage? Is it even english? The last question is a really big problem as I don't know where to look for it...

UPD: Yeah, the second fic is linkffn(2114097). Ginny remembers everyting in chapter 'The King and Queen'
