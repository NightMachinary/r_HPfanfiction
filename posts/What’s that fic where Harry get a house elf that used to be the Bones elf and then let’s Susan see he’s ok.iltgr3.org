Help me please!

It's driving me crazy that I can't find this fic! Here's what I remember: Harry gets to potter manor somehow but the gate elf (or guard elf) doesn't know him so he is sent to a cell. When the elf finds out it's his master, he can't open the cell, so Harry learns bombarda to get out. Harry needs more house elves so he gets a head elf, I think named tippy, who used to belong to the bones family. He also get a clumsy elf, who travels with an older elf (maybe her grandpa?). She breaks something and thinks she will get clothes but Harry doesn't do that. Harry heard that Susan misses tippy so he brings her to see him on a hogsmeade visit. The elf uniforms gets more fancy when they have a closer bond with the master. Harry has a Phoenix animagus form. Remus and other werewolves are captured by the ministry who are going to use the silver dart spell to put them down. Harry shows up as a Phoenix and brings them all to the shrieking shack and then goes to get a huge amount of meat so the wolves won't hurt each other.

Please help me!!!


** Found it! If anyone is interested, it's called Harry Potter and the Dimensional Trunk. I had a couple of minor details wrong, which is why I couldn't find it. The head elf was Tubow and previously owned by the Abbotts.
