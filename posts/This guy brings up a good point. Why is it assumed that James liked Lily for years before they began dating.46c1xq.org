** +Lack of intellectual subtlety+

Now this guys argument doesn't really make a ton of sense to me. What we know is that Lily and James started going out seventh year. For all we know, that is the only/first time he actually asked her out. And this dudes evidence shows that James liked Lily starting at latest in fifth year, which as far as I'm aware is years before asking her out. Unless the definition of plural has changed recently.

*** I'm the OP from the long rant, what I meant was that James liked Lily for about a year or two (late fifth to sometime in seventh) before they started dating; as opposed to some fanfics or fanons where James likes Lily from earlier years (eg. starts asking her out in third year). As I stated in my essay, he asked her out once canonically in fifth year and got rejected, and this is the only time we see him asking her out. Then either one of them could have asked the other out in seventh year (since it isn't specified in the books). I meant that he liked her for many months, rather than many years. Is that a bit more clear? :)

**** Ah, yes. Thank you for clearing that up. I was worried that someone changed the definition of a word and did not inform me... *again*.

  J.K. Rowling: James *always* suspected Snape harboured deeper feelings for Lily, which was a factor in James' behaviour to Snape.
#+end_quote

It was touched on in the post, i.e. Sirius saying James ~always made a fool of himself when Lily was around. Jo frames his rivalry w/ Snape relative to jealousy over Lily. It depends on how you interpret 'always'. It could be anywhere from months to years.

*** But James and Snape disliked each other the moment they met (on the Hogwarts Express). I don't think James had any feelings for Lily when he'd only seen her as a crying eleven-year-old. JK says James' suspicion was a /factor/ but not /the only/ factor, so I'd personally take it to mean that James amped up his behaviour once he started liking Lily.

**** Plus, if it was because snape liked lily: we know sirius and james despised/disliked slytherins. They could have pranked snape as a misguided way to protect lily, a fellow griffindor, from a "snake"

***** Hm, the framing is pretty clear, imo. If it was just to protect her, then just them being friends would have bothered them. Also that Lily wants nothing to do with them. That JKR specified that James (specifically, not Sirius) thought he had feelings for her indicates it was jealousy on his part, to me.

We don't know when he developed feelings for her. Maybe it was when she was a crying 12 year old. It not being the only factor doesn't negate the possibility of him liking her for years before.

** On a (somewhat) related note, if James and Lily weren't together at all, then we wouldn't have Harry (and therefore the premise of the series). But honestly the only way it would work is if James /seriously/ cleaned up his act in sixth or seventh year, because I just can't see Lily even considering James after the events of "Snape's Worst Memory" and the like.

*** You know, I kind of see it like this: James and Snape never got along. James knew Lily by her association with Snape. James and Sirius were bullies to Snape, but he also dished it back (when we look at /Snape's Worst Memory/, Snape uses a spell that cuts Jame's face which seems pretty violent). James started liking Lily sometime around 5th year. Lily wanted to keep her friend despite his dabbling in dark magic but the mudblood comment was the last straw. Shortly after, I think Voldemort became a more prominent threat than ever. This caused a lot of people to grow up, including James. The Potter family was a pureblood line. His parents died from dragon pox (or some sickness) and had no siblings, but I think the grandparents and great aunts might have died because they were "blood traitors". And I think seeing his maturity in dark times (along with his optimistic playfulness) was what made Lily see him in another light. I imagine they mutually liked each other for a while (at the end of sixth year or beginning of seventh) before something happening that caused them to start dating.

** For all I care I go with "James kind of liked Lily for years but then, he also liked a lot of other girls. Ever since the puberty fairy started hitting him."

And from there then I'd have his interest in Lily growing with the years. First he starts flirting with her because it annoys her (and Snape) whenever he is out of a current girlfriend but then things slowly derail.
