We talk a lot on this sub about the predictable nature of a dark or indie Harry fic - how it will have him getting a title, some sort of "this is how one treats goblins properly" instructional chapter, probably some sort of manipulative!Dumbles sub plot, Voldemort will "regain some sanity" and just want political power, will be coated in old fashioned formal language ("well met, Heir Malfoy") and at some point Harry's eyes will be described as "the exact shade as Avada Kedavra."

But are there any fics that have Harry going dark without following this format? So, he's still just Harry Potter with a half decent inheritance from James and Lily - not a lord, not a multi millionaire - who goes to gringotts to withdraw cash not to have "cleansing rituals". No one is stealing from him or trying to potion him. People don't suddenly talk like they're in a Georgian novel. And he definitely doesn't want to ally with the man who killed his parents. But he still goes dark or indie because he's angry - he's angry at being abandoned for ten years with people who hate him. He's angry that everyone in this new world knows more about him than he does. He's a stranger in a strange land, and that sense of isolation and being let down draws him into experiments with dark magic. He isn't setting up a "third side" or seeking political power. He's just the same old Harry Potter, and he's still out to get Voldie, but he prefers the more dangerous curses to expelliarmus and has no desire to be the hero of the light.

Basically, a fic where Harry acts like a normal teenager with abandonment issues and gets into some dodgy shit.

*** Ok, I'm hooked. This is hilarious and brilliant. I don't normally like WBWL stories but I am so glad you recommended this. It doesn't take itself seriously at all and it's all the better for it.

"There were also potions for literacy that taught wizarding children to read and write at the level of an 8th Year Muggle secondary student, but the vocabulary and syntax hadn't been updated in over a century, which was why Pureblood children who didn't socialize much had such oddly formal speech patterns."

This passage is so funny to me. The idea that purebloods are too busy being Very Rich And Important to even teach their children to write and don't notice how weird their speech patterns are. Absolutely subverts the usual tropes in this sort of fic

** Hmm well hes not dark per se but hes definitely not the iconic golden boy huzzah in it either. The overall story is incredibly dark and macabre, I absolutely love it.

Have you read the Sacrifices arc? By Lightning on the wave? It's a pretty dark series over all and they rewrite all seven books to fit in their universe. It honestly probably the most in depth, well written, and emotionally jarring/shocking fanfiction I've ever read. And I've been reading fanfiction for almost 18 years now.

I highly, HIGHLY recommend it.

The first fic(book one) is called: Saving Conner

I will also note that some of it is very upsetting to read. Great, but upsetting.

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

*** I'm always a bit uncomfortable about shipping Harry with Tonks because she's eight years older than him and for the majority of HP fics he's still at school. A 24 year old woman dating a 16 year old schoolboy is pretty creepy however you look at it.

In a fic that's set in a post Hogwarts world, I can see that exploring the Harry and Tonks possiblity would be interesting - if the 13 year age gap between Tonks and Remus is ok (which it is between two adults) then the age gap with Harry and Tonks is fine if they're both over 18 at the time. I think they'd be an interesting couple, she doesn't idolise him, they have a ton in common, Tonks could show Harry how to /have a damned life/. Yknow, listen to some music, drink some beer. Do what people normally do at the age of 18.

I think a grown woman (especially one who works in law enforcement) dating a schoolboy is creepy. I think them having a friendship and Harry thinking she's hot (because he's a teenage boy and of course he's gonna fancy the cool older woman) is fine and developing that into something that can turn into a relationship /once he graduates is fine/. But having /her/ pursue /him/ or have her reciprocating his affection while he's still a schoolboy is icky to me.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

  Albus Dumbledore declared Daniel Potter as the Boy-Who-Lived. This act changed the whole Magical World. Thinking that Harry might be neglected he sent him to his Aunt and Uncle on the assumption that they no longer hated magic and Harry would grow up and rejoin his parents. He did not take into consideration a meddling Death Eater that decided to mess with the Potter family. Years past and Harry is not only thrown to the streets at the small age of five but he has grown up broken and alone. Now he comes to Hogwarts bent on making a name for himself. On the train he meets Ron and Hermione, and they make something far more powerful than people thought. They don't fight for Voldemort nor do they fight for the Light they only fight for themselves. Together they make the Dark Trio Welcome to a new Hogwarts. A/N: Some events have been shifted and moved around, something that happened later in the canon book might have happened earlier in my Fan fiction. This all needed to make the story move as I wish it to move.

** I remember liking "The Fool, The Emperor, and The Hanged Man".

It's more Hermione focused, but Harry is definitely dark. Also, it's Hermione/Draco.

  While flying back from Godric's Hollow, Hagrid accidentally drops baby Harry over a wild forest. Harry is raised by rebel fairies until his Hogwarts letter arrives. The Dark Lord is in for a surprise... HP/LV romance. SLASH.
