So I've been obsessed with the Netflix movie The Old Guard and really want to read a good Harry Potter crossover fic!

So I started brainstorming how the characters would interact and thought “What if it wasn't Mother's Love that saved Harry? What if Harry was just destined to be Immortal?”

For those of you who haven't watched the movie, The Old Guard is a group of immortal heroes who after their first death basically come back to life. They can die but their deaths aren't permanent until it's “their time”. The eldest member is Andy, she's around six thousand years old and she's forgotten more ways to kill than entire army's will ever learn, she was alone for centuries until she meet Quynh/Noriko. Quynh is currently trapped in an Iron Maiden at the bottom of the ocean and has been there for five hundred years. Andy and Quynh were also lovers and Andy holds the guilt of not being able to find and save her. The next member is Lykon, he was the first immortal to die and the only reason we know they /can/ die. Yusuf and Nicolo, or Joe and Nicky, are next and they fought each other in the Crusades...until they became lovers. The last is Booker, he fought for Napoleon and was hung for desertion, he went back to his family but they later turned on him once they found he could not share his immortality with them, his son accused him of not loving him. The movie is set in 2020 with the newest member Nile being a US marine who was killed in Afghanistan.

The Old Guard finds out about new members by dreaming of each other, which is why they think it's destiny that they meet. So the fanfic would start with the Old Guard dreaming of Harry Potter as a baby. They are shocked that a baby is their newest member and don't understand as none of them have aged since their first death. Obviously Harry would age but would heal from all injuries, something they would have to keep secret in fear of being captured.

I imagine some debate over sending Harry to Hogwarts but eventually they would see the advantage in their youngest member being able to perform magic and would let him go. I see Joe and Nicky as his parents, being the couple in the group, with Andy and Book acting as Aunt and Uncle. Booker might even try to keep his distance, phantom pains of his own three sounds warning him away from getting attached. Maybe the Old Guard isn't sure Harry is completely immortal, they hope he stops aging at some point in adulthood but how can they be sure? None of them have ever been immortal as children. At this point there's a total of six members and one is dead, another is at the bottom of the ocean.

I would like the pairing to be Blaise/Harry because I rarely get to see that and Harry would likely grow up near or in Italy, that being where Joe and Nicky like to spend their time. Maybe raising Harry is even That Time In Malta and not a kinky sex thing like most Old Guard fans seem to think it is. Also, who does everyone seem headcannon Blaise Zabini as Italian? Blaise is a French name and Zabini is African? I keep trying to find a cannon reference to him being Italian in anyway and it always escapes me???

Harry would totally know how to fight if he was raised by four immortal warriors so Harry punching someone in the face or straight up using marital arts on them would be appreciated. I don't care if it's Draco, Ron or Professor Snape. Harry needs to get into a physical fight with someone and come out on top.

Rejecting Sirius, because Harry was raised by a very secretive family and he loves them, he probably won't want to get too close to his godfather. He's been taught to keep his immortality to himself and knows Booker's pain of losing his family and having them hate him. He won't be willing to risk that happening to himself. I also imagine him being very closed off to his friends and Blaise because of this knowledge.

Blaise being some type of immortal magical creature (I vote vampire) if the story has a happy ending. I can also imagine Booker yelling at Joe and Nicky for encouraging Harry's relationship with Blaise before they all know he's immortal, telling them that not everyone is as lucky as them and they will only cause Harry pain in the end. Maybe this even gets Booker to open up about his guilt and emotional trauma, stopping certain events that happen in the movie before they can even come to pass.

And Nile just has a bigger family in 2020 when the movie happens and is totally confused at not only immortality but MaGiK


** I lovelovelove this!!!!! What if Harry aged to 17/18 and stopped once he became MOD? It could be the reason he aged at all? And Harry meeting Nile and participating in the movie events would be amazing!!!!!

*** Even more so since the actor who played Dudley also played the villainous pharma CEO. I always thought that would be an intriguing tie in for a crossover.

** I would love a fic like this. And I also ship Harry/Blaise and we need (and deserve) more stories.

I never really had a problem with Zabini being of Italian descent because the name sounds really close to Bini (which is a fairly common surname), but him being French-Tunisian or something different could be awesome.
