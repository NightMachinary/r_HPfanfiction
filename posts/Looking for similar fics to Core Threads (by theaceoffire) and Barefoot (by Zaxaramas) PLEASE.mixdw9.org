I know those fics aren't inherently similar but what I meant by similar was the utter uniqueness of the plot these stories contained.


** Speaking as someone who reads a lot of HP fic but has never read those two, could we get a plot synopsis to help in recommending things?

*** In Barefoot he can see see past of everything he touches. Core Threads he uses threads of actual pure magic instead of spells or a wand. Both fantastic and long stories.

**** Ah, gotcha.

Are you specifically looking for fics with unique magic? Or just generally unusual takes on the setting?

***** All of the above really. Just looking for something good that I probably haven't read before.

****** Well, it's kind of new, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30041187][The Girl Who Lived In Three Castles]] by LaceyBarbedWire is pretty decent. Only six chapters so far, but I haven't seen anyone go quite that far into worldbuilding and the rest of Magical Europe before.

** Check out Angie Astravic's work. It is a series of fics and has some cool ideas about magic in general. First written before OOTP came out, so quite a bit is now AU.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Alternate Universe. D&D meets HP in a way you didn't know you needed
