I'm looking for fanfictions where Harry surrenders to Voldemort. Not because of an evil plan forcing him to, but mostly because he's tired and doesn't see a reason to continue fighting.

I'd be grateful for any fics you can recommend!


** There's a long one I skimmed through a couple of years ago but I remember very little about it. During the latest chapters Harry was full of worry/anxiety about Ron & Hermione's wellbeing and Voldemort arranged for both of them to visit Malfoy Manor and arranged their wedding as a way to celebrate the new regime. I'm not even sure if he surrenders to V or he gets trapped into it.

** Isn't that canon?

He surrendered unconditionally, and he should feel really really lucky that Voldemort immediately hit him with a killing curse, instead of slowly torturing him to death, or much worse, running an exhaustive interrogation on him.

Despite reading thousands of fics (apart from canon compliant ones), I have yet to find one that has him doing that. There are a few in which he made deals with Voldemort, do you want these?

*** I wouldn't say he surrenders /unconditionally/. He takes up Lord Voldemort's ultimateum to Hogwarts --- Voldemort pledging /not/ to slaughter everyone in it /if/ Harry Potter is given to him.

This is distinct from what OP is proposing, which is Harry just throwing in the towel on the War completely, not because he's received an immediate ultimateum from the Dark Lord, but simply because he's too tired to go on with the cat-and-mouse game.

*** Harry intentionally sacrificed his life to invoke the same protection his mother did, making Voldemort unable to kill any of the Defenders of Hogwarts, not exactly unconditional surrender.

And Voldemort couldn't really interrogate Harryy, Harry has just shown himself capable of not only resisting Legilimency, but also capable of using their connections to read Voldemort's mind instead. And torturing him wouldn't work either since Harry owned the Elder Wand and we literally saw him capable of shrugging of Voldemort's cruciatus.
