:END:
Harry is some ancient wizard that has been reincarnating for centuries. I think the Dursleys abandoned him or he run away.

Harry opens a shop were he makes rituals and potions. Somehow he knows a cure for newly infected werewolf that hadn't had their first transformation, and make the transformation more easy for those that already had.

I think he lives with Remus? Or Remus found him and spends time with him.

He creates an homunculus to transfer the soul of a sick Abraxas Malfoy per Lucius orders.

Forgive my shitty grammar, I'm still learning english. I will edit this later.
