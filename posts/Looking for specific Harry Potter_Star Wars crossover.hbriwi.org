:END:
Harry is in Azkaban, I think after 5th year? A pair of Jedi flying nearby feel his pain... and enormous power... through the Force. They decide to investigate, and land at Azkaban right as a Death Eater attack is happening. Between the Order and the Jedi (not Qui-Gon and Obi Wan), and a surprise attack by Harry, Voldemort and his DEs are destroyed. The Jedi free Harry and take him with them.

Harry is eventually accepted into the Jedi Order, despite his age (I think there was a Revan reference? Might be my imagination), has some adventures, and eventually ends up as Anakin's master.


** Sorry, I have no idea. I've recently started getting into star wars and hp crossovers, I'd be interested in reading this tho. Hope you find it

**** For Harry being messing stuff up, The Havoc Side of the Force is great. He helps kid Anakin become a nightmare for the jedi and its a really good read. There's also one called The Lightsaber, Harry builds a Lightsaber, unlocks the magical equivalent of force sensitivity within himself, and jumpstarts a future tech company that makes technology from SW. I'm not sure about this one, as I haven't read much, but Harry Potter, the Jedi that would not die has Qui-gon, Padawan Obi-wan, and Aayla Secura come to Earth and meet force sensitive Harry at Hogwarts, don't know much else. If you're okay with Sith Harry, Harry Potter and the Power of the Dark Side has Harry taken in as an apprentice to Darth Millennial after leaving his master. They recreate the sith empire while Harry goes to hogwarts to learn about magic, cause power is power. Those are some of the better ones, I'm not an expert on the topic; but I hoped these helped! I recommend searching up archived threads of it, as there are probably many I've missed.

  The Galaxy Far Far Away did not fall easily to the Entities. With their last breath, the survivors of that galaxy planted a seed of hope for any other worlds that might fall. Naturally, with Taylor Hebert's luck, that seed planted itself in her. A Star Wars/Worm Crossover.
