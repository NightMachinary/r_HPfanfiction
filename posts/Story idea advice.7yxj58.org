** It seems necessary to do something with Delphini. Maybe run with the fan-theory that she's not /actually/ Voldemort's daughter, but has just been led to believe she is?

*** So something like Rodolphus is her father and Voldemort somehow transferred his powers to her?

**** The theory is that she's an unrelated descendant of Salazar Slytherin, who, realizing she was a Parselmouth, latched onto the idea that she was the secret daughter of Bellatrix and Voldemort... when she's really not. Voldemort never knew she existed, and Bellatrix may not even actually be her mother. There's an interesting motivation in there that orphan Delphini desperately wanted a father to live up to, and when she's /managed/ to bring Voldemort back through the Time-Turning, he has /absolutely no idea/ who that upstart blue-haired witch even is and wants nothing to do with her, utterly crushing Delphini's heart.

***** Oh yeah, I remember that theory now XD Makes a lot more sense than mine.

I might explore it, but Delphini probably will only have barest of mentioning. I plan for the story to mostly be about the recovery of the Potter children because of their parents' mixture of neglect and overindulgence, and Harry and Ginny's own very lackluster relationship.

****** Seems hard to bash CC without Delphini, the Time-Turner and the Trolley Witch, but fine.

******* I didn't say they wouldn't be featured ;)

Just not a main focus in comparison
