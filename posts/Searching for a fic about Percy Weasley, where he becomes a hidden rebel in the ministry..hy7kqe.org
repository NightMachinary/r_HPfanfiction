:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
What I remember, is that he was slowly noticing the policy changes, sending mudbloods to trials without a thought, but then notices that one of the names is someone he knows Then after a talk with Aberforth, he starts to do things like "Sadly you made a mistake if filling this option" "And as you know this wizard didn't have a daughter, only a sonm so it would be the best if you double check everything." (not exact words). Does anyone knows which fic this was? (I found it on Tvtropes years ago, but they changed the fanfic page, so it only shows categories, and none of the categories have the fic)


** It was something like the scarlet pimpernel, I think it was taken down. It was a great story. Hopefully someone can find it and link it.

  It's been coming on for a while," said Percy ... "But I had to find a way out and it's not so easy at the Ministry, they're imprisoning traitors all the time." DH, ch30 . This is Percy's journey to that point.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

** It's not the story you're after, but he does a very good job of working undercover in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822-1/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. Actually, several characters are much sneakier in that one, which is logical since it's a non-magical AU where "Harworts" trains the next generation of counter-intelligence agents. Basically, in fifth year, Hermione and Percy write back and forth, with her pretending to be a model student concerned for Umbridge's welfare, while letting him know about the outrages she's committing, and he pretends to sing Umbridge's praises, while in the process letting slip valuable information about her activities and plans.
