One day I had was helping out with a school play and had stayed after school to help with rehearsals. Our pianist asked me to get something from her room and I was going down the hall I heard “One Day More” from Les Miserables blasting from the shop teachers class. I wanted to go in and tell him I really liked that musics but as I walked by he was staring in his seat and like passionately shaking his head. He then smacked his hands da together and said “yes!” Obviously moves by the music. It was very odd. So...head canon Snape does this to Muggle music. He locks up his quarters and blasts it. Him being half blood he would know some stuff. My question: what does he blast? I pick Africa by Toto no reason other than that I'm listening to it now. Thoughts?


** If you accept the theory that Cokeworth is somewhere near Birmingham, he would have grown up right next to the emerging heavy metal scene. Black Sabbath and Judas Priest both originated in that area. Also an early punk band, The Prefects.

I dig it.

*** I love this community because of posts like this. This is perfect. I also think that had he and Sirius been on good terms they may have found they had a lot of music in common

**** Totally!

Incidentally, if you had any interest in reading an AU where they are, in fact, on good terms, there's a new-ish fic that is still in its infancy but has a lot of promise, where Snape is sorted into Gryffindor. The author is good at everything she writes. She doesn't make Snape a metalhead, but that's because she likes writing him as a classicist.

I'll just drop the link, but please feel free to ignore!

** If we are talking angry music and a person filled equally with hate and self-loathing, and that he grew up in Britain in the 70s/early 80s, punk leaning towards the hardcore side would be a good bet.

*** “Somebody to love” I can totally see him angry nodding to this. Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little Can barely stand on my feet (Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry) Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah) I have spent all my years in believing you But I just can't get no relief, Lord! Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody) Can anybody find me somebody to love? I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life I work 'til I ache in my bones At the end (at the end of the day) I take home my hard earned pay all on my own I get down (down) on my knees (knees) And I start to pray 'Til the tears run down from my eyes Lord, somebody (somebody), ooh somebody (Please) can anybody find me somebody to love?
