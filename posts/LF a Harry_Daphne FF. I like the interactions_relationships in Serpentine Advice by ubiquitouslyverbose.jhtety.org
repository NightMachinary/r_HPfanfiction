Hey. Like in the title mentioned I really like the interactions between Harry/Daphne in Serpentine Advice. It's exactly what I look for in the Characters.

Are there any other ff which features Harry and Daphne and is preferably completed or not abandoned?

Thanks üëç


** Haven't read this fic, but I'm a great Haphne fan. How are their interactions there?

*** Harry is trying to be more secretive or slytherin like and tries to hide his reasons and ambitions (he is trying to assimilate more political power to free sirius). They form something akine to an informal alliance...Daphne is close to the ice queen persona but not entirely emotionless. They are teasing each other when they let something slip which they did not intended and share some funny moments etc. They form some sort of friendship and at least Daphne is interested in Harry at the point of the story.

  Following the events of Third Year, Harry Potter explores the Chamber of Secrets and finds a portrait of Salazar Slytherin. Following Slytherin's advice, Harry will attempt to break out of the games set upon him and finally be free. But how? And is freedom even possible for the Boy-Who-Lived?

***** Warning: The pairing is stuck between Harmony and Haphne right now and the author has not revealed the final pairing. So it can also end up being Harmony. Still a good fic though.

*** Per your request, a Harry/Daphne relationship closer to Serpentine Advice would be found in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12898815/1/Wheels-Within-Wheels-Part-1][Wheels Within Wheels]]". It's a 3-part series covering ~20 years starting when Harry/Daphne are in their late 20s. linkffn(12898815)

Also, I second the recommendation for "Serpentine Advice". HP and DG have really great chemistry together.

Lastly, the same author is simultaneously working on another fic in progress that is called "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13681576/1/Fellowship-of-the-Potters][Fellowship of the Potters]]". Harry (as Lord Potter) and his twin sister (who is the girl-who-lived) meet Daphne on the train during first year. Thus far this Daphne is colder and more serious than the DG in "Serpentine Advice". linkffn(13681576)

  Wheels Within Wheels is the story of Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, who were promised to one another by their parents in the dark days of the First Wizarding War. As they explore their new, sometimes overwhelming mutual feelings, they also discover heretofore unknown facts, and facets, about their parents, close associates, and themselves.

  Harry Potter was raised in an orphanage, aware but confused about his magical powers. Near his eleventh birthday, he discovers he has a twin sister raised by abusive relatives for reasons he does not understand. Yearning for a family, he delves into a messy and violent Magical Britain that is yet to shrug off the effects of the latest blood war. No bashing.
