** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5492188/1/Doubting-Thomas][Doubting Thomas]], linkffn(5492188): It's only an one-shot, but beautifully written. A time-traveling Luna raised Tom Riddle as her own, and Tom became a Dark Lord fighting for the opposite cause, with Luna's blessing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): After Voldemort fell, the old establishment thought they could betray the Vanquisher of Voldemort and get away with it. They were wrong, because the Dark Trio and their DA (Dark Army) were coming after ALL of them.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  One Shot. AU. After all, every child deserves a mother who loves them. Even those who grow up to be monsters. Luna just never imagined things would turn out this way. Time Travel.
