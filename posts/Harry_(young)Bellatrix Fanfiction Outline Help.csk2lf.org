This is an outline for a fanfic I'm working on where an 11 year old Bellatrix attends Hogwarts in the 90's with Harry and his friends. I would really appreciate any suggestions to help make it better.

Bellatrix Black's family was mourning Bellatrix's "death". It had been a month since she disappeared, they all assumed she was dead. All except for her parents, who knew the true fate of their daughter. That she was sent on an important mission to align herself with the dark lord's replacement, whom the prophecy foretold.

Bellatrix stands in front of Whomping Willow, holding the time turner watch in her hand. She reiterates her mission in her mind: to become allies with Harry Potter. As she thinks to herself she is found by a member of the Hogwarts staff and brought inside, just a few days before classes begin.

Harry Potter and Bellatrix meet during the feast at the beginning of the year. Bellatrix introduces herself and tries to be friendly with Harry. However, he feels conflicted after she's sorted into Slytherin.

Harry tells Ron he finds Bellatrix nice as she walks towards Draco's table. Ron narrows his eyes and says that he finds anyone from Slytherin suspicious. They talk about the encounter with Draco during the introduction where Harry refused to befriend him. After they get sorted into Gryffindor, Harry and Ron have another argument over Bellatrix while they have dinner. Harry doesn't believe Bella is a bad person but chooses not to talk about her anymore with Ron since he doesn't want to lose the only friend he has. 

Bellatrix begins to hang out with Draco and the other Slytherins. She gained a lot of information about the Death Eaters from them and learns what happened to Harry and his parents. Draco describes the Death Eaters as a rebel group fighting for a good cause and she claims to believe in that cause but thinks Harry is a better choice as the victor. This leaves Bellatrix and Draco on shaky ground.

Bellatrix works to become very versatile with her skills and tries to get in good graces with Snape knowing he oversees dueling club. She is ultimately unsuccessful but does earn his respect for ambition.

Harry and Bellatrix are partnered up for a project in Defense Against the Dark Arts. Even though Harry is interested in becoming friends with the girl he tries to keep his distance around Ron as to avoid another silly argument.

Hermione (this is before the troll incident) complains about Bellatrix, saying how she is always trying to upstage her in their lessons and thinks she's better than Hermione since she's pureblood. Harry tries defending Bellatrix and says Hermione may be overreacting but Hermione gets upset that Harry's taking Bellatrix's side after Hermione was trying hard to be nice. 

Harry goes to make Hermione feel better and the two end up laughing. Bellatrix end up mishearing and believes the two are laughing at her which fuels her rivalry with Hermione since Hermione always does better than her in their classes and is getting in the way of her mission which she almost forgot about.

Bellatrix tells Hermione to stop hanging around Harry and the two get into an argument leading to Hermione crying in the girls bathroom with the troll.

Harry saves Hermione and finds out that Bellatrix was behind the troll incident. He confronts and they have a small fight which adds some coldness between them.

After the fight, Draco begins to make fun of Bellatrix's decision to side with Harry and steals back any anti-Voldemort supporters to his side.These two failures make Bellatrix start to wonder if she should just go back home since she was straying far from her mission. 

Harry and Ron sneak around the library under the invisibility cloak trying to find information on the Philosopher's stone. They spot Bellatrix sitting by herself downtrodden reading a history book. She has an object beside her which look like a small hourglass. Bellatrix, believing she's alone, mentions to herself that perhaps she should consider returning home. After which Harry pretends to enter the room and apologizes asking Bellatrix to still give the school a chance.

While working on their Charms project, Bella and Harry unwillingly spend a lot of time together. At first they don't talk much but soon they begin to talk about their lives with each other. Bellatrix tells Harry about how mean her mother was, how she always made her do things and associate with people to keep up appearances. Harry related to her story and opened up about his aunt's family. He reveals that he could talk to snakes and Bellatrix found that fact very reassuring towards her mission.

Bellatrix becomes more distant with Draco and his gang as Harry is her only real friend in the school but she doesn't mind. She is happier now and more hopeful as the two stay at Hogwarts over the holiday break.

Hermione and Ron don't like that Harry is becoming friends with Bellatrix. Hermione tells Harry that something is off about Bellatrix. She mentions overhearing the staff say she owns a dark magic time turner clock but Harry brushed it off. 

Harry informs Bellatrix of the plan to stop Snape from stealing the stone and she agrees to help seeing this as her first real chance to aide Harry achieve greatness.

The trio spots her and Hermione immediately starts berating Harry for telling her about the plan. In turn, Bellatrix also gets angry and a fight almost ensues between them until they hear Ron scream out. The vines wrap around him and soon Harry is also trapped followed by the two girls.

Hermione lights a fire and gets her friends out of the trap but Bellatrix's is still stuck and has dropped her wand. She looks angrily at Hermione expecting her to just leave her there and run off with Harry and Ron.

But Hermione helps also helps her out using the Bluebell flames. She has the choice to leave or go along with them. Bellatrix thanks Hermine for her help and concern in a sarcastic way. However she continues on with the group wanting to ensure Harry's safety and stops at the potions riddle with Hermione. 

Harry and Bellatrix meet again at the farewell feast. Harry and his friends thank Bellatrix for her help. She asks them to keep it a secret that she was involved in their plan. She also apologizes to Hermione in an offhand way saying she isn't that bad for a mudblood. Confusing Hermione as she's never heard the term before but she ignores it and the two end on even terms.

Draco comes up to Bellatrix. He confronts her about her friendship with Harry and asks her to choose between him and her house. Bellatrix chooses Harry. 

Right after Harry leaves, Dumbledore takes Bellatrix and Hermione aside and informs the two that since Bellatrix's parents aren't around (giving Bellatrix a knowing look) and her remaining relatives are dodgy choices for different reasons, he has arranged for Bellatrix to live with the Grangers for the remainder of her time as a student.

As Bellatrix reluctantly gets in the car knowing opposing could jeopardize the mission she questions whether this is all worth it.


** Bellatrix sounds so unlikable . Just the typical "badass Slytherin girl OC" with a canon name

*** Okay, well do you have any suggestions on how I could improve her character? I did base her personality off what a standard Slytherin would be since there's not much I could find about her childhood. If you have a better more original personality for her I'd love to use that one instead.

**** Maybe have her not be sorted into Slytherin and have her be a Hufflepuff . She's in utter shock at this and it also puts her in a foreign environment she previously looked down on

** I think maybe this premise is needlessly complicated without any obvious purpose.

Why? Why would you want to write a first year story about Bella in 1991 at Hogwarts? As opposed to an OC (like Bella's daughter for example). That way you don't have to completely rework canon.

*** Well I guess the main reasons I chose to use Bellatrix is because I really her and Harry together. And I also thought tgis would be interesting since the way most stories tackle this is by havung Harry go to the past.

**** Yeah but it's not really the Bellatrix we know if she's still only 11 years old. She's missing like 75% of her memories, experience, and personality. She's basically a blank slate like any OC character.

Meanwhile, transporting her to the future causes a huge pain in the ass trying to rewrite history without fundamentally changing things.

In my mind you're better off creating a new Bella-like character to replace the one in your story, and the timelines line up reasonably well for something like a Bella's daughter.

Don't get me wrong, you could make it work with Bella coming forward in time. It is just going to seem insanely contrived... which it is... but that might be fine.

*** So in this story because young Bellatrix travels to the future she never was a follower of Voldemort. I thought it should work this way since time turners are supposed to be one way trips, if she travels to the future (as she'll later learn) she can't go back.

**** Well, then you have to completely redevelop the whole Longbottoms/Lestranges story arc.

More plot implications:

- The location of Hufflepuff's Cup
- Neville's personality if he's raised by his own parents
- The balance of power between the two sides if the Longbottoms weren't incapacitated
- Barty Jr's fate if he didn't go after the Longbottoms
- Barty Crouch Sr would be Minister if his son was not outed as a Death Eater
- Bellatrix's reactions to Andromeda and Nymphadora Tonks

See, you have a complete AU to deal with here. If you still try to rehash canon, your fic will utterly break my suspension of disbelief.

****** Some more considerations:

- The Ministry under Barty Crouch should be more effective against Death Eaters, but also more tyrannical. I can't imagine him and Dumbledore having a good relationship. At least Fudge was listening to Dumbledore at beginning.
- Barty Jr, without being led by a fanatic Bellatrix, might be a lot more subtle and could become a dangerous deep spy at his other's side after Voldemort's fall in 1981.
- Lucius Malfoy would have far less influence at Crouch's Ministry than in canon. In fact, Barty Jr would hate his guts for betraying Voldemort. There is a good chance a Crouch dominated Ministry searched Malfoy Manor competently and send Lucius to Azkaban. The Diary could end up either in Barty Jr's hand or at DoM. Under this scenario, Draco would not be that arrogant, entitled, and spoilt brat. Narcissa, seeking refuge, might reconcile with Andromeda. Draco and Dora could become pseudo siblings then.
- A 11 years old Bellatrix reappearing would definitely seek out her two sisters for help, and she would certainly get it.
- Longbottoms should have significant influence in the Ministry. Neville should be a lot more confident and entitled. He would be the Gryffindor golden boy, and might be jealous of Harry splitting his fame.
- Would a powerful and influential Barty Crouch tolerate Dumbledore's sole control of Harry Potter? Would Longbottoms have a say in Harry's upbringing, as so many other fanfics allude to? You need to make a decision here.

** Wow I am really under prepared for this story. Before I give you an answer on Harry's relation to the longbottoms, could you explain why you believe they might gain custody or have positions in the ministry? As for Dumbledore, while I do believe Crouch would want more control over Harry he wouldn't get it as Dumbledore would probably inform him about the protection charm Lily's sister keeps active to stop Crouch from adopting Harry or something. And since Harry has little reason to be in the wizarding world outside of Hogwarts (and firing Dumbledore seemingly out of no where would hurt his reputation) Filch can't get to Harry in the school year either.

I really appreciate all the help you're giving, ig your not too busy I'd love it if you could help me write a new outline! When I get to writing the story I would be sure to credit you for sll of your help and link it so you can read it too!
