I'm getting kinda tired of it being all Voldemort or Dumbledore as the main adversary, but is there a good reason people avoid using OCs as the villain?

Any thoughts or suggestions? On that specifically, or about villain OCs in general?


** When you make a new character you have to make them mean something to us. Ignoring how fanon sometimes reimagined Snape/Malfoy etc for the most part the hard work in characterisation is done for you. Why is Voldemort scary? Thanks to the books, because its Voldemort is a good enough answer. Any OC villain has to be shown to be scary. You can't just tell us, you have to show us why we should be worried about them. Its a lot of work compared to throwing in Voldemort and us already knowing that he's a bad, bad man.

Basically a villain is hard work. All new characters are. You're also going to get abuse from some rabid fans who only want to see canon characters. You're also going to get abuse if your villain is crap. When you make an important character they have to be bigger than life. They have to be special else they're boring. Voldemort isn't just evil he's really really evil. How do you make someone who compares to that without becoming cartoonish? Then there is making it fit. Where has your villain come from? Don't give some shitty daughter of Voldemort bullshit. Make it a muggleborn who thinks people escaped justice or something. Making Voldemort v2 is dumb, might as well be Voldemort not a cheap knock-off.

*** Perfectly put. It takes time and skill to put together a decent antagonist. I was always a bit bored that Voldemort was just "might makes right", the weak die and the strong survive. But, it was never in doubt why Voldemort was feared in-universe, especially once GoF came around. Torturing and killing without remorse? The guy is magic Einstein-Hitler? OK then.

An OC villain has a massive uphill challenge. You basically cannot just make him stronger or more feared than Voldemort, it just doesn't work. You can't get more evil without sounding like an impossibility. Where was this villain while Voldemort was gaining international fear? How is he more powerful? We know Voldemort would break any moral line wizards drew to gain power. It has to be done differently, as you suggested.

**** Which is why its contextual. One of the ideas the poster above you mentions was done to great effect in linkffn(11815544) , for example. In general, you need to play off different fears than Voldemort does in canon.

** Make them grow as a character and not just outright state it. I think if the story and suspense is build enough, a original villain can be interesting to the reader. I actually read some fics that successfully created these kind of villains so it is possible to cater enough attention on an original villain.

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] by cambangst is a good example in my opinion. I highly recommend reading the story, however it may take awhile considering the length of the story. The story probably contains one of my most favorite OC villain considering how well develop the villain was. linkao3(6701647)

** Assumedly because as with an OC they need to be developed believably. It's difficult to create a compelling villain so many resort to using characters that they know. I'm not a fan either of stories that resorts to using OC villains that are essentially Voldemort 2.0.

Would you be interested in a story with my favourite OC villain?

** There are definitely books that do OC villains well- HP and the Prince of Slytherin is an example, where you not only have Peter (and other characters like Rookwood) twisted into being more effective villains, but also have characters that deal with specific fears (the Toymaker)

** Voldemort is an odd example of a villain if I were to be honest. His characterization seems to have shifted sometime between GoF and OotP. In the earlier books, he was functionally a fairy tale villain. He dresses in all black, he looks like a snake, he has red eyes, he is unambiguously evil, narcissism, etc.

But by OotP, Rowling shifted his characterization to something more in line with a charismatic revolutionary (or terrorist, after all one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter). He rallies a powerful set of individuals behind a common cause, he sets up an organization to functionally bring down a magical nation, he awards loyalty and punishes failure. He is a megalomaniac, but it comes off more like Alexander the Great, a daddy's boy with undeniable talent and ability who took a strong issue among his people and used it as an excuse to change the course of events. The parallels are rather uncanny, Alexander even believed himself something of a diety, claiming decent from Zeus and having a witch (purportedly) for his mother. This is a type of leader who people would follow: not only because of fear, but because he created a vision that others can get behind or see themselves supporting.

Why the change? Rowling hadn't really done much in the way of setting up a consistent universe, and by OotP she /seems/ to have realized Voldemort can't just be a narcissist who talks to snakes.

Voldemort is thus easier to portray, because you have two separate, accurate, characterizations of him that you can use in any given fic. If you want your heroes to curb stomp him, you use the former. If you want him to be a serious challenge, you use the latter. His malleability makes him ideal for fanfiction, frankly.

Now, to create OC villains, you need to find a cause (or causes). The conclusions and convictions of people are something they form or decide based on their personalities. Idealists often get behind revolutions and populist causes, conservatives support the status-quo and distancing the public from decisions. Here is a good example of a fic with *several* OC villains linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent).

Its an old fic, but more than one villain appears in the story. Gallowbraid and Dahlia are particularly original to me. Their motivations, their history, their personalities, their quirks, all of them are a breath of fresh air in a very large fandom. The key to creating a good OC villain is to understand why they would support whatever cause you want them to support. This is the key as I see it to writing an interesting villain: why they fight, why they struggle. I would argue the same is true for any major OC character.

I hope this helps, and that I have not wasted my time or yours.

** There's more to choose from than you'd think, in canon. If Voldemort is out of the picture and Dumbledore is good, why not fall back on some of the Death Eaters? Flesh out their characterization? For me, I've decided to make Barty Crouch Jr. and (not-yet-Horcruxed) Nagini my antagonists, and it works quite well, I think. You could also have time-crossed bad guys like Salazar Slytherin, Ekrizdis, Pre-redemption!Grindelwald...

But if you do make an OC villain, and that's perfectly okay, first, follow [[/u/herO_wraith]]'s advice concerning their threateningness; and furthermore, make sure they are /believable/ as part of the HP universe. Unless they literally popped into existence during your fic's on-screen runtime, we need to know how they came to be, and why they haven't factored into things yet nor done so in the canon timeline.
