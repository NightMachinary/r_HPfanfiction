** "Rita, we've been over this before. You cannot source Snape." "But-" "Not as an anonymous source" "Or" "Not as rumors" "Not even" "No, not even as 'this reporter found'" "Fine, but now I want to interview Black, everyone is tired of Harry"

** Come to think of it, the only reason Rita was like she was to the protagonists are because her newspaper was in the pocket of pureblood families on the opposition side.

Makes me wonder how things would be different if if Dumbledore were actually rich enough to play the economic side of things which he mostly avoided doing in canon due to lack of means.

*** If you wanted to go with the "Dumbledore used up all the Potters' money in the war" route, this would be a great way to do it. Just him bribing people left and right to keep up with Lucius

**** There was a fic where this was the case, specifically to keep the Death Eaters in Azkaban. When Harry finds out, he's annoyed, but understanding, until he found out Dumbledore had been holding onto the Invisibility Cloak that was rightfully his, at which point he steals both it and the Elder Wand.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

*** The single Quibbler interview Harry did generated a lot of attention in HBP and swayed a lot of people. I often wonder at what could have been possible had Dumbledore prevailed upon Xeno Lovegood to take more interest in current events from much earlier.

** This reminds me of an Unspeakable!Rita Skeeter who's on Dumbledore and Harry's side. Been a while since I read the fic, though, so I don't remember whether her role was a significant one. linkffn(4801140)

  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.
