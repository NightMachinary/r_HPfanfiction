"How did you manage to fake your death so well?! Even Voldemort believed it!"

"I didn't. I actually died."

"Ha, ha, very funny, Harry. Seriously, what happened in that forest?"

"I'm not kidding. I really died, and then I..." Harry paused for dramatic effect, then waved his arms as if impersonating a ghost. "...CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD! ooOoOOOOOooOOO!!"

If someone can write a fic like this I would be so so happy lmao idk why I love this idea so much


** "But, yeah, I'm surprised the Goblins still allows me to keep my vault there"

"Oh yeah, you stole from them right?"

"Yep, while being disguised"

"But.. The Thief's Downfall?"

"Nah, easy peasy with Imperius to your assigned goblin"

"No way!"

"Yes way. Anyway, I then got out riding their dragon"

".... sure, with Mrs Scamander, pfft"

"Minister Granger actually"

"But... but... She would be breaking... I don't know, all the laws!"

"Eh, she's the one who brewed the Polyjuice for all of us, including her husband"

"Ronald Weasley?"

"The one and only. Convinced her to not keep the dragon too. Shame really, would've been nice isn't it?"

"Keeping a dragon?"

"Why not? We helped to raise a dragon in our First Year, I got chased by a dragon in my Fourth Year, seems to be a theme there"

**** Harry watch the Express leaving for school and nod to his livelong rival. He chuckled when his brain made the connection, remembering how in his First Year he helped calming a friend of Hagrid before accepting a job in Ilvermony, now a respected Headmaster there. Aside from being chased by Karkaroff in a really weird First Task (Spell-tag against other school's headmaster? Who even came up with that?), he also got transfigured into a galleon, unknowingly carried out from Gringott by the visiting Headmaster of Uagadou. Thankfully Hermione's spell automatically cancel the spell once the headmaster took a drink, it would be awkward to stay like that forever.

Maybe Luna is right, his life does seems to run on a theme, his friendly rivalry with Dean Thomas has started since he first meet him at Madam Malkin's fitting room. But, what if the first magical of his year he met was Lavender, would he become a botanist or potion master? Suddenly he shudders, what if he had met Malfoy?

****** Instead of meeting Draco and becoming rivals, he meat Dean Thomas. Thus, rather than a theme of dragons, he got a theme of Deans (Dean is a title for the head of a school, albeit usually a university rather than secondary education.)

** "Closest I ever came to dying without actually dying? Well, no one seems to believe my Jesus impersonation story."

Ron had to cut in here at that comment.

"You know it would help your story if you didn't refer to it like that?"

Harry shrugged his shoulders, probably but then it would take the fun out of it. He looked at the pub filled with DA members and Hogwarts Battle Alumni. They were the ones wanting stories, he was making sure he had fun as well.

"Okay, this ghost thingy of Voldemort from before he died, the first time, or the second, or the last time. It was standing there laughing at me as I was dying rapidly of Basilisk poison. Huge fang, bigger than my hand, stuck right in my shoulder. So, laying there, dying, about to reach the pearly gates, I yank that bitch out and stab his ass with it. Boom! Second time I killed his ass right there!"

Ron groaned as he saw Hermione take a pull from her drink, an action Ginny was following along with. Of all the ways to describe an epic battle of a millennia-old basilisk against the soul of Voldemort possessing his sister, that would not be one he would ever suggest.

Draco was better but he was still a Gryffindor in snakes clothing so he of course had to comment.

"No one survives basilisk venom Potter. Come up with a better lie next time."

Harry had been waiting and replied right away.

"No one survives the Killing Curse either, but here I am. Malfoy, it's magic."

With that, he finally got to start his prank he had set up. He had spent nearly a day layering compulsion charms and enchantments just for this one bit.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASGgn8bNQuA][Kicking off the chain of magic music started to play in the background.]]

The assembled crowd of people began dancing in step together and singing along.

The look on nearly everyone's face as they realized he had pranked them all was priceless.

I'm sorry, what?? Tell me a single moment in the entire story, where he showed even the slightest tinge of bravery??

Last I remember, he immediately sided with the death eaters seconds after Harry saved his life in the battle of Hogwarts.

** I feel like this would be best if it was Harry and a bunch of other protags with similar stories.

Just imagine this convo with Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, and the protagonist from Persona 5:

Harry: I died in the forest that day.

Percy: Yeah, well I literally walked through the afterlife at age 12. Years later, I traveled through hell with my girlfriend and my friend Bob.

P5: Uhhh, yeah I got shot in the head after 36 hours straight of torture. Luckily, it was all part of an elaborate plan to fake my death. A month later, I /actually/ died after the world forgot I existed. Then, my friends and I killed god.

Harry: ...

Percy: ...
