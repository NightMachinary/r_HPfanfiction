I'm considering writing a fic with a generic time-travel dark!Harry running around for vengeance, etc, but from the pov of a fellow student who doesn't approve of the way the boy-who-lived is behaving and sets out to put a stop to it.

I don't want it to be completely unreasonable (I mean, it's Harry, so him suddenly becoming dark is always going to be /somewhat/ unreasonable) but if he's lived through so much death, deprivation, chaos, and ill-use already without even a hint of losing his inner light, what could possibly cause him to go over the edge in a redo?

I'm thinking of using his death in the forest as the loop point, and bring Voldemort along for the ride, but even that feels like too little to really get the crazy dark!Harry that seems so common. I'd prefer to introduce as few deviations from canon in the backstory as possible, all the divergences will be happening up-front in the redo, but if the only way for it to work is by changing things I could live with that.


** Mid-DH. Ron never returns. Hermione (for some stupid reason) chooses Ron over Harry. See where this is going? By the time you've hit DH, there isn't much motivation to turn dark, unless you start piling manure atop poop for no earthly reason. Why WOULD Ron never return? You need to figure out a way to explain that. Why wouldn't Hermione then take a one or two day break to beat the nine hells out of Ron's ass as she makes him feel like an utter coward piece of shit?

See where I'm going? If you want Harry to turn dark, do it around book five, and kill off Dumbledore early, make Snape headmaster, and get Umbridge to be actually successful at her goals of turning the brains of her charges into absolute pudding. And then have all of the four houses blame Harry for it, because he was being a complete tool throughout that fucking book.

If you're going to have Harry go dark, it doesn't make sense for it to happen AFTER Umbridge, and Dumbledore dying, and his owl dying, and all kind of other shit that's now water under the bridge. By that point, you're at the /end/ of the epic, not at the point where he /could/ turn. Book 5, he's just fresh out of the death of Cedric. Voldemort is back. Umbridge happens. Dumbledore abandons ship. This is where it'd happen.

Hermione is Naive. She never thought that could have been a possible outcome. She only wanted to stop Umbridge.

His Deus ex machina lighter does not have teleport mode? Seems reasonable that with this change Ron never returns.

Also, making Harry turn dark in DH/Post DH is easy. Make it so Harry loved the power the Imperius gave him, and for once in his life he had control, then similar things happen with Cruciatus. You could also make Harry feel like he needs more power/ruthlessness to defeat Voldemort/Death Eaters, so he turns to the dark arts/dark. Another possible way to make him dark is for Harry to snap. Everything from the 1-6 book kept piling up on him (issues) and in book 7, when Ron leaves, he snaps. That or seeing that Umbridge was not punished at all for her torture.

Maybe Alastor dying and Umbridge disrespecting his dead body could make him turn dark.

There's plenty more.

EDIT: Post DH - Nothing really changed, so he snapped, or whatever.

** The whole idea of "you can /turn dark"/ is nonsensical fanon. You dont suddenly switch personalities and develope a sudden antagonal view of the world. It is a steady progress of learning new things that alter ones perception until a solid opinion has been formed.

Unless of course your character is simply bipolar or mentally challenged. Which, taking a look at the inbred rates of Britain without the Magic-part, and then adding the magic interbreeding, would not surprise me.

Its a miracle they have a working society at all. Magical Britain in reality would probably look more like a Hillbilly horror movie than what the movies and books tell us.

** I don't like crazy dark Harry, I think its awful. If you want a darker tone but without Crazy then if you want a different loop point/motivation. Harry Potter gets Narcissa Malfoy off her charges since she helped him. Lots of Death Eaters see this precedent and point out when they let people live and helped people. Sentences are light as Harry's given them the new imperius defence. Muggleborns protest how light the sentences are and the issues don't go away. Harry blames himself like he always does in canon. He knows they're criminals but thanks to him they've avoided justice. For such a young mind, it struggles to tell the difference between justice and vengeance. Its his fault they're avoided justice, its his responsibility to fix it.

** To make it believable, you can try:

*1. Slowly.* A gradual change in character is more believable than making him dark from the get-go, and it's not like canon!Harry is a perfect saint. Play up his anger and frustration with current circumstances, but /slowly/. If there's one thing I hate when it comes to dark!Harry is when he suddenly hates profoundly in a fic something he never paid any mind in canon at all. I personally love it when Harry's descent into darkness is a product of /centuries/ of suffering, but that's just me, you don't have to take it /that/ slow, haha.

*2. Through sudden trauma.* Major character death might be the most direct example, but any impacting event can largely change someone's personality, especially of Harry views the Light as the culpable party.

*3. External influences.* /Horcrux crruption/, y'all! Mid-DH, Harry can be influenced by the little voice from the Horcrux that tells him his friends are betraying him or whatever, and turn to his darker side for as long as he's holding whichever Horcrux it is. Or some Death Eater (or Voldemort himself) can decide they want Harry on their side and start to whisper about how the Light is evil and manipulative and stuff (whether that's true or not in your story) and Harry might decide to go Dark.

*4. A combination of the above.* Beware the slippery slope of the Trauma Conga Line, though. A lot of bad things happening for no reason at all can be just as boring as a lot of good things happening for no reason at all.

There's probably more, but what do I know?

Good luck :)

** Post-War is the most believable by far. The most believable IC and In-Universe one I've read was linkffn(11858167) Harry becomes dark for good reasons.

Though if you wanted to start it Mid-DH, just up Voldemort's competency, have Voldemort end up killing Hermione and the rest of the Weasleys. Start out with a "REVENGE" killing everyone who bares Voldemort's mark as well as Voldemort himself, and the old "Slippery slope" Harry tumbles down it and ends up losing himself to it, and becomes how Batman believes he would be if he didn't adhere to his "No kill" rule. Dark, eventually crazy after it all becomes too much, but believable Harry. If you took away all that he held on to, he'd eventually snap.

** The clash I see with this premise is that you're trying to preserve canon while writing an evil enough Harry that a fellow student feels a moral imperative to stop him. You can't describe canon Harry Potter as evil without whitewashing the character.

If you're determined, I think the sensible thing to do is make minor adjustments to the backstory that make killing Voldemort a pyrrhic victory. Arthur dies to Nagini in book 5, Ron's tantrum in book 7 actually meaning something, a much stronger reaction to the events of Malfoy Manor, that sort of thing. You could even have Ginny tortured and murdered in public at the Battle of Hogwarts right before your loop point.

From that angle, a darker, ends justify the means version of Harry isn't that much of a stretch. He isn't bothered at all by using the Imperius and Cruciatus Curses in Deathly Hallows. If the war went on longer, his canon character could easily get there. But still, there's no evil!Harry that isn't crack.
