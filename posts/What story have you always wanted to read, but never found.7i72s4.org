** A story where the Statute of Secrecy is broken and wizards have to adjust to a world where most everyone around them is afraid of them. Dark wizards and others resistant to the change would give all wizards a bad name, causing large groups of muggles to become hostile and persecute anyone with magical blood.

Bonus points if the breaking of secrecy is caused by Wormtail not being a spy and thus Voldemort gaining control of both magical and muggle Britain. James/Lily/Harry would still exist as a family, but like so many other wizarding families they would be reliant on and help run an underground network of information and supplies. Also, on helpful muggles that have the sense to realize not all wizards are Death Eaters.

Also: any fiction portraying a wizarding high society that actually requires the protagonist to play by the rules rather than pressing "I win" buttons. This high society should include honor duels, because awesome.

  “Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald,” says Skeeter with such a tantalizing smile. “I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell -- or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend. After they've read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!”
#+end_quote

That's exactly the fanfic I'd like to read but couldn't find yet. It always bugged me that Grindelwald could lose with the Elder Wand. I want a fic where Grindelwald and Dumbledore duel is only a legend and Grindelwald in fact surrendered willingly after talking with Dumbledore. Or maybe them starting to fight, in the middle they realize they don't want to kill each other and talk instead.

*** Right, Grindelwald was convinced by Dumbledore during their duel that his means had failed and that his visions required a different approach. So he yielded and voluntarily went into exile in Nurmengard.

Dumbledore continued with a far more subtle approach and had been successful until late 60s, when his efforts were derailed by Tom Riddle. Many times, Grindelwald considered breaking out, but his friend assured him that things were under control.

With Albus' death in 1997, Grindelwald decided that enough was enough. He broke out, rallied his remaining followers and sympathizers, infiltrated into Britain, and began openly contesting Voldemort's rule.

** A story where Muggles find out about the Wizarding World, they either fight against them or try to live together. Written as in character as possible with no bashing.

A multi chapter story where Voldemort is a compelling and intimidating villain who actually wins the war, but the fight still goes on. So many Voldemort wins stories have the characters giving up, which I don't see at all.

A story where Tom Marvolo Riddle Jr was never born and there is peace for a long time, until something happens to threaten that peace. For instance Bellatrix kidnapping Purebloods, Half-Bloods, Muggleborns and maybe even Muggles to see what makes them so different. I see it as a sort of mystery/drama/adventure story. While Riddle was never born Wormtail could still potentially be a spy. I've had this story in my head that showed James, Sirius, Frank, Alice and others trying to stop the kidnappings and killings. I think it could be really interesting. It's a plot bunny I've had for a long time but don't think I will ever write it unfortunately.

Or wait, do you mean got together in the romantic sense or got together to form a group? Which one did you mean?

** 1. A Post-Hogwarts story where Harry accomplishes something that makes slaying Voldemort look like a footnote.

2. A story where Harry is a couple years older and he goes to Hogwarts with the Twins. I'm picturing a Harry that's a bit more James Potterish. Or a bit more like the Harry from A Black Comedy.

   Talk about a new generation of marauders. They find the Map together. The twins seem like much more interesting partners in crime for all of his adventures.

   What could they accomplish if Harry is bankrolling them from the start?

   Ginny stays where, imo, she belongs - as the best friend's younger sister who has an ultra crush. I'm a sucker for Harry/Fleur, so this age makes that pairing very doable.

   Harry's participation in the tri-wizard is much more realistic - he could very well enter himself, or at least try.

   Bonus points if Harry is also a metamorphmagus and it's done well. Imagine the shenanigans with the twins.

   Snape could say Harry is just like his father and it might actually have some microscopic amount of truth to it.

   Of course one of the big problems with this is writing the twins well.

3. A story where Harry and Tom somehow end up as close friends accomplishing things together. The only fics I've read that are like this at all are slash.

Interesting, of the ones on your list that I've read (half of them) Deja Vu is probably my least favorite. I liked the story line, but a few things about the writing bugged me a bit. For one the writer went way overboard using epithets which I found distracting (at one point I'm pretty sure they used a 10 word phrase to refer to the main character). Also if I'm remembering correctly there tended to be a lot oflong winded internal rants with super long explanations and exposition that got a bit tiresome. I still enjoyed reading it though.

***** I find SIs to be a fairly polarizing genre. I don't just mean that people either really like or hate all SIs, though that is true for some, but individual stories can get widely different reactions. I like a lot of SIs, but there are a couple popular ones that I've seen people rave about that I really disliked.

Anyway I'll come back and link some I've liked later. On mobile right now.

Also about that perks of survival fic. Assuming I'm looking at the right fic by that name, I'm pretty sure spacebattles is the third most common place for posting/reading fanfiction, it's not that random. I guess it's not super popular for hp stuff in particular though for some reason.

However the author didn't implement threadmarks, which makes the fic much less readable. I'm not sure if that's because that feature is newer than when the fic was posted or if they just didn't do it. That would make it so on the top of every page there was an index button that would give you a list of all the threadmarks (which should just be all the chapters), and each threadmark would have a forward and backwards button for the next and previous ones. And you could enable readermode which gets rid of all the posts except threadmarked ones.

******* The turning point for me was when Harry confesses he was trying to set up Hermione with Ron because he was "scared to love her" and then all three characters laugh at the absurdity of her liking Ron. I rolled my eyes so hard they almost got stuck in my head.

There was also the SI's general creepy vibe towards Hermione. He gets kinda creepo with hitting on her especially when she expresses discomfort. and he keeps doing it. Then magically she starts to like it. That's... not how uncomfortable sexual advances work. Its weird because the SI actually did have some chemistry with her at the beginning. I was actually ready to buy a pairing with the two, then he just keeps pushing the boundaries and made it weird.

******** For the first point, fair enough. H/Hr paired fics, especially older ones, can have an unnecessary defensiveness that is a remnant of those shipping wars.

As far as the second though, it has admittedly been a while since I've read it, but I don't particularly remember Hermione expressing discomfort? Outside of William's emotional bluntness (and more casual use of the word love) anyway. In terms of whether the SI is a creep, there is a debate there, also in Peggy Sue fics, of "who" the protagonist even is considering he is turned younger, with the resulting body/hormones/etc. And I could definitely see where some of the.physical contact that happens would be unwanted in other friendships, but there wasn't, as far as I can remember, anytime where William intentionally pushed past boundaries in that realm. There is definitely weirdness between them, but William's conflicted feelings and Hermione having someone openly be interested in her for the first time can fuel at least some of that weirdness.

*** linkffn(The Ambiguous Artifice) sorta fits what you are looking for. It's the third book in the linkffn(pureblood pretense) series. Protagonist is given a time turner which is then used against them. Just a warning, the protagonist in this series is "smart" fem!harry.

--------------

If you mean instead timetravel as in going into the past to "redo" things, I find that hard to do without either making the protagonist op or literally doing a canon rehash but with narration. Why?

- If you can redo the past with knowledge of future events, there is nothing stopping you from making bets/getting obscenely rich. Additionally redoing the past would imply you had future knowledge that your past self did not have. Spells, research and the like. It's just the nature of traveling into the past.
- If you choose not to allow the protagonist to alter the past due to either "laws of time" or the protagonist not wanting to incur the butterfly effect; then you get stuck with a canon rehash.

Long story short, I just don't see any time travel fiction where the protagonist gets future knowledge to be possible to write without the protagonist being stupid op. That or the protagonist is an idiot and does not take advantage of the information they have.

I'd really love to be proved wrong on this point.

Any outside pov of Deathly Hallows - like maybe an OC auror struggling to make sense of what happened and what's the right thing to do.

An AU in which the first war goes much worse than in canon before Voldemort is defeated. Crouch is never caught and Crouch Sr becomes minister. I want to see what the wizarding world looks like when Crouch is given free reign. I'm thinking something along the lines of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][Anything but Slytherin]].

** A self insert fic in a canon setting with a main character who never read the books and strongly believes all cliche fanfic tropes and over time gets to see how wrong he was and starts growing as a charachter. But the damage has already been done and has to be dealt with.

Just imagine how people would react to a 11 year old harry who expects people to call him my lord and goblins to kiss his ass because he said please, calls the Weasleys, Dumbledore and even his own father evil. Expects snape to be a really nice person and tries to befriend people from bloodpurist families like the malfoy, nott, greengrass or zabini because they only want to protect their traditions and are actually neutral.

Instead the self inserts we got play all the tropes straight and have the inserted person be right with any fanon they know.

**** My interpretation of Harry's character was far less benign than yours. By the end of DH, he was ready to crucio his enemies without a shred of remorse. People who could climb to the top of that cesspool known as Magical Britain so quickly would actually eat Frank Underwood for breakfast.

I imagine that after the War, traumatized people of Wizard Britain demanded massive changes and reforms in the Ministry. One of its major short coming during both wars was the lack of effectiveness of its police/military force. JKR herself mentioned "revolutionary changes" in the DMLE. That could mean vast expansion of police powers and significant improvements in investigative techniques. Furthermore, Kingsley worked on the staff of Muggle prime minister and should be highly familiar with Muggle government organizations. He would now be in a position to create a magical equivalent of MI6/SIS.

Do you see the problem here? Harry might not even realize that he was being corrupted by power, because in order to pursue his enemies and protect his loved ones, he was bound to demand more and more power for his organization. Because of his great success at his job (youngest Head Auror ever), his organization would also receive more and more power. It was actually a long term slippery slope, and the security forces of Magical Britain could easily become his private army.

Epic regency fic that's not linkffn(of Muggles and Magic) because it's brilliant but I can only read it so many times

VWII as a proper war with armies etc

Harry Potter and the Undead Horde

Actually I have one story that I'd like to see but have never been able to find. I'd like a fic where Snape raises Harry or has a mentor-type relationship with him (from day one, not suddenly discovering they have a lot in common in fifth year) where Snape ends up falling in love with Hermione. I just think that the angst in that situation would be delicious.

Seven witches and wizards must learn to work and fight together for a reprieve from Dementor's Kiss and a gilded cage for the rest of their life

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/49/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery]] in a world where the Catholic Church never stopped the inquisition, Harry Potter is a battlewizard tasked with infiltrating the church. His slow rise is coupled with attempting to sabotage and subvert the hammer of the witch, save muggleborns from witch hunters, and banging nun!hermione in the most scandalous ways possible.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/44/An-Anthology-on-Broken-Pottery]] instead of ridiculously gary stu!richard cypher, Harry Potter is the OP in Legend of the Seeker/Sword of Truth. Unsure how he arrived in the Westlands, Harry spends his refound youth relaxing. Until the day Kahlan arrives. The scent of War and blood and grand magicks stoke the fires and Archmage!Harry is more than ready to ride to war to protect his friend Richard and pit his self-control against Kahlan's confessor powers.

Also, i'd like to see a harry potter/beauty and the beast crossover using the kristin kreuk series where harry his bit by the beast and it infects him turning him into a sexual alpha with all the ladies from batb and hermione his pack.

And a harry potter/waehouse 13/Dresden files crossover where harry and myka are partners and during a visit to chicago, a relic throws them into a Dresden files porn parody and they end up hooking up with bianca. (Myka and bianca are played by Joanne Kelly.)

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.

This is from Dudley's perspective right after Harry sees the Dursleys going into hiding in DH. Dudley eventually meets Snape's daughter when Dudley and his family reaches a safe house. It's one of the most original story I've in encountered in a long while. Brilliant character development as well. It's also completed, so I really suggest you take a look.

** - A story where Draco Malfoy ends up bulling a Gryffindor Female Ron, but as years go by he ends up having feelings for her. (Kind of Romeo and Juliet story at the end.)

- A complete sequel where Scorpius Malfoy's Twin Sister becomes a love interest for Albus Potter.

IF YOU KNOW ANY, RECOMMEND ME ONE!

** A fic where there's actually some kind of basis to the whole blood purity deal. It can even be something as simple as C'est La Vie; Purebloods tend to pass down family magics like learning dark curses or warding or animal caretaking easier, and Pureblood marriages tend to be carefully planned so that these traits aren't lost forever. Muggleborns don't have special traits, so when they marry purebloods, there's a high chance of that trait disappearing from the bloodline, and a very minor chance of getting a more unique trait like Metamorphmagus.

Or shit, give me a fic where most muggleborns take longer to control their magic than Purebloods, because their bodies are still adapting to it- Muggleborns get their magic from Squib ancestors, suddenly getting magic after generations of not having it would probably make it harder for the body to adapt to it.

But no, instead we get millions of fics where the message winds up being "Everyone is equal except for those inbred racist purebloods who should all be executed and also fuck muggles amirite?"
