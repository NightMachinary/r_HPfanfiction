:END:
Hi so i read a fanfic a little while ago and just want to read again while im on break from my studies

It's set in Harry's 6th year it turns out that harry's known for a couple of years that Snape is his biological dad after reading a letter that lily left for Harry

Snape became the DADA professor and discovers that harry is actually a talented duelist after making him duel him in class.

Harry has put up glamours to hide that he doesn'y have the potter features. Snape can tell harry is wearing glamours but doesn't know why just thinks that harry is embarassed by his looks and wants to honour james by looking more like him.

Snape discovers that harry is his son after they rescue narcissa malfoy from malfoy manner. (harry amd draco became friends at some point in the fic).

Harry denies but incriminates himself by revealing that he knows lily and snape slept together when they were drunk. Snape wants harry to accept that they are related and apparantly blood relation is a big deal to him.

He uses legilimems amd learns that harry is a horcrux and that he needs to die blah blah some confrontations and snape gets rid of the Horcrux in harry using some potion.

Snape doesnt remember he slept with lily because she obliviated him but early in the book he discovers that he had been obliviated and reverses it thats why he had been able to piece that harry is his son.

Draco and harry do get romantcally involved as well

Thats pretty much all i remember and that the title was probably along the lines of perfect lie or something

Thank you in advance!

  AU of HBP. Harry found out that he was Snape's son two years ago, and he's carefully concealed it. But now Snape is his Defense teacher, and Draco Malfoy is up to something, and Dumbledore is dying, and the final battle is coming up, and everything is getting very, very complicated.
