** Its not Tom riddle and its not voldemort either. You can say its an older Tom Riddle and the fic shows the story behind why fem Tom Riddle decided to become Lord Voldemort, but she doesn't enjoy it. Linkffn(Limpieza De Sangre)

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  Their engagement managed to make the news in just about every major magical newspaper. Harry wasn't quite sure how as he stared down at a photograph of himself plastered on the front page of the Lifestyle section of the Nagasaki paper. It was an old photo, from the opening of the school, and was simply him smirking at the camera in his brand-new classroom. Below the fold there was another of him and Priya arm-in-arm in a park. "Anything good in the paper?" Priya asked as she stepped into the kitchen. Harry turned his attention from the paper to her and couldn't help but admire his fianc√© for a moment, especially as the meaning behind that word sank in. Her dark hair was down and falling nearly to the small of her back and she wore a pink negligee. "Us," he said, summoning the teapot and an additional cup to the counter. He used magic to pour it for her as he slid the paper across the counter. She sat in his lap rather than at the other stool and slid the paper back toward herself.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.
