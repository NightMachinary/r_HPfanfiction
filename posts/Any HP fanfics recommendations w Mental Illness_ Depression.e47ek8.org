** *Afflicted With Filth* by MerhppDerhpp can be found on both fanfic.net and the Archive. The main character has Depersonalisation-Derealisation Disorder along with Selective Mutism. linkao3(16486274)

*And We Let the Scales Fall* by CrackleTack definitely deals with mental illness in regards to Salazar Slytherin, who is half mad from his experiences, and dealing with the grief of all his friends, and all his children being a thousand years dead. linkao3(21051101)

*Dark Lord Who* by Naidhe has Hermione dealing with the shock and depression of basically everyone she has ever cared about being dead. linkao3(15629688)

*Diablerie* by Oceanbreeze7 is a fascinating take on a Tom Riddle who is riddled with PTSD among a selection of other disorders, and the fic honestly focuses on how he copes with these issues, and fails to do so, while being mentally connected to a Harry who is overwhelmed, fascinated, horrified, and empathetic. linkao3(16697380)

*If death is a doorway, I am gate seeker* by dwellingondreams focuses on Lily Potter in the wake of her husbands death, when both she and her son miraculously survive their encounter with Lord Voldemort. Lily is acutely depressed at the loss of James, and despite being glad she can be there for her son periodically finds herself wishing she hadn't made it. linkao3(17194829)

*Second Go Around* by DoctorAgon focuses on a Dudley who finds himself back at the beginning of his entire life, and desperately intensely depressed. He's trying to relive his entire life, raising Harry and giving him the best life possible, all while coping with the crippling realization and comprehension that his parents are horrible people, and he has buckets of self-loathing for himself. linkao3(11626941)

  Salazar Slytherin stumbles into the future a thousand years ahead of his time, just as Hogwarts is getting ready to host the Tri-Wizard tournament. His arrival causes havoc not only for himself but for the modern magical world. He's a bit of a mess, and a relic, and a problem, and everyone has an angle he needs to understand.

  Bellatrix Lestrange uses dark, sacrificial magic to bring the Dark Lord back to life after Harry Potter has given his life to defeat him. However, asking for a "Dark Lord" turns out to be a tad bit too ambiguous. Baba Yaga is having fun, Godelot is a sadistic bastard, Herpo the Foul brags about his horcrux, Tom Riddle is unimpressed.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

  "The sorrow birds find what is weak, my chest, beak-marked, my eyes long gone." - Ann V. DevilbissLily Potter is dead.No.Lily Potter should be dead.The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.(Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.

  They have Shepard's pie for dinner. Ron and Hermione watch Harry fill up his plate and only start serving themselves when he picks up his fork and starts eating. Neville laughs into his wine glass.“How are you dealing with their mothering, Harry?” he asks.Ron opens and closes his mouth for a minute, groping for an excuse. Eventually, Ron says, “He's just so small, Nev.”“Hey,” Harry says. “I'm seventeen. I'm an adult.”Ron shakes his head at Neville. “My best friend is an infant.” A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione. Based off this tumblr post.

  The Marauders -- it's hard calling themselves that after Peter -- managed to defeat Voldemort, and are stumbling through adulthood without a war. Harry should get a normal life with his parents and his uncles. But Remus is worried. Because Harry doesn't seem okay. He doesn't seem okay at all.

** Rebuilding by Colubrina is really good. it's Dramione, kinda long, slight Weasley bashing that's eventually forgiven, post-canon, not epilogue compliant. might be kind of triggering to read for those who experience panic/anxiety attacks

  Harry has had a hard life, harder than anyone knows, even himself. What happens when Snape finds out that Harry's mind couldn't take the strain and fractured, leaving the BWL with MPD? PreHBP COMPLETE!
