** Snape deserved worse. His death wasn't slow or painful enough.

Better? Sirius and Lupin. Also, Daphne. Not even a single line of dialogue? For shame!

** Deserved better: Sirius, Remus, tonks, James, lily, Fred, Hedwig, Dobby, Harry (by this I mean not being left in an abusive environment), Cedric, Colin, regulus and probably a couple more I can't remember

Deserved worse: Voldemort, every death eater, Malfoys, Umbridge, Dursleys, Snape (he didn't deserve to be glorified and his death should have been a dementors kiss) and Hermione (for stuff like attacking Ron with the birds)

** Better: the characters that are portrayed in a sympathetic way from Harry's POV and die

** -Remus, Sirius, Tonks, Fred, Hedwig and Dobby deserve so much better than what the narrative had given them.

-Umbridge, the adult Dursleys, the Malfoys, Fudge, Snape, Percy and the Death Eaters and Death Eater sympathizers deserve so much worse.

I don't think he deserved worse as it appears the twins and Ginny, at least, made him suffer. But I re-read the letter to Ron some time ago and boy does that fly under the radar. It's pretty bad.

** Deserved better: Tom Riddle, (Who isn't LV yet) just because of what he became. I'm sure if his father had taken him in, no one would've died at Tom Riddle's hands.

Sirius Black. Cmon' his family hated him, and he was locked away in a dingy, dirty building for 12 years, for a crime he never committed against his Best Friend!

Deserved worse: Umbitch. Enough said.

** Sirius, James, Lily, Remus, Tonks, The Longbottoms, The McKinnons, and Emmaline Vance. They all deserved better.

Umbridge, Rodolphus Lestrange, the Carrows, and Dolohov. I hate them.
