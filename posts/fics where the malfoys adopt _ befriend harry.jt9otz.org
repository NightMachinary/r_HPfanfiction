In Royal Ward, they befriend rather than adopt. The basic premise is from a short that the author expanded, where Harry protects the Princes when Di is at his school and Dudley tries to bully them. One thing leads to another and he becomes a "Royal Ward" because the Queen's advisor says taking him from the house would be dangerous to him and that's a way to ... manipulate things.

Anyway, the Malfoys start out as classist and elitist, but not evil per se, and they slowly develop and get better to the point where Draco goes to the same school as Harry because he's interested in the Muggle World.

It does a good job in humanizing the Malfoys without making them uber-goodie. They're classist (but getting better) but they're not utterly evil.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

word of caution, it's not actually complete. jkr's latest terf rant really affected the way the author felt about the fandom, and they abandoned the fic with about 20% left to go. however, they did leave a pretty detailed outline of how the story would end.

  Narcissa Malfoy had never given her son's rants about the Girl-Who-Lived much credence, and it wasn't until cousin Sirius escaped from Azkaban that she really considered Harriet Potter's place in her world view. When she meets an intelligent, talented, and completely irreverent witch where her son had only seen mediocrity, Narcissa instead finds her sassy and sarcastic protégé.

** I'd be very curious to find a canon-believable, realistic take of this.

We know Lucius is a Death Eater, a man who has no problem signing children to their deaths (he fully expected Diary to cause Muggleborn kids to die). He is constantly surrounded by other Death Eaters who re still in the free. They are still semi active at terrorising - e.g. after the Quidditch World Cup, we can bet Lucius was at the epicentre there.

Lot of stories seem to think that Harry's life would be fixed, his childhood suddenly amazing, twin brother to Draco, adopted and given Malfoy name. Suddenly having every luxury imaginable.

In reality? I think Harry would immediately be treated no better than Dobby, likely even forced to live with Houseelves. Punished and mistreated on daily bases, forced to do houseelf work, with no magic. Other death eaters that Lucius surrounds himself with would never accept anything less than absolute abuse of the boy.

I can imagine him "accidentally" locking the boy out, on a full moon night, when Good Family Friend Fenrir Greyback just happens to be nosing outside in the gardens ...

Yeah in short, I do not think it would be a good thing for Harry to be found by Malfoys.

Any stories like that?
