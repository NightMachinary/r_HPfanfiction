Basically all of the time when I read Dumbledore bashing stories, Dumbledore is literally incapable of changing his mind, to the point of being a caricature ("I'm sorry, Harry, I know that Petunia and Vernon are grooming you, but you must stay with the Dursleys..."). Dumbledore is never simply incompetent, or a competent man who makes very big mistakes, he's always a manipulative!bastard.

If Dumbledore really has made mistakes, then I want to see a Dumbledore who makes up for his mistakes, rather than doing milquetoast backpedaling or silencing dissidence.

(inb4 someone tells me to read canon)

Is the whole point of bashfics. The characters aren't there to be redeemed, in any way, they're there to be made fun of for everything they do. Their very existence is an insult to the author, and they do not, /cannot/ accept that character as actually being a character. At least in the context of that story.

Because to change for the better would mean growth. It would mean that the bash-target is more than a representation of a target for the author's hate, whether it stems from 'why didn't you do anything for the person I projected myself onto' (in case of Dumbledore) or 'you embody every single one of my insecurities' (which is the common thread for Ron bashing, I've found) or any one of a thousand reasons (which does include 'someone asked me to write one and I was curious to see if I could').

A bashfic where the target accepts his faults and strives to improve beyond his faults and make up for his mistake is not, in my reckoning, a bashfic. It's just a normal story with an exaggerated premise.

EDIT: however, I would be interested to see such a fanfic.

I imagine it'd be like linkffn(Albus Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure) without the dimensional hopping.

*** Dumbledore is very easy to bash. Looking back, he makes so many bad decisions that the only reasonable explanations are either gross incompetence or malicious manipulation. Leaving a toddler on the doorstep in November with just a letter?! "Hello, your sister's dead, here's another mouth to feed." Dumbledore did nothing right in the first 2 books.

It's a common problem, not just in bashfics. Few authors are good enough to write characters with any depth, most characters end up as 2-dimensional caricatures of themselves.

Ron is a lazy, jealous glutton, Dumbledore is twinkling the school to death, Harry can't fly without making spectacular dives where he pulls up /inches/ from the ground, and the Marauders are all about "cubs", "pups", "prongslet", "furry little problems", and "yes, I'm always Sirius".

Nothing changes, bashfic or not. At least not in a good way. Draco in leather pants and a pregnant Harry isn't much of an improvement. At least a Snape that collects dirty underwear from girl students is something original.

I recently read a fic with a non-stuttering Quirrell. That gave me a literary hard-on.

** linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) does not have "bashing" per se, but definitely shows a Dumbledore that is cautious and used to keeping all the secrets / knowledge to himself fearing the information getting to the enemy. He's not portrayed as cruel or careless, to me the characterization was very believable, only in the face of protective!Sirius that he's forced to acknowledge that he can't win the war that way, and making amends for it / contributing his knowledge to a war council properly. Lotsa exciting Wizengamot politics and family magic stuff (a little OP!Harry though), if you can get past the HHr .

I'm no fan of HHr myself at all, but I frequently re-read this fic, it's quite enjoyable to me. Probably due to my love of Sirius...

**** I agree but i think it's because everyone loves Tonks. I really wanted the Honks ship to work out in that fic and then the author springs that chapter on us.

It makes sense from a tactical viewpoint. Not using Tonks' talents in the war is straight up stupid and using her as a spy is really the only competent choice a general can make in that situation especially if Tonks is willing and even asking to do it; but that doesn't change the fact that she's a fantastic character and we as readers can't help but think that she deserves better.

**** How is he not evil?

He's asking her to kill and torture in order to gain some unclear advantage if she manages to become one of Voldys most trusted.

It seems clear to me that this is incredibly evil:

1. There's no guarantee that it will work, honestly it seems pretty improbable. She might die on a Death Eater mission, could suffer a nervous breakdown because of all the killing, could be found out by Voldemort or mess up in some unknown sort of way. Yes a good general will send soldiers to their death, but it certainly isn't necessary and doubtful that it will be helpful. Also he isn't only sending her to her death... See 2 and 3

2. Dumbledore orders/asks someone to kill and torture innocents (for the greater good). Evil!

3. Tonks is one of their best fighters. She is actively saving lives and apprehending bad guys. Now she won't do that anymore.

There's probably more arguments on why it's evil, especially because he might also be doing this in order to isolate Harry.

***** Not different from any other general. War is a dirty thing.

1. Because there's so few chances that it works is a very good reason to be serious about it and not messing around. Tonk's a soldier, she knows the risks, She's in there willingly. Moreover, where did you ever seen any garantees in a war? There are no garantees. You use all your assets as well as you can, and you hope it will be enough, and that not to many people will die. That's what a war is. If you're not ruthless, more of your people will die.

2. In a time of war. This isn't about the greater good. It's about fighting a war. If you're not going to fight it seriously, you shouldn't fight it at all.

3. Tonks is also their only metamorph. She's extremely well suited for infiltration. There are other fighters.

****** I'm quite a cynical person as well but I'm not going to stoop to your level and try to justify war crimes. There's a reason that all civilized nations have agreements on these things.

Just so that we're clear on things this is the relevant quote from the fic:

There's no ambiguity here. Both Tonks and Dumbledore are irredeemable for taking such monstrous actions. It made me sick.

Wikipedia on [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime][war crimes]]

#+begin_quote
  A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the law of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility.[1] Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners, torture, destroying civilian property, taking hostages, perfidy, rape, using child soldiers, pillaging, declaring that no quarter will be given, and using weapons that cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.[2

There's also a reason why all of them breach these agreement more often than not.

A soldier in a military campaign isn't an agent in an undercover mission. Tonks will have impossible dilemas to solve, situations with no good solutions and Dumbledore informs her of that fact. We're not in the case of a soldier who blows off some steam torturing or murdering civilians, here.

Now, it's easy to play holier than thou from behind a keyboard, but an agent in an undercover mission has to make the calls, even if they don't like the decisions they make.

Dumbledore's not Stalin.

Edit: Dumbledore's a politician and Tonks a soldier, none of them are going to be completely moral. But they are genuinely trying to do their best given the situation. That's why I find that a little too much to call them evil.

That's utter bullshit and you know it. Most undercover missions for anything won't require you to murder innocent civilians, you probably won't have to murder anyone (I'm sure the Kremlin doesn't ask their operatives to murder an american in front of everyone to proof their loyalties).

Also it's not even a question that she will have to murder civilians and lots of them. She wants to get into the inner circle of the madman. Just murdering people is probably the least of what will be required of her (Torture, rape,...).

Most undercover mission's do not take place during war time. I've been told that a lot of messy things of the sort happend during WW2 (Even some operatives that were ruthlessly sacrificed to pass up false informations, or key civilians assassinated). Even when infiltrating a gang, you never know what you're going to be asked. Some gangs ask their recruits to commit murder as an initiation (also to have dirt on their recruits). I'm sure that the cops have ways to go around that, but there's always a risk.

I wonder what the CIA operatives that are bound to have infiltrated ISIS had to do to earn their spots in the organization...

I just wanted to say that this is pretty far from being clearcut, or at least is very arguable. Imo good and evil are heavily influenced by popular opinion and power dynamics. Or at least, what people consider good and evil.

It's been shown that when certain figures (especially powerful ones) make their opinions known, the opinions of many people in a group actually change.

For example, before America invaded Vietnam, about 75% of the country opposed getting involved. The day after the US publicly announced it was getting involved, that number dropped to 40%. (This is from /Lies my Teacher Told Me/, I forget the original primary source citation in the book though).

What people think is heavily affected by authority figures (above, plus the Milgrand Shock Experiment), as well as their peers (forget the name, but that experiement where people would all shout the wrong answer to an easy question and the subject would begin to believe that the wrong answer was correct).

Whether or not there is some "good" and "evil" that aren't affects by people's opinions depends on your personal views (I adamantly disagree, but I think you'd agree). But you can't deny that what people /think/ "good" and "evil" mean is heavily based on society.

You don't win wars by playing nice, and (at least in my opinion) the victors have a huge say in deciding after the fact if they were "evil" or "good".

Well duh, that's a tautology. Of course popular opinion and power dynamics device what people "consider good and evil". Certainly.

#+end_quote

Hm I'm from a fairly religious family, but I'm not religious at all, actually pretty anti-theist. But I studied a lot of philosophy and find moral relativism pretty reprehensible, because almost anything can be justified. I think there are strong secular arguments for a universal moral basis: Evolutionary common ground (we instinctively understand that murder is wrong, because a population that callously kills each other won't survive long) and logical arguments through rationality. From both of these I can arrive at moral judgements that I'd consider universal without invoking a higher power and you won't be able to escape responsibility by claiming that you got socialized in a certain way.

But I'm going to concede that there's certainly no consensus about this. I reject the idea though that having moral principles requires religion.

I can't really fathom though how any moral relativism doesn't immediately follow through to moral nihilism from there, because if morals are completely relative to their culture they are, in my opinion, just as meaningless as if they don't exist at all. Why even bother with the term morals if they are just a different way of describing what is socially acceptable in your particular culture? "Well, my parents are sadists and raised me that way, so I think hurting people is perfectly alright and because you are a moral relativist you are going to have to agree that I'm correct and my behaviour is perfectly moral" Seems like a pointless exercise to me.
