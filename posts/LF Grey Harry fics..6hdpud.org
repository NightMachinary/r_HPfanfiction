** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: The Trio (and most 'good guys') are definitely 'grey' in this story. They would kill their enemies without much hesitation. [[/spoiler][For example even Lavender, who hadn't killed before, could execute Amycus Carrow in cold blood, and the Carrows didn't even hurt the students like in Canon.]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): They were not amoral, but they were willing to get their hands quite dirty. [[/spoiler][By the time Voldemort fell, they had already compiled a very impressive body count. But it was their actions after Voldemort's defeat that put them firmly in the 'grey' category.]]

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I'm not sure if you might have seen this yet. Ilinkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor]])

A lot of the time, slytherin!harry ends up being a good way to find grey harry stories. There's communities on fanfiction.net for both grey and slytherin harry which i've used before. Obviously I haven't read all of the stories in all the different groups but I've had good experiences.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
