1. It accepts that a super Harry would not have an issue with canon Voldemort. Voldemort is on the back foot, because he would be, and the story doesn't keep up with contrived reasons to drag us back to the canon plot.

2. It gives Harry new challenges, without just souping up the canon ones (Hey, Voldemort is more powerful too, so you're just going to read the same story with more flashy lights.), or adding new ones that don't even appear in canon. The best part is that Harry chooses to take on the challenges that he does, rather than just being buffeted around by chance.

3. It feels refreshingly different to canon, but not too much. It's one of the few fanfics that brilliantly skate the line between 'Yawn, you're just rehashing canon' and 'well, this isn't even Harry Potter any more'.

4. It explores the problems with the canon universe, making the complaints that we wish canon Harry had made, without just feeling like it's criticising the original.


** My main issue with it is that it's not just super Harry it's almost godlike Harry. In his very first transfiguration lecture he is already better than one of the best witches in whole Britannia. You can make Harry stronger but that's just way too strong. Also if goblins are really that much stronger(almost every goblin is a transfiguration master). I can't imagine them ever losing a war against wizards. Maybe this is explained in a later chapter I stopped reading after the first few chapters.

*** Meh, that transfiguration basically plays no part to the story, and could be removed entirely.

I don't think it's better, per se, it's more that the goblins are looking at Transfiguration differently. Wizards have been overthinking it, assigning a spell, wand movements etc to every unique transfiguration, where as Goblins just do it as one action (changing something in to something else).

As for losing the wars, we see that the goblins are better at magic related to producing stuff (transfiguration, potions, etc) but they seem to be weak at combat magic, relying instead on swords and martial arts. Harry is unique in that he's a goblin raised wizard, so uses both.

**** how is that not better ?

Transfiguration and portions are my favorite combat skills. Transfiguring a tree into a flock of birds filled with potions that explode on contact is really effective.

** Harry Crow is atrocious. It's almost a case study of what not to do when writing a stronger Harry.

I stopped reading after around chapter 5 when I've seen crackfics with more realism than this.

Harry, and his army of uber-competent Goblins who just want equality.

#+begin_quote
  2. It gives Harry new challenges,
#+end_quote

But none that actually challenge him. Way back when I stopped reading it, it was the soullessness and the banality that got to me. Like I wrote before, it's not a trainwreck; the train is in perfect repair, going, at an impressive speed, absolutely nowhere.

Different --- yes. Refreshingly --- no.

  and 'well, this isn't even Harry Potter any more'.

Well, Harry is a HINO and a special snowflake (whom Hogwarts itself designates as a special snowflake), Hermione has no personality, Dumbledore is incompetently Manipulative!, and Goblins are just misunderstood.

And when it runs out of problems to "explore", it invents some.

** This feels like a troll, but I'll take the bait.

I've never been able to finish a Robst story, no matter how bored or desperate for something to read. Regardless of the number of reviews, his writing and this story--are an acquired taste. Does it have eleven year olds in love? If it does, then it might not be the best story ever.

Soul-bonds, grandstanding, excessive speeches, unlikeable know-it-alls, perfect children that act like adults, enough angst to make someone grind their teeth? Hmm, if the answer is yes to any of these, then any positive points the story has are diminished. If these things were removed from the story it'd probably only be 25k instead of 700k.

Hey, nothing wrong with unlikeable know-it-all characters. Hermione gets some great lines this way.

The problem is with unlikeable know-it-alls whom everybody (who isn't evil) likes anyway, and Harry Crow has a surfeit of those.
