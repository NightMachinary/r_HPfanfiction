  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

***** Holy shit did that inspire some weird af crack.

Reparo repairs shit right?

Harry uses it constantly and reflexively as he loves practicing magic while not being the best at learning spells right away.

So when Voldemort comes back to life he casts Reparo at Voldemort without thinking.

So it 'repairs' Voldemort. So many options to fuck around with there.

Glorious!

Will have to play around with it for a bit until I figure out the most entertaining way to go about it.

***** Yeah, although Jotaro is still more likeable than Harry in those fanfics. Hell, even Johnny, who is the biggest asshole as JoJo, is more likeable. For once, can we have a fanfic where Harry is a nice guy, or is cold on the outside but a softie in the inside?

But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?'
