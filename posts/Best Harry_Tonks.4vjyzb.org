#+begin_quote
  When Tonks & Harry meet, they quickly become friends. When tragedy brings them together again, it develops into more. Age, school, & war are only some of the obstacles in their way. Mix of canon & A/U. Rating mostly for language.

*** linkffn(HP and the summer of change by lorddwar) was well written, and I enjoyed it. It's been a while ago, so I don't remember the details, but I remember it having some issues. Nothing major, but irritating.

Spelling errors, overpowered Harry, clich√©s.

Worth reading once, but maybe not worth re-reading.

**** This story seriously needs to stop being recommended. It is way, way, way out of date. It might be one of the first harry/tonks stories, but it has not held up well at all.
