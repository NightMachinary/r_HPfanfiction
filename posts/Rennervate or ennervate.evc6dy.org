I've seen both used about equal amounts of times in fics so which do you think it is?


** ((*/WARNING:/* Inner Ravenclaw spreading its wings from down in the badger den))

It was, initially, 'Enervate', but they later changed it to /'Renervate'/. I believe it to be because *'Enervate'* is an existing English-language word meaning: to *"cause (someone) to feel drained of their energy or vitality; to weaken."* It is totally the opposite concept from '*R*evive', which is the desired effect for this particular spell: that is, to /imbue/ one with energy or vitality, so that they awaken.

I hypothesize that an 'R' was placed in front of the word 'Enervate' to instill the idea of 'Reviving' one via a magical mean; meant to be interpreted as the literal opposite action of 'Enervating' to avoid inferring the 'Renervation' as a simple revival by more natural means.

******* Indeed, it is adorffleble, but have you truly not heard of all Sixteen Houses of Hogwarts? For your illumination, they are the following:

Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Gryffindor, Hufflecluff, Huffin', Huffledor, Ravelpuff, Ravin', Ryffindor, Slyfferuff, Slytherclaw, Slythyndor, Gruffleduff, Gryffinclaw, and Good Grief.

** Oddly, it's both.

That is to say, /originally/ it was Enervate (my 1st edition GOF has it as 'Enervate') but that was changed in later editions to Rennervate.

*** I got another reply saying it was renervate because enervate was already a word in the english lexicon and meant to drain someone of their energy or something

So enervate got changed to renervate adding the r and making it sound like reviving someone

** because some of the writers who have D&D experience remember a high-level necromancy spell that /drains class levels/ that was also named enervation.

getting hit that one would /not/ make you feel awake and ready to fight.
