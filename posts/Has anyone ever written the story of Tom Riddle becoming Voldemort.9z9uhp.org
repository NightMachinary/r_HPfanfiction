I've long wanted to see what a talented author could do with the story of Tom Riddle. Keeping it canon compliant, with the story of childhood up to his visit to Godric's Hollow on Halloween. I wish JKR would write these some day, but I feel it's a pipe dream. If anyone has anything close to this they could recommend, thank you!


** Ok, so I /don't/ have a story of the actual origin story, but I /am/ writing a story of him going back in time and trying again. Does a fix-it story count? :/

********* Just finished reading all of it too, that was good stuff. Looking forward to the next chapter.

Will the Machiavelli quotes actually become relevant or are they just fancy scene separators?

********** They're sorta a nod to my background in computer engineering, so no, not exactly relevant to the story itself. The quotes reflect Tom's opinions and beliefs, so I thought they would be fitting. But also yes, honestly just fancy scene separators in the form of a puzzle. ;)

** The classic (and, in my opinion, best) Voldemort origin story would be linkffn(11752324) by [[/u/TE7]]. Aside from the gender switch, it's canon compliant.

*** I've not read the entire thing, but it's basically about HP after the events of the graveyard and the female Voldemort.

An origins story isn't that - it's about depicting TMR as the main character, and exploring his days as a young boy eventually growing in power and becoming the feared Dark Lord.

**** If you've read far enough to get to the diary, then you will recognize that it indeed is an origins story of precisely the type the OP requested. Harry's learning of Emily through reliving her past through the diary is sort of the point of the story.

***** I did read up to that point and a bit beyond, but that just shows snippets of Voldemort's life.

An origins story is usually a full story of their life. Usually, anyway

****** I don't know why I'm arguing this point with someone who hasn't even read the story.

No story could tell the full story of anyone's life. (How many stories have you read that tell of all the times the character stubs her toe, brushes her teeth, defecates, goes down on her lover, etc.)

An origins story is a largely chronological tale describing the foundational elements that define who a character is in the present. LdS spends north of 100k words doing this. I think by anyone else's standards, it at least contains an origin story if not being one itself.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  {DONE!} What drove Hogwarts' most brilliant student to become its greatest foe? Step into a mind that has failed to see past the darkness, and watch the chilling memories that were poured into Tom Riddle's diary resurface...
