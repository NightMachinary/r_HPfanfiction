Looking for fics where the WW start adapting and getting use to Muggle tech, even at Hogwarts (as long as Harry and co are there).

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** No, that wasn't the one. I only thought it was because they took on Star Wars names. Anyway, I seem to recall one or two that involved Hermione/Harry introducing wizards to Star Wars, and one had them befriending Malfoy that way. The only other one I can recall was a oneshot about Hermione getting a computer and geeking out.

***** The one where they took Star Wars names was A Switched Chance linkffn(6685668). It does not actually have them introducing technology to Hogwarts

The one where they have a Star Wars movie night I'm pretty sure is Patron by [[/u/StarFox5]] linkffn(11080542). I think introducing tech during hogwarts-period is a reoccurring theme in their fanfics, so you might want to peruse their fics.

I sadly have been unable to find the oneshot. I remember it was Hermione getting a computer and being completely over the moon about discovering the Internet and online book buying.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
