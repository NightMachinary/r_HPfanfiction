I have questions but not sure to share here or there?


** It's true that we have lots of canon discussions here as well as fanfic talk. But I think the tone of the canon discussions is different (read: better) for the fact that this is a fanfiction forum.

Firstly, it means everyone is much more familiar with the facts of canon, so you get far fewer questions about basic, easily answered issues, and a lot deeper, more searching questions that seek to root out patterns behind what we see in the HP world. There are a lot of people on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] who haven't even read the books, for example.

Secondly, it means that we approach canon discussions with a "toolkit" of certain fanon ideas. The ability to reference those ideas means we can effectively cite the many and varied ways that thousands of fans have thought of to fill the gaps of the canon world. Of course not all those ideas have the same level of merit, and many of them do not even attempt to be fully compatible with canon. But it expands the "vocabulary" we have to discuss the HP world.

** Well, the Harry Potter subreddit is all about canon Harry Potter as written by JK Rowling.

If it is more to do with Harry Potter fiction written by fans who are /not/ JK Rowling, you be in the right place.
