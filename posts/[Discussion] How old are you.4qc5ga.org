I was thinking the other day that I'm probably too old to still be reading fanfic(I'm 36), but I still love it. I'm curious to see how old we all are on this subreddit.


** 26, and I've been reading fanfiction since I was about 11.

I'm always baffled when young fans are surprised that adults are still active in fandom. Like, at what point was I supposed to disengage with this activity that I enjoy? It's like they think we turn 18 and then immediately lost interest in everything we've ever liked.

*** I've experienced the opposite actually. I only really started reading more after I started university. I found fanfiction at around 19 years of age and haven't stopped since. I think it's because fanfiction is so convenient on my phone and my free time in university was always so sporadic and unexpected.

** 58

I stumbled into the HP fanfic world about 10 years ago, made friends, started writing fic as a stress release valve after years of working in solitude on original fantasy stories. Those first few years hanging out with a crowd of older Snape fans remains one of my fondest memories.

I found out about fanfic in my twenties, when photocopied Kirk/Spock slash was making the rounds and a customer of mine at the bookstore where I worked loaned me a few examples. I didn't follow up on that initial introduction and forgot about fanfic until decades later the LotR movies motivated me to seek out fic. I ran across Snape/Harry by accident, and the rest is history.

Seriously, don't guilt-trip yourself. Fic-reading is fun, and so is writing, even if you sometimes have to duck and hide to avoid fandom's flying wank monsters. I still read regular fantasy, mainstream lit, Victorian lit, poetry, magazine articles, architectural monographs, and other print-related things, so it's not as if my entire reading life is comprised of fanfic. Although, let's face it, it /is/ rather addictive.

**** Oh, I left feeling guilty behind once I discovered like-minded, funny, bawdy, and delightful fellow fans. I might have felt (briefly) guilty about the fact that these characters didn't belong to me, but I never felt guilty about which pairings I shipped. The Snape/Harry dynamic was too invigorating. It pushes my buttons, and that's all there is to it. That's the justification.

Fiction is not reality, not endorsement, not a direct equivalence of any sort to sexual behavior, emotional susceptibility, or moral opinion. So I generally lose interest in talking to anyone who judges me as a person for my fictional pleasures. I've had the Why Do Women Write Slash conversation and the You Horrible Fetishizer, You conversation and the Ugh, That's Disgusting conversation so many times in the last 10 years that I just snort and pass on by now without engaging.

I hope you get back to writing Snarry someday! I know it can be difficult to go solo if you're used to collaborating, but you might give it a try. The Snape_Potter community on LJ/DW is having a no-pressure fest this summer, a self-posting challenge to write fic with or without prompts. Maybe think about it?

***** Yeah, it ticks all the boxes for me as does cross-gen in general. I stopped justifying it a long time ago as well, don't argue about it because people will like what they like and it would be boring as hell if we all liked the same thing.

I'd like to get back into writing but the timing isn't great for me and so far nothing has really struck my fancy to write about. I need to feel excited about the premise to write about it and I just haven't been feeling it. I hope the mojo comes back one day because it really is a happy place when I'm in the 'zone'. Thanks for the encouragement though! It has me thinking!

*** Thats exactly my story. I'm 28, so a bit older than you, but my brother called me laughing to say read the first few chapters of this Harry Potter crack-fic. I read it, found this subreddit, and here we are!

The best thing for me about fan-fic is the accessability. I have a 40 minute commute to work, so thats over an hour a day sitting on a bus, reading Fanfic. I love that you can pick it up, put it down, start another one, read a one-shot and then go back and re-read stuff that I like, or start another random story. Its great.

Weirdly though, I've tried to get into other fan fics, and can't do it. Maybe because I love the Harry Potter world in general.

**** Starsky & Hutch - written by a friend started out gen but moved to vague slash especially as they became kind of collaborative within our group of friends (I think that started because none of us could agree what type of girls would suit S&H) - so eventually, S&H were definitely doing it but there was always a fade out because none of us really knew how gay sex worked but there some scenes that, in retrospect, would have done serious physical harm (this was pre-AIDS, condoms were for birth control duh and none of knew about lube. Boy did that change.)

The same friend also wrote a few MASH stories (mostly Hawkeye/Hotlips - which were seriously joshed before joshing existed by 'Comrade in Arms').

I knew a couple of people who wrote Dr Who in the early 80s (not my cup of tea mostly due to the really horrible quality videos - made by someone pointing a video camera at a TV as the episodes aired. I remember getting a little motion sick while watching them)

The same friend who wrote S&H then started this sprawling Facts of Life story (which was way MarySue, had Jo being Magnum's daughter etc) that eventually spawned into 5 of us writing parts of it, which turned into a round robin letter thing when after high school graduation/college but only lasted a year or two. I finally threw away that what I had of this story around 2004. (I had been roomies with one of these friends and she died suddenly in 1997 at 29, leaving behind 40 or so journals along with both of our copies of the story and they all moved with me 3 times. Finally decided to trash the box and get on with life during the 4th move.)

** 23

When ever my parents catch me reading fanfiction, they laugh and ask, "Aren't you too old to be reading that? Do you still find it interesting after all these years?"

I reply with an "Always!"

** I'm 25. My first HP was PoA in 1999, still my favorite of the series. Started reading fanfiction around 2001, whenever someone would print it out or if I was able to get to an internet cafe. Fanfiction is one of the things that you can do on a dial up connection, lol.

I know in my head that HP was born in 1980, but the movies came out just as I turned 11, so a part of me really felt that I was the same age as the characters.

** I'm 22, and began reading fanfiction around age 10/11. As soon as an Internet connection was set up at home, I searched for anything Harry Potter related, which led me to many boring fan sites. The only good thing about those is that they, in turn, led me to deviantart and the old ff dot net. Now, HP is only one of the fandoms in which I lurk/read/write, and have plenty of friends (and some classmates) that do the same.
