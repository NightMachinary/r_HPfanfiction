For some reason, I find that people will criticize fanfics like this: “oh but in canon,” “this doesn't fit the canon magic system” “in canon the ministry..” I've never really understood these comments - it's a fanfiction! The author could reveal that Dumbledore is secretly Satan and that wizards are all his children and it doesn't matter because it's a fanfic! I find the same thing applies to pairings as well. People will say “oh I don't ship this EVER,” but I find that impossible because I've seen Severus/Albus have electric chemistry - because it's a fanfic and the author can create chemistry and manipulate character development however they want.


** Pairings and big canon diverges I don't mind, it's the little things that can irk me. Because it's clear the author just didn't take 5 minutes to google it.

Like saying Amelia Bones is Susans mum. Or the entrance to the chamber of secrets Is on the 3rd floor. That sort of thing. Just, just Google it

** Sure you can change many things from canon, but you better explain them well and don't have them coming out of nowhere.

--------------

However, the absolutely worst you can do is change a bunch of things like characters' personality, their abilities, the world building, and the magic system, but then still have Harry fall to Wormtail in that Graveyard, or rehash every damn canon stations.

I know one fic that has Sirius raising Harry and the author writes well, but then after Harry goes to Hogwarts, every year is basically a canon plot repeat.

Just fuck that!

** When people say "This isn't canon" in criticism of a fanfic what they really mean is "This is worse than canon, so why did you change it?"

** I think there are two very different reasons why readers complain about divergence from canon.

One is if they can't wrap their mind around an AU concept and clicked the story because they liked the ship or whatever, only to realize that it's an AU where Voldemort never happened/Harry is in Slytherin/The Potters are actually alive/author decided to overturn the entire magic system into something with entirely different rules, and the reader doesn't like it.

The other reason, which I feel is much more valid to complain about, is when random things are changed from canon for no obvious reason. Like if the author has Harry practicing magic at the Dursleys during the summer with no issue, and when readers complain about the Trace, the author is like, lol there's no trace in this fic. Or a spell established in canon to do one thing does something else, just because, or if a detail about a character is changed without explanation.

It's perfectly fine to write a story where any of the above is true, but a good writer will find a way to establish that change in a way that makes sense within the established rules of the universe they're writing in. And that may mean rewriting all the rules, but be consistent, which is exactly what is lacking in the types of fics I'm talking about.

*** That's true, I was referring more to the former, where readers disregard a story simply because something fanon is included (wards, for instance). The latter reason I've definitely felt myself while reading some fanfics - like, wait a minute, why is it that Harry can now read minds, has perfect occlumency, and duels Dumbledore to a standstill when we've had absolutely no buildup to this?

**** It depends though. I only write canon compliant stories. I can't write AU's I'm not imaginative enough.

But I try to take unseen scenes and see what those would be. So how did Amelia Bones die? Or Fudge meeting Sirius in Azkaban? Or Sirius getting into the tower.

All canon compliant but a story we never got to see in the books that's all.

***** Fair enough. I guess I'm just coming from the mindset that there is only so many things you can do in fanfiction that can remain canon compliant before people start beating dead horses. I would feel so limited if I left myself to the mercies of canon compliancy.

The biggest benefit I see in fanfiction is the freedom to deviate from the trodden path.

The fanfiction I am currently writing uses all the same characters and some of the main events from canon, but I have diverged from canon in a LOT of major ways from the very beginning. I have it set up where harry was still raised by the dursleys, but he doesn't know how he came to be in their care. His parents were good while they were in school but through poor choice in friends and their susceptibility to propoganda, they became death eaters at the end (harry is not and will not be a death eater). They eventually betrayed voldemort, but not because they switched sides again, but out of mutiny, and they died for it, neutering voldemort magically as they did so. This allows me to write a harry that is hated on both sides of the political isle and must forge a life for himself. No chosen one. No instant popularity. No prophesies, no horcruxes. Just harry potter with a dark lord that wants to use him to reverse the binding placed on his magic and then kill him.

I've placed children of death eaters in every house, just as I've placed non death eaters in every house because I don't understand how only one house can have death eaters, it makes no sense. I've made other changes as well.

It's going to be a really, really cool story with everything I have planned

** And I've never understood people who say "it's fanfiction, I can do whatever I want."

I, and many other people, want stories that explore worlds and characters we already like. If/when we want new worlds and characters, we can read original fiction. And when authors make small changes that don't really matter, it usually feels more like they just don't know about, don't care about, or couldn't be bothered to check the source material. And that makes me less interested in reading what they're writing.

** I started fanfiction in a completely different fandom and realized there are 2 real categories.

There are the fics that explore aspects of canon. They use the perspective of minor characters, explore thought processes that aren't shown or written about, attempt to fill in the gaps or explain inconsistencies, try and predict the future, and so on. I honestly haven't seen a lot of these in Harry Potter; it may be more of a TV thing.

The other are the AUs, the what ifs, "let me change X and see what happens." Time travel, alternate dimensions, setting the characters in other places and times, different characters survive or die. A lot of the "Harry breaks free" fics fall into this category.

The first set need to be fairly canon compliant, while the second should have most of the worldbuilding details correct (location of the Room of Requirement, for example; or if there's a definite divergence point, everything should be canon up to that point), but can get away with more variances.

I've read ones that were pretty interesting but could barely be called Harry Potter fanfics because there were fundamental changes that lead to long author notes for every story explaining them. Personally, I don't care for this type, but a few do write an interesting enough story that I keep reading (looking at you, luxsolis).

*** I feel that given everything of importance tends to happen around Harry, your 'type 1s' tend to either be oneshots/shorter fics or Marauder/Post-war fics.

For the second I feel that even then you have to be mostly canon complient, otherwise you lose the point of the AU. If you think about an AU as a thought experiment then you have a variable that you are changing, but you have to keep the 'control variables' the same, otherwise it can feel meaningless for the reader.

**** Canon in terms of plot or world, though?

For plot, it depends on the point of change, I think. Say Harry meets Snuffles before summoning the Knight Bus (I've seen this done a few times). A lot can change or very little will change. In the latter case, Harry gets another companion (let's not forget Hedwig), sneaks him on the train, leaves him with Hagrid during the week. A source of amusement and activity that he probably sorely needs. Sirius also gets the benefit of this, gets to check out the lay of the land, perhaps gets to be a little more stable. Maybe sneaks into the Gryffindor dorms, but maybe not. Can still end in the Shrieking Shack. All the other stuff can still happen. So, fairly compliant and not necessarily a retelling of the book when done right.

OTOH, should Sirius as Padfoot interfere or even reveal himself to Harry, a whole lot can change. Lessons and classes won't once back at Hogwarts, of course, but if Harry is receptive, they may go to Grimmauld early. Or Sirius can get into Gringotts more easily. Or Harry can nab Scabbers before the school year starts if Padfoot recognizes the rat in time. Depending on the path, the Dementors might be recalled, the Firebolt incident might not happen, or Harry gets to go to Hogsmeade openly. If--for example--Hermione knows about Sirius and is sympathetic, she won't take the broom to McGonagall, which means no fallout with Ron and Harry about it. Poof! There's a bit of canon that no longer fits.

Granted, someone else might do it, so you keep the essence but change the events going forward, but it's believable/credible either way. But the more that changes early on, the less likely it is that it will end the same way.

World canon (worldbuilding and characterization) should not shift a lot, however. It's hard to keep characterization correct, but there would be certain core elements that won't change no matter the circumstances. I mean, can we see Hermione not liking to read and study? Or Ron not being focused on sport? And the way magic works should mostly fit into canon descriptions, albeit with a couple extra details thrown in. And so on. (Although once in a while, meddling with the numbers and calendar is acceptable, so long as it's explained, given Rowling's lack.)

** I mean, yes and no.

Some people do get caught up in canon for whatever reason and want fanfic to be canon compliant for whatever reason, but that's just as valid as someone going "Y'know what I wanna read? Snape as the main dancer in a drag-queen strip club by night and struggling barista-writing-a-screenplay by day taking new-to-drag Draco under his wing while he pursues his dream of becoming a professional cheesemonger-haberdasher".

Personally, I find there's plenty of place for both types of fic on my reading list. Sometimes I wanna read something that feels like Rowling wrote it, other times I wanna read the bastard narrative-offspring of a giggly fourteen year old One Direction Fan and a kid who's just discovered Nietzsche. It's not one or the other, it's both!

So long as you don't just copy something else directly, anything can be interesting. It's not about what story you tell, it's all about how you tell it. :)

** I find it's more when writers don't explain how their story is different than canon. People have set expectations for the story you're building from, and when they're shaken abruptly from those expectations, it can often feel like the author is leaving things out or jumping around.

** I agree. Like I filet that people have their preferences for fic but there are so so many Harry Potter fics in the world, like why so they feel the need to be so loud in people's comments, just go read a fic that is tagged for canon compliance. If a fic is canon compliant people generally say so in the tags or synopsis

It genuinely baffles me when people leave comments like that, like no one is forcing you to read the AU, lmao

** You can write the fanfic for yourself and you can do it however you like. I can't do anything about it even if I think your idea is the stupidest idea I ever came across, other than choosing not to read it.

However, I will assume that since you intend to make your work public, you actually expect people to read it. But if I'm searching for Harry Potter fanfics to read, I'm searching for something remotely similar to the original story because I loved the original story enough to want to get more of it... I'm not looking for a Harry who is the CEO of a corporation that makes the low-time journalist, Hermione Granger, his sex slave.

So, yeah, my opinion is that if you put yourself out there expect to be criticized. All authors are and they live through it. And expect even more criticism when you trick me into reading basically an extended version of a universe that I love but in fact I read a completely original piece of crap that borrow the names of the series I love for traffic. Also, no one says you shouldn't write something original, but if you are going to be original... go all the way. That way if your story is good, I can support you financially too. I'm not stuck on the HP-lore. I read plenty of other stories too.

So, yeah, to summarize it. If you want to write something for yourself do whatever you want but if you make it public expect criticism... it's part of life. If you do it for views, don't deceive your readers into reading something that they're not looking for by using the names from the universe you're basing your story on.
