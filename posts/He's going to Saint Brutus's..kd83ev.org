There is a brief moment, between receiving the invitation and accepting it, when a child who is down for attending Hogwarts can have their registration switched to another school. Little does Vernon Duresly know there is an actual Saint Brutus's school in the wizzarding world and his declaration has Harry set on a different path.


** I'm not even going to attempt to write Hagrid's accent. You'll just have to imagine it.

--------------

"Really? That's great! Hogwarts is a fine school and all, but Saint Brutus is a much better school for people like us."

"What do you mean, 'like us?'" Harry asked, seeing absolutely nothing in common between the two of them.

Hagrid chuckled. "Believe it or not, I was just as small and scrawny as you are when I was--- err, /transferred/ to Saint Brutus's School of Self Improvement and Martial Maledictions."

Vernon perked up. While this man had clearly misunderstood him, this other school sounded like the perfect school to send the boy to, even if it was full of freaks.

"Self improvement and martial maledictions?"

"That's just a fancy way of saying 'getting jacked and punching curses directly into anyone you don't like.'"

As Hagrid flexed for Harry and told the story of becoming valedictorian by literally punching a professor inside out, Vernon started having second thoughts for what might have been the first time in his life.

--------------

I couldn't think of a way to fit it in, but I intended Saint Brutus's motto to be /Etiamne levas, frater?/

I can just see Harry coming home after First Year, and Dudley immediately changing his opinion of magic.
