** Basically just Harry Potter tbh.

He's brash and bold and it pretty much always works out in his favor, he's a sports athlete and probably the best one at hogwarts, he kills a giant snake not with any magic but with the power of "hit it with a sword real good", he starts his own Fight Club, and he grows up to be a cop and is in basically wizard SWAT. He also marries his high school sweetheart, a cute redhead tomboy gf who he has a bunch of kids with.

In Cursed Child it's like, almost directly stated that the reason he has trouble connecting with Al is because Al is a loser with no friends and he just can't relate.

**** I'm exaggerating a bit, but IIRC in the script there's a scene where Harry's trying to get him to talk about Hogwarts, and so he starts fondly reminiscing about all the wacky adventures he went on with his friends.

And the script is just like "timeskip of absolutely nothing happening to Al except struggling with magic and not talking to anyone but Scorpius."

** I'm pretty sure his middle name is "James", not "Chad".

** First of all for some reason his name is Hadrian and has a list of nobility titles that looks like a frikkin paragraph.

Second of all he has a magical time slowing or time rewinding item that allows him to work out 24/7 and has the body of Arnold Schwarzenegger at the age of 10.

Third he's mastered wandless and wordless magic since before coming to Hogwarts.

Fourth, he's been rescued from the Dursley's by some group unknown to Dumbledore and has built up his own secret society revolving around himself and his own importance, but still being portrayed as kind and humble.

Fifth, has a special dual-wood and/or dual-core wand or wields two wands that fit him perfectly.

Sixth, either has a massive harem of both friends and former schoolyard enemies or is giving relevance to Susan Bones or Daphne Greengrass.

**** Hmm. Was it the 10yo bodybuilder or the 10+yo (depending on Hadrian's Age) harem? Because honestly some fanfic authors think it's a good idea. ðŸ¤®

** A Harry Potter growing up in a world where Voldemort is defeated in the first war and raised by his victorious parents is very likely to be this way
