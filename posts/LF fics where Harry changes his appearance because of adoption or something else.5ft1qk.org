I'm actually looking for stories wich have similar concept to few fics I've read: Harry is either magically adopted by Sirius or something else so he changes his appearance. I'm interested in plot that explores Harry's interactions with other people when they don't know it's him. Like in 'Out of the Night' by Raining Ink or A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story by cosette-aimee linkffn(6671596). I know I've read a couple of other stories with similar plot but can't remember.


** Linkffn(11862560) In To Reach Without Harry becomes female and decides to temporarily/ possibly permemantly abandon his former identity. She tells very few people, and she interacts with a ton of different characters who don't know who she is.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1390933/1/Blood-Magic]]) Blood Magic is old but i remembering this fitting. Its a Severetus story and Harry slowly starts to look like snape. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8937860/1/Hiding-in-Plain-Sight]]) Harry gets laser eye surgery. Only muggleborns understand and are not wary of this new student.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

  Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry safe, but his relatives are expendable. Blood magic was supposed to keep Harry looking like his adoptive father, but it's wearing off. Blood is a bond, but so is the memory of hate -- or love.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
