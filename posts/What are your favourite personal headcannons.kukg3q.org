*** Not sure if this is true, but I read somewhere young kids of divorced (or divorcing) parents engage in reckless behavior to try and get attention from their parents, or to seek assurance. It might explain why Hermione likes to answer all the teacher's questions in class and does extra school work. Or she's just a high achiever. It's sad that her home life is never really explored in canon.

** The Flamels:

- Every 50 years Nicolas Flamel reveals a clue about the true nature of the philosopher's stone. The clues are all true but since only Flamel is known to possess the stone, there is no way for others to verify that.

- Flamel didn't invent the stone alone - he partnered with many people to create it, but only he and his wife Perenelle lived long enough to see the results of experiments. Or is that what THEY want you to think? (basically there are more immortals but they are more subtle about it).

- I don't think I have to add that the Flamels are secretly alive and only pretend to be dead to protect the stone from Voldemort?

The Weasleys:

- Is Percy Weasley brave by the end of the second book? Yes. Was he particularily brave before? No. He was supposed to go to Slytherin but he convinced the Hat to put him in Griffindoor.

- Percy being a prick is partially what caused Ron to become so academically unmotivated - if that is what hard work makes you into, then it's probably not worth it, even if that means being more succesful in life.

- Rivalry between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy predates the rise of Voldemort.

- Arthur Weasley pretends to know less about muggle technology than he really does around Harry to make him feel like an expert for once. Things he asks the Grangers' about are far more complicated than the purpose of the rubber duck.

- Arthur's passion is making semi-sentient magitech devices. He tells his children to never trust anything that can think for itself but doesn't have a visible brain-case. He says that from experience, like an IT guy who doesn't trust smart TVs.

- Weasleys have seven children not because they were trying for a girl, but because they were trying for a seventh child, which is considered extremely lucky.

The Lovegoods:

- Xenophilius Lovegood is not Xeno's birthname. It started out as an artistic pseudonym from Hogwarts and he made it his legal name when he distanced himself from his controlling pureblood parents. Xeno embraces weirdness in his life partially to spite them.

- Xeno Lovegood knew about Deathly Hallows for some time, but he only became obsessed with them after his wife's death. He has some controversial takes on the ethics of necromancy that he publishes in the Quibbler. Also he definitely has a Hallows tattoo somewhere.

- Mr Lovegood has a restraining order against Rita Skeeter for sending her jinxed earrings which were supposed to "purge her from the Nargles".

- Luna Lovegood had a period of trying to fit in with the other kids when she started attending Hogwarts. It didn't work out and she went back to being true to her self, because fake "friendship" weren't worth giving up who she was.

Hermione Granger:

- Hermione Granger didn't have any close friends before Hogwarts and she was bullied for being a nerd and a "freak" (she had some magical accidents in the primary school). She hoped Hogwarts would be different, which is why she cried when Ron (enabled by Harry) said that nobody liked her.

Quirinus Quirrell:

- Human and animal bodies are not well-suited to housing foreign souls. Possession sickness is caused not only by the parasite leeching off host's energy, but also by host's own body trying to force the foreign soul out. Possession sickness can kill a healthy wizard in less than two years, with complications like baldness and magical weakness kicking in even sooner.

- Unicorn blood cures all illnesses and wounds, but it retards drinker's own regeneration abilities making them unable to heal from even the slightest wounds and fight against the weakest infections without help of strong healing magic (HIV on steroids) or more unicorn blood. This is usually a bad thing, but if your own immune system is trying to kill you to fight the possession... For Quirrell it was the only option that would let him survive other than the Stone. (Basically Quirrell only haven't Stupefied Harry because he was fighting a magical disease and his medicine was making him into even more of a wimp)

Other:

- Nitwit, Blubber, Oddment and Tweak are the house elves in charge of getting the food to each House's table.

- Half of the veela cheerleaders at the Quidditch World Cup were male, but they look identical to female veelas, so nobody noticed.

- Ghosts impersonating other ghosts is a thing that happens. At any given time there are at least 10 different Jesus impersonators in Jerusalem alone (only three of them speak passable Hebrew).

** - Harry's kids have different names not inherited from anyone.

- Instead of refrigerators, they have "stasis cupboards" which keep food at the same temperature, consistency, freshness, etc. as when it was put in; basically, they pause time on the food.

- Magic treadmills are big boxes where the inside is an illusion and the texture of the floor changes, so it looks/smells/feels like you really are hiking in the woods, running along the beach, jogging through a famous city, etc.

- Harry gets all the furniture and possessions from inside his parents' cottage. The Ministry pays him the house's fair market value and he uses the money to rennovate Grimmauld Place.

- The Veil of Death is a clean kill and Sirius moved onto the afterlife immediately.

- The Resurrection Stone doesn't actually summon the dead, it just shows people what they need to see to commit suicide.

- When Snape dies, Lily tells him off for treating her son like shit and then completely ignores him. Snape spends eternity alone.

- Harry does not become an Auror. He takes a gap year in Australia or the US or Canada, among people who have never heard of The Boy Who Lived and think of Voldemort as "some terrorist who blew himself up".

- After his gap year, Harry becomes a hippogriff herder or a broomstick tester or an antique shop's curse breaker - some job with regular adrenaline rushes in safe doses.

- Harry does not marry Ginny or Hermione or anyone else he went to school with. He marries a nice witch he met while he was reinventing himself, who had no preconceived notions about him. She's Canadian, she probably would have Sorted Hufflepuff, and Harry fell in love the day he saw her blow a wendigo's head off with a single curse and then turn back to her gardening.

- Dudley works at becoming a decent person and mostly succeeds. He has one child, who's magical, and becomes a Quidditch dad. He and Harry get together at a pub twice or thrice a year.

- Ron and Hermione don't marry each other, but it's an amicable breakup and the Golden Trio stay friends forever.

- Hermione becomes a political reformer advocating for the rights of non-wizards, everyone from Muggles to centaurs. She manages to make house elf slavery voluntary - emancipation available on demand - and sets up a program where freed house elves can work with enslaved elves instead of trying to do it herself. By the time they're 40, Hermione has had more assassination attempts than Harry and Ron put together and brags about it. "I piss off more bigots than you do."

- Ron becomes Head Auror and coaches little league Quidditch. His Quidditch team uses vicious strategy and makes the playoffs every year. He still roots for the Chudley Cannons.

Absolutely, canon names are horrible.

In my head canon, Harry and Ginny combine their families naming traditions, Arthurian/Royal names for the sons, and flower names for the daughters.

The only names from other people are the middle names, since it seems like a wizarding tradition that middle names are your parents names or aunt/uncles.

#+end_quote

I did this one in a similar fashion. Instead, all of the Hallows push you towards Death. After all, why would Death give you ‘gifts' without a hidden cost?

*Stone*: Exactly as you said. It lures you towards suicide, using spirits of the undead close to you or your idols. As long as the Stone is your position, they will remain until you drop it by sheer force of will. The positive side is that the spirits can teach and aid you.

*Wand*: Makes the wielder reckless and arrogant. It makes your offensive spells insanely powerful, almost unbeatable in combat. However, your defensive spells become near non-existent and will fail. A simple Shielding Charm would not work. Essentially, any spell that protects fails. This is done slowly and overtime, to encourage the wielder to be more reckless, amass more wins (killing others in the process), and making the wielder truly believe they are unbeatable.

*Cloak*: Much less harmful than the other items. However, when wielding it, it makes you unaware of danger. Somewhat induces paranoia, leading the wearer into bad situations.

**** I just had a thought that the cloak might have a different effect. Since the story has the brother give the cloak to his son when he is ready for death, that is the curse. The owner will die soon after giving the cloak away. It's not very neat, Fleamont lived till at least James' 6th year (when Sirius ran away) but maybe even till James and Lily's wedding. Then James gave the cloak to Dumbledore (which is a plot hole I get annoyed at) before Voldemort attacked. Then Dumbledore passed it on to Harry in 1st year, 5.5 years before his death. Which is a shorter time than Fleamonts, but maybe there's an extra paternal aspect to the magic that kicked in in 6th year.

I think the Hallows curses all ended with Harry though, since he gave them all up (didn't hide from death under the cloak nor pass it on) and was able to come back. Can you imagine Harry unpacking his school trunk when James II is preparing for Hogwarts and he finds that the Invisibility Cloak has started to fade.

** The Gryffindor and Hufflepuff common rooms have muggle board games. It isn't that Ravenclaw is above them, they just always go missing because someone tries to make them magical.

Ravenclaws do NOT have the best grades. As a Ravenclaw, I can tell you right now that I never got a GPA over 3.75, even in grad school, because I couldn't make myself study for something I didn't give a fuck about when there was so much other cool stuff to learn. I can't imagine how much worse it would be with magic involve.

Parties totally happen in the common rooms. I know it says on pottermore that nobody goes to the other common rooms but come on. They're teenagers with magic in a boarding school of course they're throwing parties. (Hufflepuff throws the best parties because the Gryffindor ones get too loud and boisterous. The Slytherin parties have the best liquor/drugs, and the Ravenclaw ones are always themed.)

There are students who sell legally questionable potions and plants in every house.

Parselmouths are only considered “dark” in western culture.

Knockturn Alley has some really fucked up brothels (think metamorphagus and Polyjuice)

° Justin Finch-Fletchely eventually walked away from his family's money and became Muggle Studies professor and marries Susan Bones. They have one daughter named Amelia who eventually married Albus

° Seamus was a longtime bachelor until accidentally getting Sally-Anne Perks pregnant on New Year's Eve. Their son is named Colin and is Lily Luna' best friend

° Ernie Macmillan left the wizarding world behind and married a Muggle. He wrote a best-selling fantasy novel series about a heroic young man named Cedric Huffle.

° Michael Corner was the result of a one night stand between a Muggle nurse and pro Quidditch player David Jones. This makes him cousins with Megan and Gwenog Jones. He eventually became an administrator at St.Mungo's while his wife Padma is Charms Mistress . They have their own twins in Rose and Albus's year who David adores

° Katie became the Holyhead Harpie's manager and married Alicia. Their wedding was on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch. They adopted several war orphans and made them Quidditch crazy . Oliver is their unofficial uncle . He never married and eventually replaced Madam Hooch

° Dennis went through a very rough time following the death of his brother but eventually pulled himself together and became a Daily Prophet journalist . He married Rionach O Neal (movie only character)

° Anthony Goldstein married a Muggle and had a son . He became an Auror and is Seamus's partner. They're like the Latino cops from Bad Boys

° Marietta's scars eventually faded. She married her old friend Roger and had a daughter. Hermione forgave her after a few years and they now drink coffee together and gossip when they have the opportunity

° Cho and her Muggle husband have a magical son who Lily has a crush on. Harry's groan when he found out could be heard for almost a mile!

That's complete and utter fanon. In canon, she came to Umbridge of her own voilition and told her to drop by the Room of Requirement. Keep in mind that she knew about Umbridge torturing students and that almost everyone in the DA would have probably gotten expelled (including her best friend). And since a lot of people in the DA haven't taken their O.W.L.s yet (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Neville, etc), that means they would have had their wands snapped and would never be able to do magic again. Slight facial scarring is /nothing/ compared to what Marietta did, and that's a fact.

****** I like to think of the "sneak" scarring as akin to the damage to Voldemort's soul. One moment of genuine remorse, and it would be gone.

But Marietta in the books is too bitter and sorry for herself to actually experience remorse for betraying the DA. She'd rather moan about how mean a trick Hermione played on them all than admit that she was in the wrong for ratting them all out.

Edit- typo made sneak into snek and that would be weird, but on the plus side, the rebellious Slytherins would love it.

.) Albus Severus forever resented his parents for inflicting that name on him. He changes his name as soon as legally possible to something unrelated to any dead wizard, and criticises his parents for their lack of imagination.

.) Harry realises he has done enough for the wizarding world, and doesn't remain an auror forever. He changes careers to something he enjoys, either teaching DADA or joins his wife in the Quidditch world.

** ,) Percy is a single dad. He and Audrey had gone to Hogwarts together but never really talked or anything like that. She was a ravenclaw and a year younger. They formally met during his time at the Ministry, sometime after Harry's 5th year. At first he was annoyed by her behavior, because she was so unorthodox and she thought he was stuffy and a bit boring and she liked to wind him up. One day, she brought him coffee and from there, they felt like they had a connection. They married during '98, after the war. It was quick, because they wanted to get some normalcy back /so/ bad. And everything was great for a while; they got along fabulously and she found out she was pregnant! She gave birth to Molly in '99. But after that, that's when things started to go downhill.

Percy noticed she was short tempered with their daughter and didn't have that motherly bond or attitude. She was just upset all of the time. Worse, their marriage became rocky. They went from not fighting at all to screaming at each other left and right. Admittedly , there were times he'd been petty and got upset with Audrey for leaving a window or cabinet door open. He just assumed that perhaps things would be better in the coming months, maybe it'd just been her hormones from the pregnancy.

Well, nothing got better. Eventually, she became pregnant again. This time with Lucy. It didnt escape his notice that anytime it was mentioned, Audrey would be withdrawn and quiet. It was as if she wasn't excited at all. It was like she didn't enjoy being a wife and mother at all. But again, he brushed it off.

Than the unthinkable happened

A couple weeks after Lucy came home from the hospital, Audrey walked out on them so much as without leaving a note. And from then on, he became a single dad to two little girls

,) They both got into Gryffindor

,) Both wear glasses

,) Molly is a redhead and the spitting image of Percy in female form. However, her personality is another. She fights, and not with her magic. No, muggle fist fight style. Percy knows if he gets a letter from Hogwarts, it's probably about Molly

,) Lucy is a blonde like her mother and while she doesn't physically resemble him except for her glasses, she's more like Percy in her personality. She's quiet, likes to read and will generally spend more time studying than Molly

,) Most people never knew it but Oliver and Percy are best friends and were friends during Hogwarts. Percy was a bit snobby at first and broke off contact with Oliver once he started to work for the Ministry, however they rekindled once Percy went back to Hogwarts to help fight. He apologized and so did Oliver for the hurtful things he'd said too

,) Marcus (Flint) grew up after the war. He had a daughter and she got into Gryffindor and he was so proud of her

,) Percy became best friends with George after the war. They forgave each other for how they treated each other during their childhood and became very close

** Charlus Potter was James's uncle and Harry's great-uncle. Born in 1920, he attended Hogwarts from 1931-1938 and was sorted into Gryffindor. He became friends with Dorea Black, a rich and charming witch sorted into Slytherin. Over time, the two fell in love and reciprocated with each other. They married two years after graduating, in 1940. In 1948, he would take his father's place at the Wizengamot, where he remained until 1959, going on to work for the Ministry in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. In 1960, he became an uncle, with the birth of James, the son of his older brother, Fleamont Potter, and five years later a father, in 1965. He visited his nephew regularly, bringing him countless fine gifts, and sitting down to drink he tea with his brother Fleamont and his wife, Euphemia Potter. It was also who gave him his elegant clothes to James for the day of his wedding with Lily Evans. His wife, Dorea, died in 1977 when she succumbed to Dragon Pox, which would kill his brother and sister-in-law two years later, in 1979. Although he was not a formal member, he destined important help to the Order of the Phoenix, serving as an informant anonymous in the Ministry of any suspicious situation, also providing financial assistance. He was killed in 1980 by Amycus Carrow, a Death Eater loyal to Voldemort, and his son disappeared that night, and although his whereabouts are unknown, the Aurors left him for dead, without finding his remains.

** - Wizards are semi-immortal, but depression (and general lack of will to live) literally kills them in the span of few years. However if someone retains their will to exist, they can live for extraordinary amount of time. Philosopher's stone works around it, whereas Horcruxes are 'nice' because they prevent permanent violent death (an important feature for dark wizards!) but don't solve the first issue so a dark wizard with horcruxes might perish anyway if disembodied for too long.
- Dementors will starve without emotions to feed on, releasing the souls they consumed. The problem is that souls would pass to the afterlife and since the only trully heinous cirminals reside there nobody wants that. Due to point 1) prolonged Azkaban senteces are a death sentence already, but a tad more merciful one (you get punished for all the horrible shit you've done, but eventually get better).
- Wizards have been to the moon, but since there's nothing of interest there and lower gravity made the first guy there seasick they just didn't bother staying around.
- Central and Eastern Europe [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Koldovstoretz_school][supposedly have their own variation on Quidditch where they fly on literal trees]]. The reason for that is that before every match the players are each given three trees and are expected to charm it to fly. It adds more skill expression to the game, but due to time constraints and difficulty of charming something smaller and slick (a broom) they don't bother shaping the trees down.
- ICW has had a war observers task force to make sure wizards don't interfere in muggle conflicts. The whole thing went to shit as wizards from continental joined 1st and 2nd World War en masse anyway. Subsequently due to Grindelwald's failure and massive casualties in both wars the wizards separated from muggle world far more.
- Fiendyfyre is fueled by magic. Once out of caster's control, if it doesn't burn wizards, magical creatures or magical objects it will weaken and turn into regular fire.
- Flying carpets are banned in Britain due to broommakers' lobbying, as by themselves they are far more comfortable and secure mode of transport (just charm the bottom to be like an invisibility cloak!).

And then turned around and taught it to an entire group in even /less/ time. Which I chose to interpret as Harry's skill in teaching.

** - Harry prefers cooking with magic, partially to spite Petunia. Molly taught him :)
- Harry is bisexual.
- With practice, wand movements can minimized and eventually skipped.
- This one's a little hard for me to explain, but with nonverbal casting, casting spells can become like muscle memory, without consciously thinking of the incantation or movement. I imagine it's like how I type in my passwords out of habit and yet sometimes forget the actual password if I'm not typing it out.

** - Luna is a Seer, but effectively hides it from everyone with her 'Loony Lovegood' persona - and that she's actually the smartest person (not student, but person) at Hogwarts but hides it because she sees/has Seen how much worse things can be.

- that Draco is a HUGE fan of the Weasley twins, and Fred's death inspired him to turn his son away from the 'pureblood' line of thought. He also attended Fred's funeral but stayed far in the background under a notice-me-not charm.

- that Hermione and Harry didn't get together because Harry felt Ron would be broken if he declared his love for her - and seeing Ron's Horcrux-vision sealed that.

- Ron has suspicions that (because of her flying skills and intelligence) that Harry is actually Rose's father, not him.

- Seamus & Dean, and Parvati & Lavender, had long-term physical relationships between their fifth to seventh year.

- the staff teach students privacy, notice-me-not and cleaning charms specifically because they expect them to constantly masturbate, but don't want them to be constantly teasing one another about it. Each student does carry a lethal weapon with them during the majority of the day...

- One of the reasons why Umbridge was so horrible while she was at Hogwarts was because she was constantly sexually frustrated (with all of the handsome young men around) but refused to simply take matters in hand, so to speak.

  - the bond between house-elves and wizards/witches is a thing, and some elves (like Dobby) are smart enough to trick a wizard or witch into accepting them

- the pound/Galleon exchange rate is 25 or 50-1. When you consider what a wand can do, that it's essentially a lifelong, one-of-a-kind purchase and it's basically a symbol of you being a part of society, this thing is NOT going to be cheap.

- that either Malfoy's Patrons or Animagus-form (if he has either in the fic) is a ferret.

- Malfoy is actually very intelligent.

- Malfoy is a coffee fanatic. A Kathryn Janeway-level coffee fanatic.

- Hermione has 'a type' - tall, goofy, glory-seekers who are actually very skilled in one specific part of the Wizarding World. (Lockhart. Krum, Ron...) However, having a type doesn't stop you from being connected on another level, and in my headcanon, Hermione's been in love with Harry on some level ever since the incident with the troll. It's why no matter what, she's never abandoned him and always found a way to be there to help him.

- That Arthur Weasley is (as Draco said of him in a fic I read) 'a Viking in the sack'.

- that although he never explores it in many fics, Harry is an unrealized Metamorphamagus (the issues with his hair being cut as a child are examples of this).

- Charlie Weasley doesn't have a family if his own and lives on the preserve in Romania because he's either gay or sworn off relationships entirely - and it's because of Molly that he only comes around when necessary. The smothering broke him, and ge ran.

- Dumbledore is not a Dark Lord - but he's definitely gray.

- Ariana was definitely an Obscurial - and one reason why Harry didn't also become one was because the 'blood wards' Dumbledore installed drained so much of Harry's power away that it was unable to be suppressed through the Dursley's psychological and physical abuse (and the Horcrux disrupting any such formation in any event, as it would see an Obscurial as a Dark competitor to be destroyed). This was also the REAL reason for the Order guarding Privet Drive - although he didn't tell them, he wanted them to watch out for the possibility of an Obscurus or Voldemort overwhelming Harry due to the events after the Third Task in the graveyard.

- Veela suffer significant disadvantages in bodies of water.

- Part of the reason why Snape hates teaching is because being forced to stay at Hogwarts as Dumbledore's spy means that he has to constantly relieve memories of his time with Lily, and it's a torture that he can't get past (no matter how many people say that he should) because he deals with it every day. For stories where Snape is punished for his crimes, he's put on probation and staffed at St. Mungo's as a potion maker (which makes him happy); for those where he's allowed to go free (as a good guy), he leaves Hogwarts for Australia and finds some measure of peace there.

Professor Sinister is a VERY attractive witch (Daphne Greengrass level) in her early 30s.

The Crumple-Horned Snorkack is a real creature.

Luna Lovegood is pansexual.
