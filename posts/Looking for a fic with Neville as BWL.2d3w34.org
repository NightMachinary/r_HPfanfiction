In this particular fic James Potter turns out to be a time-travelling Harry Potter. I remember the fic being in FF.net, over 100k words and complete. Can anyone help me find the fic please? The fic does not show up in FF.net under the filters [Rating:all,100kWords, Complete,English,Neville L.] Thank you.


** Hmm...I think I know this one ;)

** Aside from the obvious choice (Kwan Li's story), there's also:

The Green Pumpkin's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9570961/1/The-Serpent-and-The-Crown][The Serpent and the Crown]], 58k words, WIP, last updated Jan. 2014).

#+begin_quote
  Shortly after Harry Potter learns that he is a wizard, he finds himself thrust into a world full of medieval fantasy, complete with kings and castles, knights and dragons, and everything else he never expected. An AU Harry Potter story.

Possibly abandoned, but an interesting concept nevertheless.
