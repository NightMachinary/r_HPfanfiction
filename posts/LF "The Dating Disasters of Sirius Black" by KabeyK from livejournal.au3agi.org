on her [[https://kabeyk.livejournal.com/68389.html][LJ]], the link that the [[http://www.riddikulus.org/authorLinks/KabeyK/The_Dating_Disasters_Of_Sirius_Black/][completed fic was posted at]] (part of fictionalley.org) is no longer in domain. i believe chapters ~7/8/9-on are posted on her profile when i looked hard enough, but i /need/ the entire thing......wondering if anyone has it saved so i may feast upon its glory! or!! if KabeyK happens to still be out there in the world (hi and i love you), i saw that [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/fictionalley/profile][ao3 is now working with fictionalley's former authors to upload its archive to a community there]]. thanks even if it's a lost cause! happy reading to everyone :)

​

*Update*: went through this sub searching about fictionalley found two [[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/kabeyk/TDDOSB.html][different]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/20180623091453/http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/kabeyk/TDDOSB.html][ways]] to access an archive of the site, but unfortunately since KabeyK's works are rated mature.... i'm SOL. /sigh./ i love suffering

​

*Update no.2*: just found some dead links to when this fic was posted to ao3 in the realm of ~2016 from tumblr. kabeyk if ur out there sis.......
