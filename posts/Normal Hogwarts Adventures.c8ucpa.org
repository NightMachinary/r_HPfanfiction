** Not Harry, and not in his generation, but I like ‚Äú[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley's-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter]]‚Äù and ‚Äú[[https://www.wattpad.com/story/51279347-dursley%27s-dilemma-sequel-to-dursley%27s-daughter][Dursley's Dilemma]]‚Äù (unfinished) by [[https://www.wattpad.com/user/writerer][writerer]], which is one a very few dudleys-daughter-is-a-witch worth of reading (the former story is also on AO3, the latter isn't; of course, another excellent example of this trope is ‚Äú[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]‚Äù series by Forest_of_Holly, but that's a different type of story).

Or the NextGen trio Scorpius-Albus-Rose in linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) has a lot of stuff like that.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** I'm sure there are fics out there where Voldemort never existed, so hopefully someone can suggest those. I'm much more familiar with fics in which Voldemort exists but doesn't really factor much into the characters' lives. All these stories are about students living normal Hogwarts lives.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12713828/1/Victoria-Potter][Victoria Potter]] has a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. I'm sure she'll encounter Voldemort eventually, but it didn't happen in her First Year. We'll see what happens now we're in Second Year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2233473/1/Latet-Anguis-In-Herba][Latet Anguis In Herba]] is about four Slytherins who are a year ahead of Harry Potter. They're very preoccupied with the war in their Seventh Year in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3353818/1/Shade-to-Shade][Shade to Shade]], but Voldemort never makes an appearance. They're far more focused on several other antagonists.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] is an incomplete, 850,000-word fic that only gets up to the Marauders' third year in school.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12386916/1/They-Didn-t-Know-We-Were-Seeds][They Didn't Know We Were Seeds]] sends Lily and Snape back in time and back into their 11-year-old bodies. They attend Hogwarts and deal with various mysteries.

And then there are the next-gen fics!:
