1. It's Lily, James, Remus, Sirius, Alice, Frank, and possibly Severus and Regulas, but could be either way. I don't know if they did the whole series or not, but I do know it was complete, and that the characters were sent back to their original time (at hogwarts in the marauders era I think). The Author had a note at the end contemplating writing a sequel, and asking if the readers wanted the Marauders and co to take this knowledge with them and change the future, or smth like that. Even if you don't know the author, even just confirmation that this fic did in fact exist is helpful.
