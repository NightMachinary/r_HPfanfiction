I've already read Strange and Invisible History by Madea's Rage and enjoyed it a lot - looking for any other good Hermione/Viktor stories.

Literally anything goes - AU, canon, other background relationships, whatever - throw it at me!


** I haven't seen one I liked, for all my searching. :(

**** I gave it a try, and it looked like some kind of a SecretlyPureblood!Hermione fic. Did I grab the wrong one?

***** You got the right one. It's a heavy AU but I enjoyed it.

** Not sure how to link it, but Looks can be deceiving by corvusdraconis is over 400k words and a really good read. (It's an AU)

** Air by Calebski on ffn. part 1 is done about 100k+ words, recently the writer's just started to continue with part 2 in the same fic. great take on how goblet of fire might have happened through hermione's and viktor's pov.

a few by Rozarka on ao3, and found some on this site too [[http://www.bulgarianbonbon.com/fanfiction.htm]]
