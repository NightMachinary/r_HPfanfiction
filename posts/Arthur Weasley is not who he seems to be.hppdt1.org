** I could see Arthur being the bumbling cover for the leader of a Magical Deus Ex-style Illuminati group.

** There is a very minor sub plot that has a (slight) element of this in Poison Pen by GenkaiFan

Don't know if it's spoiler territory considering it's a pretty classic story but Arthur is an informant for the Unspeakables, with a code name and everything. All very secret spys.
