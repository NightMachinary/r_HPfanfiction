I can't remember what the first one is,but in the second one, Severus, Harry, and, Dumbledore share a hotel room for a conference or something. And somehow Dumbledore learns that Harry and Severus are together. Dumbledore says to them that he thinks they just got together and thats all he knows. But Harry and Severus had been together since school.

Due to reading alot of fanfiction over the years I do t know what else happens. It might be mpreg, but I can't be sure. If you know what this story is, let me know please.
