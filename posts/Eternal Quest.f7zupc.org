It's been a while since I started reading fanfics and today if I leave a post here it is to find excellent fanfics. So if you have great fiction to share with me, feel free to comment.


** I really love Oliversnape's work - lots of Harry and Snape interactions.

My favorite Hermione fic is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - she's totally badass and so smart. It is complete and has a sequel.

Dudley's Memories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd][Paganaidd]]

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there is more.

I've been reading this story ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]) about Remus Lupin being thrust back in time as a way to understand his character better. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. It is a WIP and updated regularly.

  Harry runs into Snape while trying to find the definition of home, and finds himself drawn into Snape's summer Order task by the headmaster, looking for a location outside of London. Along the way, he and Snape learn a few new definitions themselves.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.*time travel*

#+begin_quote
  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** Always recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned]]

And pretty much everything by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/4453643/][JacobApples]] is good. (Though I recommend starting with "what we lost")
