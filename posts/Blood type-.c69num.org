What would a magical be if they were born from a triple embryo one of their parents was pureblood one was a Half-Blood and the other was a squib?


** They would be dead, because that's not how genetics works.

If by some miracle the malformed mutant survived, it would be half-blood.

** Half-blood, if the Half-blood parent is muggleborn (Like Lily Evans). Pure-blood, if the Half-blood parent is second generation (Like Harry). If the squib comes from a Pure-blood family they and their children (if the squib marries someone with magic) are still considered Pure-blood (4 magical grandparents).

** Magic is a dominant trait, so they'd be magical, I think.

*** What I'm asking is if someone with a pureblood for a parent and a half-blood for a parent is still a Half-Blood and what do you call someone with a pureblood for a parent a Half-Blood for a parent and a squid for a parent?

**** As I understand, a pure blood must have 4 PB grandparents. So, Harry's children are half bloods, but his grandchildren would be pure.

***** I remember reading that à wizard need to have 3 generations of wizards ancestor to be considered pure. So for Harry case, his grand children would be pure blood, assuming they marry pure blood of Half blood of the same generation. But Ron and Hermione descendant would not be pure before their great grand children since Hermione is a first generation.

There is also something about not remember you have muggles in your family tree to be pureblood. But I don't really understand this one because from one side, someone could never know about his muggle grand parents, or "forget" about them. And on the other, one family could have married only pureblood since the founder time yet still keep trace on his muggle ancestor on thé family tree. So who's the pureblood in this case ?

****** I was going by what I'd read on the HP Wiki, which was taken from this information from JKR:

#+begin_quote
  ↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 FAQ at J. K. Rowling's Official Site - "The expressions 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' have been coined by people to whom these distinctions matter, and express their originators' prejudices. As far as somebody like Lucius Malfoy is concerned, for instance, a Muggle-born is as 'bad' as a Muggle. Therefore Harry would be considered only 'half' wizard, because of his mother's grandparents. If you think this is far-fetched, look at some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to see that the Nazis used precisely the same warped logic as the Death Eaters. A single Jewish grandparent 'polluted' the blood, according to their propaganda."

So, for extremists, it seems to be no Muggles, but for the most part, seems to go by grandparents. The Weasleys are considered pure blood, even though the have squibs in the family who presumably have married Muggles. Ron and Hermione's children are in the same boat as Harry's--Muggle grand parents with Hermione's parents. Hermione is Muggleborn, but she's a witch, so her grandchildren, if all four grandparents are magical, would be considered pure blood.

***** So a child born from a triple embryo with a pureblood a Half-Blood in squib for a parent would still be considered a pure-blood?

****** I think they'd still be half because of the non-magical parent. Also, if the half-blood has a Muggle parent, the resulting child would have a Muggle GP, so half-blood.
