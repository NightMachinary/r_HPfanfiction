Objection, he wholeheartedly supported his goals and measures. Malfoy just did not want to get his hands dirty and he feared the price of failure. But we never see any indication towards an ideological break with pureblood supremacy.

If you want a believable Dramione arc, you need to diverge in CoS and, for example, have him obsess over the cheating Mudblood, trying to find out how she is besting everyone. And during his investigation, he realises that his ideology might be wrong. So he stalks her some more. Feelings would take time. Maybe some jealousy over Krum.
