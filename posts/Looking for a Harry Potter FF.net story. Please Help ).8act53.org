** More to add to help find this!! :) Harry is really good at potions, his parents are alive, and his dad does terrible things to his mom and Harry gives Lily a port-key to help her escape if she needs it. She does and Harry helps heal her with his potions skill alongside Severus Snape, who takes a shine to Lily again, and is sneaky about making her Lady Prince.
