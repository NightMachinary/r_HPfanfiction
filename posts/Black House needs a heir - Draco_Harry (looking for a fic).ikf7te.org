Hi all,

I've been trying to find a story I've once read for quite a while. Hope someone out here can help me with finding it

The premise is, Harry inherits Grimmauld Place and it starts changing him. Physically and mentally, trying to forge him into its version of the perfect heir

Draco Malfoy is the first one to notice that something is fishy

He tries to assis Harry, who develops something of a Black Madness driven obsession with Draco

Meanwhile the house is preparing its coup de grace by trying to guide Harry into ritual room where he has to "kill his heart"

If I recall correctly, Kreacher was the agent of the Black magics in this one
