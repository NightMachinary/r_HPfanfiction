:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
One is Harry summoned to another world with a Fem!Harry by the order, he teaches divination and Fem!Harry thinks he's her long lost brother, or something. Abandoned if I remember right.

The other is Ron and Harry sent back in time many many years, they're in their younger bodies, they were both aurors in their original timeline, they divorced Hermione and Ginny, had strained relationships with family, fic is mostly about them running around being silly. Semi-cracky.

Thanks!
