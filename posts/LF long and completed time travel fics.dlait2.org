  Regulus Black wakes up in a dark cell during one of the most eventful months of his life, not very sure of how he came to be there, and with only a stranger named Harry for company. An awkward almost friendship is born. Meanwhile, Harry Potter might have made a mistake. Or two. All he knows is that things aren't really going his way right now, and that his cellmate's mostly alright. Mostly.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** My top picks:

- Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): best version of Harry going straight for the jugular and taking out the baddies.
- Linkffn(Realignment): best example of time-traveler from an outsiders perspective, action-packed to the brim.
- Linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal): if nothing else, this fic has personality (but its not all that long).
- Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter): I'm a bit hesitant on this one, as its 1) more of a time-loopish fic and 2) Harry gets kind of angsty after awhile. Nevertheless, its a long read and the Harry/Hermione pairing isn't unbelievable here.
- Linkffn(Altered Destinies): the fic is a bit cheesy and dated, but honestly I still have fond memories of it as one of the first Harry-raises-Tom Riddle fics I read. Worth a read through if nothing else.
