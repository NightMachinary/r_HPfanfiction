  As the train slowed down in the approach to King's Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleet- ingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, +however, he lifted down Hedwig's cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual.+
#+end_quote

he kept sitting as the others got busy. Ron looked at him inquisitively but he stared pointedly out of the window.


** (He's only confined to the Dursleys for a mere two weeks though. I suppose Dumbledore and the MoM needed that time to review what magical protections the Burrow could be given before the Weasleys could have Harry and Hermione stay over. In fact, now that I think of it, Hermione's house needed to have protection from the Death Eaters too, so that she or her parents wouldn't get pinched.)

However, keeping with this narrative:

'Harry,' Hermione said, trying to placate him, 'We'll all be soon together again in a few - '

'No,' muttered Harry mutinously.

A tap on the compartment door signaled the arrival of Lupin, Tonks and Mad-Eye. He thought he could hear Mrs Weasley's voice down the compartment.

'No' he said much more cantankerously, lying down and turning his face away.

*** "Harry. Come on mate." said Ron, looking anxiously down the corridor.

"Colloportus." the door snapped shut, the lock clicking into place. "Protego totalem." There was a brief shimmer of light over the door, walls and window, and Ron's knocking apruptly got silent.

Harry lay there for a while before he felt someone tug on the protection charm, probably attempting to unravel it. He pointed his wand again.

"Protego Totalem, Repello Magium." a double circle, then a four leaf clover.

Outside the window, he could see a bewildered Molly Weasley as her eyes slid off the window to his compartment. He'd found the Wizard Repelling Charm while researching how to hide the DA, but deemed it too weak to conceal a big number of moving students. However, he was sitting completely alone inside a single compartment.

It held.

The train gave a slow whistle, warning any lingering students to get out, and he lay back down on the bench.

There were three or four more whistles before the train began rolling out of the station with a jolt.

**** Calm down dude. It's a fictional series.

I was thinking along the lines that Hermione and her parents needed to be protected because she was Harry Potter's best friend. Harry Potter's protection was tantamount to the MoM. They needed to ensure that he was kept safe at all times. Guaranteeing Harry's safety meant keeping those closest to him safe as well. You couldn't expect Harry to be a good boy and not do anything if something happened to Hermione or Ron or any of the other Weasleys, could you?

****** During the events of the fifth book, the MoM thought he was trying to stir up trouble. Intent on discrediting him, they sent Dementors after him. By the time of the events of HBP, the ministry knew he and Dumbledore had been right all along, and were scrambling to appease him so that he might be disposed to look kindly towards them. But as we all know, Harry is not sympathetic to their efforts.

In my headcanon blood wards are more powerful wards but are based on blood, they'll last as long as some blood relative of theirs is under the wards and even after one has left they'll last for a few years.

**** I think the Blood Wards in Private Drive don't affect the protection left on Harry, it's the other way around.

His personal protection(the thing that fried Quirrelmort) is not powered by his stay in Private Drive. Dumbledore used the former to create the latter, but I don't think he would lose it if the wards fell.

** Harry had to of come across some spells to help him when he was trying to teach the DA, or even when he was training for the Tri Wizard Tournament.

I could see him trying something drastic with this. Though to be honest, Grimmauld Place was probably one of the more protective places; outside of supposed Hogwarts. I say supposed, because Quirrell was able to be possessed by Voldemort and still go into teaching, Fake Moody was in Hogwarts, and able to fool the Goblet of Fire, Dementors were at Hogwarts thanks to the stupidity of Fudge, and other similar disasters.

Heck, I know that Fudge just sent Umbridge there to spy and to make sure Dumbledore wasn't trying to undermine him and the like, but I'm honestly surprised Fudge or someone else hadn't tried getting Hogwarts on a tighter leash earlier.
