I am looking for fics wherein people who are good in canon become, via a series of unfortunate circumstances, evil or are forced to do evil acts. After reading Black Ink, Red Rose linkao3(19381933) which showed Ginny's downward spiral in a believable manner, I am curious if there exists fics for other characters. I have never seen a Dark Neville fic for example.


** /Dead Things/ by EclipseWing was an interesting story, though as a one shot it doesn't explore with the same depth as Black Ink Red Rose. Harry isn't really the same after the war.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

** In this fic Harry did something really disturbing before the start of the story. It has not been updated in a long time. The act is discussed in the last chapter.
