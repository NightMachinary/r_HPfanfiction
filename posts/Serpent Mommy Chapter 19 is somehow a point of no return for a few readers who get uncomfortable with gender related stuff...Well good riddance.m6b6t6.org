  skirts were primarily designed, at first, for women
#+end_quote

‘Skirts' entry, Wikipedia: “Skirts were the standard attire for men and women in all ancient cultures in the Near East and Egypt.” Men also wore skirts or dresses in the Bronze and Middle Ages, Greeks and Roman men wore togas. Scottish and Irish men still wear kilts. It was only with the advent of tailoring and when men started riding horses that they started wearing trouser-like items and skirts didn't become completely socially unacceptable for men until around the 19th century. Not having had to ride horses, wizards may not have made the change. If they wanted to ride Abraxans then there's no reason why /both/ genders wouldn't do that.

Also, this is a fanfiction. People have come up with much wilder and unrealistic aspects of wizarding culture than men wearing skirts. It even has canon precedent- Archie from the quidditch World Cup wore a Muggle women's nightgown and wasn't bothered.

Yeaaah, thanks for outing yourself as a raging goddamn transphobe. Normal, decent people aren't bothered by reading about transgender characters - or even just people who pick different damn clothes than the norm. If you're this pissy about it over a story, I feel for the trans people around you IRL who have to deal with you...

**** Ok, so first, wrong word on my part. It was "anybody". Second of all, here's how I read a story. I project myself into the main character.

That's it. That's the whole story. It's why I don't read that much fiction with a girl main character, because it's way harder to "project" myself into someone who's not a man. And it's why I have difficulties reading about a trans main character, but also a non-human/humanlike main character.

So, yeaaaah, thanks for proving you don't own half a brain. Normal, decent people understand that some people have different tastes that in no way imply wether or not they hate something. You can read a story about a trans main character? Good for you, here's my "I don't give a fuck about your life" trophy.

Seriously, I feel for anyone that has different views about anything that have to deal with you IRL...

*** Well I disagree completely that it's on the author to point out 'triggers' in stories. I've had people tell me I should put a 'rape' warning in LdS because Emily admits she was prostituted out at a young age in an orphanage. Said content never occurs in the story apart from the character admitting it happened. But it's also hinted at about ten times before she admits to it. If they didn't see extensive childhood trauma coming then I wonder what they were reading

But here we have something that is 19 chapters in where it appears that a young Harry decided this on a whim without any form of foreshadowing. And that's probably just bad writing. Like most plot points it should likely be hinted at before it becomes a direct plot point.

I've skimmed some of this author's work and it strikes me as unplanned and messy. I've never felt a need to comment on it but this is sort of exactly what I would expect from a plot point thrown in last minute because of a spur-of-the-moment decision.

As for if they want a medal for pointing out a year? Well, probably. This same author, who whines about downvotes in like every thread they make, got a 100+ upvoted temper tantrum about a week ago for whining about 'negative' reviews that, after reading the chapters in question and the reviews to go along with them were...hardly negative and were rather justified.

Even look at the two reviews in question here. Neither really harps too much on the content aside from indicating they aren't fans of it and will decide to stop reading because of it. Such is life as a writer. That's going to happen a lot. Both are actually complimentary to the story to that point and one even wishes them luck in the future. Like Jesus, that's what you're negative about? I've gotten fucking death threats on my works for content people didn't like and here they're upset that someone voiced their opinion in a calm, rational way, wished them luck, and moved on? Like...wow. And people wonder why I drink. There's a comment in here saying those reviewers deserve to die lonely and alone because of their comments.

But yes, if you don't agree with the author, you're an evil bigot apparently.

**** Eeeeh, it's 50/50. On one hand, rape is a pretty serious turn-off for most people, making them quit your story in a flash, and I understand. On the other, if it's only a mention and it's been hinted at several times several chapters before, it kind of... Loses its brutality? Like, it's not THAT bad to stumble upon it because, "oh yeah, I expected it".

But yeah, I get the feeling OP is just being a whiny baby. I'd be happy to recieve a review like those two on my own fic (once I get back to writing it *COUGH*) because it basically means "yeah, not liking where it's going, it was good while it lasted, you've got talent".

But what can we do. If I'm to be an evil bigot, then evil I will be, and a bigot... Meh. Just evil is enough. My personal opinions being **le gasp** moderate, I'm bound to be seen as a bigot anyway.

**** OP is also the same person who started The Great Pedophilia Flame War of 2020 by insisting that everyone who ships Honks is a disgusting pedophile, and did so with comments that were much ruder than anything I've seen said to them in any of the comments they've complained about. Somehow, I feel that the irony is lost on them.

They also deleted their account and showed back up a few weeks later with a slightly different name after all of that. I'm guessing we'll see an [[/u/AlmaArachnidGoddess][u/AlmaArachnidGoddess]] around here soon.

***** Then take it as a lesson. You will never succeed as a writer if the two reviews you put up here are that bothersome to you. Neither of them is negative. One wishes you well. Both compliment you.

I've gotten similar reviews on pieces of mine. I may completely disagree with their premise for stopping reading, but such is life. The amount of vitriol that's come out of it is astounding to me.

You are never going to appeal to 100% of an audience. That's life as a writer. Yelling at everyone who disagrees with you or voices a contrary opinion is a recipe for disaster.

And, I'm willing to bet had you foreshadowed the decision at all, you likely wouldn't have received the same type of commentary. I'd say live and learn rather than let it bother you. You will never please everyone.

**** Hum

I don't really care about someone being black or asian, because that's a fucking skin tone. What I'm less inclined to do is read about someone with deeply different views over something than I do.

If the main character is black, it's not going to magically morph his entire mindset. When a character is trans, he'll have different values, different way of thinking that I'm not the most confortable with, especially if he's the main character and we're going to see and read every last one of his thoughts.

But you don't care, do you? It's in your reply. I'm a "bigot", I belong in hell. I'm "disgusting". You know what? Sure. Call me that. But I'm gonna have fun.

Here is what i'd have said if I was, indeed, disgusting. Your story sucks. Your writing is trash, and you're focusing to much on trying to force your beliefs on us, through your story, which makes it uninteresting and a fucking drag. I've skimmed through five different chapters at different points of your story, and the only thing I could read was your thoughts about how a proper society should be. You know what you are? You're a reverse Dursley. End of the story.

So, how was it? Do you like someone being trully disgusting? Because here I was at first, giving my honest to fucking god opinion on why some people would feel uncomfortale with your story, and here you come with your false moral highness about how "I'm the worst fucking thing since Hitler". Oh, you didn't say it like that, but you're getting close to those territories.

I don't have anything more to say. I'd argue to the best of my capability as to why you're wrong, but you've proven you're unable to compete. All you can do is hurl insults and moral justness, which doesn't work for anyone with half a functionning brain.

** It seems to me that in a world where any adult, regardless of race or gender expression, is physically capable of casting Fiendfyre in the middle of any particular building, there'd be a lot more live-and-let-live. Because any organization that was sufficiently objectionable to inspire even a single terrorist would get burnt down. Really, the only kind of systemic discrimination I could imagine surviving long in a world with magic is against people lacking both magic and magical allies.

People can act nice and still support and perpetuate transphobic attitudes. Saying “good luck with your story!” doesn't eradicate the fact that they also said that it was wrong and weird for boys to wear skirts.
