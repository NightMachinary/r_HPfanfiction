** Wizard on the Courts is fully set in Asia but YMMV, since it's a cross with Prince of Tennis. The other two have parts set in Asia, but again, crossovers, so you may or may not care for that, plus the setting isn't necessarily the focus.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
