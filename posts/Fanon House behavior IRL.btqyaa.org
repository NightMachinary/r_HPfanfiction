** This is really funny and I can see how people's personalities correspond so well with their designated houses. I'm a total Hufflepuff, and I know for a fact that I would've acted the exact same way as all the other Puffs did in these types of situations.

** I love how the Slytherins were all

  "Quality not quantity, if you're one of us you'd know."

This is an interesting discovery on human behaviour, and it also shows that even though fanon does try and romanticise the houses, the basic ideas are still correct.

Also, YESS! Slytherins not being portrayed as 'I must win so I will cheat.' Thanks. :) (You're serving my evil goals well minion)

Edit: On a side note, I wish fics would say in the summary if they bash Slytherin or Snape, because even if JKR portrayed them that way doesn't mean it's not bashing to give an entire house literally /two/ character traits. Evil, and stupid. And Snape (in the books, the movies less so) was so simple, just â€˜I am evil, and only the protagonist can tell' followed by a crap redemption arc.

** As a proud Gryffindor who has gotten Ravenclaw more and more on tests and who has been repeatedly told I should be in Ravenclaw, your descriptions make me nervous.

Having said that, I do feel like I'd be the sort of person to bring beer.

** I cannot figure out which group I would belong in. I can see myself in all of them very easily. It's just so dependent on my mood, sometimes I'm more friendly, sometimes more studious and sometimes more loud and fun and pottermore says I'm a Slytherin which I thought was a little less suited than other houses but then I realized even that fits some of my moods so I'm stuck with no set house.

*** House are supposed to fit your values, as well as your personality. If you think about what you value in yourself no matter what, no matter the mood, that might help. For instance, I value creativity, open mindedness, curiosity, exploration, and being authentic to who I am. That fits with ravenclaw.

In the other hand, I don't really value ambition or cunning in myself, so slytherin wouldn't a good fit.

*** Hey, if you aren't cunning, intelligent, or brave, you could still make Hufflepuff.

Either that or Slytherin, of course, but while Slytherin requires blood prejudice, Hufflepuff is more open and inclusive.

Crabbe and Goyle? They could have gone to either Hufflepuff or Slytherin, however, they chose to go to Slytherin ahead of time.

******** I don't know if the books say he started the rumours, but it does say he was spreading them, and trying to make Harry seem like a Dark Wizard... I wonder why? That's two for three or four... Maybe all Hufflepuffs are in a Dark Coven together, and they just pretend to be nice so we ignore all their dark tendencies?

********* Nah, it isn't that their biggest quality is Niceness, it's that their biggest quality is "Loyalty". Be it to their Heritage as a Pure-blood in the case of Cedric Diggory or against anything Slytherin/related to Voldemort in the case of Zacharias Smith, it isn't necessarily a good trait. Bellatrix could have gone to Hufflepuff as well if her family didn't give anything "Not Slytherin" so much stigma.

There is a reason why Pomona Sprout, from Hufflepuff, is the Gardener.
