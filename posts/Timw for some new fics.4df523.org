A while ago I asked for any great and torturous SS/HG fics and have read through the bulk of them... Most of them I loved too! And now I'm in the mood for something else. So does anyone have any recommendations for time Turner/time travel fics where only Hermione goes back. I mostly like marauder era but I am willing to give voldemort era a try too. Any pairing with hermione is great! Can't wait to read your recommendations :)


** If you haven't read it Pride of Time is great!
