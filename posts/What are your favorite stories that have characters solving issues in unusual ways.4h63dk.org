This is probably going to be a bit of a spoiler for my examples of what I'm looking for, so fair warning.

In *Harry Potter and the Natural 20* linkffn(8096183) Milo makes the point that Voldemort could simply attain immortality through becoming a vampire. Which is so absurdly simple that it's amazing!

Harry's solution to saving magic-kind from muggles in *Xerosis* Linkffn(6985795) is just brining them all to the mother f-ing moon. Overall not the best story, but I incredibly enjoyed that idea!

This short story, *The Great Pixie Dust Up* linkffn(6072431), Luna decides that the best way to save her pixies is to prove wizards should be killed instead. She's also characterized wonderfully throughout as an added bonus.

So yeah, I'm looking for problems to be solved with absurd or unusual answers. Obviously I don't have much preference on pairings, though I do tend to stay away from Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione these days. Thanks in advance!


** Linkffn(9901496)

It's a bit silly but the premise is using magic that is used in the books to solve huge problems in absurdly simple ways.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

** Linkffn(the arithmancer) and its sequel linkffn(lady Archimedes) have a lot of this. Hermione is a math genius who can make her own spells and many of them are pretty creative.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
