I just read something that fits so well in Manipulative!Dumbledore stories. Harry's invisibility cloak is just a normal high quality invisibility cloak not a deathly hallow. The Potter cloak is indeed death's invisibility cloak but Dumbledore didn't give Harry the true cloak because why would a manipulative Dumbledore give him that. It fits so well because it explains why would the cloak fail and in case that is what you like how would Dumbledore be able to put compulsions spells in it.

I read it in Hella Potter and the OC the fic is incredibly sexual and not good to be honest but it has cool ideas


** Isn't it canon that there are no Deathly Hallows but instead just powerful artefacts created by extremely talented wizards?

*** That is Dumbledore's theory but even if it is the case it doesn't contradict the fact that Harry's invisible cloak could not be that particular powerful artefact

** Ah, Hella Potter... Good idea, terrible execution that became worse and worse with each passing chapters.
