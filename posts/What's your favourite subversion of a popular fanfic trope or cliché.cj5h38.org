** Time Tracel Fix-It.

And then Nightmares of Future Past comes in and says; “what if it didn't work?”

Then Forced Maturity says; “yeah but what if he didn't remember any of the details of the future?”

** In "*Don't Be a Dobby Downer*" Harry changes school and McGonagall asks Dumbledore what he's going to do to get him back, to which Albus replies that he has no right to do anything but wish Harry good luck... Then he goes about his day.

** I feel like Prince of Slytherin needs to be mentioned for the sheer number of tropes it plays with. Fred and George aren't a similar as most people give them credit for and are at each other's throats by halfway through book 3. Lucius is good and Narcissa is evil. Lockhart is scary competent but pretends to be a blustering fool for the public. Wandless magic has a hard cap on the number of spells you can learn, and any shortcuts to make you learn it faster reduce the number of spells you can learn. Pettigrew actually covered his tracks extremely well, so even though James and Lily are alive, Sirius is still imprisoned.

*** I agree with everything except the parts about Lockhart and learning magic, both of which aren't tropes or cliches. They're just canon.

**** I think Umbra meant Lockhart being competent in anything other than memory charms.

** I like how the Firebird Trilogy takes one of the worst tropes in Harry Potter fanfic, the harem, and makes it kind of horrifying. I could do without the weird sex stuff though.

** Marriage Laws are such a terrible idea.

And then Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution comes along and asks "why the hell would the people go along with something like that?"
