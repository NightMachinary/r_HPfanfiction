** linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) is a recent up-and-coming one.

[[/u/Starfox5]] fics often feature Hermiones with grayish morality.

/Surprise, Bitches/ (linkao3(8379790)) is promising.

/The Two Body Problem/ (linkao3(3459731)) and a sequel being written are a Dark!Hermione story.

There is also /The Anti-Heroine/ by cheshire_carroll, which had Hermione growing up a scrappy, vicious street urchin, though I stopped reading it because Hermione became very protective and self-sacrificing with respect to Harry for no clear reason, and there was much Dumbledore-bashing.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's parents were killed by Death Eaters just before the fall of Voldemort and she was adopted by Severus Snape as part of his reparations to the post-war Wizarding World. Hermione grows up with a distant father, a library full of Dark magic, and the knowledge that Voldemort has taken away her one chance for a happy, loving family. With a father who is the Head of Slytherin House, a Muggle-born being sorted into it isn't all that surprising - even if nobody knows she is one.However, her plans to steal the next generation of Voldemort's supporters, usurp him, and take his throne as the Darkest Lady of the century, might be a little surprising. But only a little.The fact that Dumbledore doesn't bother to stop her is possibly the most surprising of all.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete - updates with a new chapter every Tuesday.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** There's a Dramione that's Slytherin!Hermione that goes from first through seventh year that I really like. It is a pairing, but the emphasis is on the plot and her life, her relationship is more of a side thing. linkffn(Green Girl)
