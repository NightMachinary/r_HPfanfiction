  In First Year, Harry realises early on that he has more in common with Hermione than Ron. Their friendship gradually blossoms into something more - something that Voldemort will come to regret - the Power that he knows not. ... First through third year near canon, more AU from fourth year on.

  "I do wonder how the magicals of Britain will react when they discover that the 'Boy-Who-Lived' is now the 'Wolf-That-Loves'." Hermione and Harry become werewolves with some surprising results. So surprising, in fact, that their world turns on its head. Takes place sixth year. Harry/Hermione, AU. I find this story hard to give a summary for...

** linkffn(10914042) is a thoughtful character-driven point-of-divergence I recommend checking out.

linkffn(12550081) builds up their friendship in its own way. Well worth it.

linkffn(10852864) goes off the beaten path.

linkffn(11764303) has an unusual execution on its premise.

linkffn(6517567) is centered on these two.

linkffn(9649736) is a fun Hogwarts-era story.

linkffn(6243892) has them solve a mystery.

linkffn(12849081) takes third year as an opportunity.

linkffn(7417693)

Here are a few shorter, fluffier stories:

linkffn(6557422) linkffn(3202706) linkffn(2302425) linkffn(1248697) linkffn(5578899)

I'll let their summaries speak for themselves.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.
