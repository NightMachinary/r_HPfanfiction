***** Translated, it means Turtle Destruction Wave

Which is clever because Goku uses Kame (turtle) style martial arts.

And Kamehameha is also either Hawaiian for "He who stands alone" or the name of a diety who does that.

There's a lot of subtle brilliance in the show like that, and it flies over the heads of people who say "It's just a mindless outdated chaddy slugfest of a scream show"
