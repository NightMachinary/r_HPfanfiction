Like if he decided to join someone else's carriage in the first year, and he doesn't meet Ron and Hermione, and really doesn't become friends with them at all


** linkffn(The Art of Self Fashioning) Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw and thus doesn't get a chance to bond with Hermione or Ron. His best friend is Terry.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) Harry ends up in Slytherin in a more militaristic Hogwarts. Doesn't interact with Ron. Hermione and Harry eventually form a platonic working relationship, but I wouldn't call them friends, allies more like.

linkffn(What you leave behind by newcomb) Harry is one year older than in canon. Best friends are Cho and Cedric.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) Harry isn't the boy who lived, his brother is. His relationship with his family isn't antagonistic. He also gets sorted into Ravenclaw and doesn't get along with his housemates.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily got in a lucky shot on Voldemort that night. They fled Britain, and Harry never went to Hogwarts. He first faced off Ginny Weasley in 2009, and went on to recruit Neville Longbottom and the Lovegoods in 2010. [[/spoiler][Later, Severus Snape would defect to him in 2015, and Hermione Granger In 2017.]]

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** I've noticed that in most of these stories, Harry still has a "Ron" and a "Hermione" with him, they just have different names. And if Harry's in Slytherin, Ron often becomes the new "Malfoy" and Ginny the new "Pansy" (excluding the "dating Malfoy" part, obviously).
