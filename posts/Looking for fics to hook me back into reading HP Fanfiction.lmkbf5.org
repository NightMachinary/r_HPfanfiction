:END:
Just a couple months ago, I had a new fic to read constantly, and it was very nice. Then, I sorta ran out and the Request threads of other people on here were running dry of fics of good quality that I haven't read. I went on to read Dresden Files, because I had nothing to read, finished all of it, and now I am back here. I am really hungering for a fic to immerse myself in, something to hook me back into reading fan fiction!

I tried some popularly recommended fics, such as Basilisk-born, A Simple Act of Vengeance, and a couple others, but they sadly didn't hook and immerse me, which is what I am looking for. It is extremely likely that this request thread will give me fics I have already read, but it is worth a try!

I will share some traits of what I am looking for:

​

- Immersive writing, with a cohesive and interesting story
- Fics not commonly recommended
- New fics (with at least 100k words please)
- Fics that sucked you in, and spat you out! I will love it if you can give me an emotionally impactful story!\\

Here is the 10 prior fics that I have completed and enjoyed:

'Genius Fratris' by CheckAlexa\\
'The Shadow of Angmar' by Steelbadger\\
'Departure From The Diary' by TendraeUmbra\\
'The Art of Self-Fashioning' by Lomonaaren\\
'Beside Me... Always' by RoseDragonWitch\\
'Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting' by TendraeUmbra\\
'Renegade Cause' by Silens Cursor\\
'Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time' by joe6991\\
'The Sacrifices Arc' by Lightning on The Wave\\
'Blood Crest' by Cauchy

If you find you look at these fics, and enjoy them as well, how about you recommend me what else you enjoy, eh? Or fics you think are similar to these 10? I really hope you can help me out in finding something new to read!!


** I personally recommend:

linkffn(Consuming Shadows), linkffn(A Brother to Basilisk), linkffn(The Mind Arts), linkffn(grandloves), linkffn(Equinox (The Master of Death)), linkffn(Delenda Est)

these should encourage you to come back to the fandom :)

  On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son and flee to France. She trained him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard. But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, Harry is forced to return to his once-home, and he finds himself engaged in a game he might not want to play.

** It is recced often but that's because it just is really really good. linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down). It broke me. Such a brilliantly well crafted story. The characters are so individual, they all serve a purpose. The story is new and interesting and I was completely terrified by the end. I laughed, I broke down in tears, I still smile whenever I think is some of the scenes. So so worth the read.

Another author who's works I devoured was TheDivineComedian. linkao3(Blackpool) is chilling I love it. All their stories are like reading a jigsaw puzzle, there's little hints and easter eggs in each so you don't get the full picture till you've read them all. It was a wonderful experience even if the stories are gloriously dark and thought provoking.

**** Summary: Harry ends up back in 1978, but instead of finding his parents, he carves out a new place for himself, joining the war for his own motivations. Cue a fic with family, adventure, pirates, vigilante groups, squib politics, dementor lore, many vicious spells and so so much more!

Genre: Big ol adventure story! Lots of action, some family, lots of humour. Not many dark moments though it does get really tense at times! Minimal romance though there is a slash pairing, its barely relevent so if your looking for something smutty this isn't it. The pairing is there to build and develop character and even my cold heart was rooting for it by the end!

Ship: Harry/Gideon (unusual but works! Its developed very well.) That is the only pairing in the story. And even that isnt a thing till chapter 30 or something ridiculous.

What I loved: The story is very well planned and written. Theres 3 distinct arcs that all help Harry grow into his own person. Harry is very in character the entire time. He's stubborn and brave and goofy in equal amounts. Just a quintessential Gryffindor idiot and I adore him, one of the best Harry representations ive ever read. Its very well paced. All the OC characters are so unique you cant help but completely fall in love with them. The story goes places I wasn't expecting and it was really good to read a 1st war story without dealing with the Marauders the entire time. Its different from the books while still getting little hints which i thought was so clever.

This story suprised me in how much i loved it. I wasn't expecting to fall in love with it as much as I did and I just think everyone should give it a go =)

***** Great, thanks!

To be honest, it doesn't look like my kind of thing (I'm not usually a fan of fics set in a different era, or slash), but if I'm at a loose end without anything to read I might give it a go.

****** It's /very/ good. I'm usually nor a huge fan of romance of any kind, but this fic was amazing. The slash takes a serious backseat to the world and the characters, and what's there just naturally fits in with the rest of the setting. The author also very kindly gave big warnings for slash stuff so you can just skip it if you want.

Linkao3(A Year Like None Other)

Linkao3(The Arithmancer)

Nightmare of Futures Past (not finished, but great) [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry_potter_and_the_nightmares_of_futures_past/index/]]

Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part I)

Linkao3(Leo Inter Serpentes: First Year)

And one of my own, if you're interested, it's a female Slytherin Harry story:

Linkao3(Swiftly Falling Snow)

I hope something on this list suits your tastes!

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

  “Just... tell me.

Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  “You're such a freak!” The rotund boy's words echo across the garden of the house they seem to potentially live at---or at least one of them does---and reach Crowley's ears easily enough. They instantly make him narrow his eyes behind his sunglasses. “No wonder your parents died! Probably to get away from you!” What. The. Fuck.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

  Thirty-Four year old Harry Potter travels back in time, adopting the name of Blake Slytherin - he interferes with his own trial and messes with Dumbledore's perfectly laid plans. What happens afterwards? will Blake have bitten off more than he can chew? Will it be left to Harry to do what needs to be done?

Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
