:END:
I've recently finished the above titled book, and as I was reading it, I kept thinking: I've read this story before but it was Harry Potter fanfiction.

The story is about a Harry like protagonist condemned to a Groundhog Day scenario until he solves a murder. The twist is that each day he is a new character. Otherwise it's all set in a big old castle / manor house with the same cast of characters - but the protagonist wakes up each morning as a new character.

Has anyone read something like this? I thought it made a lame book IMHO because each character was underdeveloped. As fanfiction though it would be a cracker, as the HP universe characters are already developed.

Thanks in advance.
