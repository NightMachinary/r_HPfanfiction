Basically anything where Harry's out of Hogwarts and he ends up kicking ass for one reason or another, surprise me.


** How old did you have in mind? This fic has the trio in their 60's, along with their children and grandchildren. The trio are very bad-ass, especially Ron. Mystery/action story:

*** This looks like a fun read, can't wait to get into it!

Anytime out of hogwarts, though I'd prefer something like mid-30s or so

** This gets rec'ed all the time but linkffn(The Sum of Our Parts) fits your description of an older, badass trio.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** linkffn(made of common clay by lomonaaeren)

Magicals don't change, in fact, they get even more absurdly racist and weird. And Harry, Ron and Hermione get tired of it. It's a fun story, but don't take it seriously.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.

*** Seconding this rec!

Quite a few of lomonaaeren's fic probably fit this LF; although they have a number of AUs from the start of Hogwarts too. Generally all well written!

** This fic is by our very own [[/u/Zeitgeist84][u/Zeitgeist84]] linkffn(Midnight Blues by Zeitgeist84), and fulfills the badass trio perfectly. Not sure what happened to the author though

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.
