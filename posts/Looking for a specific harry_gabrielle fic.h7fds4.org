Like the title say. It has the delacours come to harry the summer after 5th year due to the debt gabby owes she has to marry him. Theres a lot of stuff in the story about cultural stuff that I cant remember heavy goblin involvement I think but the biggest thing I remember other than a lot of semi archaic language is that ron gained memories and personality traits from the brains that attacked him at the DoM including stuff from the founders.


** Sounds like the Emerald Coven to me. I'd link to it but Gabby is underage if I remember correctly. I think it's on Wattpad and Ao3.

**** The one I remember, by Hallow Seeker, starts off as Harry/Gabby and as of the last update they only have sex with each other. They are only currently thinking of adding more so that a ritual can destroy the Horcrux inside Harry.
