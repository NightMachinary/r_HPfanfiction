I made a document for Hogwarts School for the Gifted, an alternate Hogwarts that isn't a boarding school. Was looking to both share and collaborate, whilst also inviting anyone to use what they want from the idea.

Any critique and comments are greatly appreciated.

** I love this! It sounds like a way more modern school, and I love the fact that it would let wizards mix themselves with muggles all year instead of just in the holidays.

*** Thank you, my thought process is that the AU it exists in is about better merging with the Muggle world so they can hide in plain sight (as the canon ways looked suspicious to the muggles)

**** Yeah, I'm pretty sure that after the war wizards would be a bit more fond of muggles. I would love to see a one-shot of some muggle parents who finally see their kid do actual magic after they've gotten their license. And the house elves being the kids nannies just makes total sense

***** That nanny bit was someone elses idea in the original thread and I thought it was genius too

** I like this! I would be willing to collaborate on a timeline for Harry's adventures if anyone else is interested

One concern is that with the commute being daily, it increases suspicion about 9 3/4 a million times over. There would definitely have to be a plethora of charms diverting attention away from it.

I like the idea of multiple entrances to the platform, though. Assumedly each station would have a different (fractional) number to again avoid suspicion and also make sure everyone goes the right way home. I'm imagining a whole row of archways with numbered signs, and glancing in each one shows a clearly different place. Fun visuals!

I think many families would have a tradition of taking the train the first day of the year, as a fun way to meet up with all your friends, and then resuming normal transportation the next day.

*** Definitely the tradition of getting to Hogwarts by train on the 1st, and I really like the imagery with the stations (and I didn't even think about the numbering, so thank you).

I'm currently working on a fic in this universe, but I'd be happy to collab with you if you're doing you're own?

Haopy cake day btw
