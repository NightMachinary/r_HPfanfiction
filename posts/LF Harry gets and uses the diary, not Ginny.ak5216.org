I've read a little of the one where he gets the diary before Hogwarts. (can't remember the name of that fic for the life of me)

I'm looking for any fics that have him somehow get and use the diary in second year. Have the students be /somewhat/ justified in the whole Heir of Slytherin rumor, at least.

Bonus points for Harry having an air-tight alibi for each attack.

This one does, but Harry isn't the main character, and he was already sorted in Slytherin.
