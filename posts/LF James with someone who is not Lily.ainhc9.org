It can be James/Alice, James/Hermione, James/Sirius, James/OC, I don't care! I just don't like Lily (and Ginny btw) and I love James, so...

I can't find anything interesting and LONG. everything with James/NotLily is really short, like 1k+... and I wanted something 100k+. Please, help!


** The James/Hermione I know of is Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11494764/1/Storm-of-Yesterday]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8850352/chapters/20295151]]) I haven't read it so I don't know if its good but here it is.

*** It's a great story! Really well written, the time travel premise is interesting (not the usual arrive in 197x and become a student storyline) and it's got one of my fav conclusions in fanfiction.

  The Prince's Tale chapter from DH, retold with a twist: "Look at me," Snape begged, trying with all his strength to block out the sight of those awful green eyes, to focus only on the boy's messy black hair and the glasses slipping down his nose. In the haze of blood loss, he could almost ignore the scar that marred this boy's forehead, and the searing eyes that would always remind Snape that he was looking at the wrong face, the wrong boy.9,000 words. NC-17. AU: the DH backstory between Snape and Lily, except with Snape and James. :) December 2007.
