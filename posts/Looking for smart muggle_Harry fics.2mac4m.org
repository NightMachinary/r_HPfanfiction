I'm looking for good stories that involve muggles somehow growing a brain and wising up to the fact that their are, in fact, a bunch of wizards running around. I'm not really looking for a story where muggles declare war on the wizarding world and Harry has to fight them, more a story where the muggles and wizards ultimately work together to build a better world. Bonus points if Child Protective Services get their act together and get Harry into a kind and loving home that leads to him having a good reason for wanting to help muggles and vice versa.


** I'd love to see a fic where Muggle Child Services take Harry away from the Dursleys, placing him in a loving and caring home.

And then a month later he's dead. An ex-Death Eater realised that they could get to him now and took the 5 minutes out of their day it would take to off him.

*** This is a great idea that I would love to see fleshed out. I have a few questions though

1.  Do any parts of the magical world cross over to the muggle side enough for the Ministry to find out about the Child Services involvement?

2.  How is Dumbledore kept from finding out about it?

3.  What methods exist to track Harry that couldn't have been used to track Sirius, Pettigrew, or anyone else for that matter?

4.  If there exists a tracking method to find Harry, is it instantaneous (as soon as the wards fall) or does it have to be activated?

5.  Harry is regularly recognized on the street (notably by Diggle), why would the wards matter?

6.  If killing or capturing Harry was an option, couldn't it have been done literally any time he left the house?

7.  Do the Death Eaters and any other related nefarious characters regularly try to find and/or access Harry, given that it's probably several years after the fact?

8.  How many Death Eaters are actually left free versus the number imprisoned?

9.  If multiple people go after Harry, do they fight over who gets to do the deed?

10. Do any of them suspect a trap, and if so, how do they react?

11. How does the magical world react to the death of their savior?

12. Specifically, how do Dumbledore, Voldemort, Bones, Malfoy, and Fudge react?

*** Or they could have offed Harry any time he was at school or in a car or any number of places. No one seems to have known what sort of protection Harry was under save Dumbledore.

** If you're into military fiction, you might consider [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1227033/Marquis-Black][Marquis Black]]'s work, specifically his /Dark Wars/ series and his story /Emperor/. Both are "total war" scenarios where the magical and muggle lines are blurred/gone.

A "Harry loses his magic and leaves the magical world" tale worth reading is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290216/1/Khaveyrim][Khaveyrim]] by In Defilade. A HP/NCIS crossover, it's an AU of one of his previous stories (a HP/Stargate Atlantis one) though you needn't read the other first. The magical world is still there, but set in the background.

** (I'll not share any opinion on the stories themselves, just give you a list of possibly relevant ones)

- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind Hunting]], some muggle secret services are trying to “groom” wizards, and later in the story some scientists get involved also and develop some joint projects with protagonists.

  - Words: 616,225; Complete

- In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/][Firebird trilogy]], /(spoilers)/ there's a story arc about some militaries getting interested in experimenting on wizards.

  - Words: ~435,243; Complete 2/3, WiP

- +There was another (abandoned or WiP) one where+ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][In the Natural 20]], a group of cops starts suspecting about the memory charms performed on them+, but I don't remember the name ATM. I'll add it later, if I find it+. This plot arc is not fully resolved yet in the story.

*** Nat 20, the police investigation is probably my favorite part of it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With strength of steel wings]] fits with the whole "muggles wising up on wizards".

Mind you, this isn't a happy story, so if you expect warm and fuzzies, i wouldn't recommend...
