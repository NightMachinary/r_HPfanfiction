Looking for fics where Voldemort is correctly identified as really not actually that important in the grand scheme of things.

.

Objectively, Tom Riddle is a pretty pathetic dark lord. If we contrast him with Grindelwald, who for some reason wasn't so feared as to have his name rendered taboo, Voldemort is kind of shit. He tried for, what, a decade? To conquer /one country/, when the country in question has a demonstrably totally incompetent government. Realistically it seems that Tom's only opposition when trying to take over 'the Magical World' cough-onlybritain-cough was a group of vigilantes that easily held him off. Maybe he was just cartoonishly evil and we wouldn't even have heard of him otherwise. The point is, Voldemort was never really suggested to be a threat to, say, America and MCUSA, or China, or South America, or Africa, all of which have rich magical traditions and their own schools of magic and everything. Voldemort, in the end, was no worse than a civil war in a single country.

.

But what /would/ be a threat to more than just one little island nation?

.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3542099/1/How-I-Learned-To-Stop-Worrying-And-Love-Lord-V][How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love Lord V]] - Voldemort has contingencies in place which trigger when World War 3 starts with total nuclear exchange. Time is frozen, allowing him and Harry to try and figure out what to do to solve the problem. However, several other wizards, older and wiser than Tom, show up and are a bit put out with the whole 'the world has stopped' thing.

.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] - Voldemort isn't really the problem; rather, what he might do in his carelessness is. Tom opens the gates of hell without fully understanding what it would do, unleashing an army of demonspawn that successfully annihilate the entire world. Harry is stuck in a timeloop to try and stop him, which is having its own catastrophic effects on the very fabric of reality.

.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11174940/1/Significant-Digits][Significant Digits]] - a sequel to HPMOR, Harry is actively trying to merge science and magic. Things start to escalate as he comes closer and closer to doing something very bad and an ancient cabal of immensely powerful wizards are keeping a close eye on the situation, ready to step in and lay the hurt down on Harry if he actually gets close to discovering something truly dangerous.

.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/1/The-Universe-Is-An-Optimisation-Problem][The Universe is an Optimization Problem]] - Corporations have taken over the world, fueled by wizards and a magical power source which permits amazing feats of arcano-engineering. Tom realizes he has no need (and little chance) to fight for world domination, and so instead settles for making a hundred thousand horcruxes and launching them into space. Sadly short, but intensely surreal, particularly in its exploration of what unbounded magic looks like.

.

Anybody got recommendations for fics where the entire Harry Potter vs Voldemort thing is shown to be kind of a tiny spat in a larger and more dangerous world? Where older and stranger things lurk in the shadows, beyond the thin pretext of 'magic' taught in Hogwarts?


** Yes, in the extreme AU of [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], Riddle was merely a small fry. Its sequel [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]] features some really scary super villains, and I expect the yet to be published "Hermione Granger and the Swiss Tournament" to have more serious threats.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436), Voldemort is only a chess piece in the great game of chaos vs order, dogma vs free will.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** Several Crossovers use this, especially when the other work has far more powerful/dangerous adversaries.

linkffn(The Queen Who Fell to Earth) Voldemort is dealt with quickly, brutally, and humiliatingly by Sirius during Act 1, and when Dumbledore asks about Voldemort later on, Remus laughs. Umbridge was a more dangerous foe than Voldemort, and that was just in the first installment.

In linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) Harry became "the cure for the Wizards case of cranial-rectal syndrome", killing Dark Lords/Ladies when ever they showed up, culminating in taking down two Dark Lords that nearly razed the entire planet with their feud.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
