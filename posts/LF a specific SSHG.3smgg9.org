** I was confused for a moment because I know this story as "Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels" on AO3, but it's the same story. Definitely an interesting one!

*** Ooh, really? Thanks for mentioning it!! I wonder if there's any other edits they made... lol I may have to read both and see! (I usually stay away from AO3 just because a lot of the SSHG fics came from before it was made, so I always forget to look there for reuploads!)

**** No problem! I only look through AO3 every few months or so, but that's how I had found that one!
