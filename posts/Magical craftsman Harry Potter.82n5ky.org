A Harry Potter who gets into magical crafting. (Mabye have him learn from a Book written by Alastor moody "what to do when you can't trust anyone a guide to makeing everything you could ever need" it could be a book series)

Sort of a Harry who instead of buying a really good magical trunk like Alastor Moodys or newt scamander,learns to craft his own(like I think moody did because could you really see moody trusting a trunk that anyone else built for him considering his paranoia(is it really paranoia if the families of death eaters he killed or captured are out to get him))

A Harry who learns to makes his own pensive and who doesn't trust other people not to rip him off when it comes to the basilisk so he learns how to harvest and process animal himself including learning how to tanner the hide himself and turn the leather it into cloths.

a Harry who threw magic becomes his own. Blacksmith(including mining his own ore),tailor(including makeing his own fabrics),leatherworker(including hunting), enchanter,woodworking,carpenter,Jeweller,weaver,ect

Pretty much a Harry own learns to do all the professions and crafting stuff you would in a MMORPG

Who uses divination to help find the Best raw materials(from ore and gems to ingredients for cooking,potions and alchemy and wood for trunks and brooms to stone for stonemasonry, sand for Glass)

And then Uses magic to harvest and the refine them(like useing magic fire to melt the ore to make a magic metal that has a certain magic content in the sameway steel has a carbon content)

And then as he crafts the items he works the echantment into ten all threw the crafting process from raw materials to final product,instead of just enchanting the final product.


** I haven't seen that sort of thing with Harry, but I love the idea that Moody made all his own stuff.

*** Dumbeldore also seems to craft at least some of his own stuff as well. I tend to think it's that way for the best magical items they are all custome made mostly by the owner like Dumbeldores put outer/deluminator.

I like the idea that Moody creates everything he uses himself. his magical eye,trunk,invisibility cloaks and mabye even spare wands. Makeing his own alcohol,cured meat,cheese,potions,ect

**** I'll make one small correction; I like better to think the Eye was the work of Dumbledore as a gift. It seems too powerful to be the work of anybody but the best, so to speak; and it can detect the Cloak of Invisibility, which I think only a Hallow-savvy Dumbledore would know (or even think) to enchant it for. It even makes sense, because Dumbledore would have had access to the Cloak at the time.

***** True it being able to detect the Cloak of Invisibility does point to the eye being crafted by the wielder of elder wand. and Dumbeldore does seem to be one of the few people alive that moody trusted.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Well I hope self-promo-ing in a comment isn't a cardinal sin but the fic I'm currently writing, in the next chapter I'll upload, Harry gets into this somewhat by asking Goblins to teach him magic. Although in my story I can it "Spellsmithing", which I distinguish from enchanting objects that is more common among wizards.
