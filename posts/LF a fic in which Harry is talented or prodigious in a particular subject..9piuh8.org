Something similar to 'The Mind Arts' or 'The art of self-fashioning' where Harry is skilled in a certain area and uses that to his advantage.

#+begin_quote
  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  Seeing as how it's the holiday season and I am quite proud of having produced 150k+ words already, I decided to celebrate and get myself a gift: brainthief now has a account. If you like this stuff and want to support me as an author, now you have the option. Any support whatsoever will help in justifying why I'm neglecting other things in favour of writing fanfiction. If it takes off, it may even motivate me to neglect more than I do currently: I will spend more time writing. Since FFNet is jealous of other websites to the point of spurning links I feel the need to add a description: I'm called brainthief at the website. (.com/brainthief)

****** To me, saying that he's "neglecting" items gives it an overall negative tone that suggests he wants payment to write. You'll notice on most people with a patreon, they say they'll have more time to work on something instead of saying that they can neglect other items in favor of working on something else. Basically, I think the way it's worded doesn't sound very genuine. Also, giving yourself a gift as opposed to opening an option for support is a similar case.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
