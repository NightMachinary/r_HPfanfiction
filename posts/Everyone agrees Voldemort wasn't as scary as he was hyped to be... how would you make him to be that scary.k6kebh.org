My idea is that Voldemort would use a lot of mental manipulation magic, Imperius variants and such.

Also his Death Eaters would use a lot of terror tactics such as using an actual zombie plague instead of mere reanimated corpses, or bombs that only go off when there's enough people nearby and display the Mark afterwards, or weaponized Dark Marks that actually subject people to permanent control, etc.

As for spell usage, he would remain fond of using the Killing Curse as his primary spell, but he can cast it silently and he can spam the fuck out of it, things that nobody else can do.


** I'd make him infiltrate the Ministry sooner. I like the way Lupin or Sirius described the First War with Voldemort:

#+begin_quote
  "/Imagine that Voldemort's powerful/ now/. You don't know who his supporters are, you don't know who's working for him and who isn't; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You're scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing... The Ministry of Magic's in disarray, they don't know what to do, they're trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere... panic... confusion... that's how it used to be./"
#+end_quote

In canon that didn't really happen. We know most of Death Eaters by name, and we don't really hear of people betraying their friends or being under Imperius (and when they are, the good guys know about it).

Also, the fact that Arthur and Bill Weasley went to work when Voldemort had full power over the Ministry and Ginny went to Hogwarts when it was under Voldemort's control just doesn't make any sense.

So I'd go for that - the confusion who is who. Sure, there are some who are loyal to Voldemort and it's common knowledge, but I would add a bunch of new people (some close to Harry and the Order), I'd make him get more control over the Ministry day by day but in a sneaky way and not "magic is might. Let's make a registry for muggleborns and accuse them of stealing magic". His actions should have forced changes - the Weasleys should have gone into hiding much earlier, the same with Longbottoms and other families connected with the Order.

He would be a better villain if we were shown more of his charming, manipulative side. Most of the time he appears in the books after he gets back his body, he seems like a crazy guy obsessed with a teenage boy.

The same with Death Eaters. I think it would be better if they were more like Snape or Narcissa, who weren't brawny but brainy. Instead, most of his followers seem almost incompetent and remind me a lot about overgrown children fighting for daddy's attention.

***** Imagine the world where everything is the same, but Voldemort cares.

Imagine, Lucius knows exactly what the diary is and keeps it hidden, because he would give everything for his benevolent master.

Imagine Wormtail turning against the Potters not out of fear, but because he truly believes that betraying his friends is a necessary sacrifice for peace with Voldemort as the ruler of Britain. Imagine that Voldemort genuinely cares about Severus' love for Lily, and simply sends her away with a Portkey instead of killing her, and only James and Harry die that night. Imagine that Severus is still a spy after ‘he attacked Lily's family!', but he's actually on Voldemort's side, feeding the light misinformation.

Imagine Death Eaters coming home and raving to their families about how just and kind Voldemort is, how he solved their financial struggles and kept them safe, and imagine the children and their friends raised under the belief that they owe Voldemort their lives and freedom.

Imagine that half of Hogwarts' staff and student body are comprised of traitors, and they are brought up with Voldemort's beliefs. The ministry is firmly under Death Eater control, and Lucius is voted in as Minister. There is no saviour of the wizarding world, Voldemort is never reduced to a wraith, and muggles are destroyed outright.

And nobody does anything about it, because Voldemort cared.

Voldemort should be shown as a force of nature. He is a terrifying opponent and basically if he is after you then your fucked. instead of Bellatrix killing Sirius perhaps its Voldemort.

you could also explore the fact Voldemort's personality is different after his rebirth.

with Dumbledore remarking stuff like ''you where never one to play with your food tom, and yet you decided to torture harry before killing him'.

you could also have Voldemort show moments where he is the insanely charming person he used to be and give a fear that he will be back to full power eventually as he recovers from his rebirth

** 1) Eliminate idiot plots. No goddamn million moving parts script so kids can beat him. No stupid "torture my own followers" bullshit. He's absolutely fantastic to those who choose to follow him. After all, willing followers produce good results. A simple loyalty oath not to betray him or his goals is all you need to be on his good side, where he makes sure that you're in the best spot possible. He's a benevolent dictator ramped to eleven. The fight against him is based in people not wanting an immortal dictator, not in wanton massacres.

2) He's an unparalleled master of mind magic. He uses it. His forces avoid killing where possible. After all, corpses can't appreciate what he's doing for their benefit. People just... vanish. Then they come back a few days later, perfectly fine and healthy sleeper agents.

3) The Taboo is an absurd idea for a benevolent dictator. Also for a normal dictator, who creates a name then bans people from using it? (Side note: FUCKING EXPLAIN TO CHILDREN THAT A TABOO EXISTS. HARRY POTTER USING THE NAME LOOKS LIKE A TWAT BECAUSE THAT USED TO MEAN DEATH FOR EVERYONE! Anyways.) Instead, minor alterations to the magic make joking about his name and title feel like someone's walking on your grave. An incentive to treat your future king with respect, if you will. (There's an idea. That part of the magic still exists, and Harry doesn't know because the horcrux makes him immune. People are curious how he stomachs the instinctive fear response every time.)

4) No Dark Mark. He's running a guerilla war by clearly and permanently labeling his soldiers. The only reason he had loyal supporters left is because the ministry is even more of an incompitence clown fiesta than he is. Fascist regimes don't name their troops "Death Eaters" and run around with skull logos.

5) A dedicated propaganda campaign. Again, he's not Evil McEvilFace.

In short, Tom is a political figure where nobody can tell if the people around him are loyal supporters, controlled slaves, sleeper agents, or not his. The Order keeps running into prisoners booby-trapped with mind magic bombs to fry the brains of whoever's making sure they're clean.

** I would make Voldemort saner. He came back and he seems more “human” than ever. However he also learnt from his mistakes. His time spend wandering as a soulless horcrux didn't make him crazy and reckless. It instead made him ruthless. He infiltrated the ministry. He keeps his initial attack on the magicals on the down low. So just like in book 5 there's a false sense of security in magical Britain. However he has given his death eaters free range on attacking muggles. He only had one rule. Don't get caught.

I would also make him and the death eaters more scary by eg. Torturing humans and muggle horns and half bloods just for amusement. Not because he was mad or crazy. And then send out the tortured souls out back to their families. Their memory wiped and the victims having no clue what happened except the scars and the trauma that their body remembers.

I would make him be more attentive of the horcrux links between him and Harry. So at some point use it to make clear to Harry. That Harry can't win. Voldemort is in his mind. He is always present. Make Voldemort try to possess him multiple times. Harry slowly loses it and loses hope. Because how can you win from someone if he is always there. Steps ahead of you because he can read his mind. (This also gives more incentive for him to learn occlumency. I do want snape to try and really reach him occlumency. And later on get punished and tortured to hell by Voldemort. Wipes him mind. Send him to Harry thinking Harry is his son - obviously not. But it will mess snape up to think he had a child with dead lily. And then he gets told everything is a lie. Or breaking his mind to recover his memories is going to be messed up. Because childhood trauma)

Or other things. Such as make Voldemort do dark rituals. Forbidden rituals. Sacrifices here and there. Make him be able to drain ppls life force so he gets stronger. Temporarily. But everything has his price. After the surge he grows weaker. It takes a toll on his body. He needs to do more and more rituals and more sacrifices. The fun amusing muggle killings become a necessity.

Make all the shit he initially did for fun (psychotic fun) make him dependent on it. Eg. Just like an addiction. So whatever he does he has no choice but to do it on a bigger scale. Instead of taking over cuz of power trips. Take over cuz he needs the life force or whatever.

The initial magical ppl who thought they were safe are realizing shit. We gon die. Also death eaters are going to slowly turn sides. (And be deathly punished when caught). Because Voldemort now kills everything just to stay alive. But the good ppl never know who is good. Who is desperately. Who is just imperiod. So you can trust nobody. Or they can't trust their own minds.

People are trying to safeguard this. They have secret pass words. They have secrets Q n As. They write down their thoughts. And keeps checking these written thoughts. They check each other for memory loss, gaps. Everyone has a rememberball. Everyone tried to learn the patronus. And use it as a last pass for happy memories. If they cannot do a patronus changes are they are effed. Paranoia at best. Also when it is really high stress and urgency. Ppl keep ppl at distance until x hours after they've seen someone drink (hello poly juice). Also every time you come into a new place you check for animagi. Nothing is easy anymore.

Magic that was once fun ... it is not anymore. Only a tool to fight abuse and self protect.

** There are two ways to make him seem scary. One option is competence - making him smarter, more magically powerful (in a way that's impressive and visible), etc. For that option, if the Ministry and the Order are also made to be more competent, it'd be ideal. This version of Voldemort would be much more able to take control of the Ministry and its resources through his own competence, rather than their incompetence. He'd be able to outsmart the good ideas the heros might have against him, and when he shows up in person, he's easily able to sway magical combat in an impressive way.

An alternative path is to have him be more brutal - treat him more like a horror story villain, more willing to do dark magic in a way that shows why it's called /dark/ in the first place. This is the path that canon generally went, in my opinion - but with poor execution. So just do that, but with /good/ execution ;) . But that's tough to execute without falling into 'edgy' territory, of course.

My preference is the former - the same way that I also prefer smarter rest of the world. It also has more flexibility, in terms of /what/ Voldemort can be up to in the story. He can be competent through charisma, through magical strength, through researching and inventing new spells/magics, etc - and focusing on different aspects of that can come up with various interesting opportunities.

Another way to think about it is to show what canon just tells. Canon tells us that he's brilliant, charismatic, incredibly powerful. But what it shows us is a half-mad character with no real charisma, only ruling through scaring the sane ones in his inner circle and letting the insane ones run amok. It shows us someone with terrible, dumb plans, that succeed only through luck and incompetence of those opposed to him. It shows us some unique magical aspects (eg, Horcrux), but in ways that aren't honestly that impressive (ie, what's the most impressive magical feat we see Voldemort accomplish in canon?).

Also, the method for defeating him should be interesting as well - and, imo ideally, utilize multiple people. That is to say, if he gets defeated by something deus ex machina-y, through something that seems easy, or through rapid training that seemingly anyone can do, he's going to retroactively not seem like a threat. This is another easy pitfall to fall into - especially with super-Harry stories.

*** the most impressive magic he did in canon was probably when he traded blows with Albus right?

But i feel like for Riddle to be more dangerous, he needs to be far more competent, but for that to happen you will also need pepole that oppose him that show competence aswell, what we get in the first books shows why that isnt possible eg mirror in first year, chamber in 2nd with the Basilisk or 3rd with Sirius and Peter. Had the adults been a bit more competent, had Remus not been a complete and utter coward, most of the books wouldnt be what they are.

I would also have Harry and Ron show more promise, eg Harry being capable of doing some high end magic, but he will need decades to catch up with the giants that are Albus and Riddle, Ron would get into the strategical side of the war, show him plotting the plans with Harry being the wand, Hermione being the knowledge and Ron applying all the factors.

Have the golden trio be more independent, but when they work together they punch out of their weight class.

**** The most impressive display of magic is likely the fight with Dumbledore, like you say - although perhaps it could be argued his instinctive use of magic (before knowing that it was real) could be said to be the case, or horcruxes. But in terms of what the reader sees, the battle with Dumbledore takes center stage... it's just not amazingly impressive, at least for me.

Having him be far more competent is the approach I'd take, for sure - just like I'd give him more competent adversaries, as I mentioned. On my end, I'd prefer to have an older Harry (& Co) be the ones to look at things - so less 1st or 2nd year, more 4-7th+. But I know others disagree with that!

In terms of the 'Golden Trio' working together, it's an approach I quite like - the three main characters all having their own strengths and weaknesses, all combining to be able to plan out - and execute - a smart setup to defeat a stronger foe? Wonderful. Unfortunately I've found very few stories that execute that well - I tend to only stumble across some that do Harry + one of Hermione or Ron, instead of both :|

More attempts on Harry's life ala Book 1 Quidditch Match, more offscreen encounters, more plots going on in the background, numerous schemes being discovered and foiled...all building up to The One That Worked.\\
Don't just rely on one possessed girl in Chamber of Secrets, use blackmailed students, use Imperius, use a bunch of other magical creatures to blur the evidence. Don't just set up a convoluted plot to turn the Triwizard Cup into a portkey, start with using the Goblet of Fire to trap Harry in a magically binding contract then launch scheme after scheme to kidnap him while he's pinned down.\\

** I think the scariest take on Voldemort is one I read a while back where it's clear that he's just a mask.

He's a shell identity the ruthless and cold but academically brilliant half-blood Tom Riddle uses to manipulate the crazier purebloods to do his bidding in the name of 'blood purity'. His true opinion of the magical world is one of utter contempt.

He doesn't actually /care/ about any of the things his followers think are important to him. He just wants them to keep magical society in Britain off balance so no one, especially not Dumbledore or the Unspeakables, looks closely enough to realize what he's really up to.

When it comes to Harry Potter? Just make him an offer at the end of the Triwizard instead of killing Cedric. He and his friends can leave Britain, perhaps even with a substantial sum of money to set themselves up somewhere less bigoted. God knows he doesn't have any real roots there. Riddle won't follow him, or bear a grudge, after all they already traded a life for a life. He can just walk away, and Tom will kill all of the Death Eaters who were dumb enough to take his mark, even send Pettigrew's corpse back, or one transfigured into Voldemort's form in exchange for the two of them going their separate ways.

**** or show Hermiones flaws that we saw earler, that she constantly cracks under pressure, eg book 3 when she failed her DADA exam.

Show us some scenes from the POV of Aurors, or order members that go against Tom himself and he litterally walks through them like they arent even there, have him slaugher them to make a point that resistance is moot.

** I'd make him charismatic, handsome and not a rabid dog madman. Ditch the horcrux's, his soul transfers to his clone bodies if he dies. I'd make the war bigger, pull in other countries. More zombies.

** Have him infiltrate the government and turn it into a monarchy, have him reveal magic to the entire juggle world and proceed to publicly torture and kill anyone who stands in his way. Don't give him close followers, all his followers should only have loyalty out of fear, which not only brings more depth and humanity to his followers but bring more character motivations. Have Voldemort be genuinely insane on all levels, no crime uncommitted, no stone unturned. He must be significantly more powerful than any witch or wizard in existence, the fact that harry overpowered him in the final moments in canon while reasonable because all horcruxes were destroyed shouldn't have happened. The only way you should be able to kill voldemort is by a numbers advantage in the thousands, his followers should be around the power they are in Canon only to emphasize how much more powerful he is than you. Overall just make him smarter and stronger then he would become the total psychopathic overlord we all want him to be.

** You know what's creepier than Voldemort? The Fair Folk. Maybe Tom Riddle is just their mind-controlled pawn, and beating him makes them /annoyed/.
