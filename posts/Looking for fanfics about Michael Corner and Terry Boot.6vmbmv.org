I've really been enjoying reading about their friendship and their ties to others in ravenclaw. I want more! I don't care if it's slash (Terry is typically written as gay in the fics I've come across while Michael is straight), but I prefer completed stories that are PG-13 or R.


** A Neville centric fic that writes the two of them well is 'Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness'
