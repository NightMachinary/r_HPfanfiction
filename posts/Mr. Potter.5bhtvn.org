  No student is going to go calling other students "Mister" or "Missus", okay?
#+end_quote

Miss, not "Missus", and it depends on the culture. There are places where this sort of thing is common, and places where it never happens.

And yes, there are schools where instructors typically refer to students by their surname. Simply because you didn't experience that doesn't mean all places are the same. A boarding school in Scotland will not have the same cultural peculiarities as a public school in Texas, say.

*** I mean, I went to public school in Texas and I still recognized that it might have been a thing in other schools to refer to them by last name. I'm not sure what this guy's issue is.

** Actually, it's fairly typical of teachers to refer to students by their surnames (/with/ and without titles) in the UK. In fact, I'd be more than a little unnerved if a P.E teacher called me by my given name...

** In canon, all the teachers refer to students as 'Mr/Miss Lastname', and the students refer to each other by first name if they're on good speaking terms, last name without honorific if they're not.

** In my school years it was a matter of age. Younger than 14 you were called by your first or last name in the familiar address (language thing), older than that, the teacher had to address you formally (the equivalent of Mister or Miss). You could waive that, some teachers expected it, some accepted it, some offered you the familiar address in return and some would never waver from formality.

** It's more of a British thing. But there is an issue that is kind of related to this, specifically stories where teachers address Harry as "Harry" or Dumbledore as "My boy" and then Harry goes absolutely apeshit on them for doing so. I imagine most people wouldn't care about the first, and most people wouldn't even bring up the second unless it was a masculinity thing and they felt that "boy" was insulting.

On the same train of thought stories where everyone is like "Call me [firstname], Mr. [Lastname] makes me feel like an old man/ is my father." are really annoying, I mean I've seen that exact line probably a hundred times. Usually with Sirius.

*** I've never had a problem with the dumbledore one, mainly because boy should carry some negative emotions for harry.

As for the second, I think it fits sirius to us that kind of cheesy line, others maybe not so much.

*** "boy" is kind of insulting though. Again, from my cultural perspective, but "boy" (or in my case "Junge" or "Bursch'") wasn't okay since I was around 12/13. I'm right there with such a Harry that Dumbledore has no business calling him "boy" or even worse "my boy" - as if he was his actual grandfather. The later in canon Harry demands that small bit of respect the more I agree with it.

I wouldn't like it if I were the only one that the teachers were familiar with. It would set me apart from the other students--more than I would already be (as Harry Potter).

I don't agree with "going apeshit" on someone, but I wouldn't have put up with it when I was in school.

*** Late to the party as usual, but this really is both a cultural and personal preference sort of thing. It's also highly situational.

It was always Mr./Ms. Surname when I was in elementary school. When I got into high school both teachers and students asked to be called by their first/given names so that's what we did. By the time I left high school most of us had a close/personal rapport with the teachers so it was natural for us to go by given names.

College is different in that unless you have a decent rapport with a professor, you just address them as Professor. Admittedly I do have a good rapport with some professors and we freely call each other by our given names.

It's all very situational in nature. Back to the point though, were I Harry and a professor or what not had addressed me by my given name without permission, or by a moniker such as "my boy" I would've gone off on them because it's disrespectful and unprofessional of them to do so.

For me I generally dislike the "call me firstname, mr. lastname makes me feel old" thing UNLESS it's Sirius saying it. Because cheesy/bad puns like that are part of who Sirius is and it feels very much "in character" for him to say something like that.
