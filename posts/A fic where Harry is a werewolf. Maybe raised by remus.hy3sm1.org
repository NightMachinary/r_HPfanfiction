** The Beast Within: linkffn(9527368)

Voldemort took Fenrir Greyback with him when he attacked the Potters. Greyback did what Greyback does - as a result, the best option for raising Harry is Remus Lupin, who homeschools him until he's 13. One of the few I could find that have Harry as a normal werewolf.

Weres Harry: linkffn(8106168)

Harry gets bitten as a kid, and the werewolf curse interacts with the Horcrux - the Horcrux is destroyed in the process, and the end result is more of a magical-creature-Animagus than a werewolf.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
