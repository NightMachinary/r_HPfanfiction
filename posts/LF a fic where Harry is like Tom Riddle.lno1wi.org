Hi, I'm looking for fics where Harry is a lot more like Tom, but where he still sees Voldemort as his enemy. Hit me with your best!

#+begin_quote
  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence. (DISCONTINUED)
