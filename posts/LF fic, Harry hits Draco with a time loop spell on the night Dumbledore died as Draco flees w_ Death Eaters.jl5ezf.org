:END:
After Dumbledore dies, Harry sees Snape turning to flee with Draco in tow, and Harry remembers how Draco's wand was lowering. There was another spell in the HBP's book that was meant to change someone's heart, and Harry remembered it off the top of his head and cast it at Draco without knowing what it did.

After that Draco wakes up and basically is stuck in a 24-hour time loop of the day he let the Death Eaters into the school. At some point he befriends Luna and gives her his memories each day, because obviously she forgets being his friend each day. Eventually he befriends Ginny as well, and if it helps at all, I remember a specific scene of Ginny, Luna, and Draco getting drunk in Hogsmeade together.

Anyways, Ginny and Luna help him figure out how to end the time loop, and it turns out the only way to escape it is to show his heart changed. He tried several things but in the end he has to destroy a Horcrux so they destroy the diadem w/ Fiendfyre. I read this fic a few months ago and I've been trying to find it for a couple days now, but for the life of me I cannot remember the name. Thanks!


** Hi I literally just read this (you might need to be logged in) It's a little fast in terms of romance but it's cute it's drarry be warned but it doesn't happen till close to the end so meh.

The ending is a bit lackluster but still pretty enjoyable
