Exactly as the title says, please at least 100k words preferably completed. When I say badass I mean it as well, no protagonist who needs someone else to do there thinking for them or one who survives by luck more than skill.

Thanks in advance.


** Question: What do you mean by asexual?

Does this just mean the story must have no pairing or romance in it, or Harry must be actively asexual and explicitly not sexually attracted to others?

*** The second, I don't mind pairing as long as it's not the main character. What I don't want is to get into a story and then have them having a complete personality change to pander to suddenly the most perfect beautiful person in the world.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.
