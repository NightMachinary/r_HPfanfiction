No matter how well-written it is, can there be such a thing as a fic that is too AU?

As long as the fanfic justifies it with fleshed-out explanations, does it really matter? Plus, don't some people complain about canon rehashes.

Personally, as long as it is well-written and the premise intrigues me, then the more AU the better.


** There is such a thing as too AU. If you throw out the canon magic system, characters, setting, and plot, you've basically got original fiction and not a fanfic. Mind, that doesn't mean your story is bad (it could be fantastic) but it wouldn't really be a Harry Potter fanfic.

However, at least a level of AUness is necessary for a fanfic to be worth reading. It's a fine line to walk.

*** I'd say it also depends a bit on why you read fanfiction. Are you in it for the characters? Well, then the setting is probably less important. Or do you really love the worldbuilding (might not be the biggest thing in HP fanfics, but take ASOIAF or LotR instead)? Well, then having an OOC cast might be OK.

Me personally? I'm not all that attached to specific characters, but I really like the... I suppose atmosphere might be a good description? Of magical adventures where the underdog triumphs. Of myths and legends coming to life and, you know, /Magic/.

**** I agree. For me, there is really not such a thing as too AU as long as the story, characters and world building are solid.

Take Miranda Flairgold's A Second Chance at life linkffn(2488754) and the sequel. It's so AU that it is pretty much a departure from the entirety of Harry Potter. Nearly all the main characters become rather insignificant and indeed, even the plot involving Voldemort is merely a secondary threat compared to the main antagonists. But it's such a well done story with great OC's and world building (not to mention, a much more compelling sense of magic than the original HP) that I have read through it multiple times. It's one of my all time favorites.

It's also why I'm such a fan of crossovers, particularly the ones that dump a powerful, confident and intelligent Harry into another world.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

**** It's “romance”. If you've ever tried to read any standard-issue entry to that particular genre, you will know that this particular genre manages to hug Sturgeon's law even with published stories. You kind of have to wonder if there's any actual publishing process involved or if it's all manned by squirrels and sasquatches and everything gets printed.

That said, let's get serious for a moment: “Fifty Shades of Grey” a “dirty fantasy” thing. Many entries to the “romance” (smut, let's be honest) genre are about some kind of fantasy or kink or whatever preference and as such those things tend to be judged a bit ... differently when it comes to actually checking if they are publishing-worthy (meaning, if it's /technically/ good writing and it has no illegal content chances are it will get published even if it squicks most people). This kind of stuff is the porn of book eaters, really.

** Yep - I'll give the example of the firebird trilogy by darth marrs. IMO, it became so goddamn AU that I actually couldn't finish it. The magic system was very very different, the dynamics of the characters were also far too different (worst offender being voldemort and that whole coven b.s.). I finished the 1st two stories before I couldn't continue, and it had well and truly reached the point of "Tons of OC but with HP names and concepts stuck to them".

Another example where I think it approaches borderline but still ok AU is the sacrifices arc - but there the magic system is presented as a sort of extension of HP magic, eg. a fully fleshed out Light and Dark magic, and while Harry could be argued to be pretty OOC, there's at least good justification for it IMO. Also, the author used OCs and give them names and stories etc. so it didn't feel like the fic suffered from "Daphne Syndrome".

Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Luna, Ron, Seamus, Dean are all very recognizable as their Canon version. Ginny's background story is kind sad, as later revealed, but it adds more emotion to the story.

** You can replace portions of the entire story, the setting, characters, lore, magical system, and make an AU but for each person there is going to be a different point at which they say "this isnt even hp anymore" or "this just isnt my cup of tea".

Iv read fics where Harry was raised completely differently leading to a very different adventurous/action hero type character, with a quantified magic system, and multiple settings, but i didnt walk away and it felt to me like harry potter.

Iv tried reading wrong boy who lived, redeemed or good bad guy, non magical, marauder era, founder era, harry's kids, and a few other AU's and just completely walked away from them because they weren't what i was looking for.

** There's definitetly a point where it's no longer HP Fanfiction and is instead an original story in it's own right. It can still be enjoyable but so completely not HP that it really doesn't classify as such.

I personally don't enjoy reading stories where character personalities are drastically different (excluding humour/comedy), but don't mind stories that are set in a different universe with different/or no magic, if the characters are recognisable. Oddly there are some 'extreme' AU stories that I feel capture the essence of the text more than supposedly 'canon compliant' stories.
