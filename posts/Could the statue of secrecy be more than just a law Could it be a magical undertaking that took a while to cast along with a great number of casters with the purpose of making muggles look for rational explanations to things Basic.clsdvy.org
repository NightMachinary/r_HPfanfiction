#+TITLE: Could the statue of secrecy be more than just a law? Could it be a magical undertaking that took a while to cast along with a great number of casters with the purpose of making muggles look for *rational* explanations to things? Basically making them disprove magic if they don’t see it themselves.

** While I do not think we can prove it it any way, it is a plausible theory.

We already know that the fidelius can, sort of, influence people remotely (people who knew of a location magically forget where it is) so it wouldn't be a terrible stretch to posit that some sort of magic is woven into the statute.

The concept is basically what's in the Percy Jackson universe: magical fog that makes 'muggles' see ordinary stuff instead of monsters, magic and such.

********** Thanks for playing along. Mind, I enjoyed this thread. I have a variety of things that are headcanon that I love to share, especially with Rowling's references to mythology.

It's the reason why I think everyone should read Partially Kissed hero. It definitely gets racist, but it references so much mythology and has great explanations.

**** Witches, wizards, magic etc are all over history, even up to the time of the Statute passing. Isaac Newton practised alchemy and although he was born before the Statute he died after it. I think it's probably better to conclude the history isn't missing, but that Muggles just got most of it in relation to magic wrong (probably mostly due to wizards passing the Statute and being actively obstructive tbf) - Mr Weasley I think mentions something about lots of dinosaur bones actually being Transfigured dragons.

So... you mean the Statute and accompanying massive spell-casting endeavour to cast a massive spell with the purpose of making muggles look for rational explanations to things?
