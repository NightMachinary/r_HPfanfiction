So basically im looking for a good ff were Harry is Metamorphmagus, with a good plot idc about if he's Dark,Grey or Light (ps if he's evil at least have a good reason) for pairings my favorites are Tonks (cause i loved Harry and the metamorph, story) Hermione Daphne Fleur Luna or Harem with one of those 5 Tbh i don't care if there are crossovers No slash Harry/Man (idc if there's yuri between Harry's harem)


** There are only a few out there where his Metamorph-ness is actually a thing and not just a "He's pretty now!" handwave, but my favourite of those few is a oneshot in this list called 'The Chamaeleon'. Which is technically spelled like the constellation instead of the lizard, but it's referring to the lizard in this case.
