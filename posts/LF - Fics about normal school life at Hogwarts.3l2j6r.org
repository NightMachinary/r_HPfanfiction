I'm looking for stories (in progress or complete) that are entirely or mainly about normal life at Hogwarts without the threat of Riddle or the proverbial Monster of the Week.

I know there probably aren't many, but any fics you can find will be appreciated.


** I think linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) does what you're looking for the best. While Voldemort returns as per canon, Ginny's school life is unaffected for most part. It was one of the things that impressed me most about the story, showing the life of a normal student disconnected from the Dark Lord situation for most part.

#+begin_quote
  "Well," Hermione says waspishly, "we all know Umbridge's class is useless."

  "True," Ginny is forced to admit. But she's not sure taking on more work in their free time is really the answer. It's just like Hermione to start an academic club in the face of an incompetent teacher. She must be worried about her OWLs.

  Hermione leans in closer to Ginny, expression hardening. "You know why this is important."

  Ginny's lips press together, knowing exactly what Hermione is trying to refer to. The only problem is that Ginny isn't sure she does know why this is important. All she knows is what Hermione shared that one night, vague inferences about secret weapons and Order members taking shifts guarding Harry. A Dark Lord supposedly returned from the dead but completely absent.

  Things at Hogwarts are ever as they have been and shouldn't that /mean/ something?

  "I'll see you then?" Hermione asks, her attention already distracted by trying to unobtrusively wave down a fifth year Hufflepuff girl.

  She doesn't linger to hear Ginny's agreement. Ginny watches her go, gnawing on her lip a moment before shaking herself out of it. She doesn't have time to work out Hermione's quirks right now.

  There are more important problems afoot, like being late to Quidditch.
#+end_quote

I believe the last sentence perfectly fits into what you're looking for.

There is also quite a bit of emphasis on Quidditch, as you would imagine there would be. There is a bit of school-yard politics, but it remains typically school stuff, nothing that comes close to determining the fate of the Wizarding World like many Slytherin Harry fanfics. The parlor subplot is excellent too. I'm not going to spoil it, but it fits very well into what you're looking for.

*** I love that fic! My favourite extract is just after Ginny has just gone up against Harry's Gryffindor Quidditch team as captain of Slytherin,

#+begin_quote
  Fred and George appear at her side, watching the mass of students surge up to the castle.

  "Now that was an exciting match," Fred says. It takes a moment for Ginny to realize that while Fred is decked from head to toe in gold and red, George is wearing all silver and green, including his hair. She must be staring agape at them because Fred says, "Wouldn't do to show favorites." George nods. "Besides, green looks good on me."

  Ginny blinks back against what she refuses to acknowledge are tears.

  Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?

**** Cool :) If you like anything in particular, I can try to rec more of the same.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=104605][ac_rules]] writes a lot in various genres and eras, most of them complete. My fav of hers are [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=307662][Muggle Studies]] a humor fic about the next gen Muggle Studies professor/class and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309592][All the Abstract Nouns]], a Molly II coming of age.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=168043][Celestie]] writes wonderful characters. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] is an ensemble look at the next gen Potter-Weasley family. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294705][Bathing in Roses]] is a favorite romcom of mine, a half-parody of the genre as well.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=30185][GubraithianFire]] writes snarky scheming and glossy evil characters, if you like blacker humor. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]] has two Hogwarts powerhouses going head to head in theatrical politics and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293489][Off Kilter]] is an Oliver Wood romcom for the cynic.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=151202][I also write things.]] Most notable for you would probably be [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][And Capers Ensue]], an ensemble, friendshippy, madcap quest for an invention.

Others:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] - Hugo, Scorpius, Neville oddball adventure fic through the Forbidden Forest.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295307][Friendship for Dummies]] - a silly Terry Boot short.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=329137][Year Five]] - I haven't had the chance to read it yet, but I adore the author, and the banner serves as a suitable trailer. Ensemble fun with recreational magic.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304027][So, Listen...]] - a Fred/OC told in vignettes.
