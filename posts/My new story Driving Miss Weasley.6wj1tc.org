Hello all. I published a new story, and I thought some of you might be interested. It's not a long story, but there's a lot of action and suspense, and I think the premise is pretty much unique in the world of hpfanfiction.

Summary: It should have been a simple task. Escort Ginny Weasley to her Quidditch match. But it all changes when Harry Potter rents the wrong car. What started out as a simple road trip between two friends and past lovers quickly turns into a hellish game of cat and mouse, and Harry and Ginny find themselves running away from a mysterious and deadly group of mercenaries.

Please tell me what you think!


** Interesting premise, and I already posted a review under the same name.

In addition, I suggest you to delete reviews by those anonymous Harmony (and other) shippers.

*** Thank you very much for the review, friend, it's very appreciated. Your point about the comment pissing people off has merit. I think it's a matter of priorities. For some people it's important to adhere to the magic system we've been given, but personally I don't care one single bit about that. It's a very minor point, and I care about telling a compelling story first and foremost. But I can see how people disagree with my mindset, and that's perfectly fine.

EDIT: and about the reviews: I prefer letting them stay there. Maybe one day they'll look back at those comments and be ashamed of themselves.

** That summary brings to mind tons of cliché horror movies.

Regarding that annon review. I understand not liking Ginny as much as Hermione as she didn't have that many lines in the whole story, it is also one of the reasons she is so easy to bash... after all we never saw her and Harry develop any real relationship in the books. Honestly, we could have had tons of scenes in the 6th year, and some more scenes in the summers, that alone would have given that relationship much more credibility.

Still, decent Harry/Ginny are always welcome, it is something that I find refreshing even if I am a Harry/Tonks shipper. Sadly your plot doesn't really call to me.

*** Regarding your Harry/Ginny comment, while I believe JK Rowling could've done much better with their relationship and the lead to it, there was a lot of small hints in Order of the Phoenix, especially during the winter holiday, that pointed towards the two of them becoming an item sometime down the line. Actually, how she handed it in Order of the Phoenix was really well done, yet that all went out the window with the "monster growing in Harry's chest" or whatever nonsense it was in Half-Blood Prince.

*** Haha, the cliché part was on purpose. I like clichés, I think there's a reason they exist, and that's because they simply work in writing and creating plot. And it's fun to goof around with them.

Eh, let's not give that review more attention than it deserves. And it's sad that the plot doesn't speak to you, but nothing to do about it. Thanks for the honesty!
