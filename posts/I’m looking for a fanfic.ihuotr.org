:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It takes place after DH and Ron kidnaps and tries to r*pe hermione, but is killed by Harry, they then go on to get killed by dementors I'm the ministry and then they go back In time to first year, the most Important thing I remember is Ron is gets attacked by the troll instead and has to have a sex change and Hsd a high probability of being a squib, I can't find it anywhere so it'd be great if someone could drop me the name.


** Oh I remember that one. I may be able to find it. Give me some time.
