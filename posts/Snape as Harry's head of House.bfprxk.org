I thought about something, how do you think Snape would (or should) react to a Slytherin Harry?

I mean, I don't think he would instantly think "That's Lily's son" and treat him really well (like you see in some fic) but I'm more curious about the House Cup:\\
Do you think Snape's hate for Harry would be enough to make him forget the House Cup? Would he take points to Harry for stupid reasons like looking smug, or would he just settle to be an ass and ignore Harry for the matter of points (never take, but never give)?


** I think Snape would give Harry detentions and turn a blind eye to the inevitable bullying he would suffer in Slytherin.
