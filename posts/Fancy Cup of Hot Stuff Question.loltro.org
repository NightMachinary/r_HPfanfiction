Could someone pull a Katniss and volunteer in Harry's place?

For a story I'm planning, I'm thinking about having Harry's sibling do that when they see that he doesn't want anything to do with the tournament.

Maybe because their magic and blood is similar, the cup will allow it?

As it's a magical contract, transferring it should be simple. The only officially known parameter for the cup is for the applicant to be the best of their school, and since Harry's sibling is better than Harry, the cup would choose them if given the chance. I'm thinking it wouldn't work if they were weaker than Harry, but as Harry was only chosen because he was the only one to "enter" under the fake school, I feel the cup would latch onto the sibling because they're stronger.

I dunno, I like the idea, I just want to see what other people think.

And before someone brings it up, age isn't actually a part of the magical contract. If it were, then Dumbles wouldn't have made the age line. The cup only cares about power and skill, not age.


** If we go with what is said in Canon . . . no. Once Harry's name is out of the Goblet, everything is over and *he* is forced to compete under a Magical Contract. Nothing can change the Champions once they are chosen, so if a sibling wants to help, he has to do something before the Cup chooses the Champions (which, depending of the plot of the fic, is not possible).

But , we are not even sure the story about a Magical Contract is true. The characters who brought and defended this theory are Moody/ Crouch Jr who wanted Harry to compete for Voldemort's plot, and Crouch Sr who was controled by Crouch Jr. For all we know, the magical contract is total bullshit and Harry could have just not showed up to the Tasks.

Since Canon isn't totally clear about the rules (and it's fanfiction anyways), you are free to do anything you want, though I'm not convinced about the Harry's sibling thing since it seems a bit too easy to abuse. If Harry can have is sibling from another School compete in his stead (since sibling would be from Hogwarts while Harry was technically entered under "School 4"), what's stopping a character like Ron to enter his name, and (if selected), to switch with one of his brother like Bill?

** Theoretically, the Goblet chooses the best champion for each school. I don't think it would allow switching because being in the Tournament is supposed to be an honor. If it was something where being in the Tournament was meant to be a curse, maybe it would work that way. For instance, if a powerful dark mage back in the medieval days cursed all three schools with a tournament every 13 years, where the contestants would be chosen from a pool of offerings and the events would be created by the Goblet/magic itself, perhaps it would allow changing like that. As things are, I don't think it would make sense for it to be allowed.
