#+TITLE: Dumbledore was annoyed as the end of the school year approached. He thought the Stone was perfect bait, but none had tested the defenses but a couple Gryffindors and a Hufflepuff. Worse, Quirrell quit after falling down a staircase and nearly strangled by his own turban, only to be saved by Harry.

TL;DR everything in place, but the Dark Lord didn't show.


** It would be an interesting take on the story... Voldemort was reasonable enough to understand that messing with Horcruxes was a bad idea so when his curse backfired, he died. Yet he used transfiguration to create such a hideous persona (in order to create fear in his enemies) that most people thought he was no longer human enough to die.

Book 1 - Turns out Quirrell was just a greedy man who wanted to steal the Stone for himself;

Book 2 - After Draco gets lower grades, Lucius makes use of written instructions left by Voldemort on how to open the chamber of secrets. He gives Ginny a notebook through which he communicates to he. A reminder of the early days of the internet when talking to dangerous strangers as a kid in chatrooms was a thing;

Book 3 - Sirius is crazy and confuses Ron's pet rat with Pettigrew, while forgetting that he had killed Peter many years ago and it was the main reason he got imprisoned;

Book 4 - After many years under the Imperius Curse, Barty Jr becomes schizophrenic and deludes himself into thinking his old master is talking to him;

Book 5 - Turns out Rita Skeeter is right and Harry is indeed cracking under the pressure of being a celebrity child. Harry is not exactly lying but he is so paranoid that Voldemort is back that he even convinces Dumbledore. Fudge and the Ministry know this is not true and try to put an end to the senseless fearmongering spread by the two.

Book 6 - When Harry & co. entered the Ministry, shit that Fudge did is revealed that puts him in a Watergate-like scandal and is forced to resign. Snape kills Dumbledore over drunk row.

Book 7 - Scrimgeour is really sick and actually retires. Elections are held and blood supremacists win the elections by a landslide because of their populist speech. Since Snape is good friends with Lucius, he gets acquitted of his crime, but because Dumbledore was really well-respected people still want someone to pay. They pin the blame on Harry who is now a fugitive.
