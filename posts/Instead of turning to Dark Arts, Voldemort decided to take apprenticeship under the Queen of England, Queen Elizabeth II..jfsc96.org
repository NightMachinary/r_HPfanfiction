I don't know if this has been done. I also don't mean to offend someone.


** This should be canon, who better to teach Tom to become immortal then the Queen herself

**** She wasn't, and he might not know she is, but that's the beauty of fanfiction, you can write around that. Maybe Tom wanted to associate/align/etc. himself with the Royal Family in general, and then of course the King did die in 1952, perhaps during that time he became a close friend of the Queen? Definitely long fic material here, lmfao.
