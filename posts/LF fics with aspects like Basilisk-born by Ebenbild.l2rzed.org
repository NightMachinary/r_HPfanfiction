I enjoyed the history, the effect of Harry being removed from his time, Harry being a healer, and especially the look into the origins of magic/ the lore of creatures.

The stories definitely do no need all of the above, I doubt there are many that fit all of them, but I like the idea of ability/affinity from creature inheritance. So if there is any out there you can think of, I'd greatly appreciate it.


** Ive read it twice before a new chapter and that was when there where 68 chapters!
