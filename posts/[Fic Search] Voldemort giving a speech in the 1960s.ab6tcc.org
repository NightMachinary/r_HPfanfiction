I remember reading (most probably in 2011) a one-shot on ff.net about Voldemort giving a rousing speech between his 10-year disappearance and his reign of terror, expanding on what Sirius tells Harry in OOTP about the Blacks being somewhat enthusiastic at first about V. The only detail I specifically remember was that the author explained in a note at the end that it was based upon that passage.

Context: I recently watched Crimes of Grindelwald with my girlfriend and we discussed G's speech and I told her about the speech in this fic being in the same vein.
