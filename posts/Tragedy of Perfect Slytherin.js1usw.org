TLDR: Read Perfect Slytherin if you want read a great story and get your heart ripped out by its ending.

So, I couldn't think of a better place to share my woes than the internet so I have come to you now looking for some sign that the world is not full of darkness and gloom as I feel it is now that I have "finished" all of Perfect Slytherin.

Perfect Slytherin is a Harry Potter/Addams Family Crossover told from the perspective of Severus Snape

I have a confession, I have just recently watched the first two 90's Addams family movies for the first time this past week. If you haven't seen them you are doing yourself a disservice go watch them there basically free. The third doesn't seem to be worth the time. Either way I wanted more so I did the natural thing and took to the internet in search of fanfiction.

Typically, when I search for fanfiction I try and search for stories that are over 100k words because I tend to read fast so if there to short I'll just forget them by tomorrow and I will have just wasted time.

First I tried looking for fanfictions that weren't crossovers. Their are only 7 on both AO3 and ffn combined. While expanding my search criteria did lead to more stories quantity wise it didn't lead me to more stories that I found interesting.

So moving on to crossovers I found "When Harry met Wednesday" hasn't been updated in 5 years but the story didn't look like it was close to an ending so I moved on fine.

Then I found the "Harvete" series, something turned me off of it around the 4th book but I will probable get around to finishing it out of spite. Either way it looks unfinished but I think I will be fine when I do finish it.

These were to only two stories that I found interesting in my initial search for a stories. So I decided to make the tirp over to wattpad in hopes of finding something. Personally, I hate wattpad because I find it almost impossible to find a story that I like.

That aside I did find a short series that was interesting enough to read "Harry Potter and Camp Chippewa" and it squeal "Wednesday Addams and the Goblet of Fire." It is unfinished but is has only been 5 months since the last update so I am confident that I will get updates.

They were fine but I was still left entirely unsatisfied.

This lead me to Reddit where I would stumble into someone talking about "Perfect Slytherin" for the first time.

It took me maybe 10 hours to finish all 4 of the different books in this series. I have read what I would consider a lot of fanfiction, I'm currently closing in on 500 stories on ffn alone. I have never felt as miserable at the end of a story as I felt when I reached the end of this story.

The description of the story says its that last in the series. The Authors notes on the 4 chapter says that their is only one left. Its been 5 years since the story has been updated. I couldn't believe it when the words ended but the story didn't.

I got the horrible gut wrenching feeling and I even started to tear up a bit. It was perhaps the worst feeling I have ever gotten reading a fanfiction.

I still hope that more people read this story and enjoy it for what it is, if only so I don't have to wallow in sadness alone.

I hope Jeconais the author of this story see this and decides that they want to finish the story.

Either way I have continued to expand my search and I am still finding stories that interest me so that a good thing.


** I tried that story a long time ago. I found it, for lack of a better word, wanky? Don't get me wrong: Jeconais can write. But I seem to recall that it was just OP!Harry and OP!Wednesday effortlessly dominating Slytherin. The fic had neither the morbid and absurdist humour of /Addams Family/, nor the sense of underdog adversity of /Harry Potter/.

*** Yea, it absolutely is OP!Harry, which should be expected from any HP/Addams Family crossover. So the whole series has no underdog storyline, which I usually take as a positive. But if it is a negative point for you, then yea, that won't change even later in the series. And the Addams Family absurdity and morbidity doesn't really come into play in the first part either. I think Addams Family dynamics start taking a more central role sometime in the 2nd part.

**** Yes, I think that was the issue. Thanks for confirming my (admittedly distant) memory of it! There was no adversity, and there was no humour, so I lost interest.

I disagree that Harry in an /Addams Family/ crossover would necessarily have to be OP. For example, Harry might never quite adopt his adoptive family's spirit, generally playing Straight Man to their antics. Once he (and Wednesday?) show up at Hogwarts, he spends all his time trying to keep anyone from being hurt too badly.

I can even see something like Wednesday *A*ddams getting sorted into Ravenclaw (which gets the psychopaths who are less narcissistic and more curious), then Harry begs the Hat to put him there as well, to keep her new housemates out of mortal danger. Of course, he doesn't fit into Ravenclaw any better than Hermione fits into Gryffindor, so they end up bonding over that eventually. (This would be less of a 'ship: and more two fish-out-of-water characters whose neuroses feed off each other in amusing ways. Not that it would stop Wednesday from trying to set them up---though her methods tends to involve putting them into situations that they can only survive intact by working together or even sacrificing for each other.)

***** That sounds very forced tho, doesn't it? Or I guess maybe Harry could turn out like that if he joined the family later in his childhood? Dunno, would need a ton of character development to make me believe Harry could turn out like that after growing up in the Addams Family.

Anyways, I was only talking about how in all the crossovers I have read he is OP. Which at this point should be all the noteworthy ones since I quite like the combination. Thats what I meant with "should be expected", since afaik there are none where he isn't OP.

****** I think that having Harry cleanly assimilate into the Addams Family and become OP is a stretch.

Essentially, the Addams Family are "OP" in that they bring what amounts to cartoon violence and cartoon logic into a live action setting. They are immortal---the way Wile E. Coyote in /Loony Tunes/ is immortal. That works if you are playing it for laughs and slapstick, not some Serious Business OPness. In fact, the crossover that best handles the OP-ness is /Harveste Addams/, where it's not a big part of the story, that I can recall, and the focus was on absurdist comedy.

For that matter, why would Harry acquire their traits? He didn't acquire any Dursley traits, and it's pretty unambiguous that Addams Family traits are hereditary.

Now, Adopted!Harry has the Straight Man who has seen everything, trying to keep people from getting seriously (but whimsically) hurt is a good setup for an action comedy, as opposed to Yet Another Excuse to Make Harry OP, now with Goths.

** Pretty much everything Jeconais wrote is worth a read, if you haven't already. Maybe that can take out some of the sting :)

Many of his works are actually all time classics of the fandom and he was the original creator of many themes back in the mid 2000s that are so common today that they are considered "annoying tropes".

But yea, I doubt he will come back to finish it. He has pretty much disappeared from the internet since 2016.
