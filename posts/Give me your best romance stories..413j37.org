I've been reading too many stories with depressing or unsatisfying conclusions. Give me any story that has a male female romance with no goddamn harem. I want an emotional connection. I don't care if it's super fluffy or it has conflict as long as the romance is satisfying with a happy ending. My only stipulation is that the male must be Harry, I don't care who the female is.


** Grow Young With Me, the current Book Club fic is shaping up to this pretty well. Not finished yet, but it gets updated on a semi regular basis.

** None of the stories below incorporates concepts such as soul bonds, marriage contracts, or other forms of magical compulsions:

*Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), is a very well written book 6 from Ginny's POV. Fully canon compliant.

*A Set Up Gone Wrong*, linkffn(7630045), is Harry-never-went-to-Hogwarts, post-war romance.

*Ginny Duty*, [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465]], is also pretty good.

*Returning to the Start*, linkffn(10687059), is probably the best Harry/Hermione romance fic I've read.

*Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), could have been a great Harry/Hermione romance story, but the author just stopped short shipping them.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  This is an alternate ending to the original story. It starts at the end of Harry's third year, and continues thru his seventh. There is action in many of the chapters, but it's not the focus of the main story. I believe the overwhelming focus should be the main characters. I'm trying to write about a realistic and honest relationship between Harry and Hermione.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/1__Beauxbatons/][Hope by jeconias]]. Harry/Gabrielle. Very fluffy.

linkffn(Pureblood Princess). Harry/Daphne. Told from the POV of Daphne. It might fall have some of the Ice Queen fanon, so yer forewarned, iirc.

linkffn(Narcotic Effects). Harry/Narcissa. Deals with some "adult" issues.

linkffn(Letters by TheEndless7). Harry/Fleur. Same author as Pureblood Princess so might seem somewhat similar.

  Sophie is an American teenager who was recruited to Hogwarts after an accident that hospitalized her best friend, along with several hundred others. She is unstable, in terms of emotions and magic, yet for some reason, she was placed a year ahead of everyone else her age instead of being a really old first year or something. She also has a major crush on Hermione Granger.
