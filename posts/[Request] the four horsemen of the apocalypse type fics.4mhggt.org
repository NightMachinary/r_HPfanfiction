Recently I've been reading a bunch of PJ/four horsemen fics and i find they're relly enjoyable and wondering if theres any hp takes on it.

Prefer if its 1 from each house, or just 3 other oc's

  Abandoned by his family, Harry was half-prepared for a life of misery and solitude, until fate dealt him a hand that turns him into Death, first of a new breed and a new generation of Horsemen. Needless to say that Dumbledore and Voldemort won't be expecting THIS Harry. Harmony; Wrong BWL; AU of all 7 books

  At a young age, Harry becomes Death of the Apocalypse. Now he must find the other Riders while keeping his identity a secret while still attending Hogwarts. Features an independent Ravenclaw Harry, no Golden Trio, and an attempt to not bash characters. Book One finished! Book Two started!
