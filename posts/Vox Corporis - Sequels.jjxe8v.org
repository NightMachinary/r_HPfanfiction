Hi all. Just finished this, absolutely loved it. In the epilogue the author suggests there's been a few follow ups written. Does anyone have any recommendations? I saw Rebirth - but could find a workable link... :(


** The 'sequel' was written by a different - and very bad - writer. It was nothing at all like Vox Corporis. If it is truly gone, the world is a better place.

Some low-lights from the sequel that I remember:

- Harry and Hermione use the cruciatus curse /a lot/ on people.
- They lose their virginity on their wedding night, and go right into anal.
- Copious amounts of sex in animagus forms.

It was horrendous. If i recall, MissAnnThropic (original author) moved on to original fiction right after VC was finished and essentially said "yea, any sequels are fine with me thxbye!" and some garbage smut author decided to turn one of the all time greatest HP fanfics into a disgusting excuse for a wankfic.

*** I thought they did all of that already in the first fic.
