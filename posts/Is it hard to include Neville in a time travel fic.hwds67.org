I find it so hard to believe that if Harry time traveled into his own younger body, he wouldn't befriend Neville. the reason why they weren't good friends in canon is that they both were of the shy variety and not actively seeking friends, more like, grabbing whomever they could get. aka, why Harry got so attached to Ron from the very beginning. but if Harry time traveled, I think he would make some effort to include Neville in the group.

there are some Draco time traveling fics that I could have swore that Neville would be included in the friend circle, but it never happened after all. which was disappointing.

the only stories that do include Neville are ones that bash Ron, so it's a friend for a friend situation. and then if Hermione is also bashed, then they include Luna. and bashing is.... meh. I just wonder why that is. is there a limit of how many friends Harry can have? does it stop at three (of four, if Draco is included).

weird.


** Ask yourself - if you traveled back in time, would you WANT to spend more time around annoying little kids? It would be mind-numbing, having to listen to a bunch of 11-year olds blather on about whatever dumb stuff they are interested in.

Now, if you were 11 yourself, no problem. But any time traveller over... idk, say 16 would have a hard time tolerating more little kids than they absolutely must.

**** One of the better ways for time travel IMO is when the older Harry provides some type of book where young Harry gets some knowledge about future events but without immediately knowing older Harry's entire life. So it's still an 11 year old harry (body and mind) that gets hints/encouragement etc before a major event occurs.

Another way is where the older soul and knowledge comes back, discusses things with the younger soul and then the older soul is subsumed by the younger. So you still have an 11 year old Harry but with some knowledge but not the personality of the older Harry.

Both of those IMO are much less creepy than when a 45 year old Harry takes his 11 year old self over completely .

***** Do you have any recommendations like this? The only time travel fics I find are an older Harry being put back into his younger body.

I'd love a fic where young Harry is given information and we see the changes that unfold because of it.

****** You're correct that the vast majority of time travel stories has the older soul placed in their younger body with all the older knowledge and memories intact. Regrettably the few stories that I have read that don't do this while enjoyable have been abandoned. 

Revolution By Shadrac - This story has old Harry going back in time to give young Harry a package. This causes an alternative timeline to be developed. 

Linkffn(5734840)

Diary of Time by joemjackson has old harry going back in time and giving his younger self a diary.

Linkffn(12624339)

A Second Chance at Life by JasonZ0654 has Harry going back in time where his older core and soul merges with his younger soul and core keeping the best of both especially his innocence.

Linkffa(1497)

A Life Rewritten by telmeastory has Harry going in back in time

Linkffn(12378641)

Reflections through Time by Perfect Lionheart has Harry going back in time with hermione, luna, and ginny who are ghosts and they remain as ghosts. Hermione gets a wish but due to poor wording they get new bodies (of children who died in the previous timeline) which means there are still an original Hermione,  Luna, and Ginny in this timeline plus the "old" ghosts in new bodies.  So it's a twist.

Linkffn(3647050)

A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel has Hermione going back in time to save the Potters. They apply a twist towards the end allowing Hermione to grow up as a child rather than a 18 year old in a 2 years old body.

Linkffn(10871795)

The Disorder of the Phoenix by JacobApples has Fawkes 7 years after the war ends bringing Andromeda, Teddy, and Harry back in time to the beginning of Harry's 5th year. But that version of Harry is destroyed in the phoenix fire so a 24 year old (body, mind, and soul) is now in the past.

That should get you started.

*** I mean, he doesn't really have a choice. unless he doesn't make any friends. he could go for older ones, but they would probably not want to be friends with him cause they think he is a little kid.

but imagine having best of friends, who didn't go with you in time travel. I would def want to make friends again. though I don't personally hate children. ... some people do, so it would be harder for them.

17 isn't much of a difference, esp since the 11yo are going to be teens soon as well. another story is where Harry is like 35. that would be weird. my niece is 11, I can't imagine being friends with her for sure. thankfully, most time travels have him right after the battle.

** Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past expands Harry's circle of friends to six by adding Neville, Ginny, and Luna, without dropping Hermione or Ron (actually, just the opposite, he helps bring out their better traits). It's a deliberate choice by Harry; a big part of his strategy on his second try is to support and prepare and train the people he cares about so they have a better chance of surviving the war. And including Neville is as simple as giving him some words of encouragement at the right time and making it clear that Harry wants him around.

Unfortunately FFN deleted it and wouldn't respond to any attempts to contact them about their decision. You can get it in PDF or ebook format from [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1]] (under Assets).

** That does seem to be the case. But think about it you have an major celebrity in school with you, (sharing classes, meals, etc and no one really tries to get to know him and be his friend except for Ron (and Hermione) who in the beginning Ron didn't like. I think that's why there are so many fics that have Ron isolating Harry either on orders from his mother or Dumbledore.

When Harry rescues Hermione from the troll dragging Ron along she becomes part of Harry's cliche despite Ron's attempts to marginalize her. Hence Ron always fighting with her and putting her down. (Which is one of the reasons I never understood the later books putting Hermione and Ron as a couple).

Now in fairness to Ron you could just say he's an 11 year old boy who is definitely in the "girls are ichy" mindset. But if you look at his interactions with the other guys he is pretty dismissive of them and very possessive of Harry. Again, making it fairly easy for fics to portray Ron as not a "good" friend.

That's why I think so many time travel fics have Harry steering clear of Ron and making better friends with Neville. Only problem is it's a rare time travel fic that has Harry making friends with a lot of other people.

Just look at Gryffindor tower itself. You have 7 years worth of students in the tower but we only know a handful. Of the male students who were present in Harry's first year, Oliver Wood 4th year, Percy Weasley 4th year, Fred and George Weasley 3rd year, Lee Jordan 3rd year, Cormac McLaggen 2nd year, And then with Harry's 1st year are Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Ron. Later Colin Creevey and his brother Dennis join the tower. We really don't know much of any others who are in the tower despite the numbers that are talked about by JKR.

You would expect that with the wizarding world's saviour in your house that most of the 3rd years and below would try to get friendly with Harry but you don't see it. Now "plot reasons" would show that you can't have Harry having too many friends as that would allow him to get advice/assistance in all his adventures and much of that advice would be to get the adults involved more. Which makes it tough for the "kid" to save the day. Hence the lack of friends.

It's also why the time travel fics don't have Harry greatly increasing his group of friends because the fics still want Harry to be the Hero. So if Neville joins in then most fics knock Ron out.

*** that is basically the problem of canon. it was pretty much done for the plot, that he only ever befriended the two. plus not including a lot of other characters. you would think that Harry being on the Quidditch team would give some time to explore at least the team members other than them coming to Harry just to say there's a practice on Wednesday night. even after the fifth book, where both Neville and Luna were more important didn't stay with it, and both were pretty much gone the same for book six. granted, that book lacked the mystery to uncover like eg. book 1 or 2. Ginny only stayed to be the romantic interest. plus she was a Weasley, and they were explored enough.

but you would think for fanfics, where Harry already knows everything that will happen, a friendship with Neville wouldn't make much difference. and it is the writers choice to not include him. maybe people just don't like his character...

**** Definitely for books 6 & 7, and likely for book 5 I would swear that JKR used a ghost writer that hadn't read the first 4 books because there was no way I could see Hermione ever going with Ron. Unless of course you were intentionally trying to get young girls to believe that the best guy for them is always the guy who criticizes you, picks on you constantly, and belittles everything you care about and believe in.

And Ginny was a massive non-entity as a character through book 4 (which if she was to be Harry's love interest you would've thought she'd have a bigger presence in books 3 & 4) and suddenly she's his girlfriend?

What was interesting was when JKR stated that Hermione/Ron was a kind of wish fulfillment for her but that they wouldn't have lasted. I've heard people say that means that JKR saw herself as the know-it-all bookworm and Ron as the popular jock. But how could you compare Ron as "the" jock as he didn't get onto the Quidditch team until his 5th year and Hermione had to cheat to get him his spot? Especially compared to Harry who was the youngest seeker in 100 years and the Triwizard Winner.

Sorry for the Rant.

For some reasons it seems that a lot of fic writers try to keep the basic symmetry of the books. So for the most part single characters get swapped around. Eg Ron not going to be a friend than put Neville in. Harry is put in Slytherin then he's friends with Draco and Daphne. Ginny not going to be his love interest then she's out and Hermione is in, not Hermione will then it's Luna.

You would think there would be a few more OC characters for Harry to date or be friends with but that doesn't seem to happen often. Still doesn't mean that the stories aren't fun to read.

****** My biggest problem with the canon pairings was that to me they came out of the blue. For the first 4 books all I could see was a romance building between Harry and Hermione. And I saw no hint of anything along those lines between Hermione and Ron. And Ginny was such a non-entity in books 3 & 4 that there were no hints of romance there to see either. Then suddenly in the later books the canon pairings started to appear and to me they felt forced as there wasn't a suggestion that was the direction the story was going.

Now most of this is due to my own background. I was always very good friends with the women I went out with before anything romantic occurred. And when the romance ended I remained very good friends with them. And yes it hurt like hell when they started to date someone else but I cared so much about the friendship I got passed it.

I wouldn't exactly say that Canon pairings bad, Harmony good. Because if the early books had done a better job of building the relationship with Hermione & Ron, and giving more interaction between Ginny and Harry I would've been fine with the pairings.

Harry/Ginny on the other hand.... that was the out of blue completely. and while I do like Romione, if the only way Hinny wouldn't exist would be HH/Hr instead, I think I would take it.

It's the rare few that have Harry come back, kick Ron to the curb but NOT make friends with Neville.

**** Harry went to rescue Hermione. He had to drag Ron there. If he hadn't physically grabbed him and took him there Ron wouldn't have gone. Now when there Ron did indeed help save Hermione from the Troll. But to me it always felt that Hermione was now Harry's friend and had to tolerate Ron since he was Harry's Friend.

And sorry but you don't get full credit for saving someone if it was your actions that put them in the sights of danger. Well at least IMO.

  They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.

  “I've just thought --- Hermione.”

  “What about her?”

  “She doesn't know about the troll.” Ron bit his lip.

  “Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy'd better not see us.”
#+end_quote

Um, no? Harry grabs Ron's arm to stop him, because they're walking. He doesn't even have to tell Ron what he wants to do.

ETA: at this point they don't even think Hermione needs rescuing. The troll is supposed to be in the dungeons.

And Hermione is Ron and Harry's friend equally. That she tolerates Ron is a fanon construction. They have bunch of fun without Harry. Notice that Hermione splits her time between them when they fight.

****** That's not what I remember. Let's see 7 books read a little over 2 dozen times in 20 years vs 2000+ fanfics in the last 3 years. Yep suffering canon/fanon merge. Looks like I need to break out the original books and reread them.

****** Eh, I disagree, not because I hate Ron - I don't - but because it is hyper unrealistic that a teenage girl would fall for/enjoy being around a guy that ruined the 'biggest' night of her life to that point (the Yule Ball) in a fashion that was both extremely hurtful and publicly humiliating.

I cut people off for pulling shit like that now, as an adult; when I was a teen I would have never spoken to them again. That Hermione continued to be his friend (much less dating him a year or two later) is even more mindboggling than magic existing for real. But JKR has a major ginger fetish, so I should place her Ron/Hr pairing alongside the fandoms that enjoy Hermione falling for neo-nazis. Just one of those things.. 🤷‍♂️

******** I don't see why. JKR had pretty much every non Weasley character either die or end up with a Weasley. That's fetish territory. Ginger dick/vag = life-saving plot armor in JKR's mind.

Edit: if Remus had been gay for Charlie Weasley, bet he would have lived through DH 😂

In Linkffn(A slytherin through time) Neville becomes Time Traveler!Draco's best friend.

It's my absolutely favorite HP fanfic and the main reason I ship Neville/Daphne.

  With a sly smile he eyed the time turner. It gleamed like gold, just the way the Malfoys liked it. With this, he could save his son. He went for the door but came to a sudden halt when realization hit him: With the time turner, he could save more than just one person. (Draco-centric time travel fanfiction, 3rd year)
