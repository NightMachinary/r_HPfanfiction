I'm looking for stories where Voldemort discovers Harry is a horcrux or stories that are written like Hauntingly. Any recommendations are appreciated.

I'll post a link to mine and hauntingly for anybody interested in reading them (These fics are incredibly well written), keep in mind it is Harry/Voldemort

Mine: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17604014/chapters/41498540]]

Hauntingly: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18541177/chapters/43945975]]


** You would probably also enjoy [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7502151/][No Glory]] by the same author. It has somewhat similar themes and also begins with Voldemort learning that Harry is a horcrux. linkao3(7502151)

Here are a few other HP/LV fics that would fit your request:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8988616/1/In-Somno-Veritas][In Somno Veritas]] - (COMPLETE) Like Hauntingly, this story features dream interactions between Harry and Voldemort. linkffn(8988616)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15649041/][Corruption]] - (ONGOING) Rather than kill fem!Harry in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort uses legilimency and discovers that she is his horcrux. linkao3(15649041)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18851794/][Mi Aedijekit]] - (ONGOING) Thousands of years after being drugged with Draught of Living Death, Harry wakes up to a technomagically advanced future in which nothing is familiar. linkao3(18851794)

Here are a few with no pairing:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11906882/1/Draught-of-Living-Death][Draught of Living Death]] - (ONESHOT) linkffn(11906882)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/832559/][Keep Your Enemies Closer]] - (ONGOING) Voldemort strikes early to win the war and take his horcrux captive. linkao3(832559)

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

  The liquid flowed thickly down his throat. It tasted of tainted honey and carried the ineffable weight of centuries down with it, until they hung heavy beneath his ribs and drowned his lungs in ice crystals.Harry Potter and Voldemort, and the inevitable baggage of a millenium. (alternatively)The fine art of historical revisionism.(No longer updating quickly due to grad school re-commencing. Slowly adding hand-drawn title images to already-posted chapters.)

  Voldemort conquers wizarding Britain and discovers his human horcrux. Harry is allowed to live under the new regime. Attending a darker version of Hogwarts, he struggles with vengeful classmates, a strange connection to Dark Marks, and worst of all, Tom Riddle whispering inside his head. AU dystopia. Story is mostly gen, though praised for its gradual platonic intimacy between the two arch-enemies.One reviewer says of KYEC: I just found this story a couple of days ago, and I'm thoroughly gripped by it. I could barely stop reading in between chapters, but had to, of course, since your tale is already so deliciously long. The plot is thrilling and well thought-out, and your characterisations are spot-on.

** linkao3(15994781) has Voldemort ordering Draco to befriend and kidnap Harry after he's discovered as a horcrux, with a side of pureblood politics (but no Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin goblin shenanigans).

  Severus Snape has a change of heart. In an attempt to keep Potter alive, he tells the Dark Lord all about Dumbledore's plans for Potter and the war. Once Voldemort realizes that Harry Potter is his horcrux, his plans change drastically. So does Draco Malfoy's assignment for the school year. Harry's sixth year starts going very differently. Snape is now on a mission to discover why Harry was so ignorant of the Wizarding World. Harry is going to need to learn pureblood politics if he's going to keep up with everything. Draco Malfoy needs to find a way to convince Harry to forgive him. Voldemort finds himself visiting Harry Potter in his dreams. Everyone is realizing that no one is quite what they thought. And through it all, there's a mystery. What is Ancient Magic? Why is it so powerful and so hard to control? And why did Professor Dumbledore go out of his way to make it illegal?
