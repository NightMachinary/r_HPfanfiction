*** Or simply a toy of his own that wasn't broken. Some distant family member he hoped would claim him if they only knew what he was going through. The mind of a neglected child has to be a tortuous place and The fact Harry wasn't buried under the pressure, shows his strength of character.

#+begin_quote
  "I cared about you too much," said Dumbledore simply. (OotP, ch37) What if Dumbledore chose a more reasonable way to express his care and went unreasonably out of his way to ensure that Harry enjoyed his childhood? Oneshot from 1982 to wrap up after fourth year.
