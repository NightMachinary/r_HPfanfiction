:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this Drarry fic a while ago where Draco works at the ministry - something to do with time, and I think a grandfather clock (?). Harry is assigned to watch over him. He sometimes just sits there eating sandwiches while Draco works. But then there's an accident and what follows is an amazing action-packed adventure. I remember something about time stopping and there being golden threads of magic (?) and possibly a Death Eater who tries to kill them (?)So, basically, I have very poor memory, and I cannot remember any more of the details, but this is driving me crazy! I've spent several hours searching for this already. If this sounds like anything anyone's read/written, please help me!!PS: I think I read it on Archive of our Own
