** A Long Journey Home features a time loop

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home]]

HP and the Temporal Beacon also features time loops

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon]]

Regrettably neither of those is complete, but both are worth a shot if you've never read them before.

** Time loops are my absolute favorite genre!

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6691 (and sequel Heartlands of Time) are amazing. Groundhog Day by Rorschach's Blot is hilarious.

His 25th life (or something like that, I can't find it) is timeloop-ish but focuses on one life with flashbacks to others in which Harry was a variety of beings.

There's one I've downloaded but not yet read: try try tri again wizard tournament

I am so annoyed with ff net right now as it only shows a small fraction of my followed and favorited stories... I know there are more. I'll update if I remember or find more.

Even if you know nothing about Naruto (I sure didn't) time braid by sharperV is epic.

If you are interested in a song of ice and fire/game of thrones there are a couple in that universe well worth reading, too.

*** Time Braid is quite the thing to recommend to someone. It's... a trip, and not necessarily a good one. The story elementals are fairly interesting but the attempt at romance is just. Its. It's awful. Skin crawling horror inducing ‘how was this thought up' kinda of awful. I wish there was a version of it without any of that stuff because then I might have legitimately enjoyed it instead of being left waffling between disgust, abject horror and perverse interest.

***** Though I'm not sure this is the kind of thing one is supposed to bring up I cannot help my curiosity so I must ask: how did that end? I cannot fathom being in a relationship with more than one person at a time and being emotionally interested in every party. It's hard enough to care for one individual like that.

****** ‘It's complicated' is a really good answer that covers everything, in this case. But I'll give you a little more than that.

I have multiple chronic illnesses that have left me unable to work and function for most of the last 10 years. I have a daughter who has been my sole responsibility since my husband died about 11 years ago. I just didn't want to put all that on any one person. I have a decent pension provided by my late husband. I was determined to be officially single and not have anyone else move in with me. I hired help when I needed it. But I have a very high sex drive and a strong desire for connection and affection. So my answer was to date multiple people at any given time, but not be monogamous with any of them. I was very upfront about this, and made sure everyone was aware of what was going on. Unfortunately, I discovered that there are a few main types of person that are interested in a polyamorous lifestyle. Some of them are extremely emotionally damaged and fear commitment. Some of them are narcissistic and selfish and don't want to give up any of their personal freedom. Some of them are just curious and trying it out, but will experience a lot of pain if they get emotionally attached and are denied monogamy. Many people are in a committed relationship as partners and are just looking for occasional threesomes.

Personally, whenever I fell deeply in love with someone that was the end of my interest in pursuing relationships of a romantic or sexual nature with anyone else. Luckily, when my husband and I fell for each other, we both felt this way. Now we are happily monogamous, with no intentions of changing that in the future.

******* Ahh. Thank you for the informative reply! I initially took it to mean that you where in a long-term relationship with more than one person. Considering what I know of human psychology that kind of arrangement you described seems to make more sense. Glad to know someone out there is in a happy relationship and best of luck in your future!

******** I did have long-term relationships with multiple people, and I loved many of them, but there was no commitment involved. I think a more accurate term for the lifestyle I was living is consensual non-monogamy. ‘Polyamory' makes a lot of people think of triads, quads, etc. all living under the same roof and raising their children together.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** [[https://vi-fi.github.io/Cedric's%20Eight.html][Cedric's Eight]]

Cedric has spontaneous duplication, which causes him to split into multiple selves that merge together after an hour. The condition was made up to explain away time turner users being in multiple places at once, but Cedric somehow still managed to contract it. He later gets a time turner too, which causes even more Cedrics to be in different places at the same time.

** It's not a happy story, but I like linkffn(Reincantation by Alisonven).

There's also:

Getting the Hang of Thursdays ([[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/]]),

linkffn(All Our Yesterdays by SallyJAvery).

Prelude and Fugue ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/562941]]).

None of which I've gotten around to reading yet.

linkffn(Greater Than, Lesser Be by Kneazle) is a very good story with a background of Harry being sent back in time repeatedly, but it's not quite what I'd consider a time-loop story.
