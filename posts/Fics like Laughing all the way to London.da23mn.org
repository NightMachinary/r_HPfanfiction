edit: i meant the time travel concept, with merged identities.


** If you want bad ass Harry Potter, Wind Shear by Chilord on FanFiction.Net is one of the more interesting ones I've read, where the adult Harry gets dropped into muggle London in 1970...

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a single father trying to raise his godson, Teddy. Unable to ensure his son's safety in the wizarding world he goes into hiding in the muggle one. But one trip to London will undo all of his precautions. Thrown back to the past, Harry will take up the DADA position and fall into the arms of a woman who once spared his life. No time paradox, Light/Badass Harry. T/M rated.

** Define Like. In terms of pairing, premise or execution. It has the best concept of time travel in my opinion in terms of the superimposition of identities and is pretty unique.

In terms of a badass Harry going back in time and becoming a DADA teacher there's a couple. Wind Shear by Chilord is probably the best of the bunch.

In terms of Harry time travelling and taking Teddy back with him, I havent seen many if those. JacobApples has a few other good fics as well so you should check them out.
