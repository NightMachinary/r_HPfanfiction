It doesn't have to be a major part, but I like it when it gets acknowledged. It's a permanent part of Harry that's in a lot of ways even more messed up than the lightning scar. What do people who don't know about Umbridge even think of something like that carved into a person's hand?

** i read a fic a while back where the quill Umbridge made him use was enchanted to make the user do whatever they wrote they'd do. essentially, he was under a kind of geas inclining him to naturally be more truthful and making it hard to tell outright lies. i can't remember the name of the fic unfortunately.

** I've seen a HP/MCU crossover where James Potter was Loki (Dumbledore told him Lily, Harry, Sirius, Remus, and Peter were all dead, thus why he didn't raise Harry). When a trickster deity slash god of lies sees his /son/ marked with "I must not tell lies", he is /not happy/.

*** Hi hello I would just like to say---- I have never ever shipped SS/HP, but as is my custom, I'm fully willing to try weird ships with time travel elements because it's normally a pretty interesting concept.

That being said, YOU HAVE RUINED ME

I will never find another time travel fic this good, I will never be able to ship these to characters with anyone else, and I will never stop sobbing, just in general over this.

I just finished this fic and it is, hands down, one of the most raw, poignant, absolutely devastating things I've ever read. Not fanfics. Anything. Ever. This is on my permanent favorites list now and I'll probably never read anything quite as good. Thank you so much.

** Not exactly a fic suggestion, but it comes up in pretty much every single crossover fic.

** I read a DN/HP fanfic where the fineness of the scar (most scars with things written are kinda jagged) and the lighyning bolt scar (looked like it was both brand new and long faded) got L to pay a lot closer attention to Harry.
