The same argument applies to Ron and Ginny btw.

If James can mature, why not Ron?

Ginny is even shown in the Books to have changed, although JKR didn't write it out in great details

And then HBP/DH came along and she changed back again. Although to be fair, there isn't a single character which comes out of these books looking better than before. Malfoy went from racist bully to war criminal, Ron and Hermione are suddenly very naive when it comes to Malfoy and cause a lot of damage that way, Tonks goes from funny side character to breeding cow for Harry's orphan godson, Lupin looks even worse after running away from his pregnant wife, Snape's motivation make him look like a whimp (and it surely isn't love), Dumbledore suddenly played with magical fascism in his youth.

Arguably, we never see James do anything where he deserts his friends. He is a dick to Snape and a bit of a prat, but he never deserted anyone and he had enough common sense to save his nemesis from his own stupidity.

That is not to say that Ron can't mature, but I certainly see where the authors who end his friendship with Harry come from.

That is literally canon. The one time where Hermione really drops the ball (the Malfoy situation), there are no consequences for her. But I also have no idea how to include something since I don't see Harry go "I told you so" at Dumbledore's funeral.

Marietta got off lightly for de facto selling the DA out to Voldemort by proxy of the woman who craved into the skin of teenagers for fun.

And the birds are irrelevant since they caused little damage, none of it lasting (so no legal consequences are possible) and ending the friendship between her and Ron, well if you want to go down that route it should have ended after year 3.

- Lord Potter Black Peverell Slytherin Gryffindor Ravenclaw Le Fay Pendragon, etc.

- Dumbledore and Weasley bashing...

- Lily and James being child abusers because the other potter twin is The Boy Who Lived

- Vernon and Petunia being Satan and Beelzebub reincarnated rather than being just negligent and slightly abusive (I mean, Vernon sexually abusing Harry... Really? is it necessary?)

- Voldemort being fucking stupid

- Snape bashing without any reason

- Harry BeInG a FriEnD of tHe GobLiN NaTioN because "Lily and James" were the only ones that treated Goblins decently enough (or... Because Harry knows the proper way to greet them)

- Nicknames such as "pup, cub, prongslet, bumblemore, moldyshorts, bumblebore, goat sucker, puppy, 'mione, Mia, etc. "

- Harry having a harem including NARCISSA, BELLATRIX and even MCGONAGALL sometimes... I mean, wtf

- To refer Harry, Hermione and Ron as 'the golden trio'

*** I would argue that Voldemort being fucking stupid is canon. Seriously, his plan during OoTP is breathtakingly idiotic and convoluted.

You want to avoid detection, and acquire a prophecy orb that only two people (you being one of them) can handle. You have a way to sneak a dozen people into the room where its stored without detection.

Obviously the smart way to accomplish all this is to spend the better part of a year calling attention to the room in question, attack someone with a giant magic snake most of the country associates with you while leaving behind the victim in the MoM because reasons, then show up in the atrium of the people you're trying to avoid for a massive battle while screaming "Here I am Motherfuckers!".

Instead of just sneaking into the DoM using the same method you used for the DE, grabbing the orb, and going home to watch Skinemax or something. Maybe do a spell and an obliviate on the order guard so they think they fell asleep.

**** If JKR hadn't dumbed down canon Voldemort into oblivion, her Trio would never have had a chance.

Her Trio (and good guys) had no political acumen, no strategic brilliance, and only some tactical competence. Therefore, they needed tons of Deus Ex Machina, author fiat, plot armors, hero's dumb luck, and very importantly, stupid villains to pull off a Pyrrhic victory.

To be fair, that is the ultimate power move against Malfoy. Not only can Harry brag about fucking his mother, he can produce photographic evidence to back up his claim.

That being said, harems are basically a guarantee for shitty writing.

** I dislike molly Weasley bashing because in that is completely wrong. It is canon that molly loved and cared about harry. I mean come on in Order of Phoenix book, when molly confronts a boggart she sees her children and harry dead. I can guess why most bashing fics include her as she is seen as diehard Dumbledore supporter and tries to make harry and his friends ignorant of war but which person would want their kid to be part of war and be killed. Many people don't like the way she treated Sirius but most made some sense. Sirius Black was very lonely and was not in good frame of mind because he had to be alone in the place which he hated the most and he had not healed mentally from his stay at Azkaban. He understood what Harry's anger at being ignorant and tried to alleviate it by telling him everything and Molly didn't like it very much as this the thing that Molly is against as she wants her children, Harry and Hermione to grow up without burden of doing the stuff which was clearly job of their elders not of teenage children.
