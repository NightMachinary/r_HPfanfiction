Harry somehow travels back in time. James and Lily are captured by death eaters and so is Harry. Harry escapes after calling them pathetic and they follow after him.


** Wish I knew what it was because it definitely sounds like an interesting read. üëåüèΩ

Is it this one? I literally just read it earlier today so that might be why I'm thinking about it. Harry does meet James and Lily in a dungeon, but they travel to the future instead of Harry traveling to the past.

  Through an freak act of magic nineteen year old James and Lily end of sharing a cell after being captured by Death Eaters with none other than their Seventeen year old son Harry. He is certainly not what they would have expected a child of theirs to be.

  Scorpius really should have listened to his father's numerous and dire warnings about the Potter clan. Harry feels his pain. Gen crackfic WIP, yo. Seriously, so cracky.
