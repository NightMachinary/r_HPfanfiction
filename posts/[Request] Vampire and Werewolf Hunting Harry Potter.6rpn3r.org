A story were Harry is tasked with or takes on the duty himself to battle Dangerous and Violent Vampires and Werewolves. Not a Werewolf hater or anything like that but rather he fights against the many who take the Greyback path rather than then path of Remus.


** I've written a Buffy Crossover where Harry and Hermione join the Watchers Council, "Uncle Quentin's Spy".

**** You don't need to be familair with the TV series. The story is set two years before the TV show and doesn't use many canon charaters. It also explains the background of the Buffy elements in the story.
