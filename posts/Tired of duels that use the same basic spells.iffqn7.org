I would daresay, spells like /stupefy/, /reducto/, /expelliarmus/, /bombarda/, /flipendo/, are too overused in fics.

And I feel there are so many different creative ways to duel with magic, such as using transfiguration, charms in an original way or even elemental magic, that sometimes (most of the times) I end up unsatisfied with how duels are written.

As a fanfic writer I understand actions scenes tend to be the most difficult to write; nonetheless, they are the most rewarding also. As such, fellow writers, I really commend you write duels in creative ways... The fic will get better almost certainly, I'm sure.

As such, would you please recommend me some fics where duels are /different/?


** Well, you know, they ARE all learning the same spells in school. Only adults would have had time after school to study other spells and use them in duels. It makes sense that they'd all be using the same spells --- except Draco, who probably has Dark Arts tutors during the summers. :D

It's part of what, in my opinion, makes it unlikely school-age kids could win a duel against combatant adults (versus adults who only use minor spells around the house instead of honing their skills).

*** I mean, it makes sense that aurors, order members, Death Eaters and maybe professors prepare themselves for combat during the war. It's also pretty likely that they would have more time to train and access to more experienced trainers than Harry in the DA. For Harry and the DA to do as well as they did is really extraordinary.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), has probably the most unlikely duel involving Voldemort, but the battle scene between BismarckMort and HMS Hood is excellent.

The duel between Hermione and Bellatrix in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11463030/1/][Lady Archimedes]], linkffn(11463030), should be considered legendary among fanfics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), has many good fight sequences. The final battle alone contains 35-40k words and is extremely bloody.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), is very heavy into using transfiguration and animation in duels.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** I keep suggesting The Second String whenever I can.

This time, because Harry uses domestic? household? spells during duels. (Slice a person using a slicing bread spell, for example.)

And he learns a lot of fire spells with some pirates, too.

Honestly, this story is pretty amazing and I really like the action scenes.
