NOT A DISCUSSION, THERE ARE OTHER THREADS IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS CHARACTERS MORALITY OR JUSTIFICATIONS

Canon glossed over a lot of really disturbing details when you think about it. Draco yelling slurs with witnesses around and getting away with it, Lucius getting away with attempted murder, hagrid getting thrown in Azkaban without due process, Snape getting away with attempting to kill sirius via proxy (poa and ootp)

there is a ton of stuff I could list but basically are there any fics where we see stuff like this having consequences or just the harry+company hold a grudge? Canon and a lot of fanfics just have the victims let it go rather then getting even like harry figure out who told tom the prophecy and he attacks snape

the best example of what I mean would linkffn(forging the sword)

no bashing please no slash no hinny

ps. I didn't include anything that ron or hermione or harry did because they in each instance realized they were wrong and apologized however awkwardly

​


** Just for clarity: I am not a fan of Lucius Malfoy (I am really not a fan of ANY Malfoy, and I won't get into details to avoid contact with the Godwin's Law), but Lucius trying to curse Harry with the Killing Curse in the open is one of many nonsenses in films. In books it is more limited:

#+begin_quote
  Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at Harry.

  “You've lost me my servant, boy!”

  But Dobby shouted, “You shall not harm Harry Potter!”

  There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.

  “You shall go now,” he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.”

  Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.

*** I meant trying to kill Ginny and other muggleborns

I assume he had some idea of what would happen with the diary

**** He really didn't have to. For embarrassing the Weasley family (if that was the original intent), it would be enough Ginny be found in possession (no pun intended) of any seriously dark object.

** linkffn(Petrification Proliferation)

Hogwarts gets thoroughly searched by the ministry. Although no individuals are brought to any kind of justice IIRC, it's satisfying seeing the ministry take an active role in actually being helpful and sorting out all of Hogwarts's problems.

Plus, the end of chapter 4 is hilarious.

*** Plus all those silly (and useless) notices “I don't know anything, JKR owns everything” are in this story turned into a separate art form.

**** At least they only put them at the beginning of chapters as opposed to (shudders) in the middle of the prose.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
