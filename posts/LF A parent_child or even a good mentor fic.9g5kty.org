Just missing my mom today and would like to feel that parental bond or in a fic as a big part or even the main part of the story. I'm not looking for something sad (like bad things can happen but the tone more hopeful/not angst?) and no death in the story please. Like if they die before that's fine but I just don't want to deal with death much right now. I usually prefer Harry as the main character but I'm open to any. Thank you!


** I would recommend 'The Secret Language of Plants' series by Endrina ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214]] )* where Harry is rescued by Snape and Lupin and raised. It has bad things happen, but the overall tone of the story is of love and people doing good things.

At several points in the story Harry is separated from Snape and Lupin but they always find their way back together (I'm trying not to spoil it but also warn you that separation is in it)

*Sorry, don't know how to link a whole series.

*** I love this series. It takes a bit to get used to the writing style but once you get the rythm it's lovely.

** Linffn(It's OK Not to Be OK (But I Promise I'm Trying)) starts when McGonagall finds out about Harry being abused and she adopts him. It has a nice take on her character and in everyone's character in general. There's around 3-5 books in the series (which is completed), so it's definitely worth checking out imo.

Linkffn(Those Who Love) is an older abandoned fic where Harry's parental figures are McGonagall, Sirius, and Remus. They kidnap him shortly after he's sent to the Dursleys, and because of it Harry has the best childhood he possibly could have.

Linkffn(The Bonds of Blood) has a subplot where Sirius is declared innocent and gets custody of Harry. But I'd save this one for latter, as it's quite angsty.

Same goes for linkffn(The Beast Within by Nifty Niffler). Angsty, but definitely worth checking out. In this one, Harry is bitten by Greyback on Halloween 1981 and he's raised by Remus because of it.

Those are the ones that I can list off the top of my head. There's probably some others; I'll list them later if I can.

  Love is a reason to live when hope is gone, and fight when it seems darkness has won. Love can help overcome fear, and change the world. Sirius lives for Harry. Remus loves Dora. Minerva is in touch with her inner Slytherin. And Harry & Ginny have a bond.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

** "The Dogfather"

“I'm not a reverse werewolf either,” says the man. “I'm your godfather.”

--------------

Basically Harry gets adopted by a loving muggle family and even when others get involved such as Sirius, they're still integral to the family unit. It's lovely and I adore the interactions.
