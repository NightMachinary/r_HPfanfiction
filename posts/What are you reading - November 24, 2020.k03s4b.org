** I read "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27558847][Dear Tom, Who the Bloody Hell Are You?]]", gen, by Ailec_12. It's a really interesting little one-shot where Sirius finds Tom's diary in the Malfoy manor during a party and then talks to it for about half a year before having it returned to the Malfoys. The story was really interesting, seeing Sirius grow more and more invested in the diary. It also touched on how life is going for him in the background of the story as well, such as stuff with his family and his friends. What I really liked was that there was some real tension a couple of times when it seemed like Sirius was about to be possessed.

Ember Rowle and Harry Potter are complete opposites. He was a saint, the "Boy Who Lived", the one who was destined to destroy the Dark Lord, and she was the daughter of a convicted Death Eater, a Slytherin, and best friends with Draco Malfoy. Even with all these things considered it was if they were magnets.

This is THE best fanfic I've ever read.

The chapters are very detailed and kept me engaged throughout the thing. The latest chapter that was uploaded today is emotionally charged and it was such an amazing read. The fic' not very popular, but I absolutely love it.

The writer is AspireandInspire, and they have a done a wonderful job.

  With Professor Snape's hateful and cruel words towards her, Hermione's trust in authority figures comes crashing down for good. She begins to question the adults' response to Harry's forced entry into the Triwizard Tournament and concludes that it's up to her to keep him safe. And if they have to leave the country to escape the madness of Hogwarts and Magical Britain, so be it.

  Betad by Eider Down.Severus remembered dying, bleeding out, his consciousness barely there. He remembered pain. He remembered his one last look into those green eyes, doomed as they were to join him soon in death. His heart ached, as his neck ached, as his body ached.He greeted death as a friend.Severus didn't expect to wake up. It was rather disconcerting, really. One moment he was drifting away, and the next he was aware of his body again, just as sore as before. It felt approximately the way he imagined coming back from the brink of death should feel like. Which is to say, fucking awful.Hell would have been preferable, instead he's now back in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter. What should he do? Can he change events for the better? Whom can he trust?Meanwhile, there's something slightly...off about his cousin Dudley. Only time will tell, but at least that's something he has plenty of now.Severus is about to find out why they say you should walk a mile in someone's shoes before judging them. A different time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus (Sevitus) you'll ever read.

** Currently re-reading some old FF.

*Title*: Customer Service

*Author*: Sunny June 46

*Rating*: R

*Link*: the original FF is no more available on the internet since Sunny June 46 lost all her original files years ago; she also deleted her FFnet account. It's circulating via email among fans, but it has been years since I read about it. Also, an Italian translation by Kit_05 (one of the most prolific translators back in the days) is available [[https://efpfanfic.net/viewuser.php?uid=11529][here]].

#+end_quote

It is a funny Dramione FF which distinguishes for its form: it's de facto an epistolary love story told through magical e-mails between Draco (now a multi-billionaire business owner) and Hermione, a young lawyer who Draco hires. Secondary pairing is Blaise/Pansy, which works well as a sidekick. The author also wrote a sequel, /Customer Satisfaction/, which has never been completed and is now lost as the original FF.

Years ago I thought about completing [[https://efpfanfic.net/viewstory.php?sid=663893&i=1][the Italian translation]] of this fic, started by Elos but which stopped at Ch. 40. Then, life happened.

I recently came into this FF again, I quickly read /First Detention/ and quickly switched to /New Home/. It's an interesting fiction in which Harry is an abused and lonely child, he has no friends (not even Ron or Hermione) and is extremely weak. Snape accidentally hits him during a detention and subsequently he and Dumbledore discover the truth. So the once misanthrope and apathetic bat puts any effort in giving Harry a better life. No pairing.

9/10 - One of the best and realistic Post-Hogwarts Harry with plenty of OCs but none of them ever feels out of place. Pretty active author, still updating and the story has a comfortable meandering pace.

linkffn(New Blood)

9/10 - A different side of cannon with Slytherin Hermione, totally bashing free, pretty good character progression and a good amount of creative content with the author taking care of all plot threads, rarely ever leaving anything forgotten or OOC. Pretty active, still updating.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

*** Great suggestions! I read and enjoyed both.

Here's a couple in return. linkffn(13507192;13653786). Both unfinished but updating frequently.

Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos is a wrong boy who lived story. Harry goes to Slytherin. He's a bit more damaged and has an edge to him but it steers clear of the angst for the most part which I liked. I give it a 9/10.

Serpentine Advice - Slytherin takes Harry under his wing and teaches him how to think. As you might expect, it brings out a more ambitious and clever Harry. I quite enjoyed the character interactions although I'm not sure the philosophy mixed in always works. I'd give this one a 7/10.

** *Title*: Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the Girl-Who-Lived\\
*Author*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/13839/Lord-Jeram][Lord Jeram]]\\
*Rating*: T\\
*Link*: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-Girl-Who-Lived]]

*Summary*\\
Harry discovers that he's a wizard, but can't understand why everyone in the wizarding world thinks he's a girl.

*The Good*\\
First off, this is definitely an original premise. I've read a lot of HP fanfiction and don't recall seeing anything close to this. The writing is pretty high quality, the characters are all from canon and all behave as you'd expect. The story has a lot of the usual Stations of Canon but things are different enough to prevent the usual boredom I get when reading yet another version of the troll in the bathroom, with the big difference being that Hermione's wearing green earrings or something utterly trivial.

The ramifications of Harry's situation are handled with a touch of humour and it's interesting to see how it all develops as he grows older.

I began reading with some trepidation because I suspected it would quickly devolve into badly written sex scenes, or some form of gender bashing but it's not done any of that. I've reached the end of what there is and I'm eagerly awaiting more.

*The Bad*\\
To my mind, there's nothing genuinely bad about the story. The ongoing mystery of what caused Harry's odd situation is pretty obvious after a while - at least in general terms - but it's not beyond the realms of canon for several characters to be playing Pass The Idiot Ball and not be able to work it out.

The big bad could turn out to be updates. I stumbled across this because I happened to be on FF net's Browse page and it had just updated. Reading through in one go, there are a depressing number of "Sorry it's been a year"-type ANs, and the story has taken a full ten years to reach chapter 24. Perhaps a few new readers adding nice reviews will speed things along.

*Verdict*\\
I'll give it an 8/10 so far: not a classic but very definitely worth a shot.

I think it was more a ‚ÄúI want to subvert the 3 year trope‚Äù than really needed, but he did work carefully to this end since the beginning of book 3. Lord Wilkes was mentioned -if only by allusion - in the beginning of book 1 (about his maternal side) + there is a paragraphe in book 2 about slytherin descendants during the Spanish conquest that I think is related + he saying to Snape ‚Äúwhen I end up winning against James, you will get an engraved invitation‚Äù or smthg. I was not that surprised, but I did not see it coming about ‚Äúlord Wilkes‚Äù and not something like a descendant of ‚ÄúSlytherin‚Äù. Which was another trope subverted I think.

**** Subversion of popular tropes got old after a while. At this point you expect the reverse to be the norm. Shrewd Fudge, Sympathetic Umbridge, Competent Pettigrew.. It feels kind of forced. Some of the logical explanations for canon events feels contrived and tbh convoluted. Sure, the worldbuilding is good especially the eastern martial arts stuff, PoS, mind arts, and wild magic, but the story became too bloated and the third arc is pretty lacking when compared to the previous ones. I wouldn't call it mediocre but 7/10 is a fair assessment. It could go higher with some stricter editing.

***** Okay, i disagree with you but i get your point.I must admit I don't know that many common-trope subversive fanfictions, maybe that's why I'm not tired of it yet.

As for editing, I've noticed some inconsistencies i made the author aware of, but compared to all the lackluster fanfics out there, I would gave more than 7. I feel like most fanfic are a 3 to 5/10, often because they either are correctly written or have interesting plot.

PoS having both make me automatically give at least a 7. With the world building added, I go up to 8-9 depending on how it will go. I'd like to have more moral dilemmas or debate around the ethics of magic and power in general, so it's not a 10.. yet.

*** I like it, even tho it's incredibly long, the author is at over a million words and hasn't even started 4th year. It does a really good job of challenging the tropes that fanfic writers usually follow. The author also has included a lot of worldbuilding, and finds interesting ways to explain all the events in canon that don't quite make sense, without just going "hey dumbledore is evil".

So, if you got time give it a read. It's still being updated.

*** I've just looked at the first chapter and it seems to have all the WBWL red flags for me, so your calling it mediocre doesn't look that far off. Pity, I'm looking for a good long read.

**** That's... kinda the point. I've read it through once, and am reading it again. The author said, multiple times, that his point of writing this was to challenge the normal WBWL tropes, and to do that, he needs to establish them first.

** Not only reading but making as well,

my own Fic- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13752653/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Mirrored-Fates]]

Pretty much a Harry Potter where the horcrux does more than just be there, it can manipulate Harry and talk to his mind. Harry practically has a alter ego where Tom Riddle becomes Harry Potter and he is much stronger magically and is more aggressive. However, once Harry goes back to normal he will have repercussions so it's not some op hacks that quick.

*** There's not really much to comment on so far, except you seem to have a character called Pete at St Peter's Orphanage, run by Mrs Peters. Bit of a fixation on the name Peter there... And a boy named Esther?
