I am quite surprised by this character popularity in fanfiction. I have only seen movie. even though I haven't read novels I am quite confident in my knowledge about the world and the characters in harry potter. But the character daphane Green grass stood out from rest. I couldn't find much information about her so I was wondering why was she so popular in fanfiction. I mean i know this is kind of dumb question I know its all upto authors imagination. but does novel go deeper into her character.

And if you don't mind drop some good harry/daphane fanfiction


** Nope, she exists, and that's it. She's a literal blank slate, the only canon facts about her are that she's female, in Harry's year, and a Slytherin, so writers can do whatever the hell they want with her and not be out of character, because she has no character to be out of.

**** Some guy thought he was being clever when he did it first, a bunch of others also thought he was clever and copied him. So many people copied that first guy that a bunch of other people started writing her that way because they thought it was canon.

** Daphne greengrass is a popular pairing for a lot of reasons

She is a blank slate, so there really is no wrong way to write her. She's a Slytherin girl, which opens up a LOT of different story types (harry falls for a death eater, daphne gets used to get to harry by death eaters, harry can get seduced to the death eaters, she can be a good girl in a bad house, she can bring in politics that other girls wouldn't bring in simply because slytherin house is almost always more political, she lends herself very well to 'gray' harry fics, she allows for tropes outside of what your standard Gryffindor girl pairing will give you etc.

A lot of stories have her as an ice queen because honestly, those stories can be really fun to read and she fills that role well as canon and fanon didn't really have a dedicated ice queen type girl.

Personally, daphne is my favorite pairing, and she is the girl that is being paired with harry in the fanfic that I am writing

**** These are ranked in order of my favorites:

Harry black series (google harry black book 1, 2, 3, 4) book 4 is currantly a WIP (really good, prob my favorite, too much to describe here, just read them)

The legacy prevention act (really, really good marriage contract)

Second chances series' (second chances, congregation of the asp, horcrux three) (instead of big bad harry, you have mildly talented harry who depends on daphne's family to bring down voldemort as a family)

Angry harry and the seven (another marriage contract. James signed a marriage contract with daphne's dad when they were drunk because sirius suggested it)

Living dangerously series (living dangerously, living in secret, still waiting on the final story to come out) (this one has daphne being forced by her father to join the death eaters even though she loves harry, she betrays the death eaters eventually to join the order but it takes a while)

There's more I'm just not remembering off the top of my head

My own fic is still very early. It will be a long fic spanning years 4,5,6 and about a year or so of open warfare between voldemort and Europe. No horcruxes, no prophesies. James and lilly were death eaters who turned on voldemort and bound a big portion of his power through blood magic when malfoy convinced voldemort that they were turning on him. It killed his parents and left him as an orphan. He is unpopular because of all this on both sides of the political isle instead of being the popular chosen one. Will be slow burn harry daphne. It's also Slytherin harry with mentor snape)

******** Tbd. Fic names are really important, and as such, I'm not rushing on choosing a title for the fic. There's a real chance that I won't fully decide on a title until I'm ready to start posting chapters, which will likely be within a month if I continue writing at my currant pace

This is the only mention of Daphne Greengrass in Canon. It doesn't give us reader anything outside of her name (and gender I guess). With time, things like Rowling Interviews and Pottermore (what I would call the extended Canon) gave us a bit more informations about her: She was a Slytherin, Pureblood, part of Pansy's gang, she had a little sister would would eventually marry Draco before dying young . . .\\
But the point remain that, outside of having a cool name, Daphne is popular because she is a blank slate.

People on this sub love to debate about the natures of the Canon character., you just have to look about some of the old "discussion" to notice this. Just try to say that Ron was an useless idiot that did not deserve Harry and you will see a bunch of guy jumping in to defend his character (me included to be honest). And the same thing would happen anytime someone talk about the talent of Hermione, Dumbledore's treatment of Harry, or the 2 cans of worms that are Snape and Draco (petty asshole and little nazi, or unsung hero and poor kid?).

By her nature, Daphne Greengrass is totally free of all these discussions. The "Ice Queen" persona may be predominant when reading about Daphne Greengrass, but unlike other, there are no "correct" (or rather "canon") way to write her. She can be attractive or plain, talented or stupid, blood purist or not, the choice is yours. And this liberty made it popular with author.

Another reason for Daphne popularity is that she fills a previously empty niche: the "Slytherin Love Interest". Before her, Fanfictions didn't really have any "neutral" character in Slytherin to pair with Harry. Pansy Parkinson was too close to Draco, Milicent Bulstrode too ugly (I honestly can't think of any other reason to not have her become a love interest, since she is very similar to Daphne outside of that), and Fem! Blaise kinda died when HBP confirmed him as a boy. As mentioned by MidgardWyrm, having the Love Interest in Slytherin opens a lot of new doors when it comes to plot (from Harry's corruption to the Dark Side, to some Cursed Lover and with the usual Political/ Lords fics), and Daphne is the perfect character to introduce Harry to these aspects that are unexplored in Canon.

​

In the end, Daphne is popular because she manages to both be a blank slate and fill an empty niche. Personally, I am a bit disappointed that with all the story about her, most of them always show the same "Ice Queen" (that I'm not a fan of), and I do wish that more stories paired Harry with other Slytherins that could also make some pretty interesting story (give me more Tracey Davies damnit, the Half Blood girl surrounded by blood purist).

** There are only a few known facts for Daphne:

1. She's a Slytherin
2. She's in the main characters' year
3. Her sister, two years younger and also a Slytherin, went on to marry Malfoy, have a kid, and then die from a blood curse
4. Astoria is said to have held her family's bigoted views until the War changed her -- it was a point of contention between her and her in-laws
5. This implies that Daphne and her family, by the time of her being at Hogwarts, were also bigoted
6. She hung around with Pansy
7. She's a pureblood
8. When the series was being developed, she was originally known as "Queenie"
9. ...And that's all, IIRC.

Some say that Chloe Rich played her as a background character, but she could have played any of the other "unknown", older Slytherins that don't have a set appearance to them (e.g. Pansy, Millicent) as we know their actresses, such as Tracey Davis.

For various reasons, people latched onto her because she's a blank slate they can use for various stories (like a "good Slytherin, non-slash romance for Harry), though a few details later contradicted the fanon portrayal of her when CC came out (from knowing stuff about Astoria).

The blonde hair, blue eyes thing? Probably lifted directly from Chloe Ric herself, even though her general appearance could be different from fic-to-fic.

Daphne was named after a Greek mythological nymph character that was persuaded by Apollo (read: He wanted to own and rape her), so that probably factored into a characterization of the usual contention with Malfoy thing (who wants to own her as a girlfriend or wife, in a lot of stories).

Anyway, whatever plans JKR had for Daphne/"Queenie", none came to fruition.
