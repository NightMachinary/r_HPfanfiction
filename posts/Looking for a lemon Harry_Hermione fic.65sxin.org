Hi there, im trying to find a fic whose link i have lost. From what i remember, it consists of hermione using a magical ritual to turn herself into a willing slave of Harry. There was also a spirit in the book she consulted egging her on and showing her the ropes. I think i also stumbled acroos this fic here in this subreddit, but i cannot find the original thread.

Thanks guys for any assistance u can offer

  Set in the Goblet of Fire, Harry and Hermione each have a strange awakening after a demonstration of the Unforgivable Curses during that fateful Defense Against the Dark Arts class. How different is a Harry Potter with one deviant obsession, a twisted kink? Perhaps not at all, or perhaps incredibly so in the most meaningful of ways. Webs of pairings centered around Harry.
