I've read a couple fics with this trope (Lithium, Hit The Ground Running, Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux): either the horcrux in Harry's head "wakes up" and starts talking to him or Harry somehow gets ahold of Tom Riddle's diary and develops a relationship with Voldemort that way. Slash is fine.


** Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge).

Possibly my favorite iteration of this idea, has the horcrux be like a sixty year old mature version of Tom Riddle.

*** Also, Abraxas linkffn(Abraxas).

The short version is the horcrux heard the prophecy too from Dumbledore, and so made a deal during the summer of 6th year with him: merge their souls in order to increase their chance of survival and Riddle tells him where the other horcruxes are (it is Voldemort, survival is kind of his overall goal).

This fic takes a right heel turn like you wouldn't believe about 2/3 of the way through. Decent, but can be a bit tropey.

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.

***** To be a bit more clear than [[/u/ikallright][u/ikallright]]: Harry and co. win the war, but this proves to be the final straw for elements of the muggle governments of the world. Almost instantly, world-wide, they launch combined military assaults on the wizarding world. Millions die before the magical world get its shit together (nukes are pretty effective) and fights back. Its pretty brutal and comes to a dark, though hopeful, conclusion.

******* There aren't many stories that really display a magical/muggle world war, so its interesting if nothing else.

Seriously, at different points things like this happen:

- A submarine gets captured and destroyed by a team of mermaids
- Muggles assault Gringotts with special forces; they use anti-tank weapons on the dragons
- Harry gets named head of the resistance army over all of Britain
- Arthur gets in a drunken rant and starts killing muggles

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** [The Soul Within by TheFlowerOfTheCourt](m.fanfiction.net/s/10236556/1/The-Soul-Within)

Summary: The blood protection inside of Harry blocked His killing curse and burned His host body to ashes, yet failed to stop His soul from entering his body? Oh wait, it didn't! Harry's blood protection fights against Voldemort's soul and something new is created...a new soul and companion. Harry thinks it is unfair that she doesn't have a body of her own...well he is going to change that!
