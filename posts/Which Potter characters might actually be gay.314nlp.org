Motivated by the day and a side comment in the [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/30vf3b/does_this_bother_anyone_else/]['No homo, but not because it's wrong']] thread...

#+begin_quote
  Considering none of the HP characters, barring Dumbledore, are gay...
#+end_quote

I present the wholly inappropriate and intended to be humorous gaydar discussion:

Using canon events, author statements and literary instincts to support your claim, which Potter characters could be gay? (I'd use the Kinsey scale but that would require too much added explanation)

To kick us off:

- Albus Dumbeldore - Gay - not only is it canon, but the man was a walking animated dress factory from the first moment we see him. You may say that I'm referencing old stereotypes, but so does he- Albus was born before the turn of the century

- Gellert Grindelwald - Gay - implied to some extent due to Albus' keen interest in their... deep discussions

- Tonks - Bisexual - a shapeshifter is thematically unconcerned with appearance, plus she's just so very joyful

- Lupin - likely Bisexual, though his gay vibe is partly from his backstory symbolising an AIDS sufferer in the workplace

- Charlie Weasley - Gay - no known girlfriends, gives up the shallow rockstar life of a Quidditch career to follow his passion, all the way to Eastern Europe

- Gwenog Jones - Gay -didn't spare any affection or decency for a wizard's public marriage proposal; she knocked him in the head

... for that matter, any of the Holyhead Harpies might be gay or bisexual...

... including Ginny - sure, she married Harry and dated a bunch of boys, but she was recruited and accepted by the Harpies, whom she already favored and was a fan of Gwenog as well.

On the Het side...

- Harry Potter - Het - sorry kids; he was facinated by Cho, appreciative of Parvati and of Hermione in her dress, blushed when encountering Tonks and fell hard for Ginny. He also was subject to Veela allure- he just didn't succumb to acts of foolishness like Ron did

- Severus Snape - Het - again, sorry; the man dedicated his whole life to honouring the memory of the only girl who gave him a chance at friendship. Even if he had screwed other women or men to dull the pain, he was Lily-sexual to his last bog-stenchy breath

- Hermione Granger - Het - this girl was entirely too torqued up by Ron's dalliances, even while being woo'd by a sports star to have gotten any sympathy from girlfriends. Then again, she and Ginny were close friends- she may have sampled from the fruit tray

Your turn!


** I once read a hilarious /Death Note/ crackfic where the protagonist became aroused only when he gained new knowledge. It'd be kind of funny if Tom Riddle /literally/ lusted after knowledge, and nothing else--he'd be a kind of Orochimaru, salivating over the opportunity to learn every spell in the world with the immortality that his Horcruxes gave him. (Alternatively, it'd fit pretty well as an alternative "Dark Ravenclaw" path for a non-canon Dumbledore, if you remember that set of ideas from /Partially Kissed Hero/'s random brainstorms.)

** To be fair, I think Charlie Weasley might have been asexual. Seem to remember JKR saying that he just loved dragons far too much for anything else :P

I always imagined Professor Sprout being non-heterosexual for some reason... and Slughorn too, actually.

** It's fitting symbolism that Snape had a doe as his patronus. But closerpants explanation that he secretly lusted after James is intriguing.

I mean, Lily never cast a patronus right? And while JKR probably drew the connection that Snape's would take a form that complemented James but was 'fixed' on the object of his desires, it is wholly strange that his patronus took the female form of James' animagus form.

But that also begs the question had Snape witnessed James transfigure into one.

So it can be stretched to say that Snape actually lusted/loved James, didn't know how to reconcile that and just went with the idea of Lily because it made sense.

I certainly agree Snape is het, but one could make a case for him not being. Or bi at the least.

** I think Lockhart is gay. Do I need to explain?

I think Delores Umbridge is sexually attracted to her job/power/influence. Her actions in book 5 to Harry seem like a crazy jealous ***** going after the other woman. Her actions in book 7 are her trying to cement the relationship.

** I disagree with the Harpies thing. You give evidence for everyone else; where's your evidence for them? (And if you say it's because they're the only all female team in England, you might want to take a look at the Slytherin Quidditch team and wonder about their sexual orientation.) That said, I'm all for gay Gwenog Jones and bisexual Ginny. (I am /all over/ bisexual ginny.)

Luna - pansexual. She has no known school time relationships, is more open minded than her peers, and heavily interested in things beyond the norm. I think Luna woudn't even notice gender as a thing; her attraction is to people with interesting minds.

I also disagree on Harry. Searching all seven books for the words "pretty" "handsome" and "beaut" (to get beautiful/beauty) I found 30 instances describing female characters, and 23 describing male. (From Harry's POV, obviously; I ignored instances of other characters describing.) I think that makes a decent argument for bisexual Harry.

I don't think Charlie's gay - I think he's asexual. JKR has said Charlie's more interested in studying dragons than anything else. Asexual Voldemort as well - he's way more interested in world dominance than sex.

Teddy Lupin - he's a metamorphmagus too, so same reasoning as Tonks

Hence why I was asking OP for their evidence...

I'd say perhaps 2 or 3 of the female descriptions are romantic and the rest male and female aren't, which I suppose from your POV supports the idea of straight-Harry on the basis of canon-only relationships, but this is a thread for our opinions based on "literary instincts" and mine interpret those descriptions as implying Harry is just as easily attracted to men as women.

*** Evidence on the Harpies wasn't needed, as I merely suggested they might be. I'm close to convinced Gwenog is girl-friendly and allergic to romantic gestures from guys.

I'm tossed on Luna - love the girl, but she's like, perpetually twelve. Fanon reinterpretation likes to ascribe her open-mindedness as also open-relationship-ness, but she marries later in life when she finally finds a kindred soul in creature-hunting, subsequently popping out two sprogs as if she hadn't even realized that she was a sexual being as well.

(A darker thought relates to her imprisonment at Malfoy Manor, but her spirit seemed entirely unaffected by the experience)

I can accept bisexual Harry based on the evidence presented. Still don't see him knocking boots with Snape or Voldemort.

*** Harry is definitely, 100%, hetero. He doesn't ever actually compliment a guys looks, let alone feel any kind of attraction, the only instances are like the introduction of Cedric; i.e. Harry mentioning that many girls are attracted to him and that *they* think he's handsome, or offhandedly commenting that Bill is good looking, objectively speaking. There's really no room for interpretation here and it doesn't matter how much truth some people want to see in their fanon fantasies, Harry is hetero. In fact he's the only character where we can be absolutely sure that this is the case, without any doubt.

** In the tongue-in-cheek sense of the OP:

What's in a name (besides sexual orientation)?

Female characters with a last name that evokes penises, erections, and/or sex are obviously butch:

Gwenog, Megan, and Hestia Jones; Angelina Johnson; Luna Lovegood; Nagini; Moaning Myrtle

Female characters who are named after flowers (Lily, Narcissa, Fleur, etc.) evoke female genitalia and thus are attracted to women (obviously).

Don't get me started on Flitwick (bent as a butcher's hook).

** I've always viewed Charlie as Ace, given his lack of interest in everyone.

I can see a bisexual repressed Harry, given who his POV sees as attractive, and given that he's from such a normative background--it's entirely possible that if he does have those feelings, he rejects them on instinct because of growing up with the Dursleys.

I definitely back the 'Tonks is a shapeshifter and everyone is fair game' theory.

I kind of feel like Bellatrix was an ace with a pain kink rather than gendered attraction.

** Oh my! I inspired a thing! XD

I still don't think there's any evidence that anyone besides Dumbledore (and implied/by extension, Grindelwald) is gay, though I would probably believe Luna is something other than heterosexual /or/ homosexual just because I can't see her limiting herself like that. I imagine she'd think it's silly. Either that or she'd be asexual because she just wouldn't understand what the big deal is when there are important things like nargles to worry about.

Wait! There's a third clique- the meta-sexuals, who see sex with other creatures as gross, so they rely solely on spell-induced stimulation. They make love to/with their magic (and no, it's not the same as masturbation, I swear on Tesla's coils!)
