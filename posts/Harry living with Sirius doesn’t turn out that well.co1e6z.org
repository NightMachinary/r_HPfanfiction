I've read lots of fics where Harry goes to live with Sirius and everything is hunky dory, but never any where it isn't. Are there any fics out there where Sirius is either mentally wounded from his time as a prisoner or his views are a bit more pureblod oriented than Harry is comfortable with? Or ones where Harry disagrees with Sirius for any other reason?

Any pairing is ok, but no slash for Harry please.

Thanks.


** Hmm, there's linkffn(the lost ones by little.acatalepsy)

It might not fit your request in that Sirius is still a competent father figure and they have a better parent/child relationship than in canon even, but he's really traumatized by his time in Azkaban in this one and trying to raise a young Harry.

Watching this thread to see if you get any others that are more on point...

  Proven innocent years after his conviction, Sirius is thrown into a world that has moved on without him. Amidst mending his own broken life, he becomes the guardian of his neglected godson and struggles to unravel the disappearance of his only remaining friend. All the while, a mysterious darkness lurks in the shadows, slowly corrupting the Wizarding World's facade of peace...

** There was a story where Sirius is liberated for some reasons, and he then fights for getting his foster rights as a godfather of Harry, but he is still struggling with his own psychical instability after living with dementors for so many years. He has many creative wild ideas and in the end one gets Harry almost killed, and only then Sirius agrees to some psychotherapeutic treatment. Unfortunately, I have completely forgot the name of the story.

** How screwed up do you want it?

Also the time period?

I'd argue in 1981, Sirius would be ideal. They'd have their problems, but he doesn't have azkaban to deal with. There's a couple of stories already listed here that deal with child soldier Harry because of the prophecy.

After Azkaban, it probably wouldn't be perfect, but as you see in OOTP, Sirius tries hard. He might not be all there, but he would be much better than the Dursley's. Some stories have shades of this, but either have Gary Stu Sirius, or a Harry that becomes a child.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9766604/1/][*/What We're Fighting For/*]] Has some of this, but you only really see the aftermath. Sirius keeps Harry instead of giving him up to Hagrid and raises him himself. Knowing the prophecy he trains Harry to be a soldier and completely forgets to let him be a child. 15 years later Harry doesn't understand basic emotions and speaks in a dull monotone. This is where our story begins, Sirius sends Harry to hogwarts to try to give him the childhood he missed.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
