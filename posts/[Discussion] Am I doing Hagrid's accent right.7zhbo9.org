I know that Hagrid's phonetic accent is one of those /things/ that are so hard to do for fanfiction writers, but feel lazy or weird /not/ to do. I recently featured Hagrid in my latest chapter. Here's a sample

#+begin_quote
  “Who did'is to ye?” he was muttering to the snake. “Who'd hurt a real beauty like yeh? Here, here... ol'Hagrid'll fix yeh up, don't fuss...”

  “Is... is he going to be alright?” Hermione asked.

  “Aye, I think so,” he answered. “'m pretty good at fixing ‘em reptiles up... ‘tll take a bit o'work though. That's seriously dark magic right here, this wound, yeh know.”
#+end_quote

So just tell me right now, is this acceptable, or am I being completely ridiculous?


** Well enough, I think. It would probably be "Who did this ter yeh" but whatever.

Here's a guide.

** Yeah, that's actually pretty good! ye should always be yeh though, because ye creates a sound more similar to a Yorkshire accent. I also can't remember if Hagrid says aye in canon or if it's a fanon thing - for me it's more of a northern thing, but it also wouldn't be out of place for a west country person to say I suppose.

**** Hmm, I dunno, the way his accent is written he seems to miss the t's on a lot of words. A Yorkshire accent has a lot of hard t's. I think it's safe to say, given his inspiration, he has a thick West Country accent.

** [[/u/AutumnSouls]] gave you the guide, so that's probably all you need. I just wanted to add -- Hagrid wouldn't say "aye". That's more of a Northern thing.

Thanks for taking the time to get it right! It's one of those things that's so much work, but pays off!
