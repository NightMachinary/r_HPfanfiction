:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read this fic years and years ago. It was a vampire!Harry fic, and I mostly just remember this one scene where Harry had essentially been found out and people were trying to kill him because vampires are straight up monsters sort of thing. I vaguely remember some sort of cross being involved, possibly a crucifixion of Harry himself to expose him to sunlight, at Hogwarts. He then somehow broke free and basically annihilated a lot of people. I think Dumbledore might have been one of the baddies, and potentially was killed by Harry. I also remember that Harry was fast to the point of it almost being as good as teleportation. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks!


** Sounds like a helluva fic, I wanna read it now

  When Harry is bitten by a vampire will he finally learn what the 'Power-He-Knows-Not' really is? M for Violence and Language.
