** ‘You look very serious, Hugo,' said Harry, as his nephew marched towards him.

'I made this,' said Hugo, in a business-like manner. He planted a spell-o-taped booklet in front of Harry.

THE BIOGRAFY OF HARRY POTTER

'Ah, brilliant,' said Harry. 'I've been wanting one of these.'

With an extremely determined look on his face, Hugo turned the first page for him, where Harry saw an explosion of colour, stick figures, shaky lines and a poorly written story cramped into any white space. 'This is when you killed Voldemort the first time,' said Hugo matter-of-factly. 'Those are your parents, on the floor.'

'Oh, Christ, Hugo,' said Ron suddenly.

'Wow, that's a lot of blood,' said Harry.

Hugo nodded, and turned the page again, completely oblivious to Harry's silent laughter. 'This is your family saying they don't like you-'

'Right, Hugo,' said Ron hastily, leaning forward and grabbing the book as Harry let out a bark of laughter. 'Why don't you wait until this evening and show Mummy this, eh? Get her approval before you show Uncle Harry

It's hard to tell from just a summary, or even a recommendation, whether a certain fic would be your cup of tea. This gave me such better insights than I normally have, skimming through a request thread.

** Fred and George arrive at Hogwarts and ask their brother for advice:

“How would one go about manipulating a professor into handing out a pass to the Restricted Section of the library?”

Charlie bristled his orange eyebrows at them. “Is this about pranking Rowle?”

“Pranking?”

“What's that?”

“This is an unfamiliar vocabulary word.”

“Since we're just wee ickle firsties.”

Charlie sighed. “Professor Trelawney is your easiest target. Bribe her with a bottle of sherry. I can get it in Hogsmeade next weekend. You'd better pay me back though.”

“Of course,” they said, figuring they could sell the schoolbooks they weren't using much anyway.

“We also have one itsy bitsy favor to ask you.”

“We'll need you to steal a few potion ingredients from Snape's stores.”

“What?”

“Oh, and we'll also need to borrow your girlfriend.”

“You can't borrow a person!”

Good, he hadn't objected to the theft, which meant he'd agreed. “Why not?”

“Because... Because she's a person, is why not. You can just ask her. I'm sure she'd love to help. She's no fan of Rowle. He called her a... a bad word.”

“She certainly isn't a bad word.”

“She isn't a word at all.”

“She's a person, isn't she?”

“That's what I heard.”

“I forget where I heard it, though.”

“Maybe she really is a word.”

“Charlie, do you often find her on the tip of your tongue?”

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape has been waiting for this opportunity since the term began. It's made him almost happy to have such a simple, delightful plan lurking in the back of his thoughts.

  Lupin is “ill,” and Snape has Lupin's Defence Against the Dark Arts students all perched warily in front of him. He's had time to plot; he knows exactly how to proceed.

  Words have always been his favorite weapons.

   “Now. Which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?” Snape asks, while pretending to study the projected image in front of him. He doesn't expect an answer, not from a class that has yet to study either subject.

  Well. Unless it's Granger.

  “An Animagus learns it. A werewolf is bitten.”

  It isn't Granger.

  Snape turns back around to regard Harry Potter, who still has his nose in his third year textbook. Granger is beaming at Potter, who doesn't seem to notice.

  Snape wants it to gall him. He wants to accuse Potter of cheating, or Granger of whispering the answer he knows he didn't hear.

  Instead, Snape asks, “And how do you know that, Mister Potter?”

  “I read everything.” Potter still hasn't looked up. “This textbook is complete rubbish, by the way.”

  Weasley gasps and turns a shade redder than his usual. “Harry!” he hisses in warning.

  “You would be correct,” Snape says in response to both statements, watching with amusement as Weasley promptly turns white. All of that blood rushing back and forth cannot possibly be healthy.

  “I don't see why we're bothering with this, anyway,” Potter continues. Weasley begins to look faint. “We already know that Professor Lupin's a werewolf.”

  Snape twitches. He simply cannot help it. “What?” It's his least brilliant retort in twelve years.

  Potter looks up. “Well, it's obvious, isn't it?” He still has that same unconcerned, emotionless look on his face. “Besides, who cares? He's made a point of not eating any of us.”

  This is a mixed class of all Houses, which means Snape can gain insight from four different perspectives. For the most part, the Gryffindors are nodding. The Ravenclaws look sanguine. The Hufflepuffs don't seem to have an opinion one way or the other. His Slytherins appear to be unconcerned, which tells Snape that even they must have had some advance notice.

  There are a few white faces (strangely, not Weasley now) and nervous, darting eyes, but otherwise, the uproar is nonexistent.

  They knew already. They all knew.

  Harry Potter has just sabotaged Snape's revenge so perfectly that it couldn't have gone better if Snape had planned it himself.

  /Gilderoy Lockhart,/ Snape seethes, /if you weren't already dead, I'd kill you myself./

This is the only excerpt I still remember even after reading a few hundreds other fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  James stepped up to his parents, stood between them, and pulled their hands apart. They made him fight to do it, but he determinedly untangled their intertwined fingers, placed himself between them, and held both their hands.

  'I told Ginny that nothing and no one would ever come between us.' Harry was smiling as he spoke. 'It seems I was wrong.'

  Ginny ruffled their son's hair affectionately.

  'That was definitely the weirdest class I've ever had,' said Ron, when the three of them were back in the common room Wednesday evening. 'Did /you/ understand what Snape was going on about?'

  'Not a word,' said Harry. 'That book he was reading from must've been written in America, though - they had a Congress instead of a Parliament. Right, Hermione?'

  'Yes, in America they call their Parliament, "Congress",' said Hermione.

  'I know /that/,' said Ron. 'What'd you make of the rest of the story?'

  'I - we didn't read it,' said Hermione. 'You must've had a different lesson.'

  'What did you do, then?' said Ron.

  'Oh ...' said Hermione vaguely, 'Madam Pomfrey showed us how to make a potion.'

  'You made a potion?' said Ron. 'You should've had Snape, then, not us - he's the Potions master.'

  Hermione, suddenly quite busy rummaging in her bag, made no reply.

  'What kind of potion did you make?' said Harry curiously.

  Hermione looked around to make sure no one else was listening. 'A potion to prevent pregnancy,' she said, sounding rather embarrassed.

  'Hermione, you're fourteen,' Ron laughed. 'You're too young to get pregnant.'

  'I'm not, actually,' said Hermione. 'Not that I'd do something that stupid ...' Clearly eager to change the subject, she said, 'So - tell me about that book Snape read to you. What was it called?'

  '/The Slytherin Kama Sutra/,' said Harry. 'Most of it didn't make much sense, but there was a Congress in it - the Congress of the Basilisk and the Chamber of Secrets ...'

  "This has all been kinda stupid hasn't it?" She asked looking at James. He met her eyes.

  "Yeah." He said with a sigh and leaned back. They descended into an awkward silence. They peeked at one another, each checking to make sure the other wasn't going to break the unofficial ceasefire. James covertly sniffed the air trying to get a good read on her now that Katie seemed calmer.

  She didn't have that bothersome smell on her that Neville had. Instead, she still smelled embarrassed, and something else was leaking in?

  "Do you-" James started, stopping when her eyes snapped to him. He swallowed and gathered his courage. "Do you want to start over?"

  Katie's lips quirked slightly; then she let out a little chuckle. "Okay."

  James stood slowly slipping his wand into its holster on his hip. Katie followed suit, hers disappearing up her sleeve. Holding out a hand James introduced himself. "Good Afternoon, I'm James Lupin."

  Katie took his hand, gripping it tightly. She was willing to try burying the hatchet, but she wasn't exactly willing to forgive him after the day she had.

  "Hello James. I am Katie Bell. Nice to meet you. How are you today?" She said stiffly. James held his forced smile as she tried to ratchet up the pressure on his hand. He returned as good as he got.

  "Oh, well enough. Lunch was interesting as I am sure you saw. Potions was much quieter than usual. My herbology partner gave me the most cryptic of warnings. Oh, and I did something to Professor Binns that seem to have maybe kinda 'woke' him up." James replied. "You?"

  Katie was nodding along politely until the last thing he said. "Umm, what was that about Professor Binns?"

  "Well it's like this," James began. He regaled her the recent happening of the Hogwart's History Professor. If she was listening to a story she wasn't attacking him, so he figured it was a win/win in the end.

  When he finished she just looked at him awestruck. Well, she was gaping like a fish. Her jaw worked up and down but no sounds came out. After a few seconds, she finally found her voice.

  "ARGGG! Of all the. What possessed you, a third year, to cast a NEWT level charm against a teacher!"

  "What? I was bored and working on compulsion charms cut into my exorcism research." James replied evenly. Katie glared at the mention of compulsion charms.

  "Exorcism? Are you saying that you were thinking of exorcising a Professor at the oldest, safest, best magical school in Europe?" Katie asked after a face palm. "Why?" She whined.

  "Because he wasn't teaching and History is supposed to be fun," James replied seriously.

  "You know what!" Katie said, straightening her robes. "I am out of here." She was out the door and on her way before James could say anything else. With her gone, James slumped into a chair and took a deep breath.

  That was one issue done with, and it only took a week. Ha, who said problems couldn't be solved with violence. Sure it hadn't been gratuitous violence, but it still took a fight to fix everything. Okay, maybe not everything.

  Granny glared at the letter. It seemed to get even more offensive than it had been when she first read it, and that was saying quite a lot. Typical wizard behavior, foisting responsibility upon unsuspecting witches and leaving babies with naught but a note to their name.

  And this baby was magic too. No doubt he'd grow up and become a wizard and take on too many names and invent some ridiculous titles for himself and start throwing orphans hither and yon without a care.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

** A few non-spoilery excerpts from [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/][Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay]]

1:

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes, Harry wondered if perhaps his home life was a little bit odd, but it was a little hard to tell. Yes, he hadn't met any other dragons, and he could vaguely remember having not been a dragon at some point, but he'd almost never run into anybody who was the vaguest bit surprised. So perhaps he was a special kind of normal which everyone was used to?

  He certainly wasn't like the dragons in the stories in the school library, either. Those dragons were usually big and scary and liked carrying off Princesses and stealing gold, and when they didn't do that and were nice they still grew up very quickly -- but Harry was almost eleven, and he was still smaller than his cousin who wasn't even a dragon. He was like those story-book dragons because he liked to live in a lair, perhaps, but it was only the cupboard under the stairs.

  As he thought about what they might be doing in school today -- it was very nearly the end of their time at primary school, and that meant they might be allowed to do what they wanted -- Harry absently ate the eggshells from the fried eggs he'd made, then tipped the eggs onto plates along with rashers of bacon and slices of toast.

  Balancing one plate on his back and the other two on his wings, he made his way into the dining room and slid all three onto the table.

  "Hm," Aunt Petunia said. "Don't forget to do extra for Dudley, he's a growing boy."

  Harry couldn't dispute that -- his cousin had certainly been growing for years, mostly outwards. So he nodded, furling his wings in case he knocked anything over. "Yes, Aunt Petunia. Is it all right if I open another packet of bacon?"

  "Of course you should open another packet if there's not enough in the open one!" she told him sharply. "Now hurry up!"

  "Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"

  Harry frowned briefly, then reached for his One Thousand Magical Herbs And Fungi. Flipping through to the end of the A section, he located Asphodel and scanned the page.

  "I think it's a powerful sleeping potion called the Draught of Living Death, but I'd have to double-check to make sure," he answered.

  Professor Snape frowned.

  "Close that book, Potter, I'm not testing your ability to look things up," the Professor said, and Harry did so promptly.

  "Harry!" one of them said.

  "Just the person we wanted to see," the other continued.

  "Do you think you could help us with something?"

  The second one held up a red envelope. "I don't suppose you'd be willing to deal with this?"

  "By which we mean eat this."

  "Our dear mother gets very uptight about things."

  "Even when we've been punished for them already."

  Harry felt like he was watching a tennis game.

  "How are you doing that?" he asked, as the envelope began to emit curls of smoke.

  "Don't have time for that now," said the one not holding the envelope, picking up a pepper grinder and grinding some over the smoking envelope. "You could really help us out."

  "Just dispose of this for us."

  "It should be a snap."

  "I think it's a good idea, Harry," Percy said, surprising Harry. "My brothers have broken the rules, but they deserve detention -- not public humiliation."

  "We're just thinking of the children," said George, or possibly Fred.

  "Don't want them deafened," George, or perhaps Fred, agreed.

  Harry opened his mouth to ask, but the letter was starting to curl up at the edges now. George held it out, Harry got slightly confused, and in a moment the letter was going down his throat.

  A few tense seconds passed in silence, as the Weasleys waited with bated breath -- along with Neville, while Hermione and Dean just looked confused.

  There was a faint tickling in Harry's stomach, but nothing that seemed important.

  "Phew," George said (Harry had decided to call them both George unless something changed). "Thanks, Harry."

  Harry tried to say it was nothing, but what came out was a magically enhanced shout. "DISRESPECTING A-"

  His glasses went bouncing away across the floor as he shut his mouth with a snap.

  "Mm?" he asked.

  "It's a Howler," Ron supplied. "It's a magical letter that shouts at the person who gets it."

  "TOLD YOU-" Harry bellowed, then decided to just hold his mouth shut until the conversation was over.

  "Mum loves sending them whenever we do something wrong," George supplied. "And normally there's no way out of it, we just let them run. But since you're around..."

  "They sound unpleasant," Hermione frowned. "Why doesn't she just tell you off in a normal letter?"

  "I bet it's just that it lets off steam," Dean suggested.

  George retrieved Harry's glasses, and George took them to hand off to Harry. "There you go. And, um... it should only take a few minutes until it stops."

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  "I'm sorry, I can't help you find your toad again today," Milo said irritably. While not strictly speaking true, any more and he'd be cutting into his emergency first-level spells. Milo never went anywhere without Feather Fall and Grease.

  Unfortunately, it was not the good-natured Longbottom boy standing in the doorway. A pale (one) blond (two) boy entered imperiously (and three! We have a recurring character). After a brief moment of shock upon hearing Milo's words, he apparently decided to completely ignore the young Wizard's existence.

  "Is it true?" the boy asked. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter is in this compartment. So it's you, is it?"

  "Yes," said Harry. Flanking the sneering boy were a pair of mooks.

  "Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," the boy said, although Milo wasn't sure why he bothered. Everything about them said mute NPC. "and my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."

  Ron sniggered slightly.

  "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are---" Draco paused, staring at Milo. The blood drained from his face, making him look, if it were possible, even paler.

  "You! I would have thought you'd be in hiding down the deepest, darkest hole you could find, after showing your face at my father's mansion. Well, Potter, I can see you've chosen your side already---a Weasley, a mudblood, and a dead man. I'd be careful, if I were you, or you might just wind up going the way of your parents." With that, Malfoy spun about on his heel and started to leave. Harry and Ron stood up, their faces livid. Hermione had tears in her eyes---apparently mudblood was some kind of insult. Maybe her ancestors were part dwarf, or something?

  "Either of you want to get him, or shall I?" Milo asked.

  Ron smirked slightly, but his fists were still held, his knuckles turning white. "Be my guest," he said through clenched teeth.

  "Grease," Milo muttered. The ground underneath Malfoy and his mooks became all-but frictionless. The results were fairly predictable, especially given that they were on a moving train.

  "You! You! When Father hears about this," Malfoy said, trying (and failing, quite hilariously, in fact) "he'll, he'll---gah!" the Hogwarts Express lurched around a corner, sending causing Crabbe to fall onto Malfoy again. Unfortunately, the spell only lasted for eighteen seconds. "You haven't seen the last of me!" Draco shouted, then stormed off, furiously.

  "Mate, forget everything I said about you being crazy. You are alright in my books," Ron said.

  "Same goes for me," said Harry. "Let's all hope for Gryffindor together. Are you alright, Hermione?" Harry asked the crying girl.

  "F-fine. I'm fine," she said.

  "What was that he called you, anyway?" Harry asked, confused.

  "Mudblood," Ron said. "It's a dire insult. It means someone whose parents weren't wizards. We'll get him back for that one."

  "I rather think we did already get him back," Milo said smugly.

  "Nah, that was just interest. We'll come and collect in full one day."

  "Hermione, I wouldn't worry about it," Harry said. "Nobody here cares whether or not your parents were Muggles."

  "Easy for you to say!" she shot back. "You're all, all purebloods!"

  "Hey, take it back!" Milo said. "There's not a drop of magical blood in my family."

  They all paused for a beat or three.

  "And---you're proud of that?" Ron asked.

  "Nine Hells, yeah. It means I'm a Wizard. I had to scrounge and work and fight tooth and nail for my magic. What do you take me for, a Sorcerer?" he asked. Hermione looked somewhat mollified (though confused), and gave him a brief, thankful look.

** “Sirius fumbled with the seat belt of his seat and glanced nervously out the window of the airplane, "Are you sure this is safe? How can this hunk of metal fly in the air?"

Judy snorted and swatted her "cousin" on the shoulder, "Relax, you're more likely to die in a No-Maj car than an airplane."

"No, you're kidding. This thing is safer than a car?" Sirius gaped. "How?"

"Don't ask me, I'm not a No-Maj engineer. Look it up when we're in New York." Judy replied, skimming through a book nonchalantly.

"I don't understand mug...No-Majs at all..."

To his left, Harry gave him a reassuring smile. "Don't worry, Cyrus. I'm sure we'll be fine!"

"Cyrus" smiled at his godson, who was reading a book of his own. The British wizard's name was changed on his government papers as a precaution, hence the name "Cyrus." The dark-haired man was still skinny and pale from his stay in Azkaban, but he was once again clean and shaven. His hair came down to his shoulders and was tied neatly into a ponytail. After several meals and a good night's sleep, his skin looked much more healthy. "Well, it won't be the same as riding a broom, but at least we'll get to see the sky."

"And unlike a broom, you'll be thirty thousand feet in the air instead of a hundred," Sam mumbled, sitting next to Harry.

Sirius paled and stared at the Auror Captain, "Did you just say thirty thousand feet? Is it too late to get off the plane? I think I'll take my chances in Britain, at least my feet will be on the ground."

-Excerpt from the end of Chapter 2 of. “A Yankee Wizard in a British Court.”

The fic will center around Harry growing up in America. Already, from the start, his life is changed significantly (should be fairly obvious from the excerpt). Magical America is strikingly different than Magical Britain, changing Harry's views and abilities significantly. As his power and acclaim grows, Harry will quickly find himself in the middle of a power play between Britain and America. With both nations seeking the loyalty of the Last Potter heir (for both Britain and America), Harry must learn to reconcile the two worlds as the Dark Lord continues to pursue after the Chosen One.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

** "That's just a story," Lucius said, stung. "It has no basis in fact."

It was, he immediately realized, a mistake.

"Fact," Silva repeated into the awful silence that followed. "Facts, my fine young Englishman, rarely, if ever have anything to do with truth."

"I..."

"Sit."

Lucius Malfoy sat, with a decidedly inelegant thud.  Silva sat opposite. His black eyes looked the young man before him over, up and down, lingering on the pale skin, the elegant, aristocratic cheekbones, the icy, shimmering loosed hair.

"The fact is that there are but a few sightings of lethifolds a year across the world," the priest said. "That fact would seem to indicate that this means that there are only a few lethifolds in existence. But we here in South America, and our brothers and sisters in Central America... We know the truth. We have nothing of the facts that your world requires to prove their presence here. To those who come and say 'show us'... We have nothing to show them but our empty hearts. We have nothing to show them but that which cannot be seen - that is: those who are no longer with us. Nothing to see, nothing to hold, nothing to touch...  What kind of proof is that, to those who were never here to see what was here before it was taken from us completely? No proof at all. And so when they leave, we are left alone twice over: over and over and over again, and again with none of the facts you demand, but only with what we know to be true."

Lucius clutched his new wand in his clumsy left fingers. His right hand lay uselessly on his knee.

"You did not come here to learn of religion," the priest continued. "But you have said yourself that it is here, across the world from everything that you have ever known, that you found the truth of what you have left behind. I want you to think about that, Senhor Malfoy. Here, you are nothing. Here, you have nothing. All that is familiar, comforting, proven... All that you know to be familiar fact... Is gone. And here you are, with only the one true thing that yet remains when all else that you have ever known has fallen away... Your instinctive knowledge of the existence of the acceptable light, and the correlative existence of its unacceptable opposite. Knowing this one true thing... Does it truly matter whether the story I told you just now is factually accurate? Is proof of its accuracy necessary in your understanding and acceptance of the essential truths that lie within?"

I'm actually pretty meh about the fic in general, but its development of Castelebruxo School and magical South America, with its horrific Lethifold problem and influence of Catholicism, was so gothic and beautiful in its sorrow. These segments were pretty regular, but were interludes rather than the focus of the fic.

** From the start of an old favourite of mine.

#+begin_quote
  "And what is your name, Apprentice?"

  Harry was still not entirely sure what that word meant, but he replied dutifully, "Harry Potter, sir." In this room now instead of in the middle of the play park, Harry got the sense that this man was to be respected.

  "Harry, then," said Petri, and Harry was not sure he was comfortable with the man using his first name, but he also was not comfortable bringing it up. "I have here the apprenticeship contract. I keep many copies. Otherwise I run out too quickly."

  At the time, Harry did not fully grasp the ominousness of this casual admission.

  He took the sheaf of unexpectedly thick and yellowy papers from Petri, and saw with consternation that even the writing was all nonsense. Harry was not very good at reading, but even he could tell that none of the words on the page were English.

  "Er, I can't read this, sir," he said, feeling a little stupid as he said it despite knowing that he wasn't meant to be able to read something like that.

  "Problematic. You must learn German as soon as possible," Petri said. Still, he flicked his hand and suddenly there was a stick in it, and with a flourish he tapped it against the paper.

  To Harry's astonishment, the words wriggled slightly and then transformed before his eyes. He looked more closely and could see that he knew most of them now.

  "What was that?" he asked.

  "Translation charm, obviously," Petri replied, though Harry could not see what was obvious about it. He had more questions, but could sense that Petri was impatient, and he knew from experience that impatient adults were not nice adults, so he tried to read the text instead.

  It was all very confusing, even if he knew the words, and before he had even made it through a third of the first page, a feather was forcefully shoved into his hands.

  "Just sign it," Petri said, clearly even more impatient than he had been before. "It's a standard apprenticeship contract. No tricks." As he spoke, he pulled the papers from Harry, shuffled them so that the bottom page was on top, and handed it back.

  Harry took them absently, staring in confusion at the feather in his hand, but he quickly realized that the bottom of it was thin and pointy, so it was probably a fancy pen.

  "It's a blood quill," Petri said, gesturing at the feather pen. "You need no other ink."

  Feeling trepidation but also pressure from Petri's clear irritation, Harry knelt down, set the papers on the ground, and pressed the nub of the "blood quill" to the line. As he drew the first vertical slash of his name, he gasped and discovered for himself just where the "blood" part of the name had come from.

  The red line that sliced like fire into the back of his hand disappeared as quickly as it had come, and Harry would have thought that he had daydreamed it, except that the spot still ached with echoes of the earlier pain.

  A vertical stroke glistened on the page in bright red beneath his quill.

  The casual prompt of "Go on," from Petri told Harry that this was apparently supposed to happen. Even he knew that there was something wrong with a pen that cut into the back of his hand, but he supposed that since the marks had vanished, it was fine to use. Bracing himself, he quickly wrote down the rest of his name in a sloppy cursive, like he had seen Uncle Vernon do with signatures. A stinging trail carved itself into the back of his hand, but when he inspected it he could see that it had healed perfectly, without even a trace.

  "Good," Petri said, finally sounding pleased.

Vernon Dursley liked to say his family was perfectly normal, thank you very much.

It was quite a shock when an old man in a robe came asking for his wife, more confusing still that he was here to inform her about the death of her sister.

"Petunia!" He called through the house. "It's one of them!" With the knowledge of what news was expected, he momentarily considered calling out a "Good news!" to excite her, but declined the opportunity for two reasons. Firstly, Petunia would hardly wish to seem indecorous, no matter who was the visitor, and he reasonably decided that revealing his expectation of her delight at the Potter woman's death would not be the height of decorum.

More importantly, when wizards came by, it was never really good news.

** In his fitful sleep, he saw James Potter.

“Are you happy now, Snivelly? Look at that, you got me after all. Are you proud of yourself?”

Fully aware that he was in a dream state and not dead, he begged the spirit of James Potter to leave him alone, at long last. But the spirit taunted him. “Why do you think that you deserve a friend? Look at you, still haven't learned to use shampoo after all these years? I guess you know who lets just about anyone join his little club.”

“I was her friend first, you arrogant bastard!” Snape shouted at his schooldays enemy.

“Yes, she told me all about your great friendship, /Sev/. The only reason she ever put up with you was because you were the only other wizard she knew, and then because she felt sorry for you! She was glad when you called her a mudblood, /Sev/, you gave her an excuse to stop talking to you!”

“No!” Severus shouted.

“Oh yes! She told me all about your parents and how you couldn't even get the Muggle to leave your mother alone... She deserved what happened to her, you know, she gave birth to you... I would never let anyone lay a hand on my mother, I would never join you know who, I would never send him after an innocent baby!” Dream James did not relent.

“You were a pampered, spoiled, arrogant toerag from the day you were born! You know nothing about my parents! You know nothing about Lily and me! You're nothing more than a bully, Potter!”

James laughed. “The bully she chose to marry. And now I'm dead. By the way, you didn't answer me -- are you proud of yourself? Are you happy now?”

“Believe me”, Severus said tearfully, “I am not. Please forgive me. Please tell her to forgive me.”

He woke up. He woke up and the Dark Mark was still there.

Hesitantly, Rashad moved away and Koury approached the bomb. Now that the time had arrived, even he was having second thoughts. However, he pushed them out of his mind. What he was about to do would change the world forever. Had Voldemort even considered the possibility that the Dark Lord would wind up ruling a world of radioactive ruins? Koury steeled himself, however. He was a wizard and disciplined man. He would do what was necessary to further his -- and Voldemort's -- cause.

He placed a stasis field around the uranium sphere which would inhibit all spells for sixty seconds after they were cast. Once all that was done, he pointed his weapon at the little uranium sphere, barely visible on a piece of broken asphalt.

"Engorgio Maximus! Compressio Maximus!"

The ball glowed as the stasis field absorbed the spells. Meanwhile, Rashad pressed a button on his wristwatch, and numbers began flickering.

01:00

00:59

00:58

Koury pocketed his wand and grabbed Rashad's arm. "Let's get out of here! Now!"

All of the operatives were heads down in the trench. Rashad screamed, "Ten seconds! Brace yourselves! Three, two, one, zero!"

Nothing happened for a couple of seconds. Then all hell broke loose as spells attached to the cameras placed on the mountaintops started screaming tones corresponding to code signals into the trench.

Sensors on camera 1 incinerated.

Sensors on camera 2 incinerated.

Camera 1 on fire.

Camera 2 incinerated.

Camera 3 incinerated.

Camera 4 reports bright light in distance.

Camera 4 blown off its moorings.

Many of the agents screamed in joy when they heard this. Camera 4 was a good five kilometers from ground zero. It would take a hell of a big explosion to knock it out.

Koury yelled at everyone to stay down and wait for the sound. His voice was barely audible over the celebrating people.

Then the shock wave hit. The sound was deafening, and Koury worried his eardrums would burst. Rocks flew everywhere, and the tent which had housed the base camp went flying. Waiting a good ten seconds for everything to subside, Koury told everyone to stay down as he cast a spell of radiation resistance and protection around himself. He had to see!

He stood up and took a peek out of the trench. One of the mountaintops had been sheared off, as if by a giant razor. Towering above the mountains was a roiling mushroom cloud.

He made a quick back of the envelope calculation of the device's yield and came up with twenty-five kilotons, just like what Voldemort had predicted.

They did it! They actually did it!

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** 'Working with him is better and worse than she expected it to be. Better, because he's clever and quick and knows all the entrenched pureblood rules and tiny courtesies that no one ever bothered to teach her. Better, because something happened to him during the war (didn't something happen to them all during the war?) and he no longer sneers down his (ridiculously patrician) nose at her. He still doesn't like her, not exactly, but sometimes there's a flash of respect in his eyes whenever she makes a particularly good point. Worse, because he's grown into his looks into a way that is patently unfair and sometimes when they're arguing, she feels strangely, shockingly alive.

And Draco Malfoy shouldn't be the one making her feel anything.
