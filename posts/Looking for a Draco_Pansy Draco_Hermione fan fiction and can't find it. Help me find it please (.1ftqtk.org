I'm looking for a fan fiction story that I'm unable to find!

The details are a bit sketchy:

As far as I remember it was Alternate Universe where Harry and Ron die. Hermione is a slave(?) at the Malfoy Manor. Draco and Pansy are married. But Draco and Hermione had a history.

There was something about a flower or a crystal thing that they both had that changed colors when brought to a flame that was in the manor. Also there was something significant about how they were meant to be but destined/forced to be apart.

This is around 3-4 years old and I really really really need to know where I can read it again.

Please help me!!

EDIT: felicitations is awesome.


** I'm looking around... no luck yet, mostly because Draco/Hermione is just so damn popular! Anyway, more information would be helpful.

Do you remember what site you found this on? Do you remember how you came across it?

How long was the story? One-shot? Novella? Novel-length?

Was it a WIP or was it already completed when you read it?

Was Hermione's enslavement a secret, or was she more like a servant?

Anything helps!

*** That's where I'm facing trouble too. Because for the life of me i can't remember if it was more than a chapter.

But no, it was completed. Not a novella, novel-length.

Either one-shot or max 2-3 chapters. And not a WIP.

She was a servant/slave. I think it was due to the fact that she was muggleborn. And probably had nowhere else to go.

And the only two websites that I can think of where I had read them were HPFF/Mugglenet. They were the only two websites I used to frequent. But the story is OLD. Like 2008/2009ish or older. I really don't remember.

IT sucks because I have links to all other stories but I remembered this one the most and I CANT FIND IT!

**** Here's something -- [[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=12945&warning=3][/The Sweetest Sin/,]] by annie. It's longer than what you're looking for (almost 60,000 words and 26 chapters), but it's old (2005), on MuggleNet, Hermione's a servant of Draco and Pansy Malfoy, and there seems to be a theme of glass/flames. Probably isn't the right story, but figured I'd share just in case; I'm still hunting!

Edit: Skimming the story again -- /The Sweetest Sin/ does indeed have a dead Harry and a dead Ron, there is a crystal/glass thing that produces flames when Draco and Hermione are both present, and the line "meant to be, but forced to be apart" is spoken. All of your criteria is met except for the length! Really crossing my fingers that this is what you're looking for!

Edit edit: I'm afraid I've run out of fic-searching tricks :( I'm hoping that /The Sweetest Sin/ is what you're looking for, but if not, I'll still keep an eye out, and hopefully kuckbaby will be able to help you. If not, try asking at [[http://dramioneasks.tumblr.com][dramioneasks]] or browse through the (many!) links listed [[http://avebury.livejournal.com/7872.html][here]]. Good luck!
