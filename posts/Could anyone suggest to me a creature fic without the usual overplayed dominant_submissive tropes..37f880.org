** Probably not the kind of creature fic you are looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][/The Accidental Animagus/]] start off with Harry escaping from the Dursleys by turning into a cat.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8423230/1/Amber-and-Emerald][/Amber and Emerald./]] I would suggest skipping this one if you have noose-tight morals. It starts out in second year and Harry has an 'advanced' relationship with Hermione if you catch my meaning.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6624252/1/Nocturnal][/Nocturnal./]] Hermione gets turned into a cat, relatively normal relationship with Hermione, Ron and Dumbledore serve as excellent comedy pieces without being bashed.

I just did a search through my bookmarks for the word cat, let me know if you want other stuff and I can give a look.

*** Veela and werewolf fics are cool. Fics with some Dom/sub relationship elements are fine as long as its something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5827647/1/Veela-Struck][Veela Struck]]and not [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10567941/1/Nature-of-the-Beast][nature of the beast]], just compare the opening chapter of both those fics to see what I mean.

I also adore [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10290899/1/Keep-This-Wolf][keep this wolf]].

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood][Cold Blood]] is pretty good, it has Harry experiencing a very rare reaction due to [[/spoiler][pieces of basilisk and dragon teeth being absorbed into his DNA]]
