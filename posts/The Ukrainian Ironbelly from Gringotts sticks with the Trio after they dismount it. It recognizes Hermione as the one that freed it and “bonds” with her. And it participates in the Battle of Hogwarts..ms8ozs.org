How does it help defend against Voldemort and his forces? What does it do to help protect its liberator? How does Hermione help it distinguish friend from foe? How does Hermione help it kick the expectation of pain whenever it hears clackers? How would she help heal its horrible scars? Does the Trio make their entrance by riding it to Hogwarts? (That would be awesome.) Charlie would certainly be impressed. Newt as well, once he hears about it. How would it take to Hagrid who would almost surely want to ride it? What happens to it in the end?

Voldemort: ‚ÄúI have an army.‚Äù

Hermione: ‚ÄúWe have a dragon.‚Äù


** It would probably be an advantage but it would have to be kept outside and attack on the Death Eaters at the entrance because bringing it too close to the school would risk hurting the Hogwarts resistance. Sort of like Daenerys did in Game of Thrones, she would always take the dragon away from her army and attack only in the regions where the bulk of the enemies were gathered.

However it was Harry that freed the dragon. Hermione only helped it carve through the roof. And Harry would not really have much time to deal with riding a dragon since he was busy dying.

But I still want to include the Gringotts heist because it's a cool scene and I was wondering how I could toy with it while making it seem original.

********** I'll check yours out? What do you usually write about?

For mine I'm still outlining the plot so nothing tangible so far but the main idea is that Ron gets captured by snatchers. They recognize him and take him to Voldemort for interrogation. He offers to sell Harry in exchange for his family's and Hermione's safety. Ron rises through the ranks of Death Eaters, while Hermione takes control of the good guys' resistance. It would be cool to have a Hermione warlady riding a dragon. Unknowingly to her, Ron aids her to find and destroy Horcruxes and when he becomes Voldemort's right-hand man, he assassinates him and takes control of the Death Eaters but he encounters a lot of trouble trying to de-radicalize the group. He and Hermione end up in a perpetual war, while never really getting over their feelings for each others (it's not supposed to be a romance or even a Romione story though).

*********** Well that's a rather tragic end. No Romione? That's fine by me; a Harmonie guy.

As my flair suggests, it'll be a crossover between Harry Potter and The Elder Scrolls. Mine is at the same level of development as you. Still in the plot outlining process. The closest I am to putting out anything is a prologue chapter... For Book 1.

It's going to be a series. Book 1 will encompass the waning years of the First War Against Voldemort, picking up in June of ‚Äò78 after the prologue. The Last Dragonborn (Whom has since become Emperor) will take the Marauders under his wing and mold them into a badass team of Battlemages. Fighting against both Voldemort and the Third Aldmeri Dominion in renewed conflicts between them and the Empire.

He will also be James Potter's cousin. By way of Henry Potter (James' Grandfather) marrying the big sister of the Dragonborn's grandfather. And I'm also making Dorea Black be Fleamont Potter's wife instead of Charlus'.

The prologue also going to mention an ‚Äúalternate opening‚Äù to Skyrim where the events of the College of Winterhold questline take place before Alduin's attack on Helgan. A student of the Clever Craft from the age of 11 to 18 before discovering his destiny as the Last Dragonborn. The actual events of the College of Winterhold Questline (with some alterations) all taking place in his seventh and final year there.

Yeah. Heavily adapted universe.

Harry Himself will have only a very minor role in the first book for obvious reasons. And since I'm a Harmonie fan, the sequels will feature it. (Slow burn is the way to play)

It's going to be a ‚Äúfusion fic‚Äù series. One of the backstory details being that the Wizarding World of Earth and the inhabitants of the Continent of Tamriel on Nirn have known about each other's existence since the Rise of the Roman Republic. Where, up until the past hundred years, the Empire of Cyrodiil only ever closely interacted with Wizarding Italy.

I don't want to spoil too much, and what I already have planned out for Book 1's sequels is but a microscopic fraction of what I have planned out for the beginning of the series.

He just throws him a bone in exchange for not another botched catch Harry mission and he has to work for his position. Ron is also not corrupted by hunger for power but considering that the falling out with Harry is out of concern for his family, he decides to go "the greater good" route. He is a good man faced with hard decisions. Hermione still loves Ron but is unwilling to forgive his betrayal and has taken on Harry's legacy.

No clue. Still working that out. I kind of need Harry to help Hermione figure some stuff out which would make it quite difficult for her to figure on her own, but I also sort of like the theme of lovers to enemies so I would like that the main battle to stay between Ron and Hermione.

***************** Gotcha.

Heh. I just remembered a conversation between myself and a friend of mine back towards the beginning of the year. I was wondering aloud to her why no one thought to use Bludgers in the Battle of Hogwarts to help defend to the school. Gather up all the Bludgers from the Quidditch Pitch, Spintwitches Sporting Needs in Hogsmeade and from Hogwarts itself.

Stick Protegos on them to increase their survivability. And, if they can, Patronuses as well. We hear all about Patronuses chasing off Dementors, but what would happen if a Patronus hits them? I feel like the end results would not bode well for the Dementor. We kind of get an idea of what would happen in that case as we see Harry (At least in the film adaptation, I don't know about the book) in Order of the Phoenix directly strike his wand against a Dementor with what appears to have been a non-verbal non-corporeal Patronus, this appears to hurt it. What would've happened if it was fully corporeal?

My logic is: If you can hurt a Dementor, they can be destroyed.

Not killed. Destroyed.

Also, yes, in OotP, Harry's Patronus stabs one of the Dementors with its antlers but it just chases it away.
