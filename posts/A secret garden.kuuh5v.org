Hi! I am looking for a fic where Harry runs from the Dursleys and finds a secret garden/plot of land. I remember he goes to Gringotts and gets a trunk with all his ancestor's things including a tent with a greenhouse. He also makes his own food and is very self-sufficient.

Please let me know if you know this one or any like it! Thanks!!
