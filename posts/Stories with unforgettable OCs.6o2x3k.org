What OCs have really stuck with you as you've read through fics? What characters have you found so compelling that you are hesitant to read another fic for fear of "overwriting" their memory?

Personally, Meciel from link(The Denarian Renegade), Alexandra from linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle), Ethan from the linkffn(Sword of the Hero) trilogy, and Bud from linkffn(A Curse of Truth) are the ones that I have found most memorable. I remember all of these characters rather vividly, even a few years after reading the fics. I had to take a short break from fanfiction after each of those fics just to let the memory of the characters set in.

What are yours?


** Calypso Rosier from Harry Potter and Boy Who Lived without a doubt.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Caroline Black, Marius Black's wife, from As Black As Night. She's the genteel upper-crust muggle who raises the MC and bonds with mugglehating Cassiopeia Black causing a great deal of cognitive dissonance in the latter.

Also, Gertrude Wrightman from Prelude to Destiny and Backfire. I like Slytherin aristocratic OCs who are ideologically opposed to Voldemort since we didn't get much of that in canon.

** Bellatrix Black from this series. No relation to the one we know, this series was written before the fifth book, and still holds up pretty strong. It is set in the 1700s, and is a fusion with Buffy, but don't let that stop you from reading it, minimal Buffy knowledge required.

They are both part of the same series, and it is the best fanfic I read from back in the day.

The other OCs are great as well, and apart from a few Buffy characters, nearly the entire HP cast is OCs.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

**** Read "Strangers At.." for the last few days and got to the last chapter today. I thought it was finished before I started reading. /angst/

I'm guessing that Jacqui can shrug off their anti-muggle spell because she's always taken one of her kids who (I'm hoping) end up being muggle borns. It might just be wishful thinking on my part, though.

One of the best fics I have ever read, it's old but still amazing (doesn't feel like it has aged compared to many other fics from long ago). Some of the most developed OCs I have ever seen.

** Kwan Li from A Bungle in the Jungle is probably the only redeeming feature of that fic.

** Honestly, Stanley from linkao3(All Life is Yours to Miss by Saras_Girl) is my most unforgettable. All of Saras_Girl's fics have great OCs, especailly OC pets, and I think about them often and wish I could just read more about them.

  Professor Malfoy's world is contained, controlled, and as solitary as he can make it, but when an act of petty revenge goes horribly awry, he and his trusty six-legged friend are thrown into Hogwarts life at the deep end and must learn to live, love and let go.
