The more in depth, the better. Straight up evil Dumbledore. Or just manipulative. I'd prefer Harmony to Hinny, but ships don't really matter to me. I just want to see this man portrayed as I feel he deserves to be, a manipulative bastard. Thanks in advance!


** linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero) does portray Dumbledore exactly in the way you want him to be portrayed.

*** I started it and I can't really get behind some of the characters actions. It seems unrealistic for the established universe. Thanks for the rec, I'm sure it's a good story, just not my thing.

It's not really a good story, to be honest. I'd even go as far as calling it complete and utter shit with pretty much no redeeming qualities.

But it did fit your request, and I honestly don't know of any good story that that has a really bad Dumbledore. I have a few with an annoying Dumbledore, or even the odd one with a incompetent one - but evil!Dumbledore is not something I've seen pulled off well.

***** I only said that to be polite lol I think it's utter garbage too. I didn't expect to come across lots of incredible fics from this, so thank you for the contribution. I'm sure my request is a longshot

  Harry walks the halls of Hogwarts seriously injured and is confronted by the Slytherins. They take him to Snape, who uses Legilimency to make a startling discovery. Is Dumbledore really who he says he is? Is Harry really on the right side of the war? Goodish!Voldemort, No Slash, Powerful Harry, Mentor Snape, Good Malfoys, super bad Dumbles, very abused Harry, AU Goblet of Fire

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
