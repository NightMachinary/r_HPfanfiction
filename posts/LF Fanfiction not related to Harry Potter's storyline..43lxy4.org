Are there any recommendable fanfictions that take place in the Harry Potter Universe, but have nothing or little to do with Harry Potter and friends? I don't mind something at the same time, in which the events are mentioned so much. I'm just looking for a whole new magical story.


** I've seen [[/u/Karinta]] recommend linkffn(3964606) quite often. It seems to be well regarded by most of the members of this subreddit.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

*** This fic is on Fanfiction.net, so you use linkffn followed by the title (and author for greater accuracy) or story ID (the long number that's in the link).

So linkffn(Raspberry Jam by vcc)

Edit: though now I actually read what the story is about, I don't think it's what OP is looking for.

** I don't think there are that many, sadly. Are you open to stories about characters mentioned in the books, but who never really affect the plot? (Basically people where all you know from the books is their name)

Alternatively, there's quite a few stories that have Harry in name only, and a couple more that have some massive changes made to the source material - this kind is one of my favourites.

A few one-shots that might interest you (none of them involve Harry or any of his close friends, and the plot of the books is in the background): linkffn(10921110;8461800;7864670;4903653)
