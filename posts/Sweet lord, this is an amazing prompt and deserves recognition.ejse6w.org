** If I were writing it, in the end it would turn out that wandless magic would never be quite as powerful as wanded, so all those witches essentially shot themselves in the foot and were deprived of proper education.

The reason Harry started this is because he's from a future where Hermione took over the wizarding world as its first Dark Lady and established a matriarchy. This is Harry's way of sabotaging it.

** Can anyone tell me why that sub exists when this sub is perfectly fine with minimal controversies? Even the more disliked content on this sub like slash has its own active subreddit, so the existence of a much lesser sub is rather baffling.

**** I find the kindness here the best, honestly. It isn't given like a free for all. If you're an asshole, then others are assholes. If you're kind and considerate, others take the time to have nice discussions too.

***** Where?

#+begin_quote
  So people have a place for their trash ideas like above? No idea tbh.

  Does it though? Feels pretty stupid with no end game. Also it reminded me of that Fic so minus points for that.
#+end_quote

All OP did was share an idea they were excited about and they got such horrible responses.

Why does kindness have to be earned?

#+begin_quote
  If you're kind and considerate, others take the time to have nice discussions too.
#+end_quote

OP did nothing to deserve this treatment and I stand by what I said. Its toxic as hell and it shouldn't be happening. If people actually responded with the same energy that OP put out, like you said they do, then they'd be happily having a discussion right now about a witchy feminist agenda.

****** That's not discussion though, is it? Taking some topic like that and then ranting about witchy feminist agenda is hardly ideal for me.

The first person is replying to someone asking about the other sub, it's not really about a person. When I talk about kind and considerate discussions I don't mean sunshine and rainbow lands. What I mean is that everyone is allowed a chance to put forth their opinions and discuss them without outright snubbing.

I too put forth my opinion that a prompt like that leads to no further development. It's the kind of thing that should be under a discussion flair, not a prompt flair. Moreover, I also suggested that I /have/ read a Fic like that and didn't like that which is a minor bait for further talk.

All in all, what I mean is that most people here, at least me definitely will try to discuss things without targeting the creator who made those things. I won't challenge you but only your ideas, that's the kind of vibe I go for. I certainly enjoy being given counter-examples that are so hard to properly explain. ;}

**** It's like an opposite version of this prompt. Harry becomes the literal avatar of Christ and the Patriarchy over the course of the fic and in the end is defeated by Delphini Riddle who is like an avatar of Feminism. It's a seriously out there fic and I'm not sure if I should link something like that or not.
