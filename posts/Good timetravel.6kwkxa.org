** Someone has to mention the elephant in the room.\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]]) Very well writen, very compelling. Also extremely well known. I enjoyed that fic a lot.

And a very good one shot:\\
Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8854828/1/A-Crime-Fitting-the-Punishment-or-Dumbledore-s-Monster]])

And possibly the most complete collection of tropes out there, although it does work well if you're able to get past the horrendous magical system:\\

** linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) is the best time-travel story in my opinion. fem!Harry travels 7000 years back in time. It has scenes from her return to modern times, and scenes of how she lived all that time.\\
If you haven't read it, I totally recommend it.

linkffn(Oh God Not Again! By Sarah1281) is the best fun time-travel story. It revists canon in a beautiful way, and is always good for a laugh.

If you want more recs, then please define a bit more what you want. (How do you like your Harry? What would you like the fic to focus on?)

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
