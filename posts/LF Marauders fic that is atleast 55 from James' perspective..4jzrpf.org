It feels to me that every single one is either focusing on Lily or Remus, which is fine, i'm just looking for something different.

And yes I've read the Life and times, Loved it, will she ever update!

  YEAR ONE: James and Sirius could spend time on homework instead of pranks. They could leave the Slytherins alone instead of picking fights. They could let the professors deal with the danger stalking Hogwarts. They COULD...But where's the fun in that?

  When James told Sirius they would investigate Remus' routine disappearances, he had been expecting some after hours mischief, perhaps a mystery or two. He certainly had not expected to stumble upon a startling secret. Marauder's Era, third year. Oneshot.

  YEAR TWO: Remus Lupin has a secret that even his best friends don't know about. Something dangerous has come to Hogwarts. And in the thick of things, you'll find James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew - reckless, stubborn, and worst of all... curious. How long will it be before they discover the truth?

  The Marauders are back for their third year and the stakes are ever increasing. James tries to juggle his rivalry with Snape and his feelings for Lily, while the world outside is growing ever more dangerous. R/R and enjoy!
