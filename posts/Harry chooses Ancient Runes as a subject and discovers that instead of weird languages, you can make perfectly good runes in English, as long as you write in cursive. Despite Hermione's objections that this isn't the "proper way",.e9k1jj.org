*** In Germany, where I went to school as a wee lad, we all learned cursive script (not sure if it was the "Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift" ("simplified basic [cursive] script") or the "Schulausgangsschrift" ("basic [cursive] school script"), though) where I went to grade school and we even had to use these fucking fountain pens (ballpoint pens were /verboten/ until, IIRC, fifth grade). I still use that script most of the time when I use a pen, but my handwriting is atrocious, tbh (as if a pigeon had diarrhea and shat on the page üòÖ).

**** I know most people abandon it, but most of the time it's for a weird mix of script and cursive (at least for most people I know so second year uni) so cursive is by no means an illegible mystery to them. And most importantly, at 10 they still use it and then they go to a school where they're forced to use quills, with which it's almost impossible to write in script. So Hogwarts students would definitely write in cursive.

This isn't the case in my experience. I learned to print first and didn't learn cursive until I was about 7yo. That was in NW England in the 70s though. My sister's kids also learned to print first though, and they're from Scotland in the 0's.

However, it is important to know that the USA has no centralized educational system, really, and this is all /very/ individual based on where your school is.

At any rate, my comment was simply to let you know that you might call "cursive writing" by some other name.

"Stand back, Mr. Malfoy," said Umbridge, a few minutes later, as she brandished her wand. One small explosion later, the whole group charged into the room to enter into complete darkness. And utter silence. Draco flailed around blindly and noticed that he couldn't locate his companions...and then he couldn't locate the floor. There was no sensation in his legs, it was as if he were floating in a dark and silent void.

Slowly the darkness cleared and with a rush, his senses returned to him. The first things to register were the rhythmic grinding of wheels and the occasional cry of birds.

"Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there."

***** Your story EXCITES me!

There are a couple of typos (which will be picked up by a beta). And some of the dialog would sound a little more "active" with some action in between the spoken sentences.

e.g.

--------------

"Madam Pince? I have a question for you if you would not mind." *He waited as she closed the thick tome in her hands and turned her gaze to him.* "How do the book holding alcoves work when you sign your name? I am trying to figure out how my name worked from the Goblet, I swear I didn't enter it but I still have to compete. I want to know how it works." *Realizing that he was rambling, he paused for a breath and continued.* "The register will give me a good idea on how it works. Please!" *he pleaded.*

--------------

And another one:

--------------

"These books are not to be taken from the restricted section. You are not to share them with anyone, and you are to keep any secrets of the library secret." *She leaned forward and her already steely voice became downright deadly.* "Champion or not I will bring my full wrath down on you should the library be compromised. You will return this note to my desk or I will ban you from the library for the rest of your time here."

--------------

I think Hermione's dialog is fine without breaks because her tendency to ramble and speak quickly is being implied anyway.

The idea that wizards unconsciously inject a tiny bit of their magic whenever they write anything could open a lot of potential plot holes but I think your idea of metal tipped quills takes care of most of them. A witch could use those to write anonymous letters that wouldn't be traced back to her.

The build up of Harry's internal thoughts near the end of the chapter is fantastic, especially the reveal with the mirror. It's a thrilling end to a chapter, without being an obvious cliffhanger, and makes me really excited to read the next one!

****** Thanks for the comments. Giving it more detail would be good you're correct. I also need to get a beta some time, hope it's not that bad.

I'll be honest the story is rough around the edges. The injecting parts of their magic is something I have been wondering about. There are lots of things in this story that I touch on that are part of another world.

I have a fairly large FanAU file and took inspiration from parts of it. My thought is the magic unravels as time goes on. So a quick note might last a few hours, while a signature at the end of a thesis submitted for a Mastery may last months. Blood quills use the medium of blood to hold the magic in place, thus the signature doesn't fade.

I appreciate your reply and will try to punch up the scenes a bit today before posting the next chapter.

All Crouch Jr did was assign them a parchment due a day prior. He may not know the mechanics fully but Voldemort could likely know a bit more this giving the instructions.

This works very well! Especially blood quills using blood itself to preserve the magic.

I'm hoping to enjoy not only how Harry totally exploits this power but also the banter between an ecstatic/smug Harry and an irritated Hermione because of her desire to "do things the 'right way' according to rules in the book".

******** I didn't get that actually, the story grew past the point where he could have that discussion with her sadly. The next similar length one I am working on right now is filled with that though.

It's based on Harry figuring out that Arresto Momentum is the single most broken spell he can think of. His entire third year made easier as he twists the spell beyond recognition and she gets upset as that's not possible according to the books.

Turns into a space adventure eventually, expanding on the short story I wrote about it.

********* Just read chapter 2 and it was fantastic. I love how Harry's items sound EXACTLY like overpowered min-maxed equipment from D&D or RPG games which have a randomized loot system (with lots of item modifiers and prefixes/suffixes). :-D

********** Haha, I was wondering if anyone would catch that. Totally had an old AD&D loot table up for it. Drew inspiration from there and Eragon, the whole Names thing they had in the book.

Yep the items are a bit min-maxed as they are Runes. Which is the most op broken thing ever. Even the most neutered rune fic I have read allows for OP-ness fairly easily. Fan made magic rune are essentially a physical way to tinker with the base code of the universe.

They are the actual coding of existence in physical form. We may be using the equivalent of Bubba Ray's School of Learning Computers Good coding it's still there!

That's why my fan au has no runes, I just cannot see a way to not break the universe with them.

Glad you enjoyed the story so far! It gets interesting to say the least.

******* People downvote like all the gay pairing though? It's just a trend I've observed. Personally I have the opposite of a problem for that sort of thing :P

Regardless, there's a context for every ship so it really depends on how the author spins thing. Ron is a self deserving bastard who only cares about himself or he's a loyal friend who suffers from self doubt. He's an abuser or he's abused. That's one of the best things about this fandom, you know, the fact that every story is a familiar setting with a new take on the somewhat flat cannon characters.

******** Its because most of the gay pairings are like that. With het pairings, you get relatively normal couples - close in age, vaguely similar mental structure, common intrests, etc.

With the most popular gay pairings, you get "Harry and fucking voldemort" or "Harry and goddamn snape" or "Harry and the literal bastard Draco" The last one is somewhat good if its done correctly, I admit. But two of the popular gay pairings are straight up pedophilic and its not alright. There's tons of interesting male characters you could pair harry with that would give a supremely interesting story! Seamus, for instance. Neville. Ron. Blaise, as the "DG blank slate" character. Just not Snake Satan, some dude as old as your dad, or someone who calls random people the wizard N-word out in the open!

It's also amazing that stories keep being written.
