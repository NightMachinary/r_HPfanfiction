Maybe you never thought of the pairing before, maybe you hated the pairing, but the way the author wrote it made you go wow, so that's why people like this pairing! Or any other similar thing.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, et cetra.

No Weasley Bashing. If Harry is in the story: No OP Harry. Harry smarter and more stronger then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable and because he worked for it.

Can be ANY Era, anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be old or new. Horcruxes can be a thing or not. Can be as canon or as AU as possible.

The pairing in question can be a major pairing, minor or a background pairing that made you like it, I'm fine with any.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** Harry Potter and the Bonds of Time was the first fanfic I ever read. It was a bit slow-moving but after that I was strictly in favor of Hinny for quite a while before exploring other pairings. Though the soul bond is a bit odd, I think it's interesting how they did it.

** Black Fortunes

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9624663/1/Black-Fortunes]]

Main pairing of Orion/Harry that I never thought I needed with a slight side pairing of Lucius/Sirius that I wish had more fanfics for the pairing.

** I just read "A dealer, not a Death Eater" on AO3.

And let's put it this way: I have never read HP fanfic before, but I read 300k+ in the last week, and joined this subreddit today.

It's Snape/Lily, and it focuses on them trying to survive Voldemort's rise to power. It's an awesome exploration of what life in the Wizarding World would have looked like for oppressed groups during this time, plus there's politics, espionage, and all sorts of general action.

It also explores Snape's early life, with a nuanced consideration of family dynamics.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
