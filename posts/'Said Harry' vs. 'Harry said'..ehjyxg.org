Does it make you stop reading a story if the writer uses 'Harry said' instead of 'said Harry'? I ask because that's what I do, and despite knowing it's a dumb question, I have to ask.


** Not really. I only stop reading when Harry becomes Hadrian/Harold/Harrison/Aries/Aaron or whatever shit.

***** Now I want to see a fic where Harry goes back in time and becomes a Black, gets a silly name, then buys a star, names it Harry, and changes his name and dares them to complain.

"There are no stars named Harry!"

"There are now."

** I'd need to go back and check to be sure, but I thing the original books favored "x said" over "said x."

Edit: I recall wrong Edit 2: partially wrong, both versions are used in Canon books

** Someone asked this in a writing group, and the conclusion of the discussion was that ‚Äúsaid Harry‚Äù is standard British and ‚ÄúHarry said‚Äù is standard American. As my stories are set in Britain, I make a point of using ‚Äúsaid Harry‚Äù consistently.

** Not really, no. If it's an interesting story, I can deal with most ways of phrasing things. Your position is semi-understandable, though. I mean, both versions are technically correct, but at the end of the day, there's a lot of fanfiction around and you've got to filter it somehow.

** I usually stop when a writer uses only "said" and not "told" "uttered" "spoke*" "interjected" or any other variation... i mean when there are not enough differences in shade and meaning in the way the author conveys not only the action of talking made by the characters but its significance in context and nuances *i originally wrote "speaked" because... i don't know, it kind of passed under the radar. Even though i hope my English vocabulary expands a bit everyday at times it happens old notions i thought were solid slip away

  "speaked"

I could probably put up with a fairly substantial amount of "said", but probably a single "speaked" instead of "spoke" would put me off.

**** Yes, standard English style advice is that you should use "said" 90% of the time. Using too many descriptive dialogue tags is generally considered bad writing.

  ‚ÄúEr --- hello,‚Äù *said* Harry nervously.

  ‚ÄúHarry Potter!‚Äù *said* the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. ‚ÄúSo long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir... Such an honor it is...‚Äù

  ‚ÄúTh-thank you,‚Äù *said* Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he *said*, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúDobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,‚Äù *said* the creature.

  ‚ÄúOh --- really?‚Äù *said* Harry. ‚ÄúEr --- I don't want to be rude or anything, but --- this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.‚Äù

  Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head.

  ‚ÄúNot that I'm not pleased to meet you,‚Äù *said* Harry quickly, ‚Äúbut, er, is there any particular reason you're here?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúOh, yes, sir,‚Äù *said* Dobby earnestly. ‚ÄúDobby has come to tell you, sir... it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin...‚Äù

  ‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù *said* Harry politely, pointing at the bed.

**** Hate? no, but I'm often annoyed by it. At first i blamed on the translation, but when i found out that in English it still was so... Limited, i was more than a little put out. It's also one of the reasons why i look for variety of lexicon in a fanfic

***** The theory is that the reader's brain tends to skip over "said" while having to pause and actually think about the fancier synonyms. Just like it skips over pronouns and names. But some fic writers think "she" and "he" is too repetitive, and as a result you get abominations like "the red-haired wizard" and "the green-eyed youth" every few sentences. I think using too many said synonyms would also disrupt the flow in a similar manner.

****** It's not only that 'she' and 'he' are too repetitive, it's that if you have more than one person of the same gender in a scene and all you're using are 'she' and 'he', it can get a bit muddling as to who is doing what even for the writer. Names are one alternative to that, but that really can hit the repetitive note ergo people try out some epithets.

** I think the second gives a more archaic / fairy tale kind of feeling, while the first is more modern. Which one to use depends on the tone of the fic.

So "said Harry" fits /Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbon√´/ perfectly, but it would look out of place in something like /A Black Comedy/.
