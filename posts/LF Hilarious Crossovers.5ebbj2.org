Not to complane (snnnnnnk) or anything, but I am having a hard time finding something worth a good laugh or two. Any fandom cross is fine.


** Definitely read linkffn(Browncoat Green Eyes by nonjon) if you haven't yet. HP/Firefly with a heavy dose of comedy in there. One of my favorites.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
