There is a fanfic called Harry Potter: Coming Out On Top, which is really just a very slightly different Gary Stu fic, but it was unique enough that it still proved interesting when you were in the mood to read a fic like that. There are 12 chapters of it on FF.net, but I clearly remember there being a lot more chapters to the story (about 18 more, IIRC) that you could read on other sites, one of which was completely in Russian with only the story itself being in English. Does anyone know a place I could read the rest of the fanfic? If not, does anyone have it saved and is willing to share?
