Iâ€˜ve read books like The Gnarled Tree of Time by Silk Lily (a personal favourite) and Face On A Milk Carton - but am really struggling to find many more fanfics as it is a very select niche. Any recommendations would be lovely :)


** It's a little bit different to the fics you've mentioned, but Daddy Dearest is fantastic! Really well-written and creative. Even if you're not a fan of tomione, this is worth a read. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9219929/1/Daddy-Dearest]])

#+begin_quote
  It is 1895 in England. Purebloods are the supremacy. Dumbledore rules them all. Lord Malfoy, one of his many devout followers, has a daughter no one has ever seen. The daughter herself, Hermione Malfoy, never questions the strict rules standing between her and everyone else -- that is, until Master Riddle arrives and makes her think twice. AU/OOC/Rated M for dark themes.
