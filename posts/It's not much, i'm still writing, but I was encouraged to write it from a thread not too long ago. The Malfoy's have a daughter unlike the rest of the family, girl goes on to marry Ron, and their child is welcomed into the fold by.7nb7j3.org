** I read over what you posted and it seems like a good framework. Here are my thoughts.

-You do more telling than showing. For example, the bit with the brooms, you just kind of shove in there that the girls come from well-off families. Think about a way to show this rather than saying, "They were rich and had awesome brooms."

-I'm confused by the the last couple of sentences in the first paragraph. Who is saying or thinking that? Is it Vanessa? Is it some third narrator? It makes me think of when a character in a movie or TV show directly addresses the audience. Are you intending to break the fourth wall here?

-I feel like you should build up her asking Harry out to the dance more. It's very dry--she sees him, her friend pokes her, she asks him, he turns her down, she walks away. All you say is she feels like garbage afterwards. /Vanessa stopped dead in her tracks, breath freezing in her throat as she saw the one and only Harry Potter leaving a classroom. He looked distracted and Vanessa had the crazy thought that he might be distracted enough to actually say yes to her question. Ever helpful, Alice poked her in her back, propelling her forward on legs that felt like they had no relation to her body. Up close, Harry was even more striking and she had to remind herself to not stare at his scar, focusing on his green eyes instead. Feeling like her heart was going to beat right out of her chest, she took a deep breath./ Think about how you would feel in the same situation. Dizzy? Sick to your stomach? Floating on air?

-The same thing goes when she asks out Ron. Let us know how she feels. Put the reader in the moment. Make the reader care. Also, having her go from barely able to approach Ron to giving him a kiss on the cheek is jarring and overly-familiar.

-Again, you just tell about why her parents wouldn't be best pleased with her attending a function with a Weasley. Was there a particular incident? Did Arthur steal her father's lunch when they were at school/work/bowling? You have an opportunity to enhance the world you're creating--don't just let it lay there on the floor.

-When writing, one should watch colloquialisms. The word is "Yeah", not "Yea". Watch your Potterwords, as well. It's "Hogsmeade", not "Hogsmeed". Minor, but things like that tend to take the reader out of the story and wonder why you're spelling it that way or using that word, rather than focusing on the action on the page.

Overall, I think you've got a good start, but you're falling into the same trap that a lot of beginning writers do which is telling rather than showing. Don't be overwhelmed--think about it as scene by scene--and you can easily punch up the scenes to make them more descriptive and engaging. Thanks for sharing your work!

*** Thanks so much for the feedback, seriously. This as you can tell, is a very rough draft and the spelling of potterwords would be something to go over in a revised, longer version. This was more of a "hey, this is an idea, should i continue or not? Thoughts welcomed"

*** I'll do my best to do it right. Much to change and add to. After all, this is 3rd year and I'd like to start from her first year which would be chamber of secrets cannon for Harry.
