I've been reading fanfiction since 2006 and I've seen about as many variations of Voldemort as one can poke a stick at. Of these, almost all were (logically) as is depicted in canon who we all know so well - deformed, snake-like, at times very Ralph Fiennes - with the occasional more human interpretation, both physically and characteristically. By this I mean still very much human in looks, potentially still in the public sphere with his role as Dark Lord very much hidden and used without putting a face to the name.

My question to you lot is twofold. Do you find, as I do, the more human variant of our favourite Dark Lord more terrifying to read about and/or imagine, or does JKR's Riddle still give you all the spine-tingles? Secondly, which /would/ you prefer to read about?


** I feel like if Rowling had kept Voldemort as he had been in the Graveyard Scene in book 4 (vengeful, theatrical, and /intelligent/) rather than a raving psychotic madman with equally insane followers, it would have been /loads/ more scary.

I would prefer to read about a Voldemort that had /reasons/ other than 'heck the mudbloods'. One where people barely even know he exists, just a vague, dark shadow of the threats of pureblood supremacy. And of course, to combat this threat, who does the WIzarding World turn to but Tom Riddle, Minister for Magic? The only one whose actions seemed to have any effect on this foe.

One where Tom is /Tom/ and /voldemort/ is an entirely separate identity. He has no side, as he said: there is only power and those too weak to use it.

He gets power. He uses it for his /personal agenda/ - not Voldemort's!

*** In one fic, Slughorn realized that Riddle was trouble, and burned all of Tom's bridges before he could cross them, and attributes Tom using his job at Borgin and Burkes as a stepping stone in his plan as a testament to his ingenuity.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

** JK Rowling's Voldemort is terrible. I'm sorry to say this and I honestly love her books but Voldemort is by far her worst work. As you said he is cartoonishly evil and makes no sense at times. He is even so predictable that Dumbledore was able to figure out that his horcruxes are tokens in places from his youth after more than 50 years after Voldemort was out of school. He is the stereotypical jock from highschool who can't let go of his popular past.

Ok in all seriousness I think that Rowling even realized that Voldemort was not ideal and created Grindelwald as a much more realistic villain. Let's compare those two.

Grindelwald wants to overthrow muggles because he claims that magic means that they are superior. Survival of the fittest. Pretty relatable if you ask me and sound logic. Especially considering the time he was growing up in. Euthenics were huge, there was lots of literature that dealt with naturalism and or survival of the fittest. Magic users fit in perfectly. Especially if you see magic equals nature in the context of literature.

Voldemort wanted to kill all muggles and mudbloods. Despite being a half-blood himself. ( I would give her a point for internalized racism tho) but for no specific reason. It is not even stated once why he actually wanted to kill them all. Only reason I could think of? He clung to his connection to Salazar and thought that he should kill all unworthy. Why? Dunno.

Means of grabbing political power: Grindelwald forged alliances, created his own armies, was maybe involved in WWII? Created prisons for his prisoners and so on.

Voldemort? While he was in school he had the right idea. He excelled in schmoozing up superiors ( teachers) and was well connected. He was popular, smart etc. Many people thought it was just a matter of time until he will become minister of magic. What does he do instead? He calls himself by a ridiculous name and forbids everyone to use that name. He kills and becomes a terrorist.

*** Dumbledore being able to guess the location of the Horcruxes makes sense however. Once he confirmed the existence of Horcruxes, he was able to guess their locations, because of his knowledge of Voldemort's personality. His first interaction with Riddle involves Riddle hiding trophies. He also knew that Voldemort wanted be the greatest wizard of all time. When one knows of how Horcruxes are made, it makes a lot more sense that Voldemort would choose powerful and historically significant objects and hide them in personal places, because it would be symbolic of him overcoming the might of some of the greatest magicals of all time, and taking their power for himself. (The exception to this is the Diary, which can be attributed to being his first attempt, possibly a rush job, and being under Dumbledore's fairly watchful eye). Plus knowledge of Voldemort's arrogance would mean that there would be no way that he would simply choose a mundane object. Combine all of this knowledge of Voldemort's personality with a search of Voldemort's movements before his rise to power would most likely eventually reveal important objects that Voldemort came into contact or could have came into contact with. If those objects were to go missing afterwards, all the more confirmation.

As to his hatred of Muggles, very likely he saw them as subhuman. Mudbloods then, were tainted by association. If we take Voldemort as a parallel to Hitler, it makes all the more sense. Both thought certain "races" were inferior, and others (their own) superior. Both thought their nation was being unjustly constrained. And even though Voldemort was a half-blood, he sought to deny that part of himself, and just like the half-Jews who were members of the NSDAP and close friends of Hitler himself, he was able to still hate the undesirables.

Also, I don't believe you can definitively argue that in-universe, Grindelwald was influenced by eugenics, because that was a Muggle belief, and Grindelwald did not associate with them. Perhaps Rowling made that part of his character, but within canon, there is no reference to a clear Wizard eugenics that was being spread around that time.

He is able to guess the locations because he went to places that were important to Voldemort as a child. Voldemort who was at least 50-70 years old. But nevermind that, that is the least negative thing about his character.

Again, I think that Grindelwald is the better Hitler. Voldemort may see muggles and mudbloods as inferior but his approach was just godawful. If he were just a bit smarter about it, Voldemort might have succeeded. All I am saying is that Voldemort was just an irrational lunatic. There was no grey. There was just simple black or white. Either you are with Voldemort and thus you are bad, or you weren't. Grindelwald on the other hand? At least from what we know of him? He was persuasive. He had ideals. He even managed to convince Dumbledore to follow him.

We don't know that and it wouldn't matter anyway. Eugenics was the big thing to have. It's a big part of Hitlers ideals: to create the perfect aryan race.

He went to school during WW2. Also, he felt like his dad abandoned him. His dad being Muggle.

** I much prefer the over-the-top, very snakelike, evil-but-calculating Voldemort to the movie version (unhinged, crazed, physically just a human without a nose). No, he's not serious at all, but I don't like /Harry Potter/ as a "serious" story. I'd much rather have it be /fun/ than /realistic/. It's about a school of magic, fercrissake! I love a good campy evil Voldemort in the same way I loved Palpatine, if you will.

** Honestly the realistic, human voldy scares me a whole heck of a lot more than cartoon villain voldy. The human aspect adds a bit of something that can be related to on some scale. Book voldy just wants death and power, but in the most melodramatic fashion.

To me it's almost like asking if you're more scared of Norman Bates or Ed Gein. Grin was a real person who actually did all this scary shit, Bates is the dramatized caricature. Book-Voldy feels like a dramatized charaiture of a real person who /could/ hate and kill for no reason, but again, it just feels... forced almost?

Plus hes a bit of an idiot, but so is basically everyone at times sooo
