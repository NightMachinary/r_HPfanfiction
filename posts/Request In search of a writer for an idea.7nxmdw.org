I have an idea that I would like to see someone write, but I am not good at writing.

My idea is that Sirius Black was in love with Petunia Evans. He would have gotten to know her through visiting Lily over the summers with James, but when Voldemort came to power he made her hate anything to do with magic in order to try and protect her.


** You will never get good at it if you do not try. Do you want to read a certain fic? Then write it. That's how most stories are born. Do you suck at writing? Well, everyone else did as well and only experience can fix that.

I went through 50k words I never published just to feel comfortable enough to post my first fic, which was a 2.5k words long one-shot. Another 70k words later I went back to that story and it sucked so I went over the mistakes and fixed them. That is just how the creative process works. All of my stories were born out of the desire to read something that did not exist.

*** I have tried to write it and it just doesn't work out well for me. I think that is amazing that you were able to work so hard and get good at it, but writing is not something I am that passionate about. I think this could be a great story if done right, and I wish I was the right person to do it. And if no one is able to make it, it will stay a beautiful idea in my head, I just wanted to put it out there to see what someone else could make of it.

*** when you say "fixed them" do you mean pressed ctrl+a and backspace and rewrote it all? :P because that's how I feel any time I look back at anything I've written.

**** My biggest issue was overuse of dialogue tags so I deleted quite a lot of them and changed some others so they would make it clear who was saying what (had a group conversation so it was quite difficult to keep track of who was saying what).

Other than that I replaced some adverbs, improved punctuation (Grammarly was a huge help with that), fixed a couple typos and stuff like that. Despite removing half of the dialogue tags the word count went up.

The plot was alright for what it was supposed to be (humourous oneshot), the presentation was the problem and that could be fixed without starting from square one. I mean, I am not a native speaker so issues were to be expected. I just needed the writing experience to see them. If you know what the problem is, you can fix it.

** Not my cup of tea, but this could work in the right hands.
