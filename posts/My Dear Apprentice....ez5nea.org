The true manipulator of Harry's life was never Dumbledore, it was Voldemort.

That night, when everything fell apart... when Tom Riddle finally died, the man was finally able to come to terms with his mortality. He could not, and would not, live forever. His followers were a group of turncoats who sold out one another and renounced all he'd stood for in the face of the consequences. His power alone would not guarantee him victory.

He slipped into the shadows, vaguely aware that Dumbledore did not at all believe he was gone. For of course he wasn't, the genius of his forays into immortality meant he wouldn't be defeated by a mere spell backfire.

His movements were subtle, inhabiting animals to move into places he shouldn't be. A shade whispering into all the expected ears, and even a few that weren't. All until 1990 when the perfect vessel for his designs made itself known: When Quirinus Quirrel came calling and he finally had his in at Hogwarts...

Target, Potter.

No, best be calling him Harry, even in his own mind. He smiled fondly at the boy he saw through Quirrel's eyes. Hand me downs and skinny, afraid of his new environment but desperate not to leave. A sickly desire to prove himself JUST under his skin. He just */was/* the same as him, all those years ago, moulding him would not be hard.

Quirrel lasted two years as the Defense Professor before Dumbledore and Snape took him down. In that time Harry had a primer in the Dark Arts, a prodigy with a wand given just the right push in the right direction to further study without his direct involvement. But that hadn't been his only student...

Yes, Harry WOULD be his crowning achievement, but there were others worthy of his attention.

Weasley had the same overwhelming ambition as his friend, a desire to stand out from his own pack. When subtly taught his place as beneath him, he'd made a far worthier confidant to young Harry than any of his own.

Granger had been a more challenging student. Dead set on her morals but still so eager to learn the "secret magicks" Professor Quirrell was offering her and her friends. Grey at best he had feared.

But his own students were the ones to prove his assessment incorrect. Bless his Harry's sadistic streak! A seductive voice in her ear FAR more potent than he could ever have been (a more relatable figure, perhaps?), he first aimed her towards Malfoy as she belittled her, but then she became such a pretty little attack dog who snapped at any Harry's eyes lingered upon...

Of course this is what really had Snape and Dumbledore catch on, on top of little Ginerva's opening of the Chamber with his trusted Horcrux. He was fortunate to take it from her and remove it from the Castle, but alas not before being caught "red-handed" in a scheme Lucius would be made to explain. Body destroyed again, he was thrown to the wind.

But not for long...

Pettigrew had found him, too cowardly to dare try cosying up with the light. Followed by the return of Crouch and he would be back to a body (HIS body) before long.

Then he would sink his claws into Harry once again and work on removing any hang-ups or misinformation that pesky Headmaster had put in his head in his absence.

The boy, once upon a time, had been his enemy. The threat sent by fate to halt his own destiny. But in reality, he was his legacy, a dear apprentice to carry in when he could not, to assist where he would fall short. He was not a perfect being, this shade form a constant reminder, but he was worthy of being the boys Professor and to teach him his place and worth in this world.

There is more than one path to immortality after all...

** This reminds me of a fanfic that was recommended here a while ago (but Ron and Hermione didn't fare nearly so well in the fic).

It was... not a story for the feint of heart. It became extremely well written in later parts, but emotionally exhausting to read and the content nausea worthy by the end of the series.

*** My idea here is that seeing how quickly the majority of his support base fled he understood (like you said) loyalty could not be hinged on power and fear. Also he realised that, really, he was alone when it mattered and wanted Harry to have servants who would actually go out of their way to protect him AND have the ability to do so.

I like to think that, during First and Second year, he develops a warped familial love for Harry. Sort of seeing him as his son and (ironically) bypassing Lily's protection by having a comparable affection for him. But it is not out of pure love but as an extension of his ambitions.

**** Its also a good idea for a potential Ruler to have someone who is not afraid to tell them why they are being Stupid

Voldemort, ruled with such fear his followers only followed

harry has the potential to inspire his followers to greatness.

“The first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men he has around him.” ― Niccolò Machiavelli, The Prince

Voldemort found himself surronded by people who fight to kiss his feet

“Since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved” ― Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince

Fear is an intresting thing, as is love, the true great leaders of history are both loved and feared, it could be merely the fear of letting them down

Caesar finally arrived to address the legions in person. Caesar knew he needed these legions to deal with Pompey's supporters in north Africa, who had mustered 14 legions of their own. Caesar also knew that he did not have the funds to give the soldiers their back pay, much less the money needed to induce them to re-enlist for the north African campaign.

When Caesar approached the speaker's dais, a hush fell over the mutinous soldiers. Most were embarrassed by their role in the mutiny in Caesar's presence. Caesar asked the troops what they wanted with his cold voice. Ashamed to demand money, the men began to call out for their discharge. Caesar bluntly addressed them as "citizens" instead of "soldiers," a tacit indication that they had already discharged themselves by virtue of their disloyalty.

He went on to tell them that they would all be discharged immediately. He said he would pay them the money he owed them after he won the north African campaign with other legions. The soldiers were shocked. They had been through 15 years of war with Caesar and they had become fiercely loyal to him in the process. It had never occurred to them that Caesar did not need them.

The soldiers' resistance collapsed. They crowded the dais and begged to be taken to north Africa. Caesar feigned indignation and then allowed himself to be won over. When he announced that he would allow them to join the campaign, a huge cheer arose from the assembled troops. Through this reverse psychology, Caesar re-enlisted four enthusiastic veteran legions to invade north Africa without spending a single sesterce.

His men both loved and feared him, and as such they where willing to go to the ends of the earth for him

alexander the great was similar regarded.

Voldemort was merely feared, but he was unable to instill a sense of comraderie that great leaders would.

if you are feared for your power, when your power falters you are alone if you are feared for your power but loved for your loyality to your troops when your power falters your men will be there

hell its why rome was such a shithole before the empire, armies became loyal to generals and not the state, as the general was going to be the one who fought for them to get land and payment when the war ended

******* "Harry didn't know what was happening. First Voldemort Resurrected, then Ministry tried to limit what meagre amounts of magic students were already learning. Now Wizegamot started installing laws that would effectively cripple Dumbledore's plans and his Order of Sizzled Chicken. That was five years ago. Harry now was running. Not from the so-called Death Eaters. No, not from them, firstly because they changed the name to Servants of the True Law, second, because the-now-servants are nothing more than arrogant uppity recruits Voldemort picked of the streets and gave instructions on unforgivable. After all, why Quality when you have Quantity that can cast one-shots repeatedly. No, what he was running from was Ministry's Aurora, the newly formed Shock-team of Aurors, and their mission: 'Invite' Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, The Last Light, Saviour of Muggleborns, to ministry, and make him face charges for, as the last 40 new laws indicates, his 'unlawful' existence. That was going on for three years now. First Hermione, his first, and last (if his situation indicates anything) love interest, disappeared inside the accursed building, then Ron and his whole Family, A clan if he had anything to say about enthusiasm of Arthur and Molly on continuing their Family's Legacy, namely breeding more than they reasonably should. Aside from that, every opposition has failed. From Political Opposition that had power simply assassinate without any evidence left behind, to opposition that had no power simply crushed publicly, to last resistance quickly subdued and brainwashed by Legilimance and other Mind-Magics Voldemort and his entourage have created these past years. Now there was no opposition, no last hideout, no artifact that could turn this away. Curse Voldemort and his Magic research, if only he haven't employed his 'faithful' servant to finding a way to regain his sanity after Horcrux rituals. The Britain has fallen, with his as the last resistance. And the world watched. Just watched like people watch films they can't relate to. As Harry was bleeding out, due to cutting curses those 'Servants' managed to lob at him, he knew, Britain has fallen, and the world will follow. Because common, immortality without drawbacks and unlimited gold due to one red stone, which Voldemort managed to steal from Flamels, is a nice toolkit to world domination." Yeah, I imagine that when I saw this post. First, if you're conquering the world, don't name your group like bunch of emo school kids, second, have families that have centuries of Magic tomes and such? Research your weakness. Third, if your plan fails at acquiring one thing, don't give up on that thing, give up the plan. Create a new one FFS.

You don't need to rehash year 1 for 10 chapters only to reveal that Harry fights the troll with real magic, and Quirrel survives. And then 10 chapters about how Ginny opens the chamber, but the horcrux doesn't get destroyed but Quirrel does. Then 10 chapters about how Harry has progressed in the Dark Arts because you have nothing to really write about but need to fill 3rd year.
