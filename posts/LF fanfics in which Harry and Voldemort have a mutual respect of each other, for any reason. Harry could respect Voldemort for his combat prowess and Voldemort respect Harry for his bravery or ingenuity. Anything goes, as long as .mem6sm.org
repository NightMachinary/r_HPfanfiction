  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

** ficao3(18851794) Mi Aedijekit is a very good and weird fic. Basically if Voldemort gets his wish and lives for a 1000 years as an emperor (it makes him quite odd lol). Very well written, awesome characterization for Harry and Voldemort, and great world building.

ficao3(25976080) an island is an ocean full of change- POV of the horcrux in Harry

ficao3(16308554) Inevitabilities is a same age AU. Creepy and beautiful writing. One of my favorite fics.

  “Hush, Harry,” came Voldemort's soothing voice. “I shall take... such good care of you.”--“I desire our reunion sooner rather than later. Come back to me, and I will ensure that you are as utterly comfortable as I can make you. You may be assured that I will never rest my immortal body until I have you once again.”--“I did not intend to -- ”“You did so intend! Well? Will you finally stop moping now that the box was not-empty for a night?”“No,” Voldamort snarled. “This fixes nothing.”--A retrospective tale of language gaps, of untrustworthy memories, and of the culmination of a millennia long affair between a Dark Lord and a counterrevolutionary. -- (summary edited 2020.12.19)

  In all the research Voldemort had done, nowhere did it suggest that Horcruxes had any degree of sentience. It would have been fascinating if it wasn't so damn inconvenient. In which Voldemort is stuck inside his nemesis's head and tries to cope with emotions. It's not that he cares about the brat, but he needs to figure out a way to get this kid out of this horrible house he's been placed in, and then maybe he can go back to his plans of reshaping the wizarding world.

  “Harry Potter,” comes the soft, sibilant hiss of a voice he has heard in his dreams, in his nightmares, in his waking hours for years.  Slowly, carefully, Harry twists over and pushes up onto his hands and knees.  He stays there, short breath fogging in front of his face, and his pursuer lets him.  Harry has no doubt of that; he's being allowed this respite. This small moment to catch his bearings, heart pounding in his ears, blood singing. “It seems I have finally caught you.”

** linkffn(3036211) At the hands of the other is a great story where they both take the line of the prophecy about being equal quite seriously in a crackfic sort of way. Sadly unfinished but stops in a decent place.

** Well, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is book one in a series and doesn't have much Harry/Riddle interaction, but in the following books, Riddle becomes aware of "Rigel" and repeatedly tries to recruit "him" as a poster boy for his new anti-muggle-blood legislation. And Harry eventually learns that Riddle's motivations are only /mostly/ bad; he's trying to make pure-bloods marry half-bloods in order to counteract a population implosion caused by inbreeding, but he's doing it in a bigoted and controlling way. They have several enemy-of-my-enemy team-ups, and make a number of deals using the Unbreakable Vow.
