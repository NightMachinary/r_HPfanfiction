I've been thinking about this canon for like eons. Is there a fanfiction about it? Like Luna Lovegood had accidentally travelled back in the Marauder's Era and had captured the attention of Severus Snape.

I mean if we all think about--I think it would make a great pair since its kind of a eccentric,light,kind protagonist (Luna Lovegood) x the dark but just actually needs a hug protagonist (Severus Snape)

Thank you! And always Stay safe everyone ‚ù§
