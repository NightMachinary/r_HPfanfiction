I've been thinking about a fanfic I read once, where the MC was taken into the castle as an infant and raised there for some time. Even had her first birthday there.

This got me thinking, what do you think the different staff members would've gotten a baby for their first birthday? This IS the world of magic after all, so I doubt it'd be the usual toy cars and stuffed animals.


** Harry got a toy broom as a gift when he was a baby. It was from Sirius, which is kinda poetic considering Sirius gave him the firebolt later.

But I also don't see why dolls and soft toys wouldn't be an option. Dolls enchanted to walk and talk, stuffed toys that can come to life. Exploding snap with animals or the alphabet on them. Chess sets in novelty shapes. Puzzles that move and change shape every time you solve them. Tea sets that whistle and smoke. Trains that pump smoke out of their chimneys.

Balls that bounce magically high and change colour. Bubble bath where the bubbles can be picked up and thrown into the air - and then they float.

Play mats where the pictures move about and make sounds when you press them. Think - elephants and monkeys and stuff. Animated farm sets.

Books. Picture books with moving pictures.

An enchanted lullaby box that plays the baby's favourite song.

Given the prefect's bathroom, this is canon!

*** This is actually brilliant, and omg so adorable to picture xD I just want to clarify that I never meant toy cars and stuffed animals were out of the picture. I just meant that I imagined them being of the magical kind that does something unusual and extraordinary instead of the usual muggle toys, and boy did you deliver!

** It depends on the professor. And this is a one-year-old, not a five or six year-old

--------------

Snape: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Sprout: Some sort of magical flower--maybe something that has color-changing petals or a vine that can play patty-cake or tickle the baby

Hooch: A toy broomstick

Hagrid: Insert pet of your choice here

Kettburn: Insert another pet of your choice

Flitwick: A super-duper bouncy ball that can bounce off the ceiling and the floor and the walls and it turns color with every bounce

McGonagall: Something practical...or perhaps a little kazoo that plays bagpipe music

*** I just died at your idea for Snape's gift xD Idk, maybe he'd think of something sweet and proper, like a colour-changing blanket that grows in size as s/he grows that smells like something calming. Lavender, maybe?

I'd love to see your idea for Filch's gift, imagining he miraculously liked the kid and wanted to give something. I imagine a tiny Mrs Norris plush that'd come to life and cuddle her/him.

**** I doubt Snape would want to give any baby a gift ever, but I like the blanket idea.

Filch? Giving a gift to a whiny, noisy, smelly, grubby baby? Ha!
