Is there any good story that features half-human Harry? It would be good if his other parent wasn't of the species of other canon halfbreeds, so without half-veela, half-giant and half-goblin.

Would love it if it was half-dragon Harry (although I don't know how would that work), or of other distinctively non-human species.


** I would pay money for a good fic where Harry's parseltongue comes from the fact that he actually hatched from a Lamia egg, or something.

  He was only twelve, going on thirteen. And shouldn't Madame Pomfrey been able to detect this and stop it while he'd been in the hospital wing? Because seriously? This? This thing right here? It had to have been something to do with the Basilisk having bitten him. A whole new spin on the Snake!Harry Genre with some Ancestor! thrown in.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2412808/1/The-Innocence-Of-Guilt]])

Has a sort of dragon Harry near chapter 12. Pretty old, cannot really remember much about it to be honest. The dragon part is more of a strange transformation that is hard to undo or something like that.

If there were some more recs here I probably wouldn't post this but maybe it will interest you, if only for a bit.

Hope you find what you are looking for :D

Harry has an OC as a partner, don't remember her being too bad.

  When phoenix tears aren't enough down in the Chamber of Secrets, Fawkes is forced to take drastic measures. This results in a Fem!Harry with new powers and no control. In a new place, separated from all she knew, how will Harry cope - with her situation, and her new abilities? And what will happen back at home while she's away? At least the local fauna seems friendly.

** I'd be interested in seeing this as well, but unfortunately I'm not sure if they exist at all.

I remember coming across some kind of dragon Harry fic and I was pretty excited.

Buuuuut then it went in some weird directions. There are more dragon people like Harry, the species is entirely male and Harry is part of the submissive girly subspecies.

The series seemed to be heading in the direction of Mpreg. No thank you.

Edit: Here are two of the closest things I've found to Dragon!Harry. He's not actually a different species, he has a pretty unique animagus thing going on in each of them. In the first one, he has spent years living alone as a Dragon so his behavior is a little different.

*** Enter The Dragon was awesome, but pity original author abandoned it and has no intention of ever coming back, and the continuation by other guy never went beyond one chapter.

I can recommend to you Cold Blood linkffn(5786099) he sort of turns into a half-dragon (not due to his ancestry), but only in a minor way like wings, claws and fire breath.

Also, thanks for the Breath of the Inferno. I'll check it out.
