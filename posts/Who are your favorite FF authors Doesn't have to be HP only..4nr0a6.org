The ones you follow and read every new story or chapter from, or the ones you always fall back on when you want something to read again?


** Current: FloreatCastellum, Jacobk

All Time: Deadwoodpecker, Arabella, Inverarity, Lady Altair, Opalish

Most of my favorite stories are by authors who have only one story, so I can't really include them here.

** I'm a big Jewels5 fan (which is apparently a somewhat controversial opinion, but I'll stick with it anyway -- The Life and Times is literally my go-to fic whenever I need something to read that'll make me feel good) and, of course, Inverarity is amazing (not that you all didn't know that anyway!)

** Mostly defunct now: JBern, Nonjon, TheUnrealInsomniac, James Spookie probably a ton more. If I like a fic I'll normally have a look at the author's other HP stuff.

*** TheUnrealInsomniac resumed writing in March, and posted chapter one of a new fic 3 days ago.

***** And I only realized because your comment made me check his profile, on the off chance that The Amalgamation Agreement updated.

** It's got to be enembee, Roarian, Shinysavage, Voice of the Nephilim and RustyRed - in no particular order. No matter how sharp a turn my tastes might take, I always end up meandering back for a re-read in this little cluster.

** Loopy777's work in the /Avatar: the Last Airbender/ fandom has been nothing but good. I haven't read most of his more recent stuff because I haven't really made the time, and he's rather prolific, but he's very consistent, he can put together an effective and suspenseful plot masterfully, and his characterisations are always spot-on.

In the HP fandom, Inverarity is my favourite author, bar none. /Alexandra Quick/ is a straight-up masterpiece - there is nothing else in the fandom that reaches its level. A few come close, though.

** Cxjenious and JMenace, with an honorable mention for Eilyfe, because I've only read one of his stories, but it quickly shot to my top 10. I like JMenace and Eilyfe for their Naruto stories.

** Jacobk, ofc, because badass Hermione is something I always want in my life. Also, his work for Naruto fic was pretty good too.

KuraiBites is one I'll always go back to to check for updates, because they're excellent but fairly spread out.

On the non-Potter front, J.Peterson of the Frozen fandom gets a mention for the single best Elsanna story I have ever seen. Possibly the best romance writing I've seen on fanfiction.net. It has under 200 reviews, go figure. Cannot recommend them enough, even if I haven't read all of their stuff. Check out 'Locked Away'. J.Peterson's ability to evoke emotion through description of body language, and characterisation, just... unf. I can't even.
