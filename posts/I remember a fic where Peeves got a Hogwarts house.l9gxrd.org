:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think it was something about Harry getting thrown out of Gryffindor by vote caused by Ron and then he and a couple of friends got their own Hogwarts house with a small table in the great hall and everything. Peeves was the House ghost. Don't remember anything else about it. I wonder if it was good even, I don't know.

Any help is nice :)


** House Peeves is in this, not sure if there's another one.

  What if when Draco challenged Harry to a duel at the beginning of first year it had a lot more significance then either realized? A duel not only for bragging rights but for injustice and eventual love. Harry/Harem
