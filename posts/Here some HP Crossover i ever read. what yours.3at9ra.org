sorry. Harry-centric. NO HAREMS. SLASH is alright. AU.

Fics I have read (and enjoyed):

So, I've read a lot of crossovers (more than is listed, definitely). Basically, I want something that's been posted fairly recently, or is outside of my usual fandoms.

*HP/Naruto*

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/442432][Sneaking around konoha]]\\
  Loneliness was not for him, Harry knew that. Then he met Kakashi and he found a solution to his problem.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4041715][But Baby Nobody Has Ever Kissed As Well As You Do]]\\
  Because it's kind of a given that it took someone literally magical to really catch and hold Kakashi's interest. KakashixFemHarry

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6428527/1/Newton-s-Third-Law][Newton's Third Law]]\\
  How would the Naruto and Harry Potter worlds change if Harry was raised the traditional Hatake way?

*HP/Ironman*

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3942424][Stranger in a Familiar land]]\\
  Tony Stark is a complicated guy, with many secrets. One of which is that he is very lonely, despite his money and fame, he has few true friends and no real idea what to do with himself outside of Iron Man. Which is all anyone ever seems to want, except Pepper. Pepper hates Iron Man, but he can't change what he is.\\
  Harry Potter has no idea what the hell is happening and isn't sure that he likes any of it, but he can't go back, can't undo what has been done, ever. A new life, new people, and a new world. None of which he wanted in the first damned place. Apparently what he wants doesn't seem to matter.\\
  The only direction is forward, for both of them. (Tony/Harry)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11200075/1/The-Stark-Chronicles][The Stark Chronicles]]\\
  Harry discovers about a cousin he never thought he had. The cousin turns out to be none other than Tony Stark. Watch as Tony and Harry find family in each other. No slash. Family fic. Scrambled timeline.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9935403/1/Petal][Petal]]\\
  Nine years after the Final Battle, Amaryllis Potter found herself working long shifts in a private hospital in New York City, combining Muggle and magical Healing. The war never really let her go.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10190188/1/Everything-I-do][Everything I do]] (AU) - As any parent will tell you, there is nothing they would not do for their child.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/653038][Proof That Tony Stark Has a Heart]] With Voldemort defeated and Harry turning seventeen, the elder Weasley boys decide to give him a chance to be a normal teenager for a while; namely, by buying him a ticket to Malibu, California. But of course, Harry Potter can never do anything normally. Especially not once he meets Tony Stark in a club, and begins a holiday romance that leaves him with more than just memories.

*HP/Avenger*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8214834/1/The-Sum-Of-All-Your-Fears][The Sum Of All Your Fears]]\\

*HP/Sherlock*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10445823/1/Patience-Rewards-Itself][Patience Rewards Itself]] Sebastian Moran's job was simple this time; 'fix' Vernon Dursley. He was prepped to do it. He had no problem doing it. That is, until he sees an unidentified boy with no record of existence at the residence thrown out of the home. Thus, Harry Potter gains a (admittedly unconventional) family, Jim gets a protégé and Seb just hopes that Harry won't wind up quite as...off as his Dad
