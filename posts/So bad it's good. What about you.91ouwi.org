You ever have those fics that are so bad, filled with every horrid trope ever. It is just sheer cringe and yet it's so bad you can't tear your eyes from it, like a car wreck? I found one tonight. It had:

-Harry as the heir and descendant of Gryffindor, Slytherin (And 20 chapters later we found out Ravenclaw as well!)

-Evil Dumbledore, ALL of Gryffindor House, All Weasleys, All of the ministry (Besides a few Unspeakables), most of the wizarding world

-Dumbledore paid everyone off to be friends with harry, using, you guessed it, Harry's vast wealth from being a Black-Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw.

-Harry is abused horribly at his relatives, extreme, with Dumbledore giving them the tools (Fire whip included!) to do so.

-Snape and Harry fall in love by Chapter 3

-Oh and Harry is Duke of three Counties?!??! in England btw.

-Snape takes Harry to Voldemort to protect him from Dumbledore and his relatives, Voldemort tells harry to call him Tom, and becomes his mentor and father figure, and bonds him and Snape. Lucius becomes his uncle and Draco his brother (Even though they were prior boyfriends). Harry becomes a Death Eater!

-Harry has powers! Tons! Obviously from being Gryffindor and Slytherin's heir, OH! Don't forget Morgana! He is a shadow-walker (He can teleport even in hogwarts!), he is an elemental (GASP), he is also a Mind-Bender--meaning he can control someone's mind without spells! He can break through any occlumency shield and use legilimency, he also can control Inferi, Dementors and other dark creatures!, He is also a demon-realm controller, being able to summon and control demons and perform necromancy! He is also a Free-Power controller, he can easily do wandless, wordless magic with only intent and poof! AND he is a muti-animagus

-If that wasn't enough, he is also more powerful than Merlin! In fact Filius did a spell to reveal the five strongest wizards of all time, Voldemort was number 2, Snape number 4, 3 and 5 were nobodies and of course number 1 was harry.

-Also Good Goblins!

I just can't help myself. I can not be the only one who every once in a while indulges in a cringe fest? There has to be some other fics I'd enjoy wincing through.

*** My favorite character is Snape, so when I was making the decision to read it or not I scrounged the 'net to see if he was in it. Needless to say the terribly OOC Snape made me want to pour bleach in my eyes. I refuse to read it!

I don't know why some bad fanfiction is okay when im in the mood, while others are like 'no' but perhaps it's because JK has the gall to call that shit canon.

**** Yea I have no idea what she was thinking. It couldn't have been about money. After saying for years the series is over and she wouldn't right another story I can't believe she let them make it official. Reading that I am pretty sure that's what people who grew up with Star Wars and saw phantom menace felt. But at least the prequels have quarks and some charm to them in their horrible dialogue. Cursed child is just an abomination.
