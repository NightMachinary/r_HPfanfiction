Looking for any fic were Harry takes on everything by himself. Preferably right before Deathly Hallows. Not looking for betrayal fics but more like he is smart and independent and does things on his own so his loved ones do't get hurt because of him. Thanks!


** Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) has a fairly solo-esque Harry but from before 1st year up to 5th or 6th.

** Linkffn( A Fallen God by Hostiel) Not right before Deathly Hallows but Harry is highly independent in this. He has a fragment of Loki in his head, kills the Dursleys (By accident Loki kinda manipulated him into doing it), and from then on just pretty much does whatever he wants he doesn't go to Hogwarts until his fourth year.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.
