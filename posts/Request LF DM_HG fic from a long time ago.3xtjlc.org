Back before I had really got into fanfic I started with dramione. Some were awful but there was this one cute one I read that I never saved anywhere. Wondering if anyone will recognize it. So it starts in 7th/8th year with the head boy/head girl joint dorms thing, anyway they end up sleeping together semi-regularly even after hogwarts, when Ron asks her to marry him a few years later Hermione goes back to Draco for one last night of fun. Time skip ~16-17 yrs to the epilogue (canon compliant) and when she sees Draco at the train station they meet for coffee or something. I'm not sure what happens to lead to this but Hermione and Ron break up and somehow Rose is injured at school and so is Scorpius. Draco and Hermione both show up and somehow find out that rose is actually Draco's daughter. Eventually they move in together and have a nice little happy ending. If this sounds at all familiar I'd really appreciate it. This one bugged me for a long time.


** It sounds familiar, but I can't think of it off the top of my head. Do you remember when it was written, or which website it was on, or roughly how long it was?

*** Would have been around 2010 I read it, but it was complete at the time, it was on fan fiction.net and it was at least 100K words maybe more. Was probably rated M, at least teen. I don't think it had lemons but it might have.
