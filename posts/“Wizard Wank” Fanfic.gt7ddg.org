I seriously do not understand the point of authors that love to have Muggles be more advanced than the WW. Why are you writing HP fan fiction if you're so obsess with normality?

Anyway, please recommend your favorite Wizards are better than Muggles fan fictions. I don't care if it's about how Purebloods are better than Muggleborn or if it's just Magicals are better than Muggles.

Also wanted: fan fictions that are about the potential of magic (not MOR).

Please no ff that is primarily about romance. Pairings are fine as long as there is a plot to the story.

In some cases they are indeed better than the WW. Not overall better, but thems the breaks.

ANYWHO~

*Mischief's Heir* (series) - Marvel Crossover - AU - linkao3(4629198)\\
Summer leading to second year, Harry makes a prayer to Loki to rescue him from the Dursleys. This upsets the plans of someone powerful.

There's someone responsible for all of the Dark Lords, and engineered everything. It explains a few of the canon plot inconsistencies. Like why the blood war happened when everyone was that closely related with each other. Or how the British Wizarding World was so... archaic in some spots.

There's what looks to be bashing in some spots, mainly Ron and Hermione, but they are the victim of the above plot. Once that plotpoint was finished, Harry starts a club to advance the magical world and start the first magical space program to relocate magicals offplanet. Not by making muggle items work, but by making some magical versions.

It gets all drama-y and crafty later on. Especially when Shield/Hydra show up. So it's not like it isn't always smooth sailing. And it does get into "Wizard Wank" with the mugglebashing speeches.

** I'm all right with Wizard wank as long as I don't see any Muggle items used by wizards. So no Hogwarts Express, no Knight Bus, no wireless, no camera, no gramophone, etc. Have the AU wizards come up with their own, non-Muggle-inspired versions of the above items. These were all created after the Statute was signed, so there's no excuse for wizards having them (other than laziness). Stealing inventions from an 'inferior' race that doesn't know that you exist makes you superior? Sounds hypocritical to me but okay.

I want to see real innovation by wizards. Things that Muggles don't have, like Vanishing Cabinets for transportation, not magicked-up Muggle rip-offs.

** My WIP linkffn(13599804) explores the idea of how wizards develop technologies by increasing and manipulating an object's consciousness in contrast to muggles who develop technologies by increasing and manipulating an object's intelligence.

To put it plainly, Riddle's minions control the muggle government through variations of the imperius, confundus, amortentia, and legilimency.

My fanfic diverges from when Riddle graduates Hogwarts and decides to do something about the Cold War since the world might become a nuclear bomb wasteland if he doesn't intervene. So he begins to recruit Death Eaters to help dismantle nuclear bombs and imperius muggle officials into thinking it's a very very bad idea to use nuclear bombs. Then Riddle finds out he likes imperiusing the government, sets a couple of people on magical research into how to control people, and has a magical revolution.

I have not yet written everything in the above paragraph into the story, but at the present there are hints.

The actual plot of the story has to do with the Blacks and how they're going to replace Riddle at the top of the food chain because he's being too unstable. There will also be plenty of magical theory discussion, mostly through Regulus because I wrote him as a researcher.

*** I got the idea of consciousness vs intelligence from Kai-Fu Lee's Artificial Intelligence book and thought it was incredibly applicable to the mind controlling magic of HP.

In this story, magic stems from the ability to manipulate consciousness. Wingardium Leviosa? You are introducing consciousness to a feather and instructing it to float. Alohomora? You are introducing consciousness to a door and making it open. Stupefy? You are mildly invading the person's mind and manipulating them into sleep.
