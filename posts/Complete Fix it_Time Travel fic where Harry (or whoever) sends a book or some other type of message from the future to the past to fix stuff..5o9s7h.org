Rather than physically or mentally going back in time they send a very detailed book with articles or whatnot telling how to fix things so people don't die, etc.


** Unfortunately the only fics that I know of like that are "Reading the Books" fics, and they are only found at fictionthunt.com.

** The only one I've seen that does this to any extent is Harry Potter and Fate's Debt linkffn(2479927). Not complete though I believe the author was moving it to another site.

Future Harry sends a three line note back to his eleven year old self telling him to get to know Ginny Weasley. Soul Bond hi-jinx ensue.

** Im pretty sure this one fits. Its denuleos and the lone traveler series, one of his earlier works.

Instead of going around and fixing everything in this particular universe, he only fixes most of it. Voldemort is removed and serius is freed as well as /all/ of the horcruxes.

After that, he leaves a letter for younger Harry and calls it a day. I never finished reading it because denuelos' stuff can be pretty over the top, and i didnt rwally find a story with all the major conflicts removed to be interesting.

However, it does go into detail the results of the letter and therefore fits your criteria.

  A spin-off of my Lone Traveler stories (Lone Traveler originally from The Professional). Harry gets a proper introduction with some insights from an alternate self who has lived it. What does he do with this information? How would his attitudes change?

**** It's a fic title. I read it a few months ago, but basically a few years into the future following Voldemort's canon defeat (but ignoring the epilogue/any Pottermore-provided nonsense) there are a series of violent tragedies. A small child (named Aurelian) is sent back in time by his desperate mother to give him a chance at a normal life and give her past self and her friends time to save the day. It was interesting.

  Two years after the war, a young stranger pays a visit to the burrow. His arrival alone is baffling, but the news he brings of an upcoming war turns the world upside down. Hermione's quiet, post-war life will never be the same.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12151770/1/Transport-Medium][THIS]] is a one-shot I wrote. It was written as a companion piece to a Cursed Child fix I started but put on hold. It's complete in itself but was intended to go along with another story and if you haven't read CC it will make absolutely no sense. /shrugs/
