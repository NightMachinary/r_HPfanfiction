Has this ever been done ? What would the effects be ?

To explain, with this I mean a Nymphadora Tonks that is born physically resembling Bellatrix Lestrange to an uncanny degree when she is not actively morphing her features. Bonus points if she ever loses her powers and accidentally gets arrested for looking like her aunt that is on the run.


** There is one where she does look nearly identical to Bellatrix but I can't for the life of me remember it!! I think she was with Charlie or bill, pretty sure it was on fanfiction.net and was relatively Harry centric, sorry I couldn't be more help!!

** Does she even have a "base form"? I mean a metamorph is what he or she (hell, do they even truly have a gender?) wants to be...so Tonks would never look like Bellatrix if she doesn't want to (we don't even know if Tonks reverts to a supposed base form in her sleep, when knocked out or even when dead!)...hm...

*** Yes, it includes a heart-shaped face and mousy, brown hair. She might also have dark, brown eyes.

** I am not convinced Metamorphagus have a base form. I mean Teddy Lupin became to change appareance the moment he was born, and apparently Nymphadora was exactly the same. And I always considered this talent to be more "permanent", like resistant to Thief Downfall permanent.

Since Harry didn't make any special comment when her dead in the Great Hall, I believe that her body kept her last appareance after her death.

Also, considering Andromeda already looks a lot like Bellatrix (enough for Harry to make the mistake when waking up) as a nicer and not ex convict version, she seems more in danger to be arrested than her daughter (and her age is closer too).

** I used something similar in my stories, even though I detest the concept of a FIXED base form. While I agree that there has to be a base form the metamorph reverts to when dead or knocked out, I say it shifts to represent the personality of the metamorph. So Tonks base in book 5 would be the pink hair and the heart-shaped face, while after Sirius' death it would be the downtrodden version.

We know that Tonks morphs a little when she gets mad about her name, so I decided to take that a step further and made her shift into a Bellatrix-lookalike whenever she is protective or wants to come across as menacing. And she more consciously does the shifts to scare people or have fun at their expense.

** From what I can remember, pretty much every fic I've seen mentioning Tonks' "base form" has a scene where her and Harry end up in bed together and she reverts to form while she's asleep and Harry sees that she resembles Bellatrix.

*** The Merging has a scene like this where Harry and Tonks have a heart to heart and Tonks explains that she hates looking like Bellatrix.
