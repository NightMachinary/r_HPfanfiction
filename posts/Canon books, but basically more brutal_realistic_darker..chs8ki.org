(Title) Where dark magic is much more common, Voldemort is much more smart, pureblood politics actually have a base, more major character deaths (Ron or Hermione, whatever)


** The flashbacks in dimensional travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/][The Granger Principle]], linkffn(13312738), exactly cover this darker canon. Poor Hermione really went through some shit, and that Voldemort was far more cunning. But the Luna in this new world is very fun.

#+begin_quote
  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
