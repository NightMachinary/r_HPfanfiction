I'm looking for any length fanfic with Snape as the main character. I prefer him to be similar to canon or a good guy as opposed to a horrible piece of shit. I enjoy his complexity. Can be any rating, any trope, any pairing, etc...

Thanks!


** Why is this downvoted, jeez.

Anyway, I have one that is complete and one that is in progress. I hope you'll find I've captured his complexity!

Please tell me what you think!

  The Prince's Very Extended Tale - The story from Snape's perspective, as he struggles to redeem himself with help from an unexpected ally.Definitely meant for adults (dark themes, not smut). Complete (until I rewrite). I love reading people's comments so please leave them, positive and negative comments are welcome.

  AU, diverges from canon after Snape tries to apologize to Lily. Regulus Black is nothing like his brother, and when he and Severus cross paths, nothing can stop them or come in their way.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
