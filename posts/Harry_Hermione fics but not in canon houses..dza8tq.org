I haven't read any fics of the pairing, but as someone who likes Haphne and Harry Fleur, I want to expand my horizons. Preferably Slytherin Harry, but I'll read anything good with Harmione. :)


** Just finished linkffn(9766604) ... not bad, considering how much I usually dislike slytherin!canonicalPerson.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  Hermione Granger is special. She's always know it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr

** There's a fic called The Reclamation of Black Magic by ShayaLoonie. Harry is in Gryffindor and Hermione is in Slytherin. It's a WIP though. The [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] subreddit community recommends some good HHr fics. They are organising a book club, you might find some interesting stories there and if I'm not mistaken someone is compiling a master list or something.
