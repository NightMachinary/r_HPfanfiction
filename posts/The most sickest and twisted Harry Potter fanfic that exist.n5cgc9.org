**** Evil Be Thou was great, sadly a lot of the actual "evil" Harry stuff comes off like it's written by a 13 year old. If you like crossovers, The Stormreaver by Faykan is really good, and still updating.

  Brick and his brothers are forced to change their lives completely when Him appears and makes his demands. But matters of the heart and mind get in the way, and choices must be made. What if you're not what you thought you were? What if you never were? What if you don't have a choice? My own spin on a PPG high school fic.

**** Ah no I don't read genderbend fics. I love fics in which characters go dark but those are mostly (solely) slash. You could check out this series of fics which are basically just smut but maybe you find something you like. Only het pairings, rather controversial/dark tropes and sick stuff

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
