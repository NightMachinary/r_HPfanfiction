There was a fic I read years ago, before I had a ff.net account. It featured a Harry Potter that had traveled back in time and ended up teaching Defense at Hogwarts when his younger double was there. What set this one apart was that at some point in the future, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and I believe Nevile, but not sure about him, took part in a ritual which gave them the elemental powers. Harry took fire and Hermione took air. It is revealed that Hermiome betrayed them to Voldemort because the ritual changed them. Also they took different names once they took the ritual.
