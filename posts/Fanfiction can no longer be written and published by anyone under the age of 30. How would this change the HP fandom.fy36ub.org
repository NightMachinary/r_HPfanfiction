As in, people are somehow physically unable to write and/or publish fanfiction, until they are (at least) 30 years old. I.e. no under-30s asking anybody allowed to post stories for them.

How would this change HP fanfic? Positives AND negatives?

What storylines would (suddenly) become popular? Inversely, what storylines would be 'rendered extinct' by the age restriction?

What if the age restriction became 40 and over? 20 and under?

Bonus: How would this affect other fandoms?


** It would get worse, since fewer people would be writing it and fewer people would have the chance to hone their writing skills.

** You know the satisfaction of following a story, and being able to witness the author improving with every chapter, even if it's the little things? Yeah, that'd be much harder to come by. I've never seen anyone else mention this part of reading fanfiction (or following any young and independent artist, really) but it's one of my most favourite parts of the experience, so I'd be pretty sad, I guess.

Also, things would get even more stale. Only a specific age group means less diversity, and all that.

** No!!!!! Lol.

Something to consider is that 'older' writers (like myself) grew up with Harry Potter as it was being released. We got the books in installments. We had several years between releases to imagine what was going to be in the next book. Think of all the canon that didn't come out until book 5 or 6 or 7 (the Order, horcruxes, the prophecy, character deaths, etc). So there is a lot of fan-fiction that went in a completely different direction from the original novels - which is why I think we have so many categories of AU after 4th or 5th or 6th year. Sometimes writers didn't like the direction of the later books. I remember at times feeling frustrated because I wanted something to happen that didn't, or I thought the books were leading up to something and then was disappointed when I was wrong. Now consider younger writers who got to read all the books at once. I think their focus has been more on what happens /after/ book 7, because they didn't necessarily have to wait years between books.

Bonus: I think this is true for a lot of fandoms. If you are growing up with something that is released in installments, you have time to hope for something to happen in the next book, or next movie, or next series. You get disappointed if it doesn't happen, or angry if they treat your favorite character wrong. You rage against canon. You write your alternate endings and give your favorite characters the happy or tragic endings that you wanted.

For someone who gets to binge watch/read the entire source material, there's less time for that angst to grow. Take the Marvel Movie Universe, for example. How many early stories have Phil Coulson in them? A bunch! People had opinions about Phil Coulson! Emotions were fresh and left to fester for years. People guessed at what would happen with his character. But as the universe went on, his arc was solidified. To everyone playing 'catch up' and binge watching the movies, his was a minor character arc that maybe didn't need a lot of attention. Or the recent Star Wars sequels. How many stories tried to guess at Rey's origins, or provide a background for Finn or Poe? Now we know the official answers to those questions. To someone watching Marvel or Star Wars all at once, they are more content in accepting the answers provided by canon. But for those of us waiting years for the next installment, we formed our opinions. We dreamed and guessed and hoped and plotted. We were... disappointed at times. So an 'older' writer might tear apart canon more and depart from the plot. Someone younger might write more sequels to the canon, jumping off where their story left off.

Obviously, this is not true for everyone. There are plenty of younger writers out there more than happy to write an alternate 5th or 6th year, and there are older writers who are now writing more traditional sequels, stemming from the canon provided. But, I do think that this is a trend. And this has turned into a rant that part of me wants to delete because it's so long... but I won't because I have strong opinions about fanfic, lol.

** A lot less would be written, but as Robst and the person who wrote HP and the Angry Seven are well over 30, I doubt quality would see significant improvement.

** Average quality would definitely improve. It's true that a 30-plus isn't necessarily a good writer, but the chances of a ninth grader writing quality fiction are close to zero.

*** But you would lose out on all of the fics from young adults, college and the majority of graduate students, which comprises a big amount of the fic-writers right now. As someone else mentioned, age wouldn't necessarily help with quality. Even if it should be expected that things like grammar would improve (which I don't think is a given), I agree with the person who said that things would get stale. I think that's absolutely true.

**** Saying that the quality would stay the same is assuming that the quality of work by young adults is superior to that of middle-aged individuals, since it's a given that teenage authors are less capable on average.

If we assume that the quality of writing by all adults (let's say twenty and over) is on average the same then just taking the subset of fanfictions written by middle-aged authors would result in an average superior quality, that's all. Of course there would also be way fewer works.

I'm not saying that aging makes you a better writer beyond a certain point, I'm saying that the average quality of writing is better when you've excluded teenage-written shit.

***** I didn't say the quality would stay the same, nor did I say it would decrease or improve. My exact words were that, "age wouldn't necessarily help with quality." What I said was, "I agree with the person who said that things would get stale," which I stand by. If you limited the writing of fiction to a particular demographic of any kind, it would get stale. Having different voices in writing is critical, even if not everyone is contributing the same caliber of material.

The quantity of poorly written "original" fiction would actually counter the argument of middle-aged authors creating works of a superior quality. There's a good amount of self-published fiction that suffers from a lack of editing, and that problem would only increase for fanfics, as there are a lot of people who do minimal/no editing when they write. While there are many examples of great older adult writers whose works are of a superior quality, this is far from standard for most writers. Age helps, but the main advantage age has is that a person would have had more time to hone their skills. But a 30-something writer who was just getting started is not going to have that advantage. A lot of fanfic writers tend to be newer writers, I doubt this would be much different for older writers, though of course there are plenty of exceptions (given that there are quite a few famous authors who have written fan fiction even after having their own works successfully published).

The quality of the writing alone isn't all that compromises the quality of a work. Yes it is an important factor, but the idea, the premise, of a work itself also contributes to quality. You would be losing out on a lot of creative premises if the works of everyone under 30 were lost. Even if you reduce that down to 20, that would account in loses, because not all teenagers have awful, overly cliche ideas, just like there are a lot of people over 30 who write the most unoriginal crap imaginable. The vast majority of fan fiction is "shitty," but, again, you can make that same argument for published works, which are overwhelmingly written by adults. So even if a lot of the poorly conceptualized fics would disappear, you would still have plenty of lower quality works too.

There's also the issue of quality having an aspect of subjectivity within it, but subjectivity is an issue with a lot of things, so I'll leave that point alone.

** I've read many good stories by college age writers. So there would be fewer good stories to enjoy. Now, if you out the age limit as 18, that could improve the average quality due to immature, inexperienced writers not writing drivel.
