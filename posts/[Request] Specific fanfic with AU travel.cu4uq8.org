:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a fic where harry travel to a world where his parents are alive, he has sisters and lily is cheating on james with narcisa malfoy


** I might have read this one back in 2017. Was it the abandoned one where Draco had a sister and Harry was paired with Tracey Davis? That is the only one i can think of right now.

EDIT: The fic I was takking about might have been removed from fanfiction.net so yeah. Although Iam curious to see fics like this
