Maybe some of these could be repurposed into fanfic character names!

[[https://5by5.substack.com/p/5x5-harry-potter-character-or-scientific][This is from a crossword blog I follow,]] and I'm a bit embarrassed to say I didn't do all that well...

*Harry Potter Character, or Scientific Name for an Amphibian?*

1.  Acris Blanchardi
2.  Anaxyrus Canorus
3.  Blaise Zabini
4.  Lithobates Palustris
5.  Newt Scamander
6.  Litoria Rubella
7.  Nymphadora Tonks
8.  Spea Bombifrons
9.  Nagini
10. Trimeresurus Salazar

Answers are in the link if you want to check how you did. I hit 6/10.


** Maybe I've read the books too many times, but I would say this is too easy:

Amphibians/reptiles: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

Harry Potter characters: 3, 5, 7, 9,

I read the answers after and see that #10, Trimeresurus Salazar, is listed as "both" because the Salazar part was from HP, but honestly, most of the animal names here include the name of the scientist that first studied them, and Salazar is a common enough name in Europe and Latin America. It's rather cheeky to say, "this reptile partially named for a Harry Potter character counts as a Harry Potter character".
