  It was on the tip of Pansy's tongue to tell Weasley to beat it, that she was not so far fallen that she'd shag the likes of him, but, then, she began to think seriously about what sleeping with Weasley would mean. Soon enough, he would sober up, come to his senses, realize what he had done, and then... Pansy grinned in anticipation for what he would promise for her silence.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Pansy in this story is a lot smarter than in canon, although she still started out as Draco's bigoted girlfriend.

*** How is Patron, by the way? I prefer HHr and I've heard good reviews of it but I dislike fics where muggleborns are shown as extremely oppressed and as being treated like dirt by the evil pureblood government.

I don't mind AUs at all, but remember that, in canon, while there /is/ blood-ist discrimination, several muggleborns (such as Cresswell) become successful. Hermione faces no prejudice from non-Slytherins despite seemingly being a slap in the face of pureblood supremacy. I just don't fancy reading depressing stories about muggle born hatred.

Anyway, does this story overdo on the "muggleborn plight" element?

Thanks.

**** That AU is depressing, but ends on a very hopeful note.

The two Dumbledores and Voldemort are very impressive in that story.

***** Muggleborns (which is a legal, not a biological definition in the story - most "muggleborns" are born to magicals and inherit the status from their parents, only a few are born to actual muggles) are not treated as dirt by the government in "Patron". They live pretty much like the majority of purebloods. But legally, there are restrictions on who they can marry, and they have a "Patron". Which, ironically, has about the same power over them as the Head of the Family has over the rich purebloods who do not choose to be emancipated (which the vast majority of the purebloods do upon reaching their adulthood) since that would cut them off from the family fortune.

So, most of the "plight" is Hermione and Harry worrying about whether or not they'll be able to marry (there are a few ways to achieve that, outside changing the laws).

I'd not call the story depressing - I generally aim to write happier endings than canon.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
