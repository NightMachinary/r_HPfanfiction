I can't remember a whole lot about this one as it's been a couple years, but I do know that Harry receives a letter from Riddle, he's able to enter into a secret room that Regulus's ghost or spirit can't leave, and Sirius accuses Harry of going dark and joining Voldemort.

Last I saw it was on Fanfiction.net and it was complete, IIRC. Sorry it's not much to go on, but I've been trying to find it and I'm hoping you fine folks will be able to help me out. Thanks.

*** Yeah if I find it, I'll definitely let you know. From what I remember I thought it was a pretty good story.
