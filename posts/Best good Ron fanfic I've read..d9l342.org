I found this fanfic so good that I couldn't leave you all without reading it.


** They mention it at the end of Not Dumbledore, but Sekrit Project by Chilord has a great Ron

*** I think "recommendation" would be a better flair, but talking up a fic is hardly against the rules.

** Try linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan)

Brilliant Ron foc that updates twice a week and is over 1.4 million words. And it has an original quality story and genuinely surprises you.

*** This gets really bad, really quickly. It's just a shitty OP-Harry with Ron instead. There's literally paragraphs devoted to everyone heaping praise on how smart he is

**** To be fair, it definitely does some new things that I haven't really seen in fanfic before. It's also very clear on the fact that Ron has a lot of flaws and some severe issues to work through, which is a rarity in a lot of OP Whoever fics.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
