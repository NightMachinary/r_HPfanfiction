Does anyone know what happened to this story, or if it will be reposted? I went to link it to a friend today, and it was gone and I was sad. Phenomenal writing if a bit prosey, and an incredibly interesting story, despite being super dark and starting with the (repeated) raping (semi-consensual? sacrifice for the greater good? I dunno) of the protagonist.

Also, if the author writes originals if someone could link me that direction I'd be interested as well.


** They pulled it down because of stuff happening on AO3 as far as I could gather on their Tumblr. They do have a [[http://nocturnememory.tumblr.com/][personal site]] that it might get rehosted on after their break.

**** I don't know. Something = something with the author. I only skimmed their blog, I'm sure you can find more there
