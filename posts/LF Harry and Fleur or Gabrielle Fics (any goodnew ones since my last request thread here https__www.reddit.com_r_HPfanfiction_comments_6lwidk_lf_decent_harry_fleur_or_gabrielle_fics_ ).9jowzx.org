The Title says it all really, take a look at the last thread if you are interested, it really was rather good.

** I suppose I could recommend my own that I have been updating for the last 9-10 months. It's Harry/Fleur, starts at the beginning of Half-Blood Prince and gradually diverges from that point. linkffn(12792189)

#+begin_quote
  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges, like a certain French witch, test his strength of will.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12627473/1/The-Half-Blood-Romantic]])

The only one I could really think of to be honest. I skimmed that thread and didn't see this one there.

Still updates, and tackles it in a better way than a lot of them do. Bill seems like a decent enough guy and doesn't turn into and asshole just for plot convenience.

Not perfect, but certainly serviceable.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12809637/1/A-Godfather-s-Promise]]) Be warned that it's a little heavy on the BDSM and fetish aspect with Harry as a dominant and Fleur as a submissive (nothing too intense, but it's a main focal point). It's pretty fluff however, and not your typical Master!Harry type story.

It's also not exclusively Harry/Fleur, as the author has confirmed that it's Harry/Multi so don't bother if you're looking for a single pairing.

There are a few grammatical mistakes but the author has said that English is not his first language and that he's working on fixing them, but it's a competent read.

  A promise made before the fateful night changed the future of Harry Potter-Black. Now on his fourth year, he has to face the Triwizard Tournament, his failing friendships, and live up to his ancestors. All of this while dealing with an increasing attraction to a French flower.

  Harry is left with a lasting legacy. He is given a most curious object in the form of a dragon egg, the last of its kind in the hopes that it will hatch for him. Two will become one, bonded for eternity. Matched only by the bond of love. The power of that bond will give him strength to stand against his enemies. Good Dumbledore, no bashing. FleurxHarry romance, slow burn.

** Since I see no good Harry/Gabrielle stories I will recommend my own. I am updating weekly and it will likely be close to 200k words at least, it will be the first in a trilogy. And I only posted it in December so I can pretty much assume you haven't read it. linkffn(13160344)

  Book 1 of a Trilogy. Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.

** No one really mentioned linkffn(Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble by DriftWood1965) It's Harry/Fleur/Gabby/Hermione, so if you don't like all of them together you won't like it, but it's pretty good. Not finished yet, but it doesn't seem abandoned.

  Harry helps Fleur in the second task of GOF and pays the price. HP/Fleur/Gabrielle/Hermione. A Veela bonding fic based on love. T Rated and it will stay that way. Thirteen year old Almost fourteen Gabrielle to start the story. Good Dumbledore.
