I know there's only 5 chapters released so far, but damnit I want more, and I want it now. This is why I hate reading WIP lol, I want to read more of this story but I have to wait for new chapter releases! Ugh!!!


** It may be the greatest fanfic ever written, but I will not read it.

I don't like the idea of paying people for writing fanfiction. If there's anything that will make authors and publishers crack down on fanfiction, it's this bullshit. Seriously, if stuff like this will lead to the termination of fanfiction as we know it, I'll be /pissed/.

What the fic author is doing, is make money by using another's work, which isn't a part of the Public Domain. And since I doubt they're cutting JK in on the deal, they are breaking the law. It's practically stealing.

So no, The Black's Resurgence gets no upvotes from me.

*** I'll read it (eventually), I just won't give the dude money. If the completed fic finds its way to FFN, then fine - I have it bookmarked. Otherwise? Meh.

I do like me some time travel redos, but my upbringing makes it difficult to justify buying actual books let alone fanfiction - the joys of having a librarian mother.

I do buy some books, and I have quite a few... But a good chunk are from used book shops or are from local authors that I'd like to support.

My mom and I did have multiple arguments about spending money on books over the years though lol.

***** And you /paid/ actual money for the privilege of accessing the story. Which means the author recieves payment for content which features intellectual properties that do not belong to them.

That's the issue I have with people who do this. Fanfiction exists /solely/ by the good graces of the authors and the publishers.

If this becomes more common than it is now, fanfiction is going to have a hard time. At least, it won't have an official home like ot does now.

And there's no need to get personal.

****** Nah, fanfiction won't have a hard time.

There are a shitton of other artists already profiting from copyrighted material, making money with it.\\
People draw characters and sell these pictures for money. There is a huge market for more sexual art of famous games, books, movie characters. The artists of those make lots of money with it.\\
Singers on YT make money through Patreon by singing famous songs from games, movies, etc.

Why is wanting some donations for extra chapters in fanfiction so much worse?

And Patreon stuff is a grey zone anyway. As long an author doesn't block his stuff entire behind a paywall, and doesn't demand money in exchange for chapters - but offer chapter in exchange for donations, nothing is illegal.

****** Dude how do you not understand that there is in no way a requirement to pay money to read the story. It is there if you want early access. The content can still be gotten for /free/ if your willing to wait. I did not want to wait. Like holy shit. It's as if you are completely ignoring that the story IS avaliable for free for those who have more patience.

******* I understand you don't /have/ to pay for it, and if you wait, you can get it for free. The issue is that the option is there, which means they recieve /payment/ from those who choose to support the author.

Sure, it's ultimately free, but the /incentive/ to pay for access to unreleased content is there, because of the delay. I can promise you, that's how the copyright holders will look at it. People have gotten a 'cease and desist' letters for less.

Some professional authors don't even allow fanfiction.net to host fanfics of their work.

A group of people were working on a free remake of KOTOR some tome ago, called Apeiron. They called it a mod, because you had to have a copy of original for it to work. I don't know how that was supposed to work, because the remake was done in Unreal4, while the original was fonevin Aurora. Well, it doesn't matter.

Anyway, it was to be free, but they accepted donations. They essentially accepted money for working on things that /don't belong to them./ And they sure as hell weren't working for Disney.

Well, you don't Mess with The Mouse. The project was shut down. Do not be surprised if the owners of HP catch wind of this eventually, and demand Lee stops his writing. Perhaps they know and don't care, I don't know.

Now, I won't bring this to their attention, because I fear what it may mean, going forward. Fanfiction is already in a very grey area.

Fanfiction and Copyright Fanfiction in its current form is an infringement of copyright. Fanfiction is defined by the use of characters and expression from an original creative work and the creation of derivative works, all of which is illegal under current copyright law (McCardle, 2003). Most fanfiction expands beyond the limited allowances to comment and critique allowed through fair use (Johnson, 2016). They also borrow substantially from the creative work, and fair use is less likely to apply the more of the original substance is copied (McCardle, 2003). As characters typically closely resemble the characters in the original work, and are not hyperbolised to the point of parody, the â€˜parody' fair use argument does not apply. Some characters, settings, and plot elements are also trademarked, serving another avenue for prosecution. (McCardle, 2003). The advent of the Internet and the popularity of fanfiction has presented a challenge in policing and navigating copyright laws to uphold copyright.

But if you want to pay for this, go right ahead, it's your money and your choice.

*** True, but what about these artists that earn money by drawing characters? There is a shitton of them out there.\\
Or musicians that earn money by making covers of other songs from other artists.

Why is fanfiction so much worse?

Fanfiction is something that will always exist, and most authors, if not all, don't block their content behind a paywall, but simply allow people to read ahead in exchange for some pocket money.

Idk, such stuff might encourage more people to write something since they can earn a few hundred bucks at the side.\\
And it keeps the interest for that book up. Without fanfiction, I would have forgotten about Harry Potter until they deliver another movie like Fantastic Beasts.

  The world around him had crumbled as the Ministry fell. He had become the hunted, and with only his wits, resilience and an ominous raven, he'd had to learn to survive. But why was he so compelled to go to the one place he knew he should avoid? The whispers urged him as did the dreams that plagued his sleep. Perhaps Death truly was the beginning...

** It's a good story, but the pacing is painfully slow, and almost nothing of interest happened so far - 70k+ words. If you read the previous stories of the author, this one feels even slower and less rewarding to read because the introduction scenes and so on are so similar in style, adding little new. Feels like rereading the same stuff again.

The first two stories of the author were the best in my opinion. Sure, they were flawed, but they didn't need 100k words or more to get to the interesting stuff. The newest works shift heavily to the emotional problems of Harry and the romance part of the story. /A Flower for the Soul/ was mostly Emo Harry having difficulties opening himself to people, and then he struggled to admit his feelings for Fleur. It felt like reading about the struggles of a high-level introvert. The fight against Voldemort was rather disappointing, to be honest.\\
It lacked the energy the stories /Honor Thy Blood/ and Stepping Back possessed.\\
From my point of view, the major focus of the story was: 'How will Harry and Fleur's relationship develop?' and 'Will Harry manage to open himself up?'

So far, in Whispers of a Raven, it's about 70k+ words, and Harry is still introduced to the world his parents experienced during their youth. And it doesn't look like something significant will happen anytime soon - or that the protagonist will become more active. Most likely, I will have to wait until the 200k words line is crossed to see Harry do something, become active - without being forced into the situation because something bad happened, etc.\\
The way I see it, Harry will struggle to accept his new life, struggle to overcome the emotional trauma of his past life, and struggle to open himself to Narcissa. He will most likely be confused for the majority of the story, struggling to understand the importance of the message told to him in his dreams, struggle to understand his Peverell powers. The most important part for me, the fight against Voldemort, will most likely come short.

I am going to wait until it is finished.

***** Oh I get it. But I do think there has to be a balance. Books aren't supposed to be movies, IE nonstop action. That's the bennifit of written words, you get to build the world up a lot more instead of having to be forced into action sequences nonstop.

I also think the pace so far makes sense with the way the world building has gone. Harry hasn't exactly been idle in a lot of aspects. It makes sense that harry can't really become more proactive yet because voldemort hasn't really come out into the open yet. I think once the cat comes out of the bag were gonna get more of the content you want.
