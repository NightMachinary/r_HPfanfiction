I'm looking for a self insert or time travel story from the point of view of an unaffected character. For instance a fic where Ron is replaced by a self insert or older version of himself but the narration remains from Harry's perspective. I'm sure I've seen the concept before but I can't find any. I don't mind any genre, length, and completeness. Thank you!

  Narcissa wakes with the certain feeling that something is terribly wrong. Draco is acting differently, Narcissa is worried, Lucius is confused, and a meeting inside Madam Malkin's goes very differently from the way it happened the first time around.

** I had the idea to write something like this, so I started one a while back.

Dudley gets SI'd and a Hogwarts letter, and then both he and Harry are kicked out of the Dursley home for bringing in such freakishness.

I've been puttering around with it every now and then, but it's been months and I've only got like 1.5k words.

If I can think up more Plot than just the basic Premise, I'll post it sometime. No guarantees on timeliness.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.
