*** I feel like it is canon, whether you accept it personally or not. Canon for me is the world as Rowling has explicitly created it - which means anything she's said or created directly. CC (from what I've heard) will probably never be a part of my head-canon, but it is 100% canon in my eyes.

I was frustrated by the deaths of so many beloved characters followed by the incongruous epilogue. I'd rather have had an ending like Animorphs if all those deaths were meant to be significant. Same goes for the other forms like interviews. Dumbledore is gay? Sure, it seems plausible. Hermione is black? nope, too late. Cursed Child? as canon as HPMOR

*** When it comes to Slytherin females that could potentially be paired with Harry though, the only ones we receive any sort of characterization for are Pansy and Millicent to a much lesser degree. Pansy isn't exactly a pleasant individual and that great of a person all things considered and Millicent has largely served as the female version of Crabbe and Goyle in the series, so if you're intending to pair Harry with a Slytherin of some sort, you've got slim pickings.

Hence, Daphne Greengrass is used as the stand-in for the Slytherin OC. It's not that you might as well pick any Slytherin OC, but Daphne Greengrass herself might as well /be/ an OC. The only things we directly know about her are:

- She's a Slytherin in Harry's year and took her OWLs in 5th year. (Per /Order of the Phoenix)/
- She's a pureblood, with her family a member of the Sacred 28. (Per Pottermore)
- Her sister, Astoria, later marries Draco Malfoy. Astoria herself suffers from a bloodline curse circa Cursed Child and later moved from a belief in pureblood supremacy to a more egalitarian one concerning Muggles and Muggleborns. (According to Pottermore)
- In [[http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/0,28804,1690753_1695388_1695569,00.html][an interview with /Time/]], Rowling says that Daphne was part of Parkinson's "Slytherin Posse."

My own personal interpretation of Daphne is not as an Ice Queen or anything of the like. My headcanon instead is that *Daphne is a thoroughly plain individual, perhaps a wallflower even*.

She's not significant enough to do anything like joining the Inquistorial Squad---Millicent, the half-blood, plays a more significant role there. She's not invited to the Slug Club meetings either on the train or at Hogwarts: recall that Ginny was able to get in merely with a very well-done Bat Bogey Hex. As such, I don't see Daphne courting much influence among Slytherin, let alone the school in general. As far as school politics is a concern, maybe some people were initially interested in her due to being a member of the Sacred 28, but by and large, she's a nobody.

Zabini pines more after Ginny and Greengrass isn't even mentioned, and Draco passed over her, a girl in his year, for Astoria, two years his junior. So, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that she's not a knockout in the looks department and not the epitome of the female form as she is in various stories.

She may or may not have been the fourth unnamed Slytherin in NEWT Potions class (the other three were Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, and Theodore Nott), but even if she was, she wasn't significant enough for Slughorn or Harry or the others to notice or care about. As such, I do not expect her to be Hermione's peer academically, as she's again portrayed in various stories.

Maybe you can do some interesting things with Daphne possibly also inheriting the bloodline curse. Possibly you could have her as an unwilling, on-and-off member of Parkinson's group: seeing as her sister seems to disavow anti-Muggle and anti-Muggleborn sentiment later on in a way neither Lucius nor Narcissa did,

Daphne might only have a nominal belief in pureblood supremacy, but isn't willing to bully others with respect to it. Either of those angles could perhaps make for a more complex Daphne that isn't invented out of whole cloth, but all in all, I feel that Daphne is likely an average nobody---politically, socially, in terms of physical attractiveness, academically---and is just another face in the crowd.

As such, ironically as it is played for laughs, the Daphne that I've seen that matches my headcanon the closest is Luan Mao's amusing /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess][Ice Princess]]/, minus the child abuse.

******* I think that climate change is absolutely real, but again, as was said earlier in this thread, climate and weather are not the same thing. You cannot assess whether climate change is real by walking outside, only by carefully measuring global temperatures over long periods of time. When one gives in to myths like "the current warm weather pattern shows climate change is real", you also provide fodder during a cold snap to those who believe it is false.

If you're still doing this next year, may I suggest adding 'Tweets' to what one considers canon. I don't, but almost all of [[/r/HarryPotter]] seems to hang on every tap of Rowling's fingers and I think it would be interesting to see what percentage of the HPFF SR considers her ex cathedra blurbs to be noteworthy.

I think the most interesting bit is the dead even split (so far) on this question:

She has largely absorbed the wizarding mindset including their paternalistic approach to Muggles and casual approach to mental manipulation. I have no doubt that Hermione would side with the wizarding world against the Muggle world if it came to a conflict. It's the place she considers home, it's where all her most important personal relationships exist, it's where she later makes her career, it's a part of her identity. Hell, given that she later becomes the Minister for Magic, it would be her /leading/ the war against the Muggles, never mind participation.

Also, her sense of justice is among the most prominent in the series, so she'd side in a conflict with the party she'd consider in the right. The girl who stood up for the slaves when no one else would, would do no less.

But even if that was true for Hermione, the idea that everyone among the muggleborns would think like her seems implausible at best.

******** Well, any wizard vs Muggle war would surely be started by the Muggles, since wizards have an established desire to be left alone and are perfectly happy with the status quo of exerting control over Muggle governments to maintain that situation. So Hermione may not have a choice. Wizards already effectively have the Muggles subjugated, it would be a war of independence against her Ministry.

I certainly agree that all Muggleborns would not think alike - Hermione, even though she's likely to side with the wizards, is on the extreme pro-Muggle end of the spectrum. I imagine the other Muggleborns would be much more enthusiastically pro-wizard.

********* Well, I don't know why you think wizards would not start the war - Grindelwald had other ideas, and while we don't know if he attacked muggles, Voldemort certainly attacked and killed muggles.

Also, Hermione would not fight to oppress muggles. That goes against her core character. The girl who counts among her greatest achievements according to JKR the house elf reforms would not fight against muggles who are fighting for their freedom. On the other hand, it is debatable if the wizards are actually oppressing and subjugating the muggles, as long as they are simply doing what's needed to keep themselves secret. The USA has the power to subjugate a great many nations, but that doesn't mean they are subjugated, as long as that power is not used.

And I really think you underestimate the value people put on family. Even if the vast majority of muggleborns would side with the wizards, the idea that everyone would do so, no exceptions, no "traitors", is too implausible. And then there's love - a historically proven cause for many betrayals.

No, the "muggles vs. wizards" war has no chance at all to be fought without traitors.

Because it goes against the Statute of Secrecy which is the basis of wizarding government and society.

Subjugation is not the same thing as oppression. The Muggles are subjugated in the sense that they are completely under the wizards' control: wizards are able to rearrange the schedules of Muggle leaders on a whim, for example. But they're not oppressed because wizards choose not to use that power except when necessary.

Hermione wouldn't fight to kill all Muggles or anything like that. I think she would fight to restore the status quo described above.

You say I underestimate family, I think you underestimate the extent to which most Muggleborns completely abandon the culture and values of their childhood. For example, Hermione is the only Muggleborn that we know of who has any problem with House Elf slavery. No one else was willing to join SPEW except Harry and Ron, and even they only did it out of friendship.

Hermione cared about others. But to think that Dean Thomas would not care about muggles just because he doesn't give a damn about creatures he never knew existed - remember, Hermione was surprised that there were house elves in Hogwarts, since she had not seen any in years - is not that convincing. He grew up in the muggle world, he had muggle friends, muggle family, and might even have a muggle love interest.

I disagree that Voldemort didn't care about the Statute. He was always careful to keep it in place. The Statute does't forbid interacting with Muggles, it only forbids revealing the magical world. Killing Muggles doesn't break the statute of secrecy so long as they don't know it's magic.

Grindelwald was another matter but he was a unique situation which is unlikely to reoccur precisely because he has occurred once and been defeated. Wizards have completely rejected that path.

I'm saying that "assuming no traitors" is close enough to possibility to be more than merely hypothetical. That by and large there would be no traitors which makes the phenomenon controllable. A small number of individual traitors can be dealt with by wizarding law enforcement as they would normally. Traitors only really affect the outcome of the war if there's enough of them to cause a large scale intra-wizarding conflict.

Further, Voldemort was defeated, yet returned. I think assuming that Grindelwald's ideas will never see a ressurgence is quite naive - or white-washing wizards. Further, if Voldemort really cared about the SoS, he'd not have attacked muggles, since each attack endangers the SoS.

Except that the moment Voldemort was gone in 1981, the Death Eaters were rounded up by the Ministry in short order. It was clearly Voldemort who was shielding them from the law and without him they posed no real threat to the Ministry.

Unless one of the few Muggleborn traitors happens to be a Voldemort-level talent, I imagine the same would occur.

I feel like this is a more serious question, so I think we should take it that the answer will be an adult one and not based on the types of stereotypes that would prove true only in a child's novel. Are the magicals generally unaware of the muggle world? Yes. However, muggle borns do exist, and they would not be nearly so ignorant. Further, magicals aren't stupid. They don't know about the muggle world because they don't want to know and don't need to know. In the event of war, it wouldn't be difficult for them to figure things out.

Without traitors, the muggles would be squashed if we're talking an all out war rather than some kind of kid's book war. Wizards are simply too OP in comparison. The ability to apparate, look into people's minds, force people to tell the truth, completely go around any kind of muggle barrier, and create magical barriers would make them completely dominate. The only thing I can possibly see going wrong is if muggle relatives of magicals ratted out the location of some places they were aware of, like Diagon Alley. But even then, there's not much the muggles could do that the magicals couldn't stop. The only way I see the muggles causing any significant damage would be if they started it by bombing magical areas, but after that they'd be overwhelmed quickly.

LINK TO RESULTS BY GENDER: [[http://imgur.com/a/FYdRE]]

The [[http://imgur.com/yuqeZXx][favorite character]] table in particular has a lot of differences! It seems like guys are more likely to have Harry, Dumbledore and Luna as their favorite character (26% vs 9% , 11% vs 2% , 15% vs. 8%), and girls are more likely to like Hermione, Snape and Draco (22% vs 11%, 15% vs 3%, 7% vs 0%).

For [[http://imgur.com/jIV2YKt][least favorite character]], Snape and Draco are the least popular among males (11% vs 3%, 7% vs 2%) while Umbridge and Ginny are slightly less popular among females (58% vs 46%, 5% vs 2%).

Slash fics are not surprisingly way more popular among females (71% vs 18%) but femslash is equally popular among both genders (53% vs. 52%)! Some other big differences are in [[http://imgur.com/ZsXFC87][the pairing preferences:]] Harry-Ginny pairing is more popular among females (33% vs 19%), while guys seem to like Harry-Daphne or Harry Fleur (17% vs 3%, 13% vs 3%).

So for example, in CoS Harry was injected with basilisk venom but because he didn't die the container wasn't destroyed, and therefore the horcrux in his scar survived.

It should also be noted that basilisk venom is not some universal horcrux destroyer. Rather, you can destroy a horcrux with anything that it has not been enchanted to be resistant to. The reason why basilisk venom is so useful for destroying horcruxes is that its counteracting force, phoenix tears, is so rare and hard for dark wizards especially to obtain.

For example, the way Dumbledore handled the Chamber of Secrets in the second year was pretty questionable in that it's pretty much a miracle that no one died.

*** I put worse just because I was thinking about the Dursleys. I feel like they could have found a nice wizarding family for Harry to live with and put them under fidelus which would have had a similar protection as the Dursleys without all of the horrible abuse. Even assuming Dumbledore didn't know about it until Hagrid saw what was happening and wanted his mother's love to still protect Harry, Dumbledore could have sent someone with Harry during the summer to the Dursleys to chaperone, or to check on him every day or once a week to make sure he was being fed etc.

Also, there were lots of times when Dumbledore's choices were to keep Harry in the dark about important info, and if Harry would have known those things he could have made better choices. Similarly, if Dumbledore would have picked someone nicer to teach Harry legilimency, Sirius would probably still be alive.

The only thing he could have done to make Harry worse off would be letting Harry's death accomplish nothing. I just really don't think the next step up from failure should be called success.

Free trade doesn't mean unregulated trade, it means trade which most efficiently distributes resources globally without regard to national borders. The ultimate manifestation of free trade would be a global free market. Indeed, generally, the freer trade gets the more regulated it is, because regulations are required to harmonise standards, laws, etc. The freest international trade zone in the world is the EU single market and that requires a mountain of legislation to maintain.

If a market failure is lowering the price of a good below the correct market price, then it is preventing the efficient distribution of resources. Correcting that market failure is not a trade barrier, it enables free trade.

You will have trouble finding an economics textbook that opposes free trade. Note that when we want to punish a country for bad behavior, we cut off trade to them, we don't push for greater trade with them. It is difficult to believe free trade is a bad thing and simultaneously that (for example) trade sanctions cause harm to the impacted countries. Were free trade actually bad for countries, then as punishment for bad behavior we would somehow impose it on them.

*** [[http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/1997/03/in_praise_of_cheap_labor.html][In Praise of Cheap Labour]], an article by Paul Krugman, a nobel-prize winning economist.

To sum it up briefly: There is a reason why people choose to work in sweatshops, and it is because they are better jobs than the alternatives they have available to them. We would not choose these jobs because we have alternatives available to us that are better, but this is not available to third world countries. This growth in a manufacturing sector has led to growth in the standard of living, especially as factories begin competing amongst themselves. This is industrialisation of the same sort experienced by the West, but happening far faster than it occurred here (largely due to established technologies), and the outcomes have been incredible. To quote Krugman:

#+begin_quote
  The benefits of export-led economic growth to the mass of people in the newly industrializing economies are not a matter of conjecture. A country like Indonesia is still so poor that progress can be measured in terms of how much the average person gets to eat; since 1970, per capita intake has risen from less than 2,100 to more than 2,800 calories a day. A shocking one-third of young children are still malnourished--but in 1975, the fraction was more than half. Similar improvements can be seen throughout the Pacific Rim, and even in places like Bangladesh. These improvements have not taken place because well-meaning people in the West have done anything to help--foreign aid, never large, has lately shrunk to virtually nothing. Nor is it the result of the benign policies of national governments, which are as callous and corrupt as ever. It is the indirect and unintended result of the actions of soulless multinationals and rapacious local entrepreneurs, whose only concern was to take advantage of the profit opportunities offered by cheap labor. It is not an edifying spectacle; but no matter how base the motives of those involved, the result has been to move hundreds of millions of people from abject poverty to something still awful but nonetheless significantly better.
#+end_quote

Which is not to say that Fair Trade is a bad thing. Fair Trade, if it fails to dampen demand whilst giving consumers a way to be actively altruistic in paying a premium for higher wages and better working conditions, is clearly a moral good. But sweat shops are not a moral evil (except where slavery is involved, but that is a separate issue).

[[http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2008/Powellsweatshops.html][A more in-depth piece]] expanding on this.

Also, anti-Free Trade isn't something which has a traditional left-right skew.

Clinton essentially represents the continuation of the status quo with some minor tweaks (which is what candidates generally stand for in most Western democracies). Life under Clinton will continue on pretty much as it always has. Education and healthcare might get slightly more investment and the military might get slightly less. No major changes.

Trump on the other hand wants to completely upend the US constitution by denying constitutional rights to millions, ditch half the USA's alliances, turn back the clock on the last century of economic progress... and of course build a giant, expensive, useless wall.

** Next time could you instead of making the: "How do you identify your political position?" not left vs right because for about 40% countries they are the reverse of the US. It literally referees to the seating position of the early parliaments of the respected countries. Also no defining it red blue won't make it any better because in Europe the red stands for socialism and sociolibratism, while in the US it stands for the conservative party. Which is often, but not always, on different sides politically.

** I'm kind of dismayed that the options given for politics are "right" and "left". It might be nice to provide more options in the future for other sorts of political views.

And no, "centrist" isn't the other option. It's like asking an atheist "are you for Jesus or are you for Satan" --- there are people who believe in neither Jesus nor Satan, and no, those aren't the people in the middle who are undecided which of the two to pick or who think both have some merits. (No offense intended to Christians, I'm using this purely as an exemplar.)

At the very least, you could provide "other" as an option.

- Harry often strives to be an authoritarian leader
- The use of weaponry and violence for (First Strike-) defense is accepted and encouraged without counterpoints.
- Death or mutilation are seen as suitable punishment for criminals
- People who do not adhere to the worldview of Harry are painted as "sheeple" and worthless.

Bush disaster on steroids.

Also, if I only get a "yes or no" option with feminism, I click yes. I do want equality for all sexes and genders, which is the original and (at least in my country) widely accepted definition.

I don't go to protests, donate to feminist charities, or really talk about it in more than passing conversation. Again, not because I don't believe those things, but because personally my free time and money are taken up trying to secure equality for blind folks; being blind, it's a thing I know more about, and care more about because of direct personal experience. I assume the majority of people answered "no" to that question for similar reasons.

Gives you insight into what people look for and like reading, which can be useful for authors, and informative for readers. For instance, being left of center, in the Worm fandom I don't really enjoy reading fics where the protagonist joins the Empire 88, a neo nazi gang. Over here, I don't like fics where Harry is evil, or where death eaters are presented as not that terrible. Or any death eater ships.

*** Working class/blue collar/service jobs are basically what Americans call 'lower middle class' because everybody in the US wants to be considered in the middle class. Working class identities were much stronger before the 1950s when socialism, which derives its power explicitly from the power of laborers and the working class, was wholly associated with the USSR and the Cold War.

And ever since then, people in the US who say 'I'm working class' are assumed to be anti-American commies, basically. But folks who work for hourly wages instead of salaries are traditionally part of the working class, as are skilled tradesmen & women.
