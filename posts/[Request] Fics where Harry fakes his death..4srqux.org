I'd prefer it as a way to get out of the war but anything works.


** Technically not a faked death, but an assumed one: linkffn(coming back late). In the end, still got away from the magical world.

  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?

*** Portkey's version of the same fic has an extra chapter ([[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=8073]]). And Bexis, the beta for the fic, also continued it with a couple more chapters after it was abandoned ([[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/9105]]).

**** It has been a while since I've read the fic, but iirc there was a point in the story where Hermione was [[/spoiler][either called a MILF or cougar]]. I laughed my ass off after that chapter.

I thought it was complete. Iirc the author ended it already.

*** FFbot says the last update was in 2012. Is it not finished or did the writer forget to put it on complete at the website it's on.

**** I'm not sure about the FF.net one but the one on Portkey I know is complete. Not sure about the continuation that the comment above me said. It has been a while since I've read the fic.

** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] and it's sequel [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]] by Jeconais. Perfect Situations is a one shot so I would give it a read to see if its for you. Its a Harry/Daphne if that interests you at all.

** linkffn(the fourth champion by James Spookie; Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot) technically others fake this death in Fourth Champion. In Make a Wish, he does it more out of necessity due to changes he undergoes.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, whilst politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming. AU. Complete.
