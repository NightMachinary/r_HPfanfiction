Rather it's more interesting prompts, different kind of discussions; and if so what kind of discussions, headcanons being explored and written by other people, maybe? Maybe challenges to help you get writing? Or anything else that you can think of/would like to see more on here?

***** Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, too. I've seen it in the main HP sub as a good starter fanfic for people who just finished the series, next to HPMOR.

I am afraid that those fics will just make people on the fence write fanfic off forever.

****** HPMoR was the first fic I read and what drove me to searching for more. Admittedly, my thoughts on it has faded into obscurity but I think you underestimate those fics. They are great writing, at least in the technical sense. What HPMoR lacks is humility and scientific facts, and what DPSW lacks is morality.

DPSW, to me, is a milder, and slightly different, version of For the Love of Magic. Without the extreme racism and sexism, of course. Though with chils-grooming this time so I'm going to change my claim from 'milder' to 'a hell lot worse than'.

Still, from a technical stand point those fics are easy on the mind and, for fans who haven't read the books in a while, they are easy to follow.

******* I think a reader's first fanfiction preference ultimately comes down to what the reader got out of the original HP. Those who enjoyed HP for the style, whimsy, and coming-of-age start out with canon compliant fanfics, post-ep, or next-gen fics that give a taste of what entering the wizarding world felt like the first time.

Those who loved the characters and worldbuilding, and were gutted by the end, want to see an "optimized" world, where the people they liked didn't have to die, and the characters made better choices and had fewer idiot balls. This is where the Peggy-Sue fics, canon divergences, and wholesale AU's like HPMOR come in.

Different strokes, I guess. I'd still hesitate to rec HPMOR to a first-time fanfic reader, because the beginning is pretty rough on anyone who expected Harry and got HPJEV.

** - People posting their own short prompt snippets, instead of asking someone to write it for them. Protip: No one ever does.

- People using the search tool before posting yet another Fem!Harry request thread. It would be good to avoid [[https://i.imgur.com/NJAAGUq.jpg][anything on the HPfanfic meta bingo]].

- Thought-provoking discussion that engages and encourages contribution. The "Why is this sub so anti-slash?" thread was good for that.

- Interesting meta-insights on fanfiction reader and writing trends over the years. What has changed? What has stayed the same? Any senior citizens got any good stories of the wild west days of geocities? Bonus if there's any charts or hard numbers.

- Discussion on the HP fandom community vs. the fanfic community vs. modern fandom culture as a whole.

Seems like the most active discussion threads are always about relatively simple but controversial topics that are easy to have an opinion on.

Thus, the threads asking about bashing, slash, etc. get far more comments than the more cerebral topics like the nature of transfiguration.

That's the same for every sub, not just this one, where you can generate an endless cycle of hot takes if you make a thread deliberately controversial and insert a critical tone into the title to stir the pot. Eg, "This sub hates slash" versus "Why doesn't this sub like slash?"

As much as I'd like to see more threads discussing writing techniques or narrative construction in HP fanfic, they are subjects that only appeal to the small minority of fanfic writers, and often aren't accessible or made approachable to the casual fanfic reader. The compromise is discussion threads that /are/ more accessible, and allow a wider range of contributors, even if it does mean the topic has to be broadened or simplified to make it so. That doesn't stop people from being able to make their niche discussions if they want to. My opinion is that any thread that generates thoughtful commentary, serious /discussion/, even if it is as a reaction to controversy, is better than yet another request thread identical to one that was posted 2 days ago.

** Disable negative karma or any karma at all.

This subreddit is heavily prejudiced against people with opinions different from the mainstream. There are stories That-Must-Not-Be-Mentioned here or the poster is being downvoted just because she or he thinks they are good.

Also there should be a sticked post with links to subreddits about different pairings (yes, including Drarry), so new people can go there to enjoy their kinks without disturbing everyone else.

*** Agreed, people down vote because they don't like or agree with someone's request / ship / what have you, and all that does is prevent other people from seeing it and helping that person out. If you don't like it, just ignore it, I don't understand why it's such a hard concept.

*** Out of curiosity, what fic recommendations do you see downvoted? Or Must-Not-Be-Mentioned (aside from HPMOR)?

Personally, I don't like seeing people rec their own fics by twisting the request, unless it genuinely is the best recommendation. Now, don't get me wrong, fully disclosing that it's your own fic and having given some other recommendations first is one thing and perfectly acceptable. If you just rec your own fics every time then that's a lot shadier (especially if you use an alt account so it doesn't look obvious). Maybe it's just one author who does this but it certainly triggers me every time (InquisitorCOC, you're not fooling anybody).

**** Request threads focused on Tom Riddle or Voldemort tend to be downvoted to 0 or -1, (they stop getting downvoted once they fall off the main page of the sub).

It seems to be a case of some people using the downvote to get rid of threads they don't want to see rather than just using the "hide" button the way they are supposed to.

**** HPMOR is a prime example. Another one is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst]]'s stories.

I don't like self-advertisement too, but this subreddit is about fanfiction. It'll be strange to forbid people telling about their own stories.

But I agree that there should be a line between sharing your works and spam.

***** True, robst's stories are very unoriginal and dull but they are what got me into fan fiction so I always have a soft spot for them.

As I said, when it's self promotion but isn't labelled as such then it bothers me. Self promotion but fully disclosed as such is definitely fine.
