Any fics where Harry realizes he isn't applying himself and starts to study? Maybe there is school rankings and he works himself higher and higher on the list?

#+begin_quote
  Harry overhears a conversation between two of his teachers early into the first year at Hogwarts. What he hears makes him ponder about how he's going about his school work. He decides to take action and make his parents proud of his performance. Just how will that little change influence the events taking place at the school?

** Sometimes it feels like every third fic is about this. It's a common trope. Plus he goes on a diet and starts exercising and drags his friends with him. (Why do skinny teenagers need diets and daily exercise is beyond me.) I haven't actually read this one, but the title/ summary sound like what you're looking for.

***** Eh, the premise is interesting, but the characters could be a lot better written imo. I only managed to get as far as Snape when I noped out of it.

In no universe does Snape use the word "son" like that without a traumatic brain injury and a complete personality transplant, and absolutely no attempt was made to explain such an incongruity.

  This story came from the thought that the Weasley introduction was a setup. This is NOT a time-travel story. The premise is that the Dursleys got him there very early and Hermione, being the perfectionist that she is, also arrived very early. Thus they meet and the glory of H/Hr begins. AU For now not a T rating, will probably change in later chapters.

*** Why wouldn't skinny teenagers need diet and exercise? Skinny doesn't mean healthy. Diets are not just for weight loss, but weight gain too. And what exactly is wrong with "skinny teenagers" working out to get physically stronger?

My only problem with these kind of fics are that they try to go into too much details regarding traning. And not even good ones at that. They always go on about Harry doing 100s of pushups and stuff. That isn't the way to make yourself stronger.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

It was pretty common for the coaches in my high school(super sports oriented, successful/competitive teams for everything) to harp on diet pretty hard. And not just for bulking.

It was an "eat more vegetables" diet, not a "count calories" diet, sure. Well, except for the wrestlers.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
