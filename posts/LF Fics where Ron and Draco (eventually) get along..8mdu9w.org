Grass is green, water is wet, and Ron and Draco hate each other. Gets a bit old, and I'd like to see something where they are at least acquaintances . It doesn't matter if Harry pulls a 'why can't we all get along' whine on the train in First Year, or something happens later.\\
Thanks!


** I think Ron and Draco could eventually get along after the War. People change, circumstances change, and time can heal lots of old wounds. 20 years is a long time.

** linkffn(On a Train, Switching Tracks).

So, this one counts? Here Ron and Draco get 'civil' as they both have a mutual friend in Harry and many times team up to get Harry out of trouble. Neville is here too. Read it and tell how this one measures up

  First year: "Celebrities," Harry said. "Fame makes them mad. I take it the wizarding world doesn't really have them, then?" Draco and Ron exchanged glances. "No, not really." AU, assorted oneshots and snippets.

** Currently in the process of planning a fic which contains as a passing point to the main character of the story that Draco and Ron get along professionally plus with Rose and Scorpius as an established relationship meaning they get over the past and find a way through to get along if only for their kids

  ABANDONED. When Harry was five, he met his best friend: the sliver of another man's soul living inside of him. Things would never be the same again. Eventual HP/DM slash with other slash and non-slash couples.
