Hi!

I'm a fan of /really/ long fics, preferably completed. Do you know of any fics 200/300K+ words that are completed?


** linkffn(The Arithmancer) and its sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes) recently finished at around 1M words.

linkffn(Black Bond) is also around 1M words, but it's only years 1-3 and the sequel linkffn(Black Bond II) has not been updated in a year.

** Most people either love or hate linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality).

Personally, I found it to be smart, funny, complex, almost typo-free, and thought-provoking. On the other hand, lots of people find Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres to be an arrogant jerk, which is sometimes true (especially the first few chapters), and sometimes not (he is very loyal to those he considers friends), and sometimes it gets him smacked down hard (like his interactions with Professor Snape). If you like long fics, I suggest reading and deciding for yourself.

Note that there's an alternate beginning (longer and with a better depiction of Harry's relationship with his parents) by [[/u/daystareld]] at [[http://daystareld.com/hpmor-remix-1]]

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

**** There's a better introduction at the start of chapter 22:

/Something, somewhere, somewhen, must have happened differently.../

PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres, a Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford.

HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read /Godel, Escher, Bach/ and /Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases/ and volume one of /The Feynman Lectures on Physics/. And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.

HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick riding.

DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class, Battle Magic. His students are all wondering what's going to go wrong with the Defense Professor this time.

DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game which involved setting fire to a chicken.

DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and scream for a while.

****** To be Mary Sue (or more specifically, Marty Stu) would indicate that he's good at everything - or rather, the best at everything - in a way that doesn't have any good explanation except that the author wanted it that way. I don't think that applies to this Harry.

He has trouble controlling his temper, which semi-alienates Neville for a while. He's condescending to people he considers not worth his time, like Ron, and that's upsetting to Hermione, whom he actually likes. His head for strategy gives him an edge in the mock battles, but he's still beaten by Hermione because he didn't think to delegate responsibility and get other people's ideas like she did, and beaten by Draco because Draco's soldiers were smart enough to copy Harry's own protective gear.

When he is legitimately extraordinary at something, it's usually from either applying his background in logical and scientific thinking to magical problems, which apparently hasn't happened before in recent times due to the small numbers of muggle born wizards, or else because of the changes to his brain from encountering Voldemort.

** I have read this fic a few times and really enjoy it, it is Snape/Harry so if you aren't into that you may not like it, but still worth a look [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4608235/1/It-All-Started-With-A-Visit-To-Gringotts]]

No real pairing with this one, again it's one I've re-read and really enjoy [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7161848/1/893]]

More than happy to recommend some others if you don't mind the occasional slash pairing or no pairing, also a few really good Draco/Ginny/Blaise if you're into that and also Lily/Scorpius

**** The fics are updated at a regular intervals, and some of them are split into different ones, like Pos or DP&SW, Harry Potter and the Game.

The only uncompleted fics are: Dodging prison and Stealing witches (Book 2 out of 8)

Prince of Slytherin(Book 3 out of 7 or 8)

Harry Potter and the Game (Book 3 out of 5)

The second sequel of Harry Potter and the gift of memories

A third path to the future

Revolution, last sequel of Resonance, but it is practically complete.

The fourth part of Last Mage of Krypton.

You will see that most of the fics are complete, and it is only the sequels which are not.

More fics to add:

***** I don't think you understand what the word 'completed' means. A work in progress is by it's very definition not completed. It's also pretty disingenuous to call a work complete as long as one part of a series is complete but the rest are well away from being completed. Especially when those parts that are finished doesn't have contained endings or anywhere close to a decent resolution. You yourself listed 7 of them as not completed and there's at least 2 that you missed. That's about half of the total works you listed in your initial post.

The OP specifically asked for completed works, so if you're going to recommend something that's not actually complete or a series of works where only parts of it is complete you should most definitely note that next to the recommendations. Kind of like you did in your second list here, so good on you for that.

I would be beyond pissed if I asked for a recommendation of completed works, saw one of your definitely not completed recommendations and ended up reading 300k words just to get to the end and see that it's in the middle of part 3 of a 5 part series. Personally I always doublecheck fanfics these days to see if it's been abandoned or if there's a sequel somewhere that's also abandoned/not finished, but I'm sure there's people that don't do that and would just start reading from chapter 1 without checking.

Still thanks for all the suggestions, quite a few of them I haven't read or looked at yet, so much appreciated.
