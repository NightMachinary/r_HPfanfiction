Happy to read any but a bonus if you can find this specific one: Harry was time traveled into the past and is an unspeakable helping out in the war against Grindelwald. Sorry it's not much to go off, wish I remembered more :/

#+begin_quote
  After Hermione is cursed the only way to cure her is with a risky ritual that ends up having some unexpected consequences. Now Harry and Hermione have to learn to deal with those consequences while they try to find her attacker before he can strike again.
