So, basically the Eleventh Doctor had this (eventual) complete bromance with Rory Williams and Amy Pond (before Doctor Who, after the Twelfth Doctor, horribly declined as a whole)... ah, he also was married to their daughter, River Song/Melody Pond, something which stupified Amy since she's now the Doctor's mother-in-law, but I'm digressing, heh.

This video compilation basically sums it up: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0febMHgxV_k]]

Are there any fics that have Harry, Ron, and Hermione like this? Just... bromancing the sh*t out of things? Or Harry with others that have this dynamic? I don't mind crossovers.

I know of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302907/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum]] , where they have a bromance (and romance, in Harry's case, with an OC French girl), but that's all.

No slash, please. It's just not my cup of tea, personally.
