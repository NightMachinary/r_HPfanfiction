*** Funny, but seriously this is not for attention. You don't even have to comment, I just want to go into the negatives. I find very small interest in karma. So it's more of a quiet protest, or something.

Thanks,

Thanks,

**** Well, I don't tend to remember people usually, as it's the content that matters to me, but your way of signing off on your messages is unique, and that's why I remember you.

I really don't think about specific users more than that, sorry.
