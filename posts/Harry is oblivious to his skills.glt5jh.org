Are there any Harry fics out there where Harry is powerfull, but oblivious to how talented he actually is? Talented Harry fics often turn him in a dick, it would be nice to see a Harry that is skilled but just assumes everyone is as good as him.


** If I'm remembering correctly, [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]] has Harry breaking all the fundamental rules of magic because he doesn't know them and that what he's doing is supposed to be impossible? Swear it was a Jeconais fic that had this, but not sure if this was the one...

*** Pretty much. I don't get people who don't think that Harry isn't powerful. Oh sure, he's not book smart like Hermione is, and doesn't practice as hard with certain subjects like she does, but he's powerful for sure.

Not many 13 year old kids can cast a patronus. Not many people can out fly/trick a dragon (the other contestants did other ways to get the egg). He also taught DA to people when Umbridge was at the school, was able to escape Voldemort multiple times, Harry was able to hold his own against variety of Death Eaters, stopped Voldemort, was involved with stealing something in Gringotts (With help sure, but still all incredible stuff).

Because his achievements look like plot requirements rather than the result of his developed skills and innate talent. They're not contextualized in his general performance, they're basically one offs in a sea of mediocrity.

Worse, his greatest gift after flying, namely DADA expertise, which could actually be seen as remarkable, is extremely cheapened by the necessity of having death eaters and school kids fight on even grounds, so he doesn't really stand out even in combat where he ought to shine.

***** He did learn, he was a great teacher, he did those things I mentioned and more. Of course it's all plot convenience, same with the rest of canon.

Why did Sirius chase after Pettigrew instead of staying to raise Harry? Plot demanded it so we could have the typical orphan raised by awful relatives plot.

Why did Dumbledore place the stone at a place full of school children? Because the plot demanded it.

And other things like that.

*** Boo! Shame on you! That joke wasn't funny the first time someone made it forty years ago on a fucking Star Trek fanfic BBS (or whatever the hell they were using back then). A fellow fan came to you looking for help and instead the sub upvoted this shitty, tired, /unhelpful/ joke.

** Linkffn(Make A Wish By Rorschach's Blot) has Harry constantly in the right place at the right time. Everyone else is loosing their mind's over this new power in the magical world and Harry is oblivious to his own reputation.

Not a deep fic, but it might scratch this particular itch.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
