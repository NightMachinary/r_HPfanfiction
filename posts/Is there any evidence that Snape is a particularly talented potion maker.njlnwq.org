I know he talks a good game, but I can't remember anyone else saying he was wonderful at it. There's the Half Blood Prince book, but he wouldn't be the first kid who was good-for-a-teenager but nothing special as an adult.

Potions Master just means he's the Potions Teacher but in a school which numbers Binns, Trelawney and a cross-section of the mad, bad and dangerous to know as DADA teacher that's not saying much. He certainly does nothing to encourage a love of potions as a discipline.

So how about Snape as a mediocre potioneer who can't get a job anywhere else because he's just not good enough?


** Remus lupin specifically states in the 3rd book that Snape is one of the few that can brew his potion (wolfsbane).

** The main one I've seen is that when Snape teaches, he writes the instructions on the board for them to follow.

But when Slughorn takes over, they learn from the book.

Usually Hermione is great at potions, but in Slughorns class, fails miserably.

By contrast, Harry does really well. Because he's reading the HBPs notes and instructions. Not the books.

The Half Blood Prince who we later learn is Snape.

Ipso facto: Snape was teaching students using his own recipes and notes, which always yeiled better results than the books. Thus Snape must be a superior potioneer.

(Also the fact the HBP book exists proves he was great at potions and/or school in general at the very least)

I don't think she did, though. She just didn't do as well as Harry, who had Snape's notes. If he hadn't been using them, /he/ would have failed miserably and she would have been at the top of the class, as usual.

I do think Snape was a superb potioneer, and a very talented wizard in general. Pity he was such a miserable pos.

Hermione didn't fail Slughorn class, she just maintained bein excellent (with maybe a bit more difficulties) while Harry went from making Average (if not Mediocre) Potions to Perfect ones.

Even if she is overshadowed by Harry in this class, Hermione is still at the very least a solid E student, maybe even an O depending of how Slughorn grades potions.

**** Harry got an EE in his Potions OWL.

He was not average or mediocre. He was likely graded rather unfairly by Snape. Unsurprisingly.

** A master potioneer? Probably.

A shitty teacher? Without a doubt.

** We really only have Harry's point of view, and he's never at a level where he would be able to properly assess a potions expert. There will always be insufficient data.

Though others have made some good points that there are at least /indications/ of him being quite skilled.

And in fairness, it wasn't the class he really wanted to be teaching.
