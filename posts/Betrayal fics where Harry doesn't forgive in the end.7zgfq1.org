I've just gone on a bit of a binge of betrayal fics, but in every fucking one of them, Harry ends up forgiving everyone in the end. It makes me irrationally angry.


** Well, Harry Potter & the Azkaban Parody is...yeah, a blatant parody of betrayal fics. It features a dominatrix house-elf, homoerotic snuggling, and a competent Muggle Studies teacher. And of course, Harry getting revenge.

*** I love fics where Harry just fucks off and leaves people to their fate. Though, I felt like this one's ending was rushed.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
