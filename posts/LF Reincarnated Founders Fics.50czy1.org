Not where their magic is inherited or something, but more of a waking up and thinking, "Okay I remember dying . . ." type thing. I've only seen one fic like that I think, it was like Slytherin and Gryffindor I'm pretty sure. Thank you!


** There's linkffn(5434985), which I like, but has long since been abandoned.

There's also linkffn(10991501), which only has Salazar being reincarnated. It's quite good and is still being updated.

I like this trope, I wish there were more.

*** My writing partner and I have a fic in the works where the founders are reincarnated (thanks to measures taken by Godric) into Susan Bones, Cho Chang, Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy. By that I mean, Salazar = Susan, Godric = Luna, Helga = Ron and Rowena = Draco. The three are VERY annoyed at Godric for not telling them they might not keep their genders when he cast the spells. Godric just thinks it's hilarious.

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they called her - and yet... Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar? (Reincarnation fic)

** linkffn(11151528)

Starts off rather slow, gets better and adds more conflict in the last few chapters.

#+begin_quote
  The Founders have spent the last fifty years separated and drifting, but with Voldemort rising, they're headed back to Hogwarts once more. Between a wary Golden Trio, Umbridge, and Voldemort's shadowy plans, there's little time to deal with their own problems, even though Godric knows it's tearing the four of them apart---maybe even irreparably.

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
