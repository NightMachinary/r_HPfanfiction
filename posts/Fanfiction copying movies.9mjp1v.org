** It seems like a rather twisted argument. At its heart, fanfiction is copying. We're copying someone else's characters, world, and plot, and giving it our own spin. How is it any different if you're incorporating other shows/movies/books? It's essentially a crossover.

Plus, don't forget that Fifty Shades of Gray started out as a twilight fanfiction... take that as you will.

Edit: To address a little further, you're saying it doesn't have any spin of the author's own, right? I would point out that technically it has a spin since it's got “different” characters. It's definitely unethical, but at that point it becomes a personal ethics issue more than anything else.

** I ain't gonna lie, I have been wanting to do a fic with the exact same plot as Pretty Woman for years now. I mean, it's possible it's out there already but I'm too lazy to look.

** Well I mean doesn't shows like Family Guy make entire episodes about movie plots but with their characters in the roles? It is like the exact same thing so I guess it is okay? :)
