I've seen lots of ideas floating around that show many different forms of inheritance in the wizarding world; using a magical blood test by the goblins, magical wills, magic deeming you worthy for certain family titles, Rite of Conquest (kill off/end a line and the winner takes it over, and I've no doubt theres more. So onto the reason for this post:

What do you think is the most reasonable/likely form of inheritance? Could a family leave everything to a wizard not related by simply stating so in a will? Could a character gain secret family magics bc they defeated the heir and head?

I'm excited to see what different people think.


** None of the things you mention are “likely” in the sense that they fit into the setting as it is presented to us. The least bad of these is “blood test by goblins,” but there's no suggestion that goblins do anything of that nature.

*** There was a fic I read a while back that had a reasonable explanation for the goblin blood test trope. The basic theory is that the goblin cultural value in the origin and creation of objects makes the blood of goblin artisans a valuable ingredient in ancestry tests. The most a potion can test without that key ingredient is slightly better than non-magical paternity tests.

Much of the goblin "wars" were the goblins deciding to stop humans from abducting their master artisans and bleeding them dry, and the current arrangement is done through Gringotts to protect a major part of Goblin society. Goblin artisans sign on because Gringotts offers scholarship opportunities and protection in exchange for a limited supply of blood.

Gringotts started both as a protection scheme for Goblin artisans and as a service to human nobility to keep objects within the blood family's control.

*** This is in a fanon sense of what could be possible if a scenario that needed some form of inheritance were to happen (ex, basically just asking for opinions lol)

** Sirius left the Black fortune to Harry so it is possible to leave everything to an unrelated person. Though there are fun fics about the house itself not accepting an unrelated owner and I find that trope interesting.

It would be reasonable to imagine purebloods at least would value magical ability and make an heir of their most powerful child. So there could be a spell that identifies the most magically powerful wix in the room and they use that spell to identify the next heir.

I'm sceptical about the rite of conquest idea, that is not a law that would benefit anyone in power because it creates a situation where a rich person could lose their riches and pride in one fell swoop and then be law bound to honour the victor by placing them in the will. That is a stupid thing to do, so the rich and powerful people who influence the laws would bleed support for any kind of law that included upholding the rige of conquest. Also, wand allegiance has nothing to do with giving the winner all your money when you die. So a normal duel wouldn't invoke any 'rite of conquest'. Even if killing your opponent in a duel is protected by the sanctity of duelling, I don't think anyone in their right mind would happily agree to leave their livelihood in the hands of whoever killed them. If it happened at all then that would be the individual decision of the wix in question, like Ron Swanson's "all my belongings shall transfer to the man or animal who has killed me" will in parks and rec.

*** Rite of conquest is stupid it only really applies to the elder wand

** You can probably leave the money to anyone, but the title, even without monetary assets, must probably go to the designed family member or the closest alive.

And, I think a blood ritual may be best, not just a test, but a whole ritual to see if you are from X family, but also to see if the family magic accepts you.

That's my opinion

*** That's what the word was! Blood ritual. For the life of me I wasnt able to remember that even tho I've read a few fics with it.

** The likeliest method of inheritance is just legal - and similar to the British one.

If we were to change things around, which I think can be more interesting, there are a lot more possibilities. Right of Conquest/Magic deeming you worthy are... well, in my opinion they're very boring ones done just to justify having Harry as OPOPOP, which can be fine /if/ that setup accomplishes an interesting setting/plot - but in itself I find it terrible.

Magical wills, though, I find much more plausible - and I could see magical families having had a set of laws/wills that force certain ways to inherit or requiring a test to prove worthiness (eg, it might have requirements that only a wizard or witch can inherit, and not Squibs). Those might make it difficult/impossible to leave things to someone outside the family. Magical wills might be more binding/tough than regular ones, as well. That's one way I can see the 'Goblin blood test' trope make sense - less as a blood test to find relations, but more as a way to test which forgotten/lost families' wills end up having made their way to Harry, through whatever the means of the last will they had in place. But then you have to explain why /everyone/ doesn't do such a test a Gringotts ;)

In terms of actual inheritance, secret family magics being gained makes no real sense to me. However, magical heirlooms that might have specific powers/abilities/enchantments make a lot of sense, as do books/journals/secrets accumulated over years/centuries. That is more of a knowledge pool to be studied in my mind - and I could see that being very fitting for families. (So essentially - instantly gaining an ability bad, but gaining access to more knowledge could work)

*** I hadnt meant it in the gaining ability kind of way, I was more thinking along the lines of "oh this family had a family specific library", along those lines (hadnt thought of "oh he becomes a metamorphmagus cuz he inherited the family stuff" tbf lol)

**** Ah, I see! Yeah, that case can certainly work, though I think it'd need some explanation/worldbuilding to it to explain why it's not common knowledge.

It could be through a family specializing in something (eg, the Potters in cosmetics/potions, or a family in a certain type of dark magic, etc), a particularly brilliant person's notes (I imagine that Dumbledore, Voldemort, Flamel, etc would have research notes that could be very useful) - and why no one else has discovered it or uses it.
