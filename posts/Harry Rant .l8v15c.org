Am I The Only One Who Finds It More Than A Little Annoying When Harry Speaks As If No One But Him Has Been Affected By The War? Saying Things Like “I Don't Want Anyone Else Getting Hurt Fighting For Me”. As If People Weren't Dying Before He Was Born. As If People Weren't Fighting Since Before He Was Born. As If He Is The Only Reason People Want Voldemort Gone.

** To answer your question: Probably not, but it's pretty absurd to be annoyed when Voldemort himself made the whole thing about Harry.

"Don't these people realize what you've been through? What danger you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort movement?" - Hestia to Harry in DH

"Now that Dumbledore is dead you - the Boy Who Lived - were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting you had a hand in the old hero's death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you." - Remus to Harry in DH

"And the fact that you crouched and snivelled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!" - Voldemort to Harry in DH

There's more like Dumbledore telling Remus and Kingsley Harry was their best hope, "he's after a weapon to destroy you," and Voldemort spending two books looking for a wand to best Harry's, but I think you get the gist.

*** I think there's a bit of arrogance in Harry's statement of "I don't want anyone else to fight and for *for me*". Like yeah, you're 'The Chosen One' and people have chosen you to be the figure head for this fight, but a lot of these people would be here even if there wasn't a prophecy, because Voldemort is a genocidal bigot who needs to be stopped.

**** Sure, but those people wouldn't be dying or getting hurt protecting him from Voldemort because there were at least 5 people who died or got hurt that way.

The Battle of Hogwarts is for sure a last stance against fascism, but they waited for Harry to get there and it gets started because they don't give him up.

*** Of Course I Understand The Position Voldemort And The Prophecy Put Him In Specifically. What I Don't Understand Is Why It Seems That He Doesn't See That Others Have Been Affected Also. I Know That He's The Main Character So Of Course Everything About Him Will Be Put In The Spotlight By The Author And Also By The Wizarding Media. It Just Seems Odd To Me That He Places So Much Pressure Onto Himself Even Before Learning About The Prophecy.

** Voldemort was after Harry in particular and that wasn't a secret to anyone. The Weasleys and the Lupins were pretty much left alone when they did not find them harboring Harry. The Tonkses are tortured because they had seen Harry a few nights before flying to their house but they aren't killed when it's discovered they don't know about Harry's whereabouts. Just like no guest from Fleur and Bill's wedding is killed. But most of the significant deaths in the series occurred because people got in the way between Voldemort and Harry: his parents, Cedric, Sirius, Moody all those people who fought the Battle of Hogwarts only to give Harry time, despite being way fewer than Voldemort's forces. Dumbledore is the only other person that had a target on his back regardless of his relationship to Harry. So I think the fact that there were so many people who might not have had a great fate in Voldemort's, dystopia could have still survived, yet they were killed because they came in between him and Harry, gives Harry the right to think like that.
