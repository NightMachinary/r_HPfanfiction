I am looking for a fic where harry doesn't go to Hogwarts, I'm pretty sure he grows up without knowing about magic at all.

When Albus finds him one day he tries to force him to learn magic and ends up driving him away. Not sure what happens thought the story completely but I know that Albus survives and Voldemort is killed by three different people that were fighting him. I know one was an Indian, an American Indian - not from India (I think)


** It's by kb0, don't remember the name of it though.
