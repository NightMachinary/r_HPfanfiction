***** But you did except instead of using clever innuendo you just stated what it was.

At least have the dignity to keep the witty innuendo!

How could you you monster.

Yours isn't even badass!

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

**** Could somebody who's read this provide a short summary of the differences between canon events and this? What kind of Harry & Neville are we dealing with here? Canon plot, or?

***** Neville is a stuck up, asshole, BWL. He mostly went through the canon events of years 1-5 with Dumbledore in the background manipulating things. The story starts year 7 with Harry arriving at Hogwarts for the first time. Harry is cocky and powerful. The year 7 plot is very different.

  After she escaped with Harry that fateful night, Lily swore to always protect her son - no matter what. "And it is with great pleasure," Dumbledore continued, his smile growing wider. "That I introduce to you your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, the Lady Lily Evans Potter."
