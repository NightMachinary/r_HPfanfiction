Looking for fics where Harry (before or after HBP) start uses darker spells (but doesn't go evil) on his opponents like Sectumseptra and such to the shock of his peers and teachers. He can uses unforgivables in the fics as long as its against Voldemort, Lucius, or Bellatrix.


** linkffn(Unlcked Knowledge) Harry creates a stunning spell that only he can undo, and he kills one of the Lestrange Brothers with a Bone-breaker to the sternum. He also recreates Voldemort's greatest defensive creation, a robe that can block almost any curse.

** What is the advantage of using dark magic anyway? A cutting curse to the throat is just as deadly as a killing curse, I guess it needs a to be better aimed. Elemental fire or electricity spells could also kill people pretty easily.

*** A simple cutting hex can be healed easily. Dark spells like Sectumsempra require a specific counter-curse. Mundane spells can also be averted by wearing protective gear like a shield hat, which have little effect against serious dark magic.

How do you magically reattach a head? You have like 15 seconds before irreversible damage occurs.

****** Just saying that a lot of general purpose spells can be lethal. It is easy to crush someone with a levitation charn or drown your enemy with summoned water.

******* Its the same reason why people prefer guns to say a crowbar. A crowbar is designed as a tool but can be used as a weapon if not a poor one. A sword or gun is designed with one purpose in mind. Sure sparks can be used as a weapon and can even burn, but why would u use something that may fail when you could just use feindfyre? Why use a cutting curse which has a chance of missing something fatal if you are aiming to kill or has a chance to kill if you are aiming to torture when you could use the killing curse or cruciatus curse both of which are designed for the purpose of killing or torture.

***** Iirc, there are healing spells to undo amputations, since those learning to apparate tend to splinch themselves. But maybe attaching a head is a hit much, yeah. Still, cutting charms are /meant/ for cutting paper and cloth. It would take an unusually potent one to decapitate someone.

Also, think about Harry's duel with Malfoy in book 6. Had he used just a cutting charm, /Diffendo,/ Malfoy wouldn't have really been in danger. A simple healing charm or potion would have undone the damage. But he used /Sectumsepra,/ a dark curse. And the only reason Malfoy didn't die is because snape knew the counterspell.
