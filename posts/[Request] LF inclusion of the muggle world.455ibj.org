I'm looking for fics that heavily involve muggles.

For an example, I love the Alchemist's Cell/Heart of Gryffindor series by SJR0301. Harry gets stuck in the muggle world when he runs away, gets pulled into stage acting and street performing, and works with criminal Black Jack Crowley (still my favorite OC ever.) Meanwhile, detectives are looking into Voldemort's murders, the death eaters are using muggle gangs to do their dirty work, and the MOM has to appease the muggle government to keep the secrecy act.

I'm looking for that kind of integration with Harry as a central character. Preferably Harry/Ginny if there's romance.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

** I just read some DLP reviews of Alchemists Cell while looking for a link, and they were both as glowing and as biting as you can be. My favorite, defending an overall 2* review:

  Well, it's wonderful and it gets your hopes up - and then it tears your heart out and throws it to the ground and stomps on it until you die.

  The second two-thirds wouldn't be so /bad/ if the first third weren't so /good/

It seems the pre-Hogwarts chapters were in the muggle world and amazing, and then Harry goes to Hogwarts and its just another clich√©d 6th year story without much if any reference to the greats OCs the author had introduced.

Id love to read whats there since the users all seemed to love the writing style, but i cant find a working link... any help OP?

*** Last I checked, this link still worked: [[http://www.geocities.ws/heksie2144/sj.html]]. If one of the chapters is weird, I got a PDF version.

The best part of the series is definitely the muggle stuff. I still liked the rest, but the Harry's time in the muggle world is awesome. It gets pushed to the back when the school year starts, but Detective Bones and Voldemort's association with the gangs still happens in the background. The Heart of Gryffindor Pt 2 goes back to the muggle world too.

  What would you do if you woke up one morning, looked outside your window and could see Hogwarts? This is what happened to Nigel Chaucer. For the first fifteen years of his life, he grew up in St. Luke, a village in the North of England, and for fifteen years, the view from his window was an empty horizon and a warning sign in the distance. But now, home from a long hospital stay after a devastating accident, this new vision, this castle out of nowhere, will change the course of his life.
