Reading GOF again (my personal favorite of the series) and the Triwizard Tournament comes off very dry and matter of fact, no music, no fireworks, it's all very "Very well then here's the deadly challenge, can everyone see? No? Maybe? Possibly? Who cares, 321 die"

I'm talking about Entrance Music for each person, Giant boards that stream what the Competitors see or at least what they are facing.


** linkffn(The Futile Facade) has a very intense tournament. There are devices that allow the audience to see what is going on and the tasks are very open. This fic is the fourth in a series.

  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.

** I've got part of that in my story "Patron". The (different) tasks are all far more spectator-friendly, with magical displaying the action for everyone to see.

The tournament also involves events for those who didn't make the cut, in between the tasks - curse-breaking and duelling tournaments as well as a Quidditch tournament.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
