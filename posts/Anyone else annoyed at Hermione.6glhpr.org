** So you are actually not annoyed at Hermione, but at how she is portrayed in most fics? If so, then I am too

** Depends ot the author, sometimes it really feels like some of them outsource Harry's brain to her and his conscience/work ethic etc. too (as in he'd cease to be more than a trained monkey who only knows how to eat, fight with Draco and maybe play quidditch without her!) so of course she has to read all the books Harry has access to, so she can teach him how to use the knowledge in those books :(

Indeed many make her into a total book fanatic - I get it, she's an academic, she's pretty smart (though not a prodigy like Dumbledore, Riddle or Merlin!), but she'd not throw away friendship for some damned books :(

Sadly canon portraits her this way, just not as extreme! I mean she is bossy (Sorry, Hermione, you aren't Harry's mother or his wife, so leave him alone damned!), socially inept (going behind peoples backs, like with the Firebolt incident...damned, she didn't even talk to Harry before going to McGonagall! He was right to not speak to her for a while!), she can't leave people alone and has got to know everything going on in their heads (again: Sorry, but Harry has the right to keep things from you, it's called a right to privacy Granger!), she worships a guy who put a child (Harry!) in an abusive environment (Yes, trying to hit children with frying pans is ABUSE, not "just" neglect!) without checking on said child and probably without having propper authorization to do this!

Still, it's easier to fix than many authors think (even without bashing!):

Make your Harry assert himself and set some boundries (and stick to them - defend them like an American gun owner does his home!)

** Most fanfics are crap anyway. My advice is to identify authors you like and stick with them, also look for their favorites because chances are you will like them too.

When it comes to Hermione centric authors, I like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/636397/][lorien829]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Starfox5]].

*** The problem is that she is either very annoying or very perfect in most fics, I don't hate her in canon, but I try to avoid fics that list her as main character.

***** I like Draco sometimes but not Dramione, and I usually filter out only Snape and Hermione. Snape is actually the worst fanfiction character in my opinion, I kind of liked him in the books, but I can't stand him in most fanfics. Hermione is the second worst for me.

***** snape and draco here, although ron is often a choice.

Hermione on the other hand is a difficult subject, she was bossy in the first books but nothing out of character, once the character grew it mostly went away, at least the annoying parts. The are plenty fics out there with a well written Hermione, the problem is that many people like to put her together with Ron and Dumbledore, making her quite a bich.

I tend to spoil myself most fics by skimming through comments to get some clues as to the personalities of some characters, its the best way to find some decents reads.

**** Isn't that more or less canon? I mean she only has one real weakness in canon: Her lack of good social skills (and she's insecure at the start, but that gets fixed rather quick!), otherwise she's little miss perfect, the teacher's pet who can do no wrong! I mean people take her side with that cursed parchment (I am kind of torn about this, on the one hand Marrieta deserved what she got, on the other hand: It's a tad cruel!), with the Firebolt incident (going behind a friends back!), when she intrudes on Harry's privacy (tries to weedle out secrets from him). Hell, many support her decision to obliviate her parents, which I don't (I'd rather die than have somebody erase my memories, as without them I cease to be me, so I might as well be DEAD! I mean death of personality is a punishment in Babylon 5 for example because it's like you are killing that person without actually pulling the trigger!)...hell, I'd love to hear her parents tear into her for doing it!

*** I'm split on those depictions. On one hand, I sympathize with the bossiness, book addiction, and knowitallitis, having been that way at that age. And most ages.

On the other hand, I had had about zero trust for any and all authority figures long before 11, so the teacher-worship makes me cringe. Although I would have acted as she did to Lockhart, at first, had I had a class taught by Bill Nye...

**** You could be describing me, it just didn't apply to all school subjects (I wasn't interested in maths for example - but biology? history? economics? etc. Bring it on!), but then again:

I didn't try to beat that knowledge into other peoples heads and neither did I always try to show off (sure I participated in class, more than most others, but I didn't try to make others look stupid!)

I also was not bossy, not really - I liked taking the lead, but I wasn't affraid to surrender the reigns from time to time!

As for authority? I was bullied in school by students and sometimes by the teachers, too so I trust no authority figure! I distrust even the police and fire-department (the former because I fear them abusing their authority and use excessive force/violence and the later because I don't trust them to save a building when they are putting a fire out...I've seen them totally destroy a building in our neighborhood which IMHO could have been saved (some of them admitted that to me in private, too), but no they had to show off their equipment and used a high-pressure hose and destroyed what the fire left...that building had to be torn down later because it was a safety hazard!)

So while I have some sympathy for Hermione, I think she should know some boundries (I don't think she'd react well if people tried to pry into her life, so why is it ok for her to do so with others?)

***** As a person, who as a small child, told an individual described as "a large, scary man" by others, for smoking, asking him loudly why he was killing himself, thinking that only people unaware of the dangers thereof would do so...

I understand only too well!

*** Indeed - "XYZ is dark magic, you shouldn't do it...oh, by the way I cursed that parchment (which of course is NOT dark magic, right?)"

Same for "Follow Dumbledore he's the greatest - what, Dumbledore and the wizard world use houselfs? Down with the slavers, down with the slavers!" :(

Hell, she had a crush on Lockhart because he looked smooth and had writen some books (in her mind books seem to be right, despite the fact that many books in the wizard world were probably writen by the likes of Draco and Lucius Malfoy - so: Propaganda pieces!)

Yeah, that's why so many independent Harry stories bash her, instead of them (Harry and Hermione) having a serious (no, Sirius, I wasn't talking to or about you!) talk and him setting some boundries! She doesn't have to know everything that goes on in his head, it's ok to keep secrets even from friends (especially if someone else asks you to keep a secret!)
