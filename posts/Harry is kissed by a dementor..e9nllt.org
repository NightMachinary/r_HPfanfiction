But he's a ginger, so it doesn't work.


** You know, we already have prime ginger material(like, 10 of them), Harry doesn't have to be changed.

** Because of his mother's sacrifice, anything that will kill him will rebound! Suddenly the Dementor turns into a dark-skinned girl in a robe who has fallen in love with Harry.

Maybe I need to read less manga.

** Instead of sucking out his soul, he sucks out all the souls that the dementor had consumed.

** Harry was enjoying the view in park near his loving home in Surrey. He suddenly felt dreadful and air turned colder than winter. He looked arpund frantically for the source and saw two dark robed figures approaching him. He knows then and there that his life was forfeit. He cursed his stupid uncle who locked away his wand under the cupboard.

Both dementors held him in his place and pulled their hoods and kissed him on his lips to suck away his soul. But suddenly the dementor pulled away like it got electric shock.

Both dementors were on their knees in front him.

"My Lord Potter-Black-Azkaban-Gryffindore-Slytherin.....and other 500 useless titles. Please forgive us. We don't know it was you, My Lord."

Harry was shocked at the sudden turn of events. He no longer felt fear and despair. It took him few moments to gather himself.

"What do you mean by My Lord?" asked Harry.

"What do you mean by that, My Lord? Don't you know that you're Lord Potter.....-Apple-Microsoft-Instagram?? Your magical guardian should tell you this on your 11th birthday." asked dementor-1 with confusion

"No. No one ever told me. What does this means? Who is my magical guardian?"

"We need to go to gringotts my Lord. They know everything about everything and nothing. They will help you. After all you're Lord Potter-...-Mouse-Keyboard." replied dementor-2 with anger in it's voice that someone deliberately kept this information away from it's young Lord. They were gonna pay for it.

---Scene Break----

A trip to Gringotts later. He was 100 times richer than entire North American economy and owns 2/3rd of the Earth. His magical core was now bigger than black hole.

---Scene Break---

"Harry my boy. It was for GREATER GOOD that you should give away your titles and marry Ginevra." said Dumbledore in his grand fathwrly voice and twinkling eyes.

"That's Lord Potter-....-Lipstick-MakeupKit to you, old geezer." replied Hadrian Potter. Dumbledore was shocked at this. He didn't know that Potters were related to Lemondrop family. He couldn't do anything. He was completely powerless against Lemondrop family.

---War---

Dementors kissed everyone except Daphne Greengrass and Neville Longbottom. All others were traitors.

---The End---

*** For a moment there, I thought you had Dumbledore saying "that you should give away your titties and marry Ginerva," and that you were folding in the Harriet Potter trope as well. :)

Lord Potter-Apple-Microsoft-Instagram. I ship it!

*** I like these kind of stories but I do realize they can be a bit over the top.
