Has anybody saved "The Daughter of Darkness" by Maxx_Mouse1441 and it's sequel "The Princess of Darkness" (and any other in the series)? It's Hermione/Belatrix. They used to be on AO3, but the author has deleted their account.\\
I'd really like a copy of these stories. Also interested in anything else by that author.


** if anyone has it, please also give me a copy ðŸ˜Š
