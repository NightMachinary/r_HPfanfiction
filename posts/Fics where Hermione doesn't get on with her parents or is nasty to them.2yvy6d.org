Just realised I'm not sure I've ever come across a fic that gives an explanation for why Hermione's parents never show up in canon. I've read quite a few fix fics where they have more of a presence but I wondered if anyone's come across any where the author tries to explain it otherwise?


** Nos tres reges's outstanding story [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=13093][VINCET]] and sequel was one having a very nonstandard set of parents for Hermione. Her relationship with her mother (she was a designer test-tube baby) is strained.
