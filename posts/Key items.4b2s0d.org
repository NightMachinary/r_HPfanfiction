What would be all the key items in the hp canon that would be worth acquiring. And how would one get the elder wand as early as possible without dumbledore finding out who did it.


** Technically you don't need any item at all. It is fanfiction, a free for all, for all i know you can just make harry punch voldemort to death. But for the elder wand, make it canon till 4th book ending, Dumbledore figures Moody is impostor, goes to graveyard, saves Harry and dies. Leadership goes to Lucius Malfoy, Harry defeats him next year at ministry, wand is anonimously sent to him by Snape.
