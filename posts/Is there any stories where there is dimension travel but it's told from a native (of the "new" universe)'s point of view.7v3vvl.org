  What happened to the Other Hermione that Harry encountered in "Shadow Walks"? As she struggles to survive, despite immense loss, in a world that no longer has a place for her, how will the reappearance of someone she'd thought she'd never see again change her life completely? Reading "Shadow Walks" first is advised. Companion piece; alternate universe.

Don't get disheartened by the Harry/Multi, there hasn't been a single chapter with anything close to romance yet. Mostly its been character develop and the actual plot.
