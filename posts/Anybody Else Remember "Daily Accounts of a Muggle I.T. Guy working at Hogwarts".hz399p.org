I stumbled across [[https://thesetupwizard.tumblr.com/tagged/setupwizard/chrono][this masterpiece of fanfiction]] while cleaning up old social media and I figured you all would be the perfect people to appreciate its genius.

"When I was first starting out in this position I had easily become the target of many pranks from the students. Did you know there is a freaking spell that glues your feet to the ground? I know.

It took all of 2 days for them to quickly realize I literally have a switch that shuts off all the wifi access to the entire school. I don't need forbidden curses. I have more power than any witch or wizard at this school could ever possibly imagine."

What were your favorites?


** One of the few fics with genuinely useful advice.

I have several younger, very annoying siblings. I also happen to be the only one of us with access to the router settings. If they annoy me too much, I enable a time rule limiting their phone and laptop to 1:01-1:02 AM, because the router doesn't have a proper way to temporarily block a specific device.

I have more power over them than our parents do. Muahahaha.

** Honestly I got into the Tomione ship (gross, I know) when I was like 11, because of this masterpiece of a fic that made me cry. It's sort of had the same outcome as the mortal instruments.

In those books, the main villain of the entire series repents at the end elements about the time he could've had with the main character.

It was Hermione going back in time to stop him from becoming Voldemort or killing him, and he was a dick the entire time. They ended up becoming friends or acquaintances at least because of a project and she never really fell in love with him, but never really made sense to me in that ship anyway.

However, he fell in love with her, and at the final battle sacrificed himself by committing suicide. So really, anything that will make my cold heart connect with the characters.

**** Thank you so much for linking this! I have heard something about this before but never in such detail. I kind of regret reading The Mortal Instruments in general because those were mediocre at best, but now I feel the weight of giving my support to a plagiarist.

On a side note, I really hate that reddit archives posts. I would have loved to give [[/u/iwasonceafangirl][u/iwasonceafangirl]] a like at least.

***** No problem! I don't think you have to feel bad about enjoying a story even if the writer is an asshole. I mean, we're all doing that right now.

I feel you though. I lost my shit when I read about the Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness dude ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/9n4vge/fanfic_community_popular_author_turns_out_to_be_a/]]) though by the time I got to the end of the story it made sense.

Everything that girl has submitted to that sub is pure gold. Definitely check out the one about the Snapewives.

*** I mean the guy updated it for three years, so I'd call it a full length fic on a Tumblr account.

***** It's a weird format for sure, but it really works here. The Tumblr page itself is part of the story.
