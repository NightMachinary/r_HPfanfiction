...and the adults are actually portrayed as adults?

I find it really strange when reading all these varied stories where an eleven-year-old can outplay seasoned political veterans after one month of study. Or when adults act way too petty or immature.

It just doesn't make sense.

Eleven-year-olds should be making retching noises at kissing and protesting against the use of sunscreen. Not politicking or 'employing ample quantities' of verbose.

I guess I just really need a regular age-appropriate experience in a fantasy setting. One where the character actually matures because they grew as a person over time.

Just give me a 'normal' boarding school fic that isn't focused on the actual day-to-day fluff.

Thoughts?

It's because kids are hard to write, even the canon books made them way more mature than most kids their age.

Those are hard to come by, some times it's hard for the writer, or sometimes they don't bother because many readers would find it boring.

I can agree that should be the norm, but reading about that can get boring, and you can justify kids being more mature or having better vocabulary, OR you can just skip that and begin the story in 3rd/4th year and have the characters be old enough for more interesting magic, romance, and more danger.

I am gonna be honest, I find normal boarding school for eleven year olds boring, it's just hard to imagine kids doing interesting stuff that we haven't read a thousand times.

That's why I like when authors put Harry in another House and write it well, it changes things up, many authors keep to the stations of canon way too much and we end up getting 'boring' stories.

I have no trouble with kids acting more mature(as in dialogue) but it has a limit, I don't like when they make the adults so incompetent, or when the kids are too mature, having an eleven-year-old acting as if they were fourteen on some things is not THAT unbelievable, you can just say magic children are different. With Harry who lived a life of abuse it's even easier.

But yeah, kid politicians just stretch it.

*** That's a big thing that struck me yesterday - a fic that I just read actually /had kids playing/. I mean, the muggleborns ran out onto the grounds during their first afternoon off, dragging along their new (magical and somewhat unwilling) friends, and played some footie. They had wars with the little green army men (which are superior to ones that move for eleven-year-old-boy reasons) and so on.

They weren't magical toys (iirc the only 'magical' game was aurors and robbers) but like... I had never seen it before. It was refreshing, especially since this Harry didn't have a normal childhood either. It wasn't even a huge part of the plot, but it was present and it gave the impression that it happened frequently even if we didn't see it.

#+end_quote

I 100% agree with the "Kids should act as kids" bit, but for the petty adults . . . Snape. More seriously, and without going too political, recent events showed us that some adult can be just as petty and immature than kids. I think it's fin to include it in fanfictions (and stories in general), as long as the character is considered as /petty/ immature/ in the story, and that there are some mature people to balance things out.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

*** Not at all!

For example, I'm completely fine with 'the boring stuff' as you put it. It can be some of the best parts of a fic.

What annoys me are the fics where they try to make 'the boring stuff' unrealistic. Like, for example, first-years speaking in a formal language with each other in the hallways between class. Talking politics or calling each other Heiress X or Heir X while in the common room, y'know?

What I'm saying is we need more realistic boring stuff, not less of it in general.

Like, enjoy school life. You're at a mixed-gender boarding school. How are you not goofing off or acting your age in your free time?

"Stop sending mail to the goblins and go take a dunk in the lake, Mr Potter!"

But what I meant by that comment is that we only get this normal interaction in the 'friendship/family' fluff fics or the ones that centre themselves purposely around those interactions.

We never get this casual attitude in fics not centred around school life. It's never used as just a regular side-thing. That's what's sad to me.

A Second Chance

This is the only fic that I think demonstrates children being children. Sirius gets a trial after 4 years, and takes over Harry's guardianship.

So you get almost all of Harry's emotional developments. He has his issues of abuse from the Dursleys. Jealousy issues from Sirius' girlfriends, testing boundaries and rules as any child does with their parents, and a lot more.

*** "The Best Revenge" and it's sequel are amazing! I love it so much! I would have to say that my favorite things about it are how the adults actually act like /responsible/ adults and the kids act like kids, as well as the Wizarding World Explorers Club and Hufflepuff Harry. It's exciting and suspenseful at parts and it also shows how much better things can go for the Wizarding World when people actually come together, despite their differences, and try to find a common ground.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

He is actually a child figuring things out for himself. Adults are mostly mildly perplexed by Harry, excepting the few that are outright malicious (Dursleys, a teacher or two).

I also have the adult creatures behaving as adults in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15911484]])

because this is also a frustration of mine. It's been really challenging, but as you say, I'm aiming for precocious, smart but naive bad innocent children with their own childish logic rather than children that are smart and so think like adults. From my comments and feedback so far it seems most people think I'm doing ok with it.

  Albus Dumbledore's hiring habits leave a lot to be desired. Even if the choice of teachers weren't questionable, the methods are.

  When Hadrian James Potter felled the Dark Lord Voldemort, it wasn't only wixenkind who celebrated their newfound freedoms. When the Chief Warlock then moves to leave their apparently beloved little Harry Potter on a doorstep on a blustery November night it is the creatures that step up to care for and raise the Boy-Who-Lived. In the process the Boy-Who-Was-Left-Alone becomes something that no one quite expected. Not Voldemort, certainly not Dumbledore, nor any other wizard either.

** Writing interesting or funny stories about kids is hard. While kids always do stuff it is not that engaging for older readers, nevermind the younger writers that see themselves as more mature than they are and write the characters in a similar way.

I personally like to write stories about kids more in a slice of life style, in those they can their behavior slowly, without needed to show any specific moment when they grew in that way

*** I agree that it is a challenge, but I think that makes the story that much better in the end.

Though managing to portray them adequately out of a 'slice of life' style story is harder, I think. For me, at least, even though it makes the non-slice of life story THAT much better.

I don't think it should centre around specific moments, though. Small thoughts or observations are usually enough to set the mood, especially if your POV/Limited is a child protagonist.

For example, I recently included one of those moments in my own fic - Harry (age 8/9) is spending some time in Egypt, and so he needs to be prepared for the weather. His parents force him to use sunscreen, and he hates using sunscreen. So he sulks.

It's a pretty simple bit, but my fic isn't centred around 'slice of life' - it's fantasy/adventure. And this whole idea of 'engaging for older readers' I find a little bs. It's a magical world, and there's no age limit for magic. Experiencing new sights and sounds doesn't require much in terms of maturity, and you can still write a fantastic story.

Harry shouldn't be written as a child wizard, he should be written as a wizard, who happens to be a child. In that order of focus, while keeping both in mind. That's my angle, even if I have to remind myself at times.
