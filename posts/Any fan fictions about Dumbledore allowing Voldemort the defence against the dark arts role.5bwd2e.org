**** I don't think he'd be that good of a professor.

I mean, if you think about it... he was a demented, sadistic little shit before he even got to Hogwarts.

That's not even taking into account when he /did/ get to Hogwarts and let ripped his soul into pieces.

And we still don't even know what he did to Myrtle's body. Who /knows/ what he did with that shit?

***** Hogwarts was his home. He applied for the position twice, which shows that he actually deeply cared for it and wished to stay in his home.

I honestly think he would have given the Dark Lord process to be a teacher... it may seem like it's character breaking, but such a small change could have changed him completely.

****** The way the you experience 'deeply caring' and the way a psychopath does is not the same thing. He wanted to power of being a teacher in order to shape the world into one that made sense to him.

And for teaching to change him completely it would have been completely character breaking. Tom essentially had magically-induced psychopathy, it defined his entire existence. For him to care about the feelings or happiness of anyone but himself would require him to be a different person altogether.
