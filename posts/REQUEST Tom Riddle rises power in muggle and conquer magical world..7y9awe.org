What if Tom Riddle, instead of assuming the title of "lord voldermot," decides to hide in muggle world, rise to power with both magic and his political tactics, then take over the magical world too? Wouldn't /that/ be interesting?


** I can't seem to find a link for it, but I remember Taure did a short story along these lines. I think it was called “Yes Minister”. It's been a while since I read it but I remember it being pretty good.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
