What's a piece of Harry Potter lore that you no longer recall is fanon or canon? I've noticed that in reading so much fanfiction there are quite a few things that get mixed up, and I can't remember where I read them most of the time. Book? Fanfiction? Fan theory? A good prompt on this subreddit? Heck if I remember! How about you? I want to hear was canon and fanon you all get mixed up, I know I can't be the only one!

My thing is that I can't remember if Tom Riddle being incapable of feeling love because he's the product of a love potion is canon or fanon.


** Regulus. He is not in the books like, at all bar a brief mention but I can see his face and personality so well in my head because of the amount of Regulus I've read.

And I can tell you all about the complicated relationship he had with his brother. How they were so close as kids because Sirius used to cover for him but that broke down sometime during Sirius's 3rd year when Regulus came to Hogwarts. By Sirius's 5th year they were barely talking and never in public but they used to sneak up to the Astronomy tower at night to talk in their posh, dry sarcasm, under the stars because it was something they could never see at home in London (ironically, Sirius always saw more of his family from hogwarts than he ever did at home.) By the end of the years they weren't talking at all but Regulus would still curb attention from Sirius at home when he could. Problem was Sirius was also trying to curb attention from Reg so they both ended up getting in trouble for it but neither would talk to the other about it. When Sirius left, Reg spiralled further and further into Dark Arts, just desperately trying to keep himself alive. Which is where he found Horcruxes... and why he knew he had to destroy them...

Oh wait, thats not in the books?

** So it doesnt happen very often in my case, the only one which i remember is that i thought Sirius middle name is Orion and James' is Fleamont, but they dont have one in Canon. And a few house traits like that slytherins care about brotherhood and hufflepuffs are good finders.

I often see that people forget that Hermione didnt know what mudblood means in CoS. And many portray Lyall Lupin as an abusive, homophobic father in fanfics and thanks too atyd many think that Remus father is a bad father, even though he is supportive and still loved his wife and son in canon

***** Yes. And many forget that it is ONLY in the movies. I am still angry how they portrayed Ron in the movies. Like why should Hermione know what it means?! And one of my favourite scenes in PoA, the book, is the one in which Ron stands up from the bed with his broken leg and goes infront of Harry and says to Sirius, who they think is a murderer, that he needs to kill them all when he wants to kill Harry. In the movie it isnt as near as a sweet sign of friendship because Hermione does it

Neither of those things are canon and every time I read an otherwise enjoyable fan work I lose interest when I see those pop up.

*** This is more a case of the fandom bringing over a shorthand word from other works of fiction to describe a near-identical concept. The basic idea of what a ward is does exist in canon, but there doesn't seem to be a dedicated word for the idea of protective enchantments placed over a house, building, or other static location.

***** I think he says "there's not a wizard who's gone to slytherin and not gone dark" or something like that.

Admittedly, this statement, alongside what Hagrid says, is what makes Harry beg the hat for Gryffindor. If Ron and Hagrid hadn't said what they did, he might've accepted its decision.
