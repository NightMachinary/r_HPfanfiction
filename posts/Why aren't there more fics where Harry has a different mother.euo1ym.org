Maybe James moved on from Lily, or he cheated on her -- just think about the possibilities!

And yet, I can't seem to find any fanfic where this is the case.


** Lily is pretty much the entire reason Harry is special or important and most writers aren't prepared to handle the divergences that would result from upsetting the entire premise of the series.

** Because that's not HARRY POTTER anymore.

I don't read fics that feature different parents for Harry. (That's right, James must be his father too, so no Severitus either)

There's a line I have to draw somewhere.

** In fics where James isn't Harry's father, usually nobody finds out until years later. That wouldn't be possible if Harry had a different mother. You could still write a fic like that, but Harry would necessarily have a completely different childhood--it wouldn't make sense for him to live with Petunia.

** Don' be dissin' on Saint Lily the defiant!

I mean...

Part of the problem with this is that there are very few women of that generation with any amount of info, and by Harry's time they're all dead or married. With Lily, there are several somewhat-distinguishable men that could have been Harry's father with some alteration of backstory- Sirius, Regulus, Severus, even Peter or Remus -- though the black hair would require an explanation. Of the women, we have Lily, Marlene McKinnon, Alice (eventually-) Longbottom, Narcissa & Andromeda Black, Rita Skeeter, and Bertha Jorkins.

*** Don't forget Petunia in the list of women.

But yes, there's just few appealing women characters of that generation for this, so it'd basically either have to be an OC or a female version of one of the male characters for it to work.

** Possibly because it's really hard to fake which woman had the baby come out of her body. Different father is much easier to orchestrate.

That being said, Who Is Harry Potter? by BeepKeeper has neither James nor Lily as his parent. linkffn(13218646) Warning that Lily, James, and Sirius are all horrible, horrible people, but the story is absolutely lovely.

  When Harry arrives at Gringotts, Hagrid produces the key but there's nothing else proving that the child is Harry Potter. What if there is a dark story behind the origin of the Boy-Who-Lived. Bashing Potters, Sirius and Dumbles. Good Goblins and Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. HEA in the end.

*** Not really. There's not really any other feasible canon ones that people would gravitate towards. In contrast we know a lot of other male characters from that time period.

Eg, if you had to rank the top 5 characters of interest from the generation of Harry's parents, Lily might just be the only woman on there - compared to James, Snape, Sirius, and Remus for men. What other women are there even - Petunia, Narcissa, Alice? Maybe Bellatrix? Not really many appealing ones for Harry's mother in there

*** Lily's sacrifice is the reason why Harry is special and survived. Lily only got the choice to stand aside because Snape wanted to smash that sweet redhead. Snape knew about the prophecy and Voldemort's plan because he was the one who told him. It would be beyond contrived to alter all that to a new set of characters.

So it is not a double standard but merely the fact that Lily as Harry's mother is the single element which would be the hardest to alter. Sirius as Harry's father? Sure, James was infertile and asked his brother in all but blood for a donation. But Lily cannot be replaced in the same manner.

**** So glad you asked. I think Ron and Lavender could have worked out if Lavender chilled on the PDA and Ron actually cared (because I do agree that Ron did take advantage of her feelings towards the end). For all Lavender's faults, she showed obvious, consistent interest in Ron which is more than I can say for goddess Hermione. Ignoring the bickering aspect of the 'ship, Hermione never saw Ron's potential and constantly put him down - [[https://www.quora.com/Isnt-Hermione-somehow-harsh-to-Ron][see this link for more]]. If my crush complimented our mutual best friend, calling them 'fanciable' and 'scarred' and 'tall' when I'm all those things as well, I'd take that as a sign of disinterest.

If they had talked things out and made more of an effort, they could have gone somewhere. It's really sad that their relationship was played for laughs and so that Ron could become 'deserving' of Hermione.

***** I'm not saying that list is wrong, but this list is exactly like the lists made for Ron. And taken out of context and proportion. The turnabout is deliciously ironic.

I'm not a RonxHermione shipper either. Some of the bashing fics have it right: those two would be bickering with nothing to talk about until the end of time.

I need to find a similar list for Harry.
