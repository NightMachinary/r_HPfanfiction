I was wondering if you could use docs as it's way easier in my opinion than word. Thanks


** I don't think so. It's so annoying having to bring things over from docs because of formatting issues so I wish we could!

*** Ok, thanks though. I hope to start my story by next week. I have it all planned out and ready to go. I just need to write it.

** You might be able to copy it directly into ffn, I know you can write it directly in there, though I have no idea if there's going to be any formating issues.
