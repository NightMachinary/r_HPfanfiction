Hey, all. Just a quick question!

I've been planning out this mostly-OC story set at Ilvermorny for a long time now, and I'm finally hashing out the details/plotline and writing the actual story. However, there are several things about the established canon that are either a little too colonialist, too "Ilvermorny is the only school in America period", or too British-influenced, in my opinion, notably how the school itself is supposed to run. For example, I want my main character to start as a freshman in high school (so, like, age 15) rather than a 12-year-old, since schools with middle/high school grades combined are pretty rare in the States.

Since Ilvermorny isn't insanely fleshed out, nor is it a super popular school to use in HP fanfic anyway, do you think people would mind if I changed some already-established canon, provided I had an explanation for everything? Or would it be too weird? I'm still keeping the rules of Rowling's universe, the history of magical America overall, the Ilvermorny houses, all of that. I guess I just don't like how Ilvermorny is set up in some ways, heh.

** Do it!

Hell, I think we get away with a lot of rewriting /Hogwarts/ with our OCs, especially the ones from other houses besides Gryffindor.

Each OC is a unique perspective, and that's why I personally really like a well-written OC. A new perspective is exactly what a lot of us are here to read ;)

**** The MAgical Congress of the United States of America preexisted not only the First Continental Congress, but also the existence of States in America and their unity. By around a hundred years. Not a single word of that atrocious acronym other than 'Magical' makes any historical sense at all.

It's supposed to be a unified governing body of North American magical communities with its own law enforcement and legislature and everything, but not only was there no unified concept of 'North America' at the time, but there wasn't even a No-Maj corollary for that for the thirteen colonies after they became States independent from England. We didn't have a federal government that unified stuff like that until 1787. The entire concept of a governing body for magical society that covered even the colonies under one blanket before the 1770s is ludicrous.

Much less 1693.

There are so many different and better directions to go with it. I highly recommend fanfic writers who want to seriously explore magical history on this side of the pond completely scrap MACUSA and its accompanying history, and go from scratch.

***** I used the term MACUSA in my fanfic, but this is the government only for the territory the USA covered in 1781 plus Florida and it wasn't like that in 1693. But I'm not going to delve into history because I'm garbage at American History and my story is unashamedly European/Old-World-centric. Although, I'll make sure to clearly mention the First Nations being wholly part of the wizarding community in North America outside of MACUSA.

***** I never thought about that...maybe I can keep MACUSA but change when they were formed so it makes sense haha. Maybe they came about around the same time as/shortly after the American Revolution, so Ilvermorny would've relied on the Ministry beforehand.

** I think America would have a lot more indigenous magic. Like I lived in Western Colorado/NE Utah an hour north of the Navajo (Dine) Nation. I'm indigenous Polynesian Hawai'ian, we call ourselves kanaka maoli, the people in the Hawai'Ian language just like Dine is the people in the Navajo language.

I like to think Illvermorny is more of an east coast thing, like how Chaote, Boston Latin and those other NE prep schools are big in the New England and the Northeast US but not so the South, Southwest, Mountain West and West Coast. Spanish magical influence would also be cool in those other areas.

That's just been my personal head canon.

*** I completely agree! I found out the Mohican tribe was originally from the same area as where Ilvermorny is located, so I would like to research some of their traditions/history to see if that could be incorporated into my version of Ilvermorny's history. I'd rather try to be as accurate as possible rather than just a vague “Yeah there's some Native American influence I guess, maybe some Cherokee or whatever even though they're nowhere near here but no one will notice,” ‘cause...no.

#+end_quote

Make Ilvermorny a highschool where the first two years are OWL prep year (9th) and OWL testing year (10th), and the second two years are NEWT prep year (11th) and NEWT testing year (12th).

Make the middle school years after-school sessions and summer camps. For theory and basic stuff like wand safety, potions ingredient preparation, stirring, basic spells, history and astronomy.

Hell, this might become my headcanon. This forces them to do muggle school, for math, science, history, english, and the most important of all: muggle studies!

You don't have to do it this way, but it is a way to make it possible.

*** That's pretty similar to my plan:

In the 1960s, a lot of American public schools shifted into the middle school/high school format, so to keep up with the times (as well as all of the other schools that had popped up that were taking away some of the younger students), Ilvermorny did the same and now only has 9th through 12th grade. Some other, smaller schools did the same, but the rest kept the 7 year format. So, many students entering Ilvermorny either went to a 7 year school and left after 8th grade for whatever reason (maybe they were tired of it, or maybe they were expelled), attended summer camps (imagine Theatre camp but wizards lol), were homeschooled in the basic subjects of Charms, Potions and whatnot, or even went to public school. By the end of 8th grade they'd have to take some test to prove that they had all the basic knowledge to enter the 9th grade, otherwise they'd be held back/prevented from obtaining acceptance to Ilvermorny/whatever school.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall]] Does it this way, at least for the intro years. Or something. Harry got his wand really early. They had after-school classes and summer camps. And they were allowed magic /only/ at home. It could have been an elementary school deal.

** Definitely go for it. Harry Potter canon for anything outside of Britain is pretty poor, and should not restrict you in the least.

Ilvermorny is only set up that way because people associate the british influences in Hogwarts with magical ones - eg, the house system.

Just go for whatever you think is more interesting!

** I'd still start them at 11 and end at 17, they boom seem to be important ages for magical development in canon. I would strike a good balance between American influences and magical influences. Remember, it's unlikely that magical American society would completely mirror muggle society. It'd have its own evolution from wizarding societies elsewhere. If your mc starts at 15, he should already be competent to a level of other 15 year olds (else the school system is pure trash). A fusion of a 7 year school and American grading and courses might work.

​

Above all, I would make sure that Ilvermorny teaches wanded magic. No "unique magic that is superior because wandless magic ruled by intent makes everyone a god".
