The Firebird Trilogy was the first HP fanfic I read, and I absolutely loved it. IIRC it was recommended to me here, and I was hoping you guys could recommend me some fics that are similar. They don't necessarily have to have a harem or any of the same pairings, but a similar style of worldbuilding and stuff would be awesome.

** "Patron", linkffn(11080542), has excellent world building. Its magical society was also kind depressing, but the ending was more hopeful than Firebird. Another great part of this story is the back-n-forth chess moves between Dumbledore and Voldemort.

"The Animagus Series", linkffn(9863146;12076644;12088294), is great in building a very extensive magical world. For example, Dumbledore and Australian Grand Wizard Edward Grayson saw major actions in East Africa against a local dark lord named Kigami Ngeze. Voldemort gained an important ally in La Pantera in Mexico, and the Dark Lord of Leningrad Konstantin Jugashvilli was interested in joining forces with him.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** You're looking for stories with worldbuilding like the Firebird trilogy, whose worldbuilding [[https://blog.ikeran.org/?p=201][is sorely lacking]]. The flaws might be corrected eventually, but I reread the first twelve chapters recently and came up with more than one apparent flaw per chapter. My patience had already run out several chapters prior and I wasn't willing to give it any more chances. You /can/ write a story where that many questions come up, but it takes special care, and you need a PoV character actively trying to figure out what's going on.

If I recall correctly, the core conflict in the Firebird trilogy was: evil power-hungry women take control of men, who are naturally stronger, by forcing them to use dinky female wands instead of giant male staves (phallic imagery ahoy) and by forcing them into marriages, stealing their magical power. Basically an MRA's cautionary dystopia tale.

linkao3(DSS Requirement by esama) Its worldbuilding suffers one significant flaw. However, that flaw would be easy enough to rectify, which means it doesn't quite qualify. Also, it doesn't have MRA-tastic subtext -- its tone is closer to Star Trek. But it did come to mind.

I mean, you /could/ take it that way, but that's just more Darth Marrs than anything else.

Dude tends to write pretty dark shit that inevitably gets darker as it goes along. It's pretty clear where he started with the idea of a world of swapped gender roles, and then took it very extreme.

***** You're welcome to your opinion, I just disagree. After reading most of Darth Marrs other work, there's an easy to see pattern. Guy just writes dark shit.

Honestly,I thought Marrs had actually created a relatively well thought out world with swapped gender roles. Besides for the magical aspect, it reflects the way women have been historically repressed ever since the widespread adaption of agriculture.

Even the wands fit into the idea well, after all men have used (obviously non magical) tools to repress women as well. Clothing seems to be one of the more obvious fits here, as female clothing (at least in Western societies) has been almost universally less functional than male clothing for a significant period of time.

You can choose to interpret it how you wish, but I think you're doing a disservice to the writer and the effort he put into his work.
