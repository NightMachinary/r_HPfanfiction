Look, some people like it, few love it, and most hate it. No matter how you slice it, I find it very interesting how muggles adapt and change while the wizarding world remains mostly stagnant. There are advantages and disadvantages to both sides, but I want to read some good old fashioned muggles beat (or at least equal) wizards with tech/magitech, either by themselves or because some muggleborn/halfblood gave them the tools to do so.

** Once my version of the muggle Tom Riddle escapes from Merope, he is determined to never be a victim of magic again, but instead exploit it to his own ends.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. Now complete! Sequel: Nymphadora Tonks: The Last Auror.

***** And it's not a completely bad thing. It allows people to relate better (since things don't generally change between generations) and it's great for keeping traditions. But it is. There have been advancements (Wolfsbane, Weasley twins, new spells, etc) but compared to the non magical side it's slow going.
