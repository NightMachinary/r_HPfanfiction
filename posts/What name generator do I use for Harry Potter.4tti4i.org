** For Muggle-borns, I look up lists of common names from the year of birth I want.

For purebloods, I look up lists of names from the 16th-18th century, some of them fit quite well. Then I try some until I think one fits the character well. But keep in mind that not all purebloods have "weird" names. Classic British names work just as well.

Oh, and I suggest to avoid names that scream "MARY SUE", like those girls names that have at least four syllables and are supposed to sound mysterious.

** JKR used a lot of literary references in naming her characters. Some are pretty obvious such as Remus Lupin.

Here's a good compilation of how she names characters: [[http://www.accio-quote.org/themes/names.htm]] As you can see, she has used Old English for Dumbledore's name.

Agreed on the fact that muggle-borns or students not from old pureblood families have much more normal names. Ted Tonks was muggleborn. Andromeda Black (Tonks) ... well, you can tell she was pureblood just from the name.

For background characters I suggest this name generator: [[http://www.behindthename.com/random/]] It's very customizable, as you can choose the language you want the names to reflect, and also look for literary names (such as Hermione) and biblical names (such as Hedwig).

Edit: She also named Albus (Dumbledore) and Rubeus (Hagrid) after White and Red, which are components alchemy. They're not the only color names we see in the series: the Black family, Lavender Brown. Also, many flower names: Pansy, Lily, Petunia.

My Oxford Compact Dictionary of the English Language sets the oldest attested usage of the word "dumbledore" in the 1780s. Modern English is roughly 1550 on.

In contrast, if you want a real Old English name, you would be looking at /Beowulf/, which would give you names like Wealhtheow, Hrothgar, Unferth, and Hygelac.

**** Ah, my bad. I was referring to the website, but I guess that does say old English (using old as an adjective) rather than Old English.

** [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/wizards_list.html][HPL's List of Characters]] will help you. There's a link on that page for Hogwarts students, as well as other groups (teachers, death eaters, etc).

I can't rec name generators because I don't use them--I prefer just browsing baby name websites--but there's themes among the names JKR uses--the Blacks favour stars and consellations, the Malfoys seems to use Roman and Greek names--but you could really pick anything, depending on your character. As you noted, Muggleborns tend to have more common names so you probably wouldn't want to call them something unusual. Although depending on the era you're setting it in, there is a trend for weird names for more recent babies, and if they'd got weird hippie parents then they might have an odd name. Similarly, you probably want to avoid a stoic pureblood named, for example, Jaz. (That said, note that the Weasleys favour more standard names, likely a stylistic choice by JKR to highlight how they're nice purebloods vs. the prejudiced Blacks and Malfoys.)

** For the Black Family : names in relation with stars (Orion, Sirius, etc)

Names like Remus, Cassandra Trelawney actually comes from mythology.

** You might like these two name generators here, [[http://www.springhole.net/writing_roleplaying_randomators/britishfantasynames.htm][1]], [[http://www.springhole.net/writing_roleplaying_randomators/american-mage-names.htm][2]], both of which have /Harry Potter/ style names in British flavor and American flavor, respectively. Some of them are recognizably inspired by the series, but there are some pretty decent ones that pop up too.

** [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Hogwarts_students][I think this may useful to you.]]

I don't try to make my OCs's names anything meaningful or Old English-y. I'm sure in canon there are families who like to preserve some of their old family names or believe in naming their child something meaningful. If that's the case then browsing through the HP Wikia may give me ideas as to how I should go about naming them.

I prefer to stick with normal names and last names. As long as it seems something that a character in that time period and area would be named I'm satisfied. So I like to use behindthename and behindthesurname for my HP OCs. I play around with combinations until I find something that sounds right to me.

(I leave the word meaning for when I'm creating spells.)

** For people named in the Muggle world, I usually pull up a list of common names from the UK -- surnames and given names for the decade in question. For instance, if I want to have a female version of Harry, I look at the rank of the name "Harry" in 1980, see that "Irene" is roughly as popular, and now she's named Irene.

Mages are harder. The Blacks use stars, constellations, and flowers. There are references to mythology (/Dedalus/ Diggle) and esoteric English words (Dumbledore). A lot of them were chosen, it seems, just to sound silly.

** Lots of flowers. Lots of fuddy-duddy out-of-style names. Lots of alliteration. References to classical mythology, but not to the bible or modern english literature.

** All of the other suggestions are good ideas, common names work for muggleborns and somewhat older frillier names work for purebloods.

I also have a list of names I've compiled, can send if you PM me.
