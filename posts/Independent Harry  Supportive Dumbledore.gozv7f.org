Hey everyone! I've checked out previous threads on this, but most of my results were pretty old so I was wondering if there would be new (or different) entries.

Any recommendations for a fic where Harry is largely independent, but Dumbledore is supportive and willing to use his considerable social/institutional influence to protect the next generation (Harry) in the war, /without/ sheltering them from it? Potentially as a cost of previously keeping secrets that backfired on him when Harry and/or others find out? Sort of a last ditch, "I made the wrong choices before, I'm not going to do that again" move.

Not really interested in slash or H/G, and nebulous romance bothers me in general so also not interested if there's a love triangle. HHr, H/DG are both good. No harem, please!

Thanks!


** Renegade - linkffn(11302568) - has a Independent, Grey Harry with a Dumbledore who trusts and supports him. Harry/Fleur. 5 years since last update.

Lesser Evils - linkffn(13106612) - there's a lot of conflict between them and Harry's not completely independent, but it is quite realistic. Harry/Ginny, but it doesn't really affect the plot. Complete.

Defiance - linkffn(12516323) - again, rocky start, but they get along well later, especially after Dumbledore starts training Harry personally. Harry/Daphne. 3 years since last update.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.
