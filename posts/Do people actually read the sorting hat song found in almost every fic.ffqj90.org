** Never read a single one. Even the ones in the original books. Anything of note in them will be discussed in the next couple paragraphs afterward anyway.

** If they're just copypasted because the fic is a canon rehash, no. The sentence "And then that hat sang a jaunty song" is better than copypasting the original books.

However, if the story takes place before or after canon, and the author went through the effort of writing a new song, I read it.

If they are stolen from the books - no point If they are original they are uniformly terrible. I get that most people can't manage to word play, but no one can manage doggerel either. They don't rhyme and they don't scan.

*** ...in my Last Mage HP fics, I came up with a couple of original songs for the second year onwards. Year 3 was set to the tune of American Pie and the Year 4 song to Bohemian Rhapsody, both promptly lampshaded.

The problem with original songs isn't just rhyming, it's getting it to scan as well, hence why I used existing music to guide me. Even then, it took longer to get those songs usable than writing not only the rest of the chapter but the next two chapters combined!

** I find that for in-universe poetry or song, it's usually hard to read. That's particularly true in fanfiction, since the quality of those often leaves a lot to be desired - but I find it hard to read those in most every book. I don't find them particularly fitting, either - if they have a point it'll be rehashed over by the characters at another point, and if it doesn't it's just a wall of text that could be condensed to a line about the hat (or whoever) singing.

That's just me, though (particularly for the non-fanfiction songs)

** I don't. I'd prefer the author gloss over it with "Harry tuned out the hat's singing" or other words to that same general effect -- establishing that yes, the hat is singing as per tradition, but nothing more than that.

** Not really, sometimes I do, specially when it can add something new to the fic. But sometimes like the fics with Slytherin Harry are pretty easy to predict, like it's going to be a paragraph where Harry will realize that Slytherin is everything that he wants, it can be because of having friends, power or vengeance.

Most of these don't have any original content, sometimes the songs are fine when they just dropped you a little hint that in the moment you don't realize and at the end you're like omg that was what the hat was saying. But those are really rare
