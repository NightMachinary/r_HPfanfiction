Forgive me if it isn't canon since the last time I read the books and not fanfic was when I was 12, so some info probably got jumbled in my head, but I'm looking for/requesting a fix where all the supposed amazing rumors about Harry Potter are actually true and he arrives at Hogwarts as a complete badass


** I've been planning a story similar to this, though it'll be a while until I get around to write it. Though it'd be a bit more complex.

** Is first year a requirement? Because there's a bunch of fics in which Harry returns in 5th or 6th year as Lord Gryffindor after a meeting with the Goblins, unlocking his obliviated memories, feeding him nutrition potions and removing the block on his magic with the Sword of Gryffindor on his shoulders and wearing contacts.

While the thought might be appealing it doesn't make for very good story telling.

*** Well, my idea is a bit different - and darker. Pre-Hogwarts, Harry and other kids - Hermione and Ron, maybe others - are abducted by the denizens of the Dream Realm, a plane/dimension where your imagination controls your environment, and which can usually only be visited in drems, and even then only by children. The denizens (styled after faeries) need mortal wizard children to deal with a threat they can't deal with. So, the kids who were abducted during their dreams are raised in that "faerie realm", with lots of fantastic creatures and elements - but not the sanitized "Disney" version - as a training of sorts, then sent against the main threat once they are deemed ready. The books about Harry's adventures are written by a wizard or witch who is one of the few adults able to catch more than glimpses of the Dreams Realms even after they grow up, and even so they can't remember that much - but enough to use for stories.

The thing is that what much of what works in the Dream Realms doesn't work well or at all in the Magical World since it's often imagination-based, imposing one's will on others and their surroundings. So, while the surviving kids are quite experienced by the time they are released from the Dream Realms, having grown too old to stay (say, around 14-16), they can't exactly curbstomp everyone in Wizarding Britain since wizard magic doesn't work quite that way.

So, the kids would be quite a bit messed up from their upbringing, and Wizarding Britain would realise that the Harry Potter Tales glossed over a lot of things.

** Well... there is one... Arrives in 5th or 6th year I forget which... linkffn(12321004)

I'm not sure if I did the bot right. Anyway its basically a parody on the "Lord Gryffindor" (And other cliches)fics that are mentioned below, and is basically made of crack. Or maybe crack on crack. You need to read it to see what I mean.
