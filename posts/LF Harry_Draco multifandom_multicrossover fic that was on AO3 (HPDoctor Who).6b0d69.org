Okay, so here's what I remember about the fic: it was set post-DH. Harry stumbles upon Draco, who disappeared after the war? He may or may not have thought that Draco had committed suicide. Anyway, turns out that Draco had been travelling with The Doctor (Doctor Who). Eventually Harry tags along, and the three of them go adventuring throughout time and space.

Harry and Draco absolutely despise each other from the beginning--more so on Draco's part. He loathes Harry. He also loathes himself and battles with a crippling amount of guilt.

I think the TARDIS might have been super fond of either Harry or Draco.

I'm pretty sure HP, DM, and the DR landed in the Hunger Games universe and possibly Game of Thrones. And some space-opera-esque sci-fi one. In one universe, Draco befriended this guy who he stays in contact with throughout his travels with the help of a high-tech cellphone? Something like that.

Hopefully someone remembers what this fic is and has a copy they'd be willing to share if the fic was taken down. Thanks in advance!

*ETA:* Found! The fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11039662/1/Song-of-the-Dark-Between][Song of the Dark Between]] by TessaCrowley.


** The men on this sub irrationally despise slash, especially Drarry, so that's why you're getting downvoted.

Try posting this question on [[/r/HPSlashFic]]. Not many people will see it, but you'll get a friendlier response. :)

*** I actually found the fic already, but thanks for the subreddit suggestion!

Honestly, the anti-slash stance so many people in fandom has is just super, super gross. They should be ashamed of themselves, really.

**** Yeah, some of the stuff people post on this sub makes my blood boil. They pretend to be tolerant... but it's like your average pseudo-tolerant homophobic saying, "Gays are fine lol, as long as they're not in my life/in MY fandom. Harry being gay is OOC and unnatural, but it's ~in character~ for him to be an overpowered genius/date Fleur/have a harem!!!"

But whatever. I downvote and move on with my life.
