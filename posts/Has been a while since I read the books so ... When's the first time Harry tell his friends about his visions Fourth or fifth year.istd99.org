I'm writing a fic about GoF, and I don't remember exactly when Harry tells Ron and Hermione. Before he's selected by the Goblet? After Voldemort's resurrection?


** He tells them immediately after going home to the Burrow after the World Cup

GoF, "Mayhem at the Ministry"

  ‘I'm sure he wasn't in Privet Drive,' said Harry. ‘But I was dreaming about him ... him and Peter -- you know, Wormtail. I can't remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill ... someone.'
