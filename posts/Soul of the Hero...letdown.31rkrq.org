** As I think even Joe would agree, it's a disappointing ending. But it's fair to put this in context: this was his rookie million-word saga, one begun over a decade ago, with many moments of greatness.

His later work (particularly his original fiction writing) is far more polished and tighter prose.

*** I think I read somewhere that he said looking back on it made him cringe but it definitely had its high points. All in all, it's pretty decent considering he was only 15-16 years old when he wrote it.

** I've yet to find a fanfic that didn't begin to feel like a letdown near the end. Personally, I think it's because, as fanfiction authors deviate further from the canon as the story progresses, they lose a lot of the framework of JKR's original, are increasingly left to their own devices and begin to get out of their depth.

*** It definitely seemed to get way out of control. The story just kind of spiraled and it seemed like, as the protagonist got lost in the darkness, so too did the author get lost in the immensity of what he was trying to convey.

I definitely have to applaud Joe though for trying it and for trying to make it make some kind of sense. I know for a fact that I wouldn't have been able to.

** I kind of feel like this is what is happening towards the end of wastelands of time. What started as a tight story seems to have spiraled out a bit and made the story lose focus. Maybe it's the fact that Joe was moving into his own original writing, or maybe it's just my own opinion formed over a long time frame

** It was alright, I suppose. I never read considered it an issue because the rest of the series is more epic that just about every other fic can hope to be. And he did this at what, 16? That's some serious talent.
