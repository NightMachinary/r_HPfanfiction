Hey so I am looking for this fic I read a while ago and thought had saved but I guess not. I can't remeber what's it's called but I remeber what it is about. I think I read in on Archiveofourown. It's a snape/original female character and lupin/original female character. What I remember about it is there is a new mediwitch (original female character) and lupin and snape are still teachers. The ofc starts off dating lupin but is friendly with snape too, and I remember eventually snape and ofc start to be together but there is also another new teacher (ofc) with a kid who is against werewolves and she ends up with lupin. There is also some stuff I think about the mediwitch character being this super rare animagus like a blue dragon or something like that. I know this is kinda vague but I have been dying to read this again if it can be found somewhere. Please help!!! I may be able to remember some more details if needed. THANKS!!!
