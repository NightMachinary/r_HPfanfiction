Instead of the usual request of a fic containing smut with good plot, are there any smut fics that feature an actually romantic relationship between 2(or more) characters. Or Quality romance fics that have it's fair share of smut(sex) in them.

the plot could be anything really as long as it's comprehensible, but i like the story to focus or put more emphasis on the relationship and romance. writing quality should be readable and the smut as well, if "readable" smut makes sense. Although over-the-top, gratuitous and/or steamy smut is welcome(Big Weasley Happy Family and Potter Family Chronicles are examples of such smut).

all pairings, of all sizes are welcome so long as harry is in said pairing(s). No slashes though. and please, no "teasing" smut/lime where the sex is only implied/skipped over and not actually written in.


** How we live on AO3 is great

*** its not really my thing, but its amazing to me how frequently smutfic authors seem to update, how we live as an example. Similarly, megamatt09 has written millions of words in comic/HP smutty crossovers.

Maybe its a bit like those early 90s randy skinemax/hbo shows were there's some boobies every ten minutes. Like the rhythm of scene - lemon - scene creates some narrative momentum that keeps things moving forward. Or an alternate hypothesis: adding the lemony bit turns a 20k one shot concept into a passable novella length fanfic, the length people seem to prefer. I dunno. The entire phenomenon is sort of out of my usual reading list.

for the OP: Gandalf's Beard on Ao3 and fanfiction seems to mix the smut and romance. H/Hr heavy.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/][For Love of Magic]] has decent smut and storytelling, as well as an ok-ishly designed overall plot. Relationships between romantic partners are mostly not overly out-of-character and out-of-nowhere. Characters themselves are mostly well-developed as well (aside from Luna, who after some time starts looking a bit 2-dimensional).

- Pairings: a Harry-Tonks-Fleur-Luna poly, with only Harry and Fleur so far also having side partners outside of the main group.

- Smut tags: anal, BDSM, brainwashing, edging, futanari, group sex, group mind, incest, loli, MILF, monstergirl, oral, sense sharing, shape-shifting, student-teacher roleplay.

- Fanfic tags: chaotic neutral Harry, ruthless Harry, Harry changing himself through rituals and tattoos, characters ok with killing enemies, researching and experimenting with magic, distrust of goblins.

- Fanfic cliches: OP Harry, Harry is Lord Potter \ Black, Harry is capable of wandless magic

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** The Third Path to the Future has Harry winding up in the Marvel Universe and getting with Storm, Jean Gray, and Emma Frost. Smut scenes are few but explicit and he romances the women before getting with them. VERY long chapters.
