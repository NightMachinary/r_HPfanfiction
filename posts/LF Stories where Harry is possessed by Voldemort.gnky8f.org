In Canon Harry was briefly possessed by him during what happened at the Ministry, but I'm looking for a Voldemort that posses Harry like that, but longer.

I'd like Harry to eventually break free (eventually).

It can be a small part in the story or a big part.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash Bisexual/Asexual Et cetra (Doesn't have to focus on pairings).

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings.

Would rather not have evil Harry, more that it affects him or what possessed Harry might do, and the after affects of it (if at all possible).

Would also rather not have evil Dumbledore and evil Weasley's (if at all possible).

It can be from Voldemort or the Horcrux itself (Though it can be hand in hand as well)

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all? (OotP AU. Go inside the mind of Severus Snape as he tackles several beguiling mysteries, and risks everything he holds dear.) COMPLETE.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the Last Task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry had been a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up. Also, the tanslation in French is available by Eohwel.
