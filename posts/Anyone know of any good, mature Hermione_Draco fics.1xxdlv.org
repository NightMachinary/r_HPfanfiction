Draco is my favorite character and i like it when these guys are put together, because of the emotional turmoil is often put Draco through. Any ideas, guys?


** I don't normally look for this pairing, but I recently enjoyed a long and emotionally sophisticated story called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends or Truth and Reconciliation]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1994264/Vera-Rozalsky][Vera Rozalsky]].

Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

Harry Potter - Rated: M - English - Drama/Romance - Chapters: 66 - Words: 329,854 - Reviews: 1021 - Updated: 1-6-13 - Published: 11-26-09 - Hermione G. & Neville L.

It is in Hermione's POV and involves more than a few ethically surprising choices, but if you'd like to see a proper post-war fallout kind of story involving Hermione and Draco (and Neville and Ginny and memories of Tonks), it's worth the read.

**** Sadly no. Maybe a few more fans will prompt Vera to post again- according to her profile, she was approaching the endgame chapters.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] which only seems to get updates every couple months, but it's almost finished.

** One of my favourite stories is [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=274][The Politician's Wife]]! This was the story that launched me into mature Dramione. The story and the characters are marvellously written - I've read it countless times!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8982722/1/Cruel-and-Beautiful-World][Cruel and Beautiful World]] by[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3692526/Lena-Phoria][Lena Phoria]] was quite good in my opinion, though rather dark.

"After years of captivity, Hermione Granger fights her way onto the streets of Voldemort's London with only the knife in her pocket and the blood on her hands. There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater who let her be captured in the first place."

She has others completed Dramiones but I haven't started on those yet.
