Right so i want to read some good severitus. I hate severus with a passion but i am interested in seeing some other aspects of him. No slash and mentor snape only please preferably complete. If snape and harry are instantly on good terms with each other after miraculously finding out that snape is actually his dad i will not read it.


** In Blood Only is one of the most popular ones out there linkffn(2027554). It's been a while since I've read it but I remember it being very good.

Digging for the Bones is an angstfest and can be quite sad but it does take a while for Harry and Snape to be on good terms with each other. linkffn(6782408)

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

** I don't know how no one has recommended The Sacrifices Arc. It to this day is my favorite fanfiction. I cried like a bitch at the end. It does take a while for the Severitus to fully kick in. But it's, again, my favorite fanfiction.

** Well, it's less of a good Severitus and more of a very good fic that incidentally happens to be Severitus, but I still feel that I'm required to mention linkffn(By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down And Wept).

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

  "Perhaps a man who wants to redeem himself in the memory of the mother would, in turn, give comfort to a child." Dumbledore grinned at the other man's unbidden expression of shock. "But when said like that, it hardly encompasses the depth of emotion when I see you have cradled Harry Potter to sleep after a nightmare." Severus scowled. "I was not cradling him."

  It is only days later -- four, to be exact -- that Severus feels a twinge of something in his gut. He's carefully bottling potions when it hits, the desire for mist against his skin, dark ryegrass beneath his feet. A small boy with green eyes standing at his toes. [Sequel to What it Is.]

** Sadly, the only Severitus I know are dad (biological or adopted) Snape, but, like you, I can't tolerate a story which just dismiss years of borderline hatred (if not downright). Nonetheless, I think the best rec I can make is this one:

linkffn(In Blood Only)\\
Best characterization and progression of a Severitus while keeping characters in characters. Summary is quite telling, and I think it's one of the best I can rec.

Honorable mention to linkao3(A Year Like None Other), although there was a bit of familiarity and bad blood brushed aside, but it is, nonetheless, very good too. If you feel amenable, I'd say to try it out too.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** probably the only Snape story I can think of ATM is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160980/1/Hindsight][Hindsight]] by Loralee. there are other HP fictions with this title, but are not this one.

another is this:[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/Reboot][Reboot by Kallanit]] which is another of the Reptilia28 challenge, but it makes Snape a reasonably decent person. I recommend it.
