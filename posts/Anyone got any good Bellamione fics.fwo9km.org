I'm looking for some good Hermione/Bellatrix fics, excluding /Time Heals All Wounds, Our Mercurial Selves, and Impossible/ cuz I've already read those.


** You might like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid]]).

Generally, I've tried a few fics like that in the past, but I found that Hermione in them usually gets this passive, flighty ingenue portrayal that's also common in Dramione fic---and that's when she's lucky. When she's not, she gets that, plus Stockholm Syndrome.

Are there any readable Ballamione fics in which Hermione ends up as the "top" in the relationship?

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

*** No, but I will. Thank you for the suggestion my kind sir or fair lady, but I think you spelled the title wrong. I think it's supposed to be All According to Keikaku(keikaku means plan)

***** I...you...did you not get my classic death note translator note where they didn't translate keikaku and instead just had a note that said keikaku means plan?
