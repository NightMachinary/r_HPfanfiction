An idea that's been stirring about for several years now. Figured I'd put it out there in case anyone else would be interested. Would seriously consider writing it with enough interest.

It's a three-way crossover between HP, Dresden Files, and TES.

Basically I find much of the magic in the Harry Potter universe to be relatively underwhelming. One of the things I liked about the last film was that it was far more visually impressed; Grindewald actually seemed like a super competent and powerful lord. In comparison the only time I truly got that vibe from Voldemort was his duel with Dumbledore, everything else just made him above average as a wizard.

For those who don't know magic in the Dresden Files gets pretty damn impressive. The title character even manages to throw out a massive fire spell in only the second book in the series and only progress as it goes on. One of the stronger characters, his mentor, even summons a damn satellite out of orbit. And in another impressive moment his apprentice, who has just now come in to a power up of her own, freezes a large swath of the sea so that she can walk to the shore.

The Elder Scrolls (aka Oblivion, Skyrim, etc.) works in much the same way. Even the games themselves don't showcase just how impressive some magic is. Elven Wizards are capable of incredible magic that would blow away anything else in the HP universe. Casually throwing out thunderbolts or summoning ice storms as you take on a horde of enemies.

In truth the TES and Dresdenverse have a lot of similar themes. Mantles that can empower mortals, dragons with seemingly divine ability, alternate planes of existence that run parallel to our own. Having specifications in entire schools of magic and rituals with wild results are fantasy staples that Harry Potter seemingly ignores.

So basically the proposed idea is boosting the Potterverse up to these levels.

Where did Lily find that blood protection spell? How about Voldemort's resurrection ritual? And the incredible knowledge he and Dumbledore seem to have that put them so far above the normal wizards and witches? Questions Rowling didn't answer.

The key to to this story is the use the rules of the Dresden Verse as a base and to fit the Potterverse in to it. We know from Jim Butcher (Author of the series) that the strongest wizards often have tricks up their sleeves for real fights. The main character even has a choice of three power ups that each come with a major cost and eventually chooses the seemingly least 'evil' of the bunch; which still amounts to him effectively selling his allegiance over to a cruel goddess like figure.

I had the same idea considering the figures in HP; Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindewald didn't get as far as they did following the normal paths to power. No, each made deals/sought knowledge that most would shy away from. And in this story Harry is forced to do the same to survive. Which leads him in to threats even greater than Voldemort.

In order for this to work drastic changes need to be made to the Potter-verse.

We know the Ministry is a relatively new and Hogwarts very old. Having Merlin, a mythic figure in both series, as a connecting point is key. We know he started the Order of Merlin to watch over abuse of magic on muggles. We also know the White Council was once called something else. Having the Order morph in to the Council over the years would give it the pull and leverage it would need over the prospective ministries of the world. After all, who would argue with the peacekeeping organization started by Merlin himself?

The White Council also laments how the human population increase makes it more difficult to police magic users. Having the ministry and statue of secrecy is actually a good thing. The Ministry also agrees, for the most part, with the seven laws, finding only real fault with the law of mind magic and even then there are limits:

Occlumency and Legilimency are illegal to teach which follows the laws of magic. And memory charms are only to be preformed by licensed professionals who are closely monitored and trained to prevent and treat damage.

The Department of Mystery is known as such because of the research that goes on there studying things that break the laws in a controlled and seemingly safe environment. Only they get to study time magic and a prospective gate (the Veil) with not even other members of the government knowing the details. Also strictly regulated and vowed to secrecy on pain of death.

The ICW is apart of the accords and leave most of the dealings to the council in exchange for policing the human magic users.

The Warden's lack of involvement in the first war against Voldemort can also be explained away by a mixture of arrogance and more pressing matters. Upon realizing that the Ministry and inexperienced Wardens weren't enough to handle the situation they prepared to really step in - Only for Voldemort to suddenly bite it. This also makes Fudge's reluctance to admit Voldemort's return to make more sense; he doesn't want the ICW and the White Council to come over and directly take charge or investigate him.

It all can work out with enough explaining.

TLDR: Harry finds his mother's secret, a Black Book, and uses it in desperation only to get pulled beyond the gates and in to Hermeaus Mora's realm of Apocrypha and is forced to serve the Daedric deity in an effort to find a way home. Upon his return he finds himself at odds with the Ministry, the White Council, and the Archive. Oh, and Voldemort is still around.

** There's already a fic about Harry serving old Herma-Mora, just fyi: linkffn(12119321)

Maybe it will give you some further inspiration.

*** I've read it and found it too much of a crack-fic. There was no real penalty or consequence for it. In the TES we know people sometimes go mad with what they've learned from the Black Books but that mostly seems forgotten.

  Lily Potter never actually saved her son's life. No, Hermaeus Mora did it for her, at a price. The witch ended up in Apocrypha and Harry became a new dimensional anchor for the Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge now standing on his shoulder. Poor, poor Wizardry World.
