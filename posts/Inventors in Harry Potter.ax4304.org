So I was thinking, that maybe there are inventors too in the world of magic. Like people who actually invent new spells to make something easier. Or maybe they develop upon the older spells. Like if you say it in a different way you get better results - like the tech part of magic. Because it's just difficult to believe that all spells have been predetermined and there's no more scope for newer magic. Also if you do find some new spell does it count as inventing nah discovering?

****** how was the map self-modifying? but i disagree: the op is about inventing new spells or modifying existing ones, and we don't have any proof that the marauders did that, or that they even can, or needed a new 'method'

#+begin_quote
  Or even their 100% effective method for achieving an animagus form
#+end_quote

i mean, for all we know they just researched the known method and did it independently

from pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  The magic used in the map's creation is advanced and impressive; it includes the Homonculous Charm, enabling the possessor of the map to track the movements of every person in the castle, and it was also enchanted to forever repel (as insultingly as possible) the curiosity of their nemesis, Severus Snape.

the magic was advanced and impressive, but not new

******* Inventing is not limited to spell /creation/. Novel devices applying existent spells in previously un-imagined ways qualify just as much as new methods for casting known spells or alternative potion recipes.

** There are inventors/innovators in wizarding world, for instance, self-stirring cauldron by Gaspard Shingleton. Infact, all the potions, standardised spells and latin incantations, wands, it used to be like industrial revolution for wizards during 11-15th centuries.

It's just that the frequency of innovations/inventions slowly reduced after statue of secrecy and now, they are far less than that of muggle world.

P.S: Severus Snape might be an epic proportion of failure as a teacher, but he sure is a genius at potions and spells. Consider the /muffliato/ charm for instance.

#+begin_quote
  Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard.
#+end_quote

White noise!

It obviously filled the sound emanated from two people conversing with white noise after a certain range.

Human speech is a structured/organised sum of sounds of different frequencies at different intensities. Hence, rather than completely blocking the sound, it is lot easier to fill the gaps with white noise.

Just like how white colour is the sum of all colours of visible spectrum, white noise consists of sum of all sounds of visible hearing range at equal intensities. Severus Snape must have got inspiration for this spell from a muggle telle.

*** I always figured he invented the dark spells (like /Sectumsempra/) but the safer charms came from Lily. After all, James used /Levicorpus/ in the fifth year, so it was "invented" prior to Lily cutting Snape out of her life. I also bet Snape found the potions tricks in a book by Fleamont Potter, whom he researched for ways to get back at James. Otherwise Snape would've taught the tricks to the students, so he wouldn't have to deal with so many idiots.

**** My headcanon is Snape first invented muggle inspired spells like /muffliato/ to probably impress Lily, before their fallout. Before their fallout, even though he was friends with Malfoys, Averys and Notts, he was still close with Lily, that probably prevented him to permanently join their organization and take the mark. But once their fallout happened, he must have lost his final vestiges and permanently joined Voldemort and took the mark. It's probably during that period he went deeper and deeper in dark arts and invented spells like /sectumsempra/.

** Spells can be invented. Pandora Lovegood was a professional spellcrafter. Fred and George invented patented daydream charms and probably many other spells for their pranks and products. Snape invented multiple spells that Harry finds in HBP. There are many references to "inventors" of certain spells.
