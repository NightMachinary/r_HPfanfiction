Hello all,

I'd love to read some time-travel fic where the travelers reveal to people who they are and why they came back in time, either intentionally or not. +points if it's in the Marauders time, but not obligatory. Please and thank you :)

  Harry was sick of it all. So when he catches Draco in Snape's private stores, he decides that he isn't going to stand back and let Draco lie about it. During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione time travel to 1981. She comes clean with Dumbledore at first opportunity. The results are excellent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry time travel to 1975. He tells Bellatrix right in the beginning, and others near the end. The final reveal scene is pretty hilarious though:

#+begin_quote
  Harry shrugged and, after swallowing a bit of chicken, spoke up. "It sounds like you've already figured out the gist of it. My name is Harry James Potter."

  "Congratulations," Bellatrix said, "you now know his deepest and darkest secret."

  Lily was not satisfied with this. "Surely there is more to it. What were we like in the alternate future?"

  "I was an only child. You and father both died while I was still a baby. The Dursleys half-heartedly raised me. I escaped to Hogwarts, and ever since my first year, have been dodging Voldemort and foiling his plans until three days ago. At some point in all that, Sirius became my beloved godfather until he died and made me a Black in his will. As far as I'm concerned, I met you, my parents, for the first time when I taught you Potions at Hogwarts," Harry said.

  Bellatrix rolled her eyes. "I think you can spare them more than that, Harry. And for the benefit of the younger part of our audience, I would like you to tell the story of your mother competing with her daughter-in-law for your affections back in the day.”

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13377375/][The All Seeing Eye Glass]] Harry tells everyone the truth about his situation and his past, but he tends to act weird and mix the truth with other tall tales, so everyone always assumes he is lying and/or crazy.

If you don't mind the eventual pairing, it's a great fic. It's the only 'time-travel to Tom Riddle's Hogwarts years' fic I know of that treats the situation as a comedy. It's great.

  When Harry lands himself in 1942 he officially stops caring. Surrounded by witches and wizards that are blissfully ignorant that there's a time-traveler in their midst, Harry resolves to make his own changes, which results in some interesting and unexpected consequences.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.
