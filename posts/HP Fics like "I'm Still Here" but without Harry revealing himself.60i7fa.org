I am looking for time travel or parallel dimension travel stories where Harry Potter gets to redo or change things. However I am looking for ones where Harry is very powerful, and retains prior knowledge and experience, but works from the shadows or does not reveal himself to ANYONE for what he truly is (except maybe a love interest down the line).

An example of what I am looking for would be Fics similar to "I'm Still Here" linkffn(9704180), EXCEPT without Harry ending up being discovered for who he is, or obtaining help. For those who have read the story heres more detail on what I am looking for:

Imagine that in Im Still Here, Harry does not end up being helped by the Flamels, and to the world he is some mysterious force like Voldemort, but Grey instead of Dark. Unafraid of killing death eaters or corrupt individuals, and working from the shadows. Perhaps occasionally having to dual aurors and light side individuals, but never killing. Simply being an OP BAMF, who works to change the future from the shadows.

Anything similar would be fine, even if its NOT time travel or dimensional travel related. I simply want a Harry working from the shadows and being a mystery to the world as to who this figure is. Willing to do what is needed to be done, and maybe even fighting the light (but simply defensively) to do what he feels needs to be done. Would prefer if there was some romance involved at some point but its certainly not necessary (and no male slash please).

this might be something you'd like but it does get very rushed in wrapping up, but still good.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

*** The first isn't quite what I was looking for, and I am surprised the 2nd is so short given its premise... but i've not read either so ill give them a whirl.

I have however read "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" and I enjoyed it (at least whats in play so far).

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

Focused on romance a lot but it's kinda what you're asking for. In a way.

Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches also might be something you'd like.

It starts off a bit strange which may not be your cup of tea. However, it moves on with the plot fast, but sadly it's abandoned (pretty short at 26k words).

Oh and check out by the divining light and Conlaodh's song by the same author. It's not what you're looking for in this case but amazing stories in my opinion.
