:FlairText: Question about fan fic
:END:
Ok so I have a problem, I havent read atyd yet and I want to print a hard copy, but i still live with my mum so she will know if i order something. And if i tell her not to read something, she will automatically read it so I need to know if the fan fic contains smut.

** A little. But very fade to black esque. And it's in later chapters. I can't imagine your mom will slog through that much fanfic. Its beastly long.

*** Thank you for this, my mum gets through loads of books in a day, she once read the cursed child in an afternoon so i may just have to be sneaky, i dont think she means harm by it she just doesn't really understand boundaries

**** How old are you, out of curiosity. My mom went mental over me reading age inappropriate books/fanfics most my childhood, but she stopped when I was 15.

***** Oh, there is some serious alcoholism in the story if that bothers her.

****** That won't bother her really, im 14 at the moment and she is a pretty chill parent, and i think she just likes being included in all the things I like, its more my problem than hers really, I think if she read it she would not get angry it just saves me a kinda awkward conversation about it
