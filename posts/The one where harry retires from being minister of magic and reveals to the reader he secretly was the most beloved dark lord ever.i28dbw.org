:END:
Hi, im new here and would like some help finding a fic i read a good while ago, that i cant find anymore for the live of me.

In this fic harry is quite old, and is retiring from being minister of magic after an unusually long time in the job. While at his retirement event, someone (I think a child or grandchild) is recounting the many great things harry did in his life. As that goes on harry himself starts to reminicine and next follows his whole life story, not only the good things the public saw, but also bad things he did to get where he is. Near the end of the story harry reveales to the reader that he was secretly a dark lord all along, and the most beloved in history and that magical brittain had no idea he ever was their dark lord. The speech from the (relative?) ends and a great applause starts and i think it ended there.

If i recall correctly it was a one shot, but a very long one shot. If anyone has a clue as to what the title of this story is, I'd love to hear.

Thanks in advance and have a good day

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years
