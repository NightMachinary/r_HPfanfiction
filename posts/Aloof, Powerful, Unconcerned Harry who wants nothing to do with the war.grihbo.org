** Not really what you are asking but in linkffn(prodigal delinquent) he is that kind of OP and more or less ignores Voldemort and the whole PS plot, it only updates every few years though.

And in linkao3(This is not the chosen one you are looking for) it's a crossover with good omens in which he is the Antichrist, so Voldemort is petty much insignificant in the plot, bonus in which it is already complete.

And in linkffn(Storybook Hero by dogbertcarroll) it seems to be heading in that direction, but it is still in the beginning and only updates occasionally.

None of them have Daphne Greengrass as a particularly important (or even present) character though, closer one I can think to this would be linkffn(The mind arts), but in this Voldemort is shown as an actually significant threat.

  When the infant Antichrist is brought to Earth, he is secretly exchanged for another child with no one the wiser. His new parents? James and Lily Potter. The situation doesn't go exactly as Heaven and Hell planned, however...

  AU. Little Harry Potter knew from the moment he defied the laws of gravity and made a pebble accelerate at a freefall of 8.9 m/s 2, that he was going to have fun learning about the rules of all the known universe... and breaking every single one of them. WARNING: Sporadic Updates.

  Harry is sure he's living in a fairy tale with himself as the hero. Really, what else makes sense?

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
