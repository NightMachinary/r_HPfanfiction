It doesn't have to be in any particular genre or have a particular pairings - though I do have a few things that I tend to enjoy and some things that don't really do it for me.

-I am partial to Slytherin, and Draco in particular as being an ultimately good character despite his family's alignment.

-I love the idea that Snape, behind his mask of indifference, is extremely caring.

-Harry/Draco is one of my prefered pairings, but it is my no means necessary. I could probably see Draco paired with almost anyone and be happy with it.

-I am not against Harry/Ginny, but I tend to prefer her in a more sister/confidant relationship with Harry.(and in the case of a Drarry, her being totally supportive of it)

-I enjoy Ron bashing a bit, but I'm equally okay with him staying true, same goes for the rest of the Weasleys.(Ginny being an exception, it would take some coercion for me to be okay with her being against Harry)

-AU is totally fine with me.

-I am totally fine with a fic starting anywhere on the time-line, but I don't want to read excessive canon rehashing.

-I have not really mentioned Hermione because I have no preferences for how her character is handled.

-I don't have much interest in intense violence, but if the fic is good enough - I can always just skim over it.

-Any length is acceptable, but completed fics is prefered.

So with that all being said, recommend away!


** So, I guess you've read the Sacrifices arc?

*** I have not, though so far it's robbed me of a nights sleep. The first year was delightful. It seems to be exactly what I had been looking for. Thank you for the recommendation. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.

*** Question for you good sir, as I've been curious about this fic.is the slash really in your face, or is it a good story where the main character is gay? I just can't stand stories where everything comes down to them being gay.

**** What NeonicBeast said. It doesn't come down to them being gay, but their relationship is an important part - which makes sense, since one's choice of partner is (supposedly) an important life step. I will say that at times it seems like the author is extremely repetitive about the state of the relationship, but it does make sense, and I would argue is necessary, given the context of the story, particularly in terms of Harry's perception of others.

**** I read through the first three books in the Sacrifiecs series before I was distracted by other fics, but the slash doesn't start until book four, and it builds as a friendship for most of the time before that. Hope this help!

** I don't get to rec this often--[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308522][Satellite Heart]] is a postwar Harry/Draco, where Harry starts dreaming an AU where Voldemort never existed and he and Draco are in a relationship. It melds together the two worlds really well, and Harry handles it as someone who suddenly starts lucid dreaming a gay relationship would.

*** Thank you for the recommendation. It was a beautiful moment of a story, that left me with a soft ache, like trying to grasp onto a wisp of smoke.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.
