I just finished reading House Proud by astolat and was wondering if there are more fics with (partially) sentient houses that can protect themselves, get offended or something similar.


** Its an unfinished fic, but it has a small bit in chapter 6 about sentient buildings.

** I don't know if the houses are technically sentient or not, but I remember a fic where older Wizarding Families (the OG ones that made the first magic government) bound Genus Loci to their homes for protection and the wards became semi-sentient. Can't recall the title, but I'll poke around for it and see what I can find.

** A sentient house provides the background for linkao3(12985506), which is a fun, romance pairing of a rare-ship.
