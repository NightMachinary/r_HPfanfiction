"Harry! Hurry up, you'll be late!"

"Yeah, I'm on my way."

Harry stepped outside his temporary lodgings in Gryffindor tower with Hermione, and they made their way down to meet with Ron in the Great Hall.

Harry made his way up to the podium to prepare to give his speech. After he stepped up, a wave of hushed reverence spread through the crowd. It was the day after Voldemort had been defeated once and for all, and Harry was required to give a speech.

"Hello, everyone. This has been a long war for all of us, and most of us have lost family or friends one way or another. I'd like to give thanks, and apologize to many friends and family who gave their lives fighting the forces of darkness and stood for the light."

Harry continued the speech, saying everything he needed to say about his apologies that people died, to his thanks for everyone who fought.

"Finishing this speech up, I'd like for us all to realize one thing. Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, it doesn't matter. Right now, all we need to do is unite, and focus on rebuilding."

"Now I have a bit of extra time, so I suppose I can answer a question or two."

A random person from the crowd shouted "What were you doing during the year Voldemort took the ministry?"

Harry wondered how to put this delicately.

"Me, Ron, and Hermione all hunted down... Items of great importance, that until found, Voldemort could not be killed. Any more detail is private."

Another person shouted out "Is it true you can do a fully corporeal patronus?"

Harry sighed. He'd been getting this question since he was 13.

"Yeah. Would you like a demonstration?"

There were various cries of agreement in the crowd, so Harry dredged up his happiest thoughts, and pointed his Holly wand to the sky.

/Expecto Patronum!/

Harry could only watch in awe, as he saw a beautiful snowy owl fly out of his wand, and land on his shoulder nudging his cheek in affection.

"Hedwig..."

*My first fanfic, had this idea. Thoughts? :)*


** Okay thanks for the crying....

*** Probably because Prongs is sad enough as it is. I mean, it's his dead father, of whom he has no memories. And the fact that Prongs is much more imposing.

** I wish I'd read the post before the comments as I'm sure the reveal would have been more moving. Really interesting one-shot though.
