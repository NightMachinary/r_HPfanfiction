Lf any fics where wizards gather to show off their talents. Anything like a state fair, X games or Olympics.

I imagine events like: Week long enchanting competition Extreme curse breaking Broom racing Angry griffin riding Some kind of event mixing skiing and magic Extreme brewing of difficult potions Etc.

The world building potential here is endless.


** I've seen dueling as a professional sport in a few fics.

** It's not exactly the Olympics, but in my AU story "Patron", the Tri-Wizard Tournament features competitions for the rest of the students - Curse-Breaking, Duelling and Quidditch - and four elemental-themed challenges for the champions, including a broom race.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
