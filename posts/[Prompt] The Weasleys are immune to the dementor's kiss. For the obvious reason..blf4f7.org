****** Ginny was biting her lip. "Harry..." she said, "I have a bit of an odd request."

"Any thing for you, Gin," said Harry, as he wiped his member.

She looked him in the eye. "This time... can you pretend to be Voldemort?"

Harry dropped his dick in shock. "Voldemort? Gin, what..."

"I'm sorry Harry," she gushed. "I love you, I really do. It's just that ever since the Chamber I've had these /thoughts/ and /urges/..."

She shuddered.

Harry wasn't completely opposed to the idea, but he tentatively asked, "and who would you be? Bellatrix? Yourself?"

He loved Ginny, and didn't want her to have issues stemming from the whole nasty possession business that was basically a metaphor for child grooming.

Ginny blinked. "I'd also be Voldemort, but a girl."

"You'd... also... be Voldemort."

Ginny perked up. "Yep! He /was/ a narcissist."

Harry had no objection to this because you don't get called the Boy-Who-Lived for seven years without it going to your head a little so then they had fun.

** One wizard, a great many years ago. Heard a young muggle comment about the fact his friend had no soul, as such this wizard grew curious. Kidnapping the young red haired friend and Obliviating his friend, he conducted many tests.

He discovered; indeed the young redhead did not have a soul. As such he endeavoured to grant them a soul.

The result?

The first dementors were born.

Thank you Redheads of the world. You are living, yet to be cloaked, Dementors.

  But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around Harry's neck. They were forcing his face upward... He could feel its breath... It was going to get rid of him first... His mother was screaming in his ears... She was going to be the last thing he ever heard---
#+end_quote

and then through the fog he thought he saw movement. A form smashed into the dementor pushing it aside. Then Ron stood over him facing the dementors. He gave Harry a quick grin.

"Run," Hermione croaked trying to push herself back to her feet.

Ron wasn't listening. He was staring down the dementors.

"Be gone" he demanded in a loud clear voice that seemed to carry to clearly despite the fog. Strangely for a moment it seemed it would work. The mob backed up a pace until a circle opened around the four and even the fog seemed to clear a touch, but then as if with a single will the dementors rushed him.

Harry hadn't even realized the dementors weren't affecting him anymore, until it all came rushing back. He felt the cloth sliding along his arm. Some part of his mind noted that it was slimy, but most of him was screaming. This was it. They were are going to die and it was going to be his fault. He'd killed them all. It wasn't enough that he'd killed his parent. It wasn't enough that his Godfather was going die because he couldn't do a simple spell. Dimly he heard a scream as he slumped towards the ground.

"I said be gone!" the shout rang out loud enough to echo against the castle and in an instant the crushing sadness lifted. Haltingly he pulled himself to his feet.

A dementor was kissing Ron. Its rotting face pressed up against his nose. Harry tried to rush to his friend, but found that his legs wouldn't obey. Strangely though, the dementor seemed to shrink in on itself. it was only was only then that Harry realize that the dementor hadn't just been kissing Ron. Ron was kissing back. An instant later it was gone. Swallowed up. Ron stood up straighter. He shook himself. With a small spin he started to glow. Within seconds the glow was blinding. Harry had to avert his eyes. The dementors seemed to panic. They turned to flee, moving with a speed that Harry had never seen before. A mob of patronuses rushed after them. An unlucky dementor weren't quite fast enough. A badger caught and tore it apart as Harry watched.

"Um, I wasn't supposed to do that," Ron said. Harry and Hermione just stared at him.

Hermione was the first to clamber back to her feet. "What was that?" she asked. Her voice still shook, but it might well have been from shock more than anything else. Harry felt fine. Better really than he had in a long time.

"Yeah, well you see... OK, have you guys heard what they say about Gingers?" Ron asked.

"That they don't have souls," Hermione offered.

"So, yeah. Us Weasilies, we really don't."

"That can't, be right Ron," Hermione said, "Everyone has a soul"

"Hermione, how come I'm still breathing then?" Ron asked, "Look, Fred wouldn't--"

"'Fred', you believed Fred?" Harry asked.

"Well Dad told all us kids most of it. He says soul magic won't affect us and the whole dementor thing," he shrugged uncomfortably, "I mean, I'm pretty sure most gingers have souls."
