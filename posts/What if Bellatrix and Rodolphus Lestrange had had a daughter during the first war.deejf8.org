  What if Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange had had a daughter during the first war, who had to grow up without her parents, living among the winners of the war as a child of the losing side? This is the story of Cassandra Lestrange, a girl with the fierceness of her mother and the determination of her father, lovely and lonely, who belonged only to herself.
