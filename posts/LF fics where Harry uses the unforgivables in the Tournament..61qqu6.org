**** I always assumed that Dragons were powerful enough to even be killed by Avada Kedavra, like I can't see someone being able to imperious a dragon. They were scary because they were so effective on humans, not because they would impact especially defensive magical creatures.

****** dragons are basically cattle. They are eaten, made into clothes and potion ingredients, used for wand cores and dragon-blood has over a dozen uses and they are used as guard dogs by goblins. Its also extremely hard to kill or harm a dragon, I imagine that if you killed the dragon during the task you would gain a lot of respect and the ministry would proceed by selling the various parts of the dragons carcass.

******* If they were truly treated like cattle, why would they be on what is referred to as a dragon reserve? They are definitely controlled, but I think cattle is a bit far considering harming the eggs was even an issue. Death of the child bearing mother ( which would impact population either in ranching terms or preservation terms ) would be worse I'd imagine.
