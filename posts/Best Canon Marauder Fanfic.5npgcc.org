** I haven't read it in a long time, but I have a soft spot for Casting Moonshadows - linkffn(3378356)

It's slash & incomplete, but it fleshes out the home-life/background of Remus and Sirius beautifully. Remus' the main character so there's a big focus on lycanthropy. Endearing pranks and a solid characterisation of both James and Peter too. Canon compliant if you don't mind S/R.

*** I'll second this. It goes through 6th year and it's REALLY long and really well done. The pranks are amazing and the writing is great. Definitely worth a shot.

  Lonely and outcast by his classmates, Remus wishes on a moonshadow for a friend who understands him. To his amazement his wish is answered not once, but three times, by his former enemies, the Marauders. SBRL and some JPLE as well, of course.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3503913/1/You-Want-To-Make-A-Memory][You Want To Make A Memory?]] - Starts at the beginning of their first year and goes through their years at Hogwarts and beyond. The only romantic pairing is James/Lily. Remus gets the most focus, but everyone is characterized pretty well; Peter isn't left out as part of the group, and they all have a believable friendship. It's also complete!

[[http://shoebox.lomara.org/][The Shoebox Project]] - You've probably heard of this one, and it doesn't go through all their years at Hogwarts - it's not completely finished - but what exists is enough to keep you busy for a while, and the characterizations are pretty solid. It's pretty canon compliant, and the romantic pairings are James/Lily and Sirius/Remus.

** Against the Moon - linkffn(7305052)

I like this one, but the updates are quite slow. Though I prefer a background where werewolves are stronger than the average human though, and this one paints the werewolf curse as weaker... it's stlil a delightful read. The author writes Sirius and James really well, and it's one of the rare fics that doesn't leave out Peter as part of the Marauders.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to realize there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.
