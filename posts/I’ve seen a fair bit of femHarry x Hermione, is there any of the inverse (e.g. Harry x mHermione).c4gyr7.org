I feel like it'd be an interesting take on the ship, and I've never encountered a single fic like it.


** M! Hermione is pretty rare. I think I recall a few H/Hrs with avmale Hermione, but they were all with the entire trio swapped (so mas!Hermione x fem!Harry).

Easily they were not that good.

I do frequent ffn more than ao3, this might be more up ao3's alley
