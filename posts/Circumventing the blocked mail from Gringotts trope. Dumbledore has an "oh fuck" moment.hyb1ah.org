Turns out Harry never recieved mail from Gringotts, because nothing was stolen Harry chooses to confront Dumbledore.

Dumbledore promptly has a "oh fuck" reaction. Turns out he forgot to unblock Gringotts once Harry was reintroduced to the wizarding world..


** It would be fun to read a story where Dumbledore spends the whole time pretending he knows everything and is in total control of what is going on, but in reality it is all poker face and bluffing and he is really just flying along by the seat of his pants, barely coping with each new crisis as it springs out at him.

*** That's how I'm trying to write him in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting). Dumbledore actually meant to give Harry the invisibility cloak at the start of the year but got distracted. He genuinely had no idea that Quirrell was working with Voldemort. He's just an old man who's forced to fight evil when he'd rather be playing jokes on his students

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** "YOU! Old goat, why are you hiding my Gringotts mail from me?"

Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, Supreme Mugwump of the Wizengamot, and several other important titles, looked up from his desk at the first-year student that just walked into the office.

In his memory, he vaguely remembered a release-form from Gringotts disappearing into a stack of paperwork - most young students, especially Muggle-raised ones, happily let the Hogwarts staff tend to their finances while they were students.

A long-suffering sigh escaped the Headmaster's lips at the insult - despite Dumbledore's efforts, Dumbledore had accidentally done him many wrongs, though he'd always try to rectify them immediately. Harry, nevertheless, had taken to calling him "old goat" whenever a lapse of judgment made itself clear.

"Ah, Harry. I was wondering what I'd done to earn that scowl at dinnertime - at my age, one does forget things. Hang on a moment..."

A ten-minute rummage followed, after which a quick signature was placed on a form. Said form was then given to Harry to double-check - indeed, it was a release form for Harry to receive his monthly investment statements.\\
The form even included a request to magically disguise the post and place a Muggle-repelling charm on the envelope, so the Dursleys wouldn't steal it - the Headmaster had learned his lesson from the hundreds of acceptance letters that had to be written for one Harry James Potter.

"I must say, I rarely get students your age interested in their finances. Hogwarts' staff tends to invest for Muggle-raised students, to ensure they have a nest egg to make it through school. We'd done the same for your account, merely to ensure you wouldn't be surprised with an empty vault due to taxation and inflation - I hope we did an adequate job of it?"

Harry, remembering the amount he'd seen in his vault - seemingly never-ending piles of gold coins - deflated in his anger. He'd been quick in his judgement - in this case, it seemed, the Headmaster really was looking out for him.

"On another note, did you ever receive the Muggle-Raised Introductory Package? I recall Hermione Granger being quite cross at having to sift through a thick historical tome to find out about Wizarding Customs, and then having young Justin Finch-Fletchley tell her she should have received a leaflet..."

Meh, I tried. I feel like this one rambles on a bit and Dumbledore is quite out-of-character, but I did my best.

** Turns out the Mail block was implemented by Harry's parents as part of their hiding, but because they're dead, it hasn't/can't be removed until he is of age and Dumbledore has nothing to do with it at all.

** I don't have the time to write it in prose at the moment, but here's how I see it going. Feel free to steal.

1. Indy!Harry confronts Dumbledore about blocking his mail. Dumbledore apologises and suggests sending an owl to Gringotts to unblock it.
2. Harry demands to use the floo to speak with them right then. Dumbledore agrees.
3. Harry does some "goblin greeting" (E.g., "May your cash flow like the blood of your foes, and may your galleons be stacked as high as their spleens.") which weirds out the goblin. Harry then demands all the mail that's been blocked. The Goblin agrees.
4. Before Harry leaves, Dumbledore gives him a cryptic warning to stay away from windows.
5. Harry, being his indy self, deliberately sits on the window sill of his Gryffindor tower dorm room.
6. Harry finds himself physically buried in owls carrying the years of accumulated mail.
