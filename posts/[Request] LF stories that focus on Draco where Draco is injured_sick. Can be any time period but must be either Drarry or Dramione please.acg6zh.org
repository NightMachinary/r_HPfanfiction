  Hermione Granger is a mess and everyone knows it. She hasn't been sober in more than a year, she's cut ties with her best friends and she spends her nights partying with everyone's favourite ex-Slytherins. Draco Malfoy has been abroad since graduating Hogwarts, studying muggle and magical healing. Upon his return, their paths intertwine and Draco can't seem to stay away.

** [[https://test.archiveofourown.org/works/412150/chapters/684113?view_adult=true][Ingenious Devices]] is Drarry. Draco is mentally ill and searching for the right kind of green. There's plenty of hurt/comfort in this fic, but also friendship, as Draco is the link that brings Gryffindors and Slytherins together - a plotline I enjoy to read.
