[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/11/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Here]] is the link.

It's a truly excellent Slytherin!Hermione fic that hasn't updated in a while (until today!). Here's the full title and description:

Applied Cultural Anthropology... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

For example, the last chapter was a concatenation of shorter snippets that has been appearing on SB over the last month.

*** Huh. That's pretty awesome. Still, I'd rather have my one huge surprise every once in a long time (as long as I try not to grow frustrated with the long waits).
