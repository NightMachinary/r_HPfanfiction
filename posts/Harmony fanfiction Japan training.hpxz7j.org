Does anyone know the name of the harmony fanfiction that has Harry and Hermione going to Japan to train at a special academy where time is slowed ?


** The main one that I remember reading is from Radaslab and is 30 Minutes that Changed Everything and it's sequel where they go to the Watanabe School in the summers which equates to multiple years of training.
