** While not particularly focused on in the books. Both Mcgonagall and Snape valued punctuality in their students. I would imagine from a world where transportation is instantaneous that punctuality would be a bigger deal. When it takes only a second to separate or throw a pinch of floor powder into the fireplace, being late can only mean that you weren't ready in time to go. There is no traffic to blame tardiness on, so lateness can easily be interpeted as showing the other person that you don't value or respect their time.

While obviously not all situations can involve easy apparation or flooing, I would expect punctuality to be valued within all of wizarding society

** A wizard is never late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. ðŸ§™

** Yes, they do, unless all the examples in canon were odd cases.

Instantaneous transportation isn't going to make sitting there and waiting for someone any less annoying or insulting. It could easily make it worse - there's one less excuse for people to be late.

Also, remember that some people apparently do not apparate because of the risk. It's probably a minority, but when it was mentioned it wasn't presented as something super bizarre.

** Case by case, all the Hogwarts teachers seem to care about it to some degree. The wizengamot got angry at harry for being late even though it was their fault (lul YoU sHoUlD hAvE bEeN oN tImE, wE sEnT yOu An OwL aT tHe LaSt PoSsIbLe SeCoNd! HuRp DeRp DeR HeRr) so yeah I think they do.

** If instantaneous transportation is an option surely being late is totally unacceptable. You can't use traffic or late public transportation as an excuse when you can appear beside the person in the blink of an eye.
