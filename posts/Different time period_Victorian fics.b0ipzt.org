I am looking for magical aus with canon characters of any gen and not too much OOC ness, but seen through the lens of a wizarding world in a different era that isn't the founders era. I prefer this era to be Victorian, but mainly I just want it to be before the time of whichever specific character is protagonist was canonically in hogwarts, and after the founders time.
