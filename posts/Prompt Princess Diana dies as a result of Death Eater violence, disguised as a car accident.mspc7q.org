** ...You know, it's kinda amusing that my first reaction on reading this was "Princess Diana of Themiscyra?" and I say this as a Brit who likes the Monarchy.

** I have never finished “Royal Ward” by Catstaff linkffn(10556030), but it is the only one where I know about Lady Diana playing an active role.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.
