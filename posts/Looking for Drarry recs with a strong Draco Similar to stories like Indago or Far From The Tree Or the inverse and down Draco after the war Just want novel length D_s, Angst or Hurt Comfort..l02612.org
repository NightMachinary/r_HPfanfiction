** Try the Mirror of Ecidyrue series by starbrigid on ao3, it's one of my very favourites and I think it fits all of your descriptions. The series starts in Hogwarts year one, which I usually tend to dread with very fibre of my being. But trust me, having canon knowledge in this case actually helps you to be more engaged with the story rather than less, and the major canon events are approached from very interesting angles. Not to mention all the mystery elements... I highly recommend it.

** check out my tumblr where I do specific drarry recs(just drop an Ask, I will answer anything as quick as I can since I have the time), the only thing I ask is that you be specific enough, anything that's not specific will be ignored since, even if I have no school or work I still can't go around through my bookmarks(my ao3 account only has about 0.5% of my read fics) finding everything that fits the most vague of...I digress.

linkao3(Men Who Love Dragons Too Much)

this is the first which came to mind, it's really fucking good. Try it, yea? If you already have, you could ask for me for more.

To be more specific, BAMF Draco?

#+begin_quote
  [Extensive re-telling of Deathly Hallows] â€˜Kill Albus Dumbledore' is less a challenging task and more a suicide mission, so when Draco Malfoy is presented with the option to either dispatch his Headmaster or suffer an excruciating and most ignominious death of his own, along with his parents, he reaches deep into his black little Slytherin heart and manages to scrape together enough courage to go with option C instead: Spend Sixth Year secretly studying Animagecraft in the hopes he'll turn into something sufficiently imposing even the Dark Lord himself won't be able to keep Draco under his thumb. But just his luck, his Animagus form turns out to be a dragon, and a rather randy juvenile at that, intent on finding its mate: one Harry James Potter.

**** tumblr really is great; whoever says it died is wrong. I'm also on ao3, and am in the process of moving my personal bookmarks to my account there. It's under the same name, by the way. edit: I can also give you recs on here. Just give me an Ask through a DM or here in the comment section.
