I'm looking for a long series covering multiple school years with Fleur D. being the main protagonist, preferably starting her Year 1. having a reasonably good character progression and going through all the phases of a teenager/young adult and the difficulties that may bring.

Smut is okay, aslong as it's not a "smut fic". F/F (femmeslash) pairings are prefered, but not after some major character building.

Preferably Strong!Fleur.

Obligatory apology for mobile formatting and for it being a request off the odd sort.


** I don't think I've ever read anything with a particularly interesting Fleur, but I'd certainly like to see what you find!
