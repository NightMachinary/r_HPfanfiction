** I really like this ship in certain circumstances (time travel, Sirius coming back a decade later) their personalities can work well together. There's obviously a lot to work through but it's just fanfic.

Anyway, recs: Hello from the Other Side: Minister Potter has ninety-nine hundred problems. He never would've expected Sirius Black to suddenly become one of them, but when every person lost to the veil is suddenly returned, Harry deals with public opinion, rehabilitation, and long-forgotten feelings as he works to provide a future for a new segment of magical society.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15241182/chapters/35350473]]

Grown up Harry with a returned Sirius. It's an interesting take on the character.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/979182]] <--Cartographer's Craft. Written pre Deathly Hallows, basically a 16 year old Sirius comes out of the Marauders Map. The author is well known and it has a lot of plot and such a well-written Remus too.

The Man Out of Time [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16816447/chapters/39472441]]Sirius/Harry Time Travel. Loosely based on Time Traveler's Wife. Some nice evocative writing and a time travel aspect that messes things up in a way I hadn't seen before.

Oh and you can only read this one if you have a ao3 account but More than a Firebolt: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10642545/chapters/23547030]]

Harry is 21, Sirius didn't die in OoTp. It's dirty/wrong with feelings and lots of smut but the writing is excellent.
