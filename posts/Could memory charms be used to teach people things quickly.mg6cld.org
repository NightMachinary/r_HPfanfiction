There's a way to give people false memories using magic. Even if we assume these memories can be identified as being false with training, they presumably at least /act/ like memories are supposed to.

​

Thus, if you gave someone false memories of attending a class, would they "know" what the class would have taught them? If so, could this be repeated to teach someone vast amounts of knowledge at an accelerated rate?

​

I'd be willing to be there'd be some mental backlash if too many memories were given in quick succession, but if the memories were given in smaller bursts it might be okay (seeing as that's how the memories would be given for things like Statute of Secrecy breaches and that's supposedly held up completely since the Statute was implemented).

​

If this does work, it could end up being a bit very OP, but as long as limitations are applied (like maybe sufficiently advanced magic can't be taught and there's a decently long "cooldown") I think it could serve as an interesting plot point for something like a mentor fic. Or it could just be used as a prompt for a crack fic.


** If the thing you're trying to teach is a motor skill rather than just knowledge, you might have to imperius them through it a few times to build the motor skill.

*** Can't help but imagine a crack fic of Lucius Malfoy teaching kid Draco how to walk using the Imperius.

**** 1. That would be epic. I would totally read that.
2. I think Hogwarts should have been about 30% Imperius, if they weren't paranoid about Dark magic (oh noes!!!! dark magic!!!!). Just think how much better the flying lesson would have gone with a few Imperius curses from the instructor and maybe a trustworthy older student or two.

***** Given Durmstrang's reputation, they would probably embrace this teaching tool and churn out some very competent wizards.

*** If we're talking strictly canon I don't think it works that way. We have things like people cartwheeling around the classroom or Harry only failing to flip onto the desk because he resisted and we have no indication either could have accomplished those feats normally

**** Of course they couldn't do those things normally, but the caster could. That's my point. If you want to teach someone to play piano, and you can play piano, you could (1) do it the slow, painful way where you crudely move their hands with your hands and try to describe correct movements using imprecise language, or (2) cast the Imperius to make them move their hands correctly, and let them experience from the inside exactly what it feels like to play well.

***** They don't really experience it from the inside though. The Imperius puts you into a trance-like state of bliss where all anxiety and thought disappears, so I'm not sure if people remember things they do under Imperius. Having "no thoughts" kinda implies they can't exactly process what they're doing.

** I remember one such fic!! Harry there put the memories of meditation in his head to boost his Occlumency. He also did the same thing with some other subjects. He was in the first year and then took exams and quickly advanced to higher years if I remember correctly. There was also something about Hermione? She wished to do the same? She also had an eidetic memory. Dumbledore was somehow connected to this. It was gen and pretty interesting.

** I'm not sure - the impression I get is that memory charms are imperfect, and provoke plenty of confusion in the people charmed, without crystal clear memories. So taking that view, it seems unlikely that the memory charm that implants fake memories would be able to do detailed enough ones to teach useful things.

Alternatively, it might be tied to the user's skill in visualizing the memory. In that case, your idea might work - though it depends on how many people at once it could be used on (if it's being cast on a bunch of people individually, it might just be easier to have a normal class). Though I imagine they might not be 'integrated' into our other memories as nicely.

Instead, what I think might work better would be transferring actual memories, instead. So for a mentor fic, say someone is struggling to, IDK, 'see' magic. The mentor might be able to 'transfer' a memory directly of what they experience when doing so - with necessary downsides to explain why a pensieve is typically necessary.
