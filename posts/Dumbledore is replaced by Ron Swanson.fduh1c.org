**** /Lucius/: Dumbledore, you can't just kill a manticore in the middle of the Great Hall, during the welcoming feast, and then enchant a giant barbeque! This is outrageous! And why, in Salazar's sweet name did you replace the banners of the Houses with the flag of Muggle America?!

​

/Dumbledore/: Not to worry, I have a permit!

​

/Lucius, looking back at him aghast/: This just says 'I can do whatever I want!'
