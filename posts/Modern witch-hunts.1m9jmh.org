*** Or they do, but it's listed alongside such great classics such as the Malleus Maleficarum (Arabic translation) and the history of the spanish inquisition.

** What I would like to see in a fic in which the witch hunts are a real threat to magic, and the Ministry plays down the danger in fear of wizard accidentally exposing themselves to muggles who could easily destroy the wizarding world if prompt. This being the real reason why the statute of secrecy was made.

Maybe a crime conspiracy fic with Auror Harry investigating a string of murders whilst Hermione undercovers some sort of political conspiracy involved in the covering up of magical creature killings that span numerous generations, while Ron juggles with his out-of-control and grief stricken brother, a failing shop and his relationship with ever growing distant Hermione.

**** Firstly, Political life is very time consuming and I think Ron might subconsciously expect Hermione to be like Molly for the first part of their relationship.

Secondly, I just imagine Ron being jelly over Hermione and Harry having clear career roles and having an adventure he's not apart of, when he's stuck with his brother (which in my mind goes off the rails). In the end, George would get back on track and take control of the shop and Ron would become an Auror to be closer to Hermione.
