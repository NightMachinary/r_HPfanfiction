Dastardly and cunning, Romilda Vane has a secret plan to ensnare her long time crush and idol: Harriet Potter.

All the way from the US of A, she spent all of her pocket money on a Preference Correction Potion. Quick to dose her idols food with it, the potion works to switch an individuals sexual preference. In her eyes, hopefully switching Harriet from straight to lesbian, in order to give her a better shot at seducing her.

Hermione notices a change immediately, when her dear best friend suddenly starts surreptitiously checking out some of the older year boys in the same way she'd been fawning over Cho Chang not too long ago. Working backwards in her investigations; she, Ron and Ginny locate Romilda and get her to spill the beans.

They are horrified, but also VERY unwilling to out their best friend as gay by reporting to the staff and risking it getting out to the student body (or worse, the Prophet) and being used against her.

Thus a shadow campaign begins to keep a suddenly quite prococious Girl Who Lived, a lot more eager to track down a potential partner due to the potions side effects, from getting a boyfriend she really doesn't want. All whilst surreptitiously trying to source and brew the antidote and not let on what's happened.

Unfortunately... people catch on. Thus changing it from Ron, Hermione and Ginny trying to keep it quiet to the whole of Gryffindor house flitting around, dragging Harriet away from any boys to keep their little Chosen One pure.

As the rest of the school wonders what the hell is going on...

[OBVIOUSLY A CRACKFIC\NOT MEANT TO OFFEND]
