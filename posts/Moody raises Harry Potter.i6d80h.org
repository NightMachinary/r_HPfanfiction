  Dumbledore, against his better judgement, decided to allow Alastor Moody custody of the Potter scion. Years later, he has to reap the whirlwind. Oneshot.

  What? Why was Amelia snickering? Surely it was a good thing to have such a legendary auror like Alastor Moody as a mentor... right?

** Not overly cracky and Harry doesn't shout "CONSTANT VIGILANCE" like Moody does, but Mad-Eye Moody's Little Marauder fits the bill for "Moody raises Harry Potter".

Moody takes Harry in when he's six, after Harry literally bumps into him and Alastor notices signs of abuse.

It reminds me a bit of Petrification Proliferation in a sense - when Harry gets his canon scar-ache because Quirrell, the first thing he does is confirm where his scar-ache came from. The /second/ thing he does is call in Grandpa Moody and Auntie Bones, who promptly take care of the entire plot of canon because the DMLE is competent.

  Mad-Eye Moody always wanted kids, but it never happened. So he made due with a slew of apprentices.Until one day, he finds a little boy who needs someone to step up. Someone who can protect him from any threat, and more importantly, teach him how to protect himself.Or, how one adult stepping up can change the world (and also make people's heads spin).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/2/][Rorschach's Blot's Odd ideas file]]: chapters 2, 4, and 12

I admit I have not been keeping up with new entries, so I cannot say if there are more chapters than this.
