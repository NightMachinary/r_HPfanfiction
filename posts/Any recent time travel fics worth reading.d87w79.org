Posted in '19 or so. I'm willing to forgive a multitude of sins.


** */[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13285012/1/][A Fair Life]]/* is one of my favorite ongoing stories. Reptilia28 Reaper challenge, Harry is told Hermione is his soulmate (as always in this type of story (I will note that this story DOES NOT have the soul-bond stuff in it...)) but this time has an answer for why he didn't get together with her. She doesn't swing that way. Reaper checks Harry's file, he is supposed to be a girl...

The story is (so far) about Fem!Harry Learning how Magic society works (and how it is different now that she is female) while going through the triwizard. Love the relationship between Harry and Hermione, doesn't just come on, there is some buildup.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13221168/1/][*/Me Without My TARDIS/*]] Not a doctor who crossover, This Fanfic has Harry, Hermione, and Neville sent back to 1947 by the time room explosion. Featuring a Moody fresh out of training, and 11 year old Mcgonagall.

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13306252/1/][*/Double Time/*]] Future Hermione (who has, of course, lived through a dark and angsty future) deaged herself and sent herself back in time.

What makes this fic different from most similar fics is:

One, De aged future Hermione doesn't have all the future memories. When she was de aged the memories were removed too, what she has are pensieve memories left behind by Future!Hermione, F!H was working on a Greater-Good principle so didn't give all her memories, just the ones that will fulfill her goals.

Two, the ritual to send her back in time didn't erase present!Hermione from the timeline, so now there are two Hermiones.

This fic is definitely not for everyone. It is angsty (but in a good way), dark, and handles very difficult issues (like consent in a world with love potions, lifedebts, obliviations, etc etcetera), and is a bit bashy...

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.

  During the battle in the Department of Mysteries things go very wrong. An errant spell changes things far more than anyone could've imagined. Despite the title, this is NOT a Dr. Who crossover fic.

  Summary: Hermione had just kissed Harry on the cheek and watched him leave with the Dursleys when she learnt that Time Travel doesn't always work out as planned. Sometimes, things double up. And really, how the hell is anyone supposed to account for that? Warnings: Dumbledore and Weasley Bashing, Harry/Hermione relationship, Character Death, Graphic Violence, Time Travel, Potions,

** linkao3(19267840)

The romantic side-plot is lacklustre and there is very little actual chemistry, but other than that and a tad too much Weasley bashing in the background (Molly, Percy and Ron), it is quite interesting. Certainly avoids the usual angst and has a humorous narrative.

  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.

** One of my favorites is "Falling Through Time" by Kait Hobbit [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11418202/1/Falling-Through-Time]]

It starts off a few years after the war, but Hermione travels back in time to just after the battle at the Department of Mysteries, but this time around she falls for Fred instead of Ron. it isn't complete, but is updated regularly.

** I wrote a timetravel! Well- it's still under development and shifts a bit the definition of time travel. Basically, it's Tom Riddle from the past coming to the future. It is fairly dark, so be aware. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380/chapters/39160087][Here!!]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a single father trying to raise his godson, Teddy. Unable to ensure his son's safety in the wizarding world he goes into hiding in the muggle one. But one trip to London will undo all of his precautions. Thrown back to the past, Harry will take up the DADA position and fall into the arms of a woman who once spared his life. No time paradox, Light/Badass Harry. T/M rated.
