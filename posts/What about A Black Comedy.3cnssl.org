So I saw the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3cgps9/how_is_the_hell_is_harry_crow_so_popular/][post]] about Harry Crow the other day. Now that we are talking most favorited FFN stories of all time, I was wondering about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]. What do people like about it so much? I've seen this one on several lists as the number one HPFF.

I really liked the story for the first couple of chapters, but after a while it felt like the jokes where repeating themselves. The kind of humor is imo similar to that of the movie [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhFVZsk3XEs][The Hangover]], which was a very funny movie and a huge success (I think at the time it came out I saw it a couple of times), but I never went to see the sequel/part2 and I think a lot of people feel the same way. My experience with A Black Comedy is similar. The first couple of chapters I found really funny and original and I thoroughly enjoyed reading them. Then later it felt like I was watching the Hangover 2 and I couldn't finish the story.

Why do people like the story so much? What kept you reading? Was I reading it to fast - should I have spread the story over more days?

NB: No bashing of the story intended, genuine question.

TL;DR: Why do people like A Black Comedy? Do you think the humor is repetitive?


** It's humor, which will always be very subjective. I don't like it, but it is technically decent, and unlike Harry Crow, which is objectively terrible for plenty of reasons, I won't begrudge the people who like the story.

** It's very entertaining because of all the humor and action, it's competently written, and doesn't take it self too seriously. It also features a powerful and badass Harry who nevertheless isn't omnipotent. A formula for success if I ever saw one.

** I read it in the course of about two days, and I think part of why I enjoyed it was because it was so left field. It certainly was repetitive after a bit, and some characters definitely seemed way out of character (honestly can only blame so many things on changing location, time, or dimension). But it used things I hadn't seen before, like overly elaborate ward use/breaking, amusing vandalism... I enjoyed the story for the individual things more than the whole, I think. It's something I have gone back to reread once, and I found myself getting impatient or bored, so the novelty was probably a big part of my enjoyment.

** I've never really understood it myself, there are a great many better stories. But ABC is readable and fairly original for its subgenre.

** I couldn't get past the first couple of chapters, but then I also rarely read humorous stories. I'm much more if a fan of h/c and angst and dark stories where it's unlikely anyone will actually survive until the end. So humor doesn't fit well into that.
