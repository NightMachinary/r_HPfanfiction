I wanted to give the genre a try, but.. ehhh.

I read linkffn(In Bad Faith by Slayer Anderson) because it was the first recommendation I stumbled upon.

It's short, abandoned before Hogwarts, heavy on pureblood politics and managed to get lost in its plot in only 6 chapters.

I tried linkffn(Magical Me by Publicola), in which [[/s][spoilery mouseover stuff]]..

And just gave up on linkffn(Neville Longbottom and the Harry Potter by December Morning Owl) a few minutes ago. I didn't even survive the first chapter..

Sooo, is there a good one out there? Thanks in advance!


** Disclaimer: I have not read this story. I have seen it suggested on this subreddit a few times. Some have said it is decent (for a self insert).

*** I've actually read it, it's really good, and not only for a self-insert fic. The main character seems to be hit and miss for a small percentage of readers, but if you read a few chapters and don't find anything wrong with him you should be fine.

Unfortunately, yeah, there aren't many decent SIs in the HP fandom. A curse of truth is pretty much the only complete one I'd recommend. SIs are pretty much my weak point and I've read an embarrassingly large number, so I'll give my opinions on the other recs in the thread.

Magical Me is good, but ends at an awkward point in the story and will leave you wanting for more, so only read it if you're desperate.

In Bad Faith is less a Harry Potter fic and more an exercise in pureblood worldbuilding (this might be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your tastes). Also never updates.

I haven't read The Perks of Survival but I'll get right on it, will edit this post when I'm done. EDIT: Eh, I can't really see the appeal. There's no immersion to be found, no description, almost no dialogue. Many SB fics are like this and I can never get into them.

People are recommending other non-HP self-inserts so I'm going to go ahead and recommend a Worm SI I enjoyed, linkffn(Security! by ack1308)

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding.

*** I've read it and I was not a fan at all. First the protagonist was poorly written and spends most of the fic hitting on 11-14 year olds while being hinted at being in his late teens. The second gripe for me was the awful climax, [[/spoiler][much of the later half is spent angsting over "what if they/Hermoine find out the truth", but that confrontation ends up just being about his future knowledge, not the fact that he's from another universe and regards/regarded this one as fictional.]]

**** Hermione is 15 and according to the writer he thought of the main character as around 18 years old. It's not /that/ awful. And if you think he was hitting on anyone else you severely misread the story. I agree with your second criticism though, that was a cop-out.

** As already suggested, The Perks of Survival is good. I read it for the upcoming Book Club and was pleasantly surprised.\\
The only other SI I've read was ages ago, so I've forgotten the name, but it involves a SI who has read so much fanfiction that they struggle to remember which information in their head is canon and which isn't. Hopefully someone else can point you in the right direction if you're interested, it was pretty well done and rather amusing.

*** This. I have read no good self-insert HP fanfiction, but Naruto has stories like Iryo-nin Kasa, Catch Your Breath and Dreaming of Sunshine.

I think the Naruto world is much better for self-insertion. Having read the Naruto manga, if I ended up as a average ninja in the world, I'd probably bunker down and run to the hills whenever anything canon was too occur.

As a regular wizard, I think anyone not suffering from the J.K Rowling breed of /plot-based idiocracy/, and a dash of genre-savvy, would end up in a very good position in a very short amount of time. The world is just too abuseable to write believable self-insertion.

*** Here are a few of the links I had in mind for Naruto self-inserts:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine][Dreaming of Sunshine]] by Silver Queen. The story has advanced through first part of the series and the filler arcs and is heading into new territory.

The same author has also done other similarly themed one-shots, the first of which, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8774090/1/Reincarnation-Roulette][Reincarnation Roulette]], is very good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6749873/1/A-Cage-of-Blood-and-Circumstance][A Cage of Blood and Circumstance]] by Shadowsdeep. Hinata-centric.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10264082/1/What-Doesn-t-Kill-You][What Doesn't Kill You]] by Zbluez.

If you like lots of words, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872/1/Vapors][Vapors]] and its sequel by ElectraSev5n have nearly a million words between them.

There's another where the SI is reborn as the daughter of Jiraiya and a prostitute that is decent (but abandoned). I'll see if I can remember the title.
