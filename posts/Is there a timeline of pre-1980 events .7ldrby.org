Or, to be more precise, is there a timeline that covers the 19th and 20th century precisely?

Or even just bits and pieces of one, I'm more interested in the Grindelwald years in power and the 1sr blood war than the rest but anything can be useful.

*** Thank you !

I wasn't sure but now it is clear that I cannot just fiddle with an official timeline, but that I must work on it from scratch, sadly.
