I just don't understand why authors want Lily and James to be abusive/neglecting parents with Harry. Could you explain it to me?

I mean, I understand Harry has a brother who is the BWL. However, why would that imply he has to be arrogant, or that Lily and James would avoid their other son?

/Sigh/


** And this would be why I avoid that subgenre like the plague. It's such an interesting concept but always results in Lily/James bashing. I certainly don't want Lily and James to be perfect, but I can't suspend disbelief enough to accept that two people who canonically died for their child would have abandoned him to a life of abuse if they'd lived.

Seems to me that Harry not being hailed as the BWL is AU enough without completely altering other characters for no apparent reason.

*** I blame canon for precisely why this is so prevalent. I haven't read many of these stories, but from what I can tell, Harry being abused is just a natural starting state for many stories, no matter their premise, which is the starting canon position. I feel like many authors who want Harry to be genuinely Harry need him to be the "lesser son" in a family dynamic in order to maintain the same personality traits.

Totally not necessary if you're a clever author, but that's how I feel these stories come about.

*** I always wanted to see a story where Harry is clearly loved and they include him in as much as possible, but the WBWL just gets a bit more attention, similar to having a sibling with a handycap, because in a way that child who is hunted down by Voldemort, just needs a bit more attention and training to stay alive.

But they still try to take time out of they day for Harry and make sure he is loved, but maybe not at they full power

**** That is what would actually happen, IMO.

I have met siblings of special needs children (in the broadest use of special needs. From handicapped to gifted, and including traumatized and neuro-atypical etc etc etc).

Most of them where loved by their parents, and cared for by them. However their siblings just needed more attention, more time, to the point that despite the parents best effort...well there's only 24 hours in a day, and the other children were a bit neglected. Not the point of abuse, but enough for the siblings to have to struggle with some form of resentment and jealousy that they knew was misplaced.

So you can totally write a story with Harry in conflict with his parents and sibling, and even himself over WBWL, without painting Lily and James as bad guys, not even bad parents.

***** I mean it could be simple things that show the root of the resentment. Something like James cutting Quidditch-training with Harry short because of some appointment or Lily falling asleep while she is doing something with Harry.

And in a way you can even contrast it with the other child feeling jealous of Harry as well. Because Harry is free of expectations and can do and live the life he wants. Or even that L&J spend all the time they spend with him out of love and not obligation. Because while they would spend more enery and attention on the other child, they would try to still make time for Harry in their spar time.

*** There's one WBWL fic that I think handles it decently well. James and Lily do love Harry, but were convinced by Dumbledore to send him to the Dursley's because Harry IS the BWL; it's his brother who's a twit for becoming so hugely egotistical under all the false praise.

Harry's brother gets him sent to Azkaban in their Second year by blaming the deaths caused by the Basilisk on him, and Fate and Death have to step in and literally force a time travel plot, /twice,/ to try and fix things.

First Harry's brother gets sent back after dying during his and Voldemort's duel during the Triwizard Tournament. Fate and Death tell him he's not the BWL, and that Harry is, which is why he gets Harry sent to Azkaban in the second timeline---he's utterly terrified of Harry stealing his fame and thunder, so he /purposefully got people killed/ to get rid of Harry.

Here then fucks around and wastes all his time failing at things that should have been easy with prior knowledge before meeting Voldemort once more in the graveyard and, this time, outright /letting/ himself be killed because he's so far up his own ass that he can't imagine Fate and Death /wouldn't/ give him a third chance. And thus starts Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches, in which Harry dons the (won via challenger's rights) title of Lord Slytherin and begins swaying the Gray to his banner, along with some of the Dark, in an attempt to fully neuter Voldemort's power base before he's resurrected.

Is it a power trip fantasy? Yes. Does Harry get to meet his parents and spend time with them? Also yes. And they love him, but are also completely scared of what he might do with access to their estate due to the much more evil "Harry IS Voldemort" twist Dumbledore feeds to Lily and James when telling them of the Prophecy.

TLDR Dodging Prison is one of the very few fics that play a bad trope straight, and are fully enjoyable /because/ of it.

Children literally cannot make those choices for themselves, because of inexperience and immaturity. By telling them what he's planning/what's going on, and getting them to agree to it, Harry is displaying classic grooming behavior.

It would have been better if Harry, from his upbringing and Azkaban life, was actually emotionally and mentally stunted, having never progressed past 12~13, went to the Greengrasses, and Lord Greengrass would have gone "ok, your plan sounds interesting, but you're clearly a child, lemme help with the adult side of this" and he took care of a lot of the Lord Slytherin stuff.

******** Yeah, that's fair enough. For me, I found I'd lost interest and was put off right around when Hermione started her crush on Harry, and was hoping for a gift signaling intentions (or something), and it was just so weird that it was normal teenage stuff, because in private she's all 'my lord' and stuff. And the girls were starting to compete with each other to reach favor and I just.... wasn't enjoying it. I may do a catchup from time to time, because it's a good plot, just a bit cringy for me.

But I've certainly read lots of stuff that featured a protagonist doing stuff I was uncomfortable with, because i'm into the story. But I think, especially with a lot of younger teen readers, there should be an acknowledgment that wrong stuff happens in the story when recommending it, because they tend to read stuff like that and it shapes their perception of normality.

Twins raised by Dursleys, twins are rather codependent, split up at Hogwarts, wizarding world favors Twin over Harry (then Harry over Twin when real BWL status is revealed, Twin doesn't take kindly to that), and further conflict ensues. This is one of the only WBWL stories I've ever read without any bashing (except for a character literally getting hit by a bus offscreen).

** It's a way to create conflict, which you need for there to be a plot. Of course, some authors are better at this than others.

**** As I wrote in another comment, one can consider that the kid who lived as special needs, as he'd need more training, more attention etc than his siblings. James and Lily would have to spend more time and perhaps ressources on Harry's siblings.

It doesn't mean that they don't spend time and ressource on Harry. Quite the contrary, but not nearly as much as the sibling. Not out of desire or having a favorite, but just because it's what they have to do, and need to do to insure everyone safety.

Thus it can create a world of conflicts. Between the siblings. Between Harry and his parents. Between James and Lily, very much aware that they don't spend as much on Harry that they should, but can't find a solution, feel guilty about it, and take it out on each other, because that is what can happens.

Also, Internal conflict for everyone involved, including Harry. As he grows up, he might start to understand that it's no ones fault but the circumstances, and his parents are trying their best, but he'd still struggle to let go of the negative feelings.

Hey, you can even create conflict between James and Sirius (if Sirius is still Harry's Godfather). Sirius would grow closer to Harry because he kind of pick up the slacks, and that make James a bit jealous, and/or Sirius gets protective of Harry and angry for Harry's sake.

** My biggest issue with WBWL is that James and Lily always survive. How can there even be a BWL without Lily's sacrifice?

That said, I would love to see a WBWL where Harry isn't neglected or abandoned and gets on fine with his twin - I know people have said he has to be either abandoned or bullied to create the necessary conflict, but that's not so. There's plenty of other ways it could go, such as:

(J&L are dead in all these scenarios btw, because as I've said without the sacrifice you cannot have a BWL, and I think Harry and Twin would be good mates because growing up together at the Dursleys would have made them a "team," but feel free to add any spin on these you like. It's fanfic after all!)

1. Canon events play out in their first year but there's two Potter kids, and they both end up in the mirror chamber. Twin gets attacked by Quirrell and Quirrell doesn't burn until Harry jumps on him to protect his brother. Upon hearing this, Dumbledore realises who was actually BWL and the conflict/story/canon deviation comes from the boys and indeed the wizarding public adapting to the fact the boy they thought was the hero actually isn't. (If you really must do a J&L survive, they could be a big part of this conflict as they feel they "should have known") Twin gets a lot of shit off eg Draco for having "lied." Harry and Twin can either become closer or end up with a rift between them as this goes on, and either ends up with Twin helping Harry kill Voldie making them /both/ the hero, or Harry does it alone leading to Twin apologising for being a jealous bugger all those years.

2. Presumed BWL manages to get through the events up to GoF without people realising Harry is BWL. Twin gets put in goblet and ends up in graveyard. Twin dies, because he doesn't have the brother wand (let's assume wand binds to horcrux in Harry, so Twin wouldn't get it because he's not one). No one realises Harry is really BWL, but he's now so angry with Voldemort for killing his last remaining family member that he goes after him. Something happens that makes Dumbledore or whoever realise that Harry is a Horcrux, leading to a ton of self guilt from D for letting Twin go off half cocked without actually being BWL. Dursleys are super horrible to Harry - not that they cared about Twin but having his death as a stick to beat Harry with is too convenient for them. Harry does end up offing Voldemort, but he's so angry and angsty because of, yknow, his brother dying, that he makes some morally questionable decisions on the way.

3. Harry and Twin get on fine but are completely opposite. Harry maybe goes to Slytherin or Ravenclaw whereas Twin goes to Gryffindor, but even if they're in the same House they're different. Others assume Harry is jealous of BWL, bully him a bit and it can either make Twin and Harry become more insular and "twinny" or it can make Twin become a bit of a bully for a while until something happens to bring the brothers back together. No one finds out that it's WBWL until the very end, when Twin gets Snape's memories in the same way as Harry does in canon. Harry sees him leave for the forest and follows him. He doesn't realise Twin is "supposed" to die and takes the AK for him by jumping out of a bush in front of it. Cue a meeting in All White Kings Cross between Harry and a /really confused spirit Dumbledore./ Voldemort makes Twin carry Harry's presumed body back to the castle (they don't bother checking if harrys dead because they assume he's just a normal boy), saying he will kill him in front of all his schoolmates this time to "complete the set of dead Potters." Tries to kill Twin, who is master of the Elder Wand (because that's not a BWL thing that's a sheer dumb luck thing) and it rebounds. Voldemort ducks the rebounded curse. Harry comes back to life in front of everyone, gives a speech about how Voldemort is such a dumbass for ignoring the twin who flew under the radar (him), the Potter Twins attack Voldemort together and he dies.

*** Ooh another cool one could be canon events until first year and then Harry jumps on him to protect his brother. His brother and Dumbledore, realizing that Harry is actually the BWL, have to adjust to this, leading to a huge rift between Harry and his brother. It could possibly get so far that Harry is trying to go after Voldy while his brother gets so jealous and angry and upset about having his title taken away from him that he JOINS Voldy. The whole conflict could be brothers on opposite sides, where Harry is trying to get him to come home and Voldemort is so gleeful at having Harry's BROTHER on his side that he trains him and then Harry and his brother end up on opposite sides of the battlefield.

** Someone will have to remind me of the title, but there was a fic, once upon a time, (pretty sure it was ABWL not a WBWL, but my memory sucks) of Harry being a few years older than his brother, the BWL. And to protect his brother, Harry basically goes the way of Snape and becomes a Death Eater spy. Good story I recall right.

As to the point of the neglect; drama and conflict. If you don't have that, why bother with a WBWL? You'd just have a story where Lily and James survive with an extra OC, probably as a Gary Stu.

** I also think it's silly. My guess they do it for a couple of reasons:

1) It's Snape fans, some of whom tend to paint James and even Lily at times in the worst light while excusing Snape's faults. They can't figure out how to write adult James who isn't the same as teenage bully James.

2) Related to 1...it's people who like Death Eaters so writing James and Lily as "bad" helps them frame the Death Eaters as "good."

3) Fans who just like edgelord like stories.

4) A cheap and easy way to create conflict.

I've only seen a few WBWL who lived stories that worked & don't involve neglect/abuse...like the ones by The Santi. It's odd, too, because you could write a story involving some level of neglect that doesn't turn one of Harry's parents into a comically evil creation. For example, there once was a fanfic from years ago---which I think was deleted---where james had severe survivor's guilt & PTSD and turned into a quasi-alcoholic. He tried to be a good Dad, which his kids acknowledged, but was somewhat absent/a bit neglectful due to his problems & Sirius stepped in.

*** The WBWL trope as derivative of the Count of Monte Christo has never made sense to me. The Count of Monte Cristo takes revenge on people who had him wrongfully imprisoned because they wanted room to steal his career, seduce his fiancée, etc. As a side result of this, his father dies of starvation. (Yup, the actual Count of Monte Cristo had an adoring father and he still managed to spend hundreds of pages taking revenge.) There are decent people in his life, too, and he doesn't take revenge on them... much like canon's actual COMC-derived character, Sirius.

Being the Boy Who Lived isn't some great achievement Harry worked for the way the COMC's career was something he worked for. Canonically, Harry doesn't care for the attention that comes with it and would rather be just Harry. BWL status doesn't and shouldn't entitle him to anything. So losing it shouldn't put him in an automatic state of righteous indignation.

But even if an author wants to equate “killing curse bounced because of his mother's love “ with “was a good, talented hard working person who achieved stuff jerks wanted to steal,” there's still no need to completely rewrite other characters to make the plot hang together.

When they are gone Voldemort attacks. Lily dies sacrificing herself for Potter spawn II. James is broken with guilt, thinking he could have saved Lily if only he was there. He misdirects his guilt towards Harry. Afteral if he wasn't being a cranky toddler they would not have gone out that evening.

Honestly, the two WBWL fics that I like are Linkao3(Wait, What by esama) and linkffn(The Story of The Guys). In the latter, Harry is a lot like young Tom Riddle, and ends up forming his own group of friends in the vein of the Marauders.

****** Also linkffn(The Green in the Grey)

It's actually a story I really like, and the only WBWL story I've stuck to reading. However, the entire start to get the plot going is extremely contrived and nonsensical. Harry and his brother (Charlie) survived the attack in Godric's Hollow. Harry's a horcrux, and is slowly being corrupted/possessed by it, and needs his magic bound to lock the horcrux away. Charlie's magic is damaged from the attack, and can't be around Harry due to the darkness surrounding him due to the horcrux, as it could damage him further or it's possible the horcrux will possess Charlie. Also, Harry can't be around magic, as it could potentially cause his own to become unbound and allow the horcrux to become active again.

Seems like a great way to split up the family and get Harry to be raised by the Dursleys, right? Well, the author included a bit where Sirius argues that he can take care of Harry as his godfather, and would wear magical suppressors and do whatever else needs to be done in order to keep him safe. Which is perfectly reasonable and there are no valid arguments raised against it, meaning it would work just fine. But Dumbledore doesn't want that, and it's never really explained why, so he memory charms Sirius and places Compulsion Charms on him so he goes out of the country, memory charms Harry and the Dursleys into thinking James and Lily died and the Dursleys have been raising Harry for a couple of years, and memory charms James and Lily when they want to visit Harry and he won't let them (so he charms them to make him think they're visiting him). Unfortunately he can't create love, so the Dursleys abuse Harry regardless of their charmed state, and Harry is eventually rescued by Sirius and the Blacks when they find him abused. Then Dumbledore continues to charm James and Lily so they think their son is happy and healthy and they're visiting him regularly.

Like, the entire plot relies on Dumbledore wanting Harry to go to the Dursleys for no reason and rejecting other, better options for him. It makes no sense, and the fact that the author wrote in another solution then gave no actual reason for it to not work is just disappointing. If they really wanted to make it so Harry /had/ to go to the Dursleys, then it would have been far better for them to write a good reason for it, and explain why other solutions wouldn't work. Instead it was like "yeah, we could do this, and it'd make sense to, but let's not."

Other than that the fic is actually pretty good and decently written. It's super contrived in the beginning but after that the plot works.

** Cause people either like broody emos, or repressed underdogs. It becomes an 'excuse' to write a Harry with a shitty home life who totally outshines his 'supposedly' BWL (and usually a horrible excuse for a human being) sibling. In the first chapter, usually.

Honestly, some stories are able to carry this quite well, without bashing Lily and James. I cant remember the fics exactly, but i've read stuff where either due to a prophecy, or a spell/ curse, or other (usually quite interesting) reasons, without making James or Lily into horrible excuses for human beings.

The reason, i think that so many people like to fall into either this or the 'Harry is still left with the Dursleys, even though his parents live' trope because its /so damn easy/. There's a lot of fics out there for reference and inspiration. The idea behind the subgenre is actually really interesting, and gives a lot of options for a bit tense family dynamic (maybe a slightly jealous harry, who tries to work to get out of his sibling's shadow) or a wholesome family fic (where harry doesn't know its a WBWL situation, but supports his siblings cause he's Harry and he's a good boy) or so many more things.

TL;DR: People like broody emos/ repressed underdogs, its easily, and this is a subgenre with so much potential that has pretty much gone to shit. :(

Protecting muggleborns is somewhat more believable with his friendship with Hermione (plus any off-screen friendship) and his own mother being muggleborn, but it would still make more sense if he just tried to protect those he cared about instead of outright fighting Voldemort.

** i remember reading several fics about this f\very plot point.\\
FIC# 1::

in CoS harry displayed snake-speak. and everyone turned on him. well in this one his parents caught him speaking to a snake and that started a downwards sprial because they believed his magic was tainted by Voldemort. they started out in slight fear but fear often turns to hatred, so in this case they thought the best case was to alter his mind and memory of all magic, binding his power and leave him with a random muggle family. a good one. that way there would be zero chances of him turning out like tom riddle. NO magic-No dark wizard. however the binding ended up destroying the horcrux/soul fragment by causing it to starve from not being able to feed and harry absorbed it and the bindings. there for his magic came back. his adobted family caught him using it and became afraid. leaving him at an orphanage. after all who would believe them about what he could do. MOVE OBJECTS WITH HIS MIND? naw. anyways he became physically different hair color and such and ended up feeling the same as riddle did. bullied at orphanage and abandoned by his muggle family there for hating muggles. he would be given a new name by the orphanage and when picked up by hogwarts no one knew he was harry potter. the whole plot revolves around Dumbledore not knowing what horcrux's are and therefore not realizing that harry was one. plus james and lily did not really hate harry. they just felt he would be a better person as a muggle. but at hogwarts he would be hated by them because they did not realize who he was. everyone thought he was riddles son or something.

​

FIC#2::\\
harry and his younger brother were born on same day different years. harry is about fleur's/cedrics/victor's age. begins in GoF. harry is slightly dark. not full blown socicopath/ but realistic in what dursley's do. however dursley's did not abuse him them to canon degree. because Harry remember the truth. layed the law down and what not. hes old enough to threaten them. younger brother is like CANNON!harry. same personality/events/blah blah blah. (my personal headcannon is that only reason harry was a good person despite all the S*** that happened to him is the horcrux abosred and fed of his negative emotions like anger/hatred/blah. also amplified his despair from dementors. there for any hatred harry felt was taken by hocrux and thats why HP stayed in the light)

any ways... in this fic Harry felt upset by his brother because he felt like his brother was looking for trouble all the time and was spiting on their parents sacrifice. in the fic the younger brother has his name come out og goblet and harry is real champion instead of cedric. HP pulls his brother to the side and lectures him about the dangers of the tournament and asks why does he keep doing this stuff. PS. CoS. PoA. he keeps getting in harms way of his own free will. much like canon and this is what causes strain between brothers. Harry feels frustraion that its hard to keep his brother safe when he keeps rushing into situations way beyond his level and surving because of dumb luck. like canon!HP.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

** It's to explain (for the most part) why Harry is the way he his. He grew up in a cupboard where his only friends were spiders. And did all the chores around his house while Dudley had none. He grew up not really trusting adults especially when it came to information about himself. And that little trust of adults plummeted after Professor McGonagall dismisses the golden trios concerns about the philosopher stone being stolen.

While I wouldn't say Harrys cunning by any means but he is resourceful and like the hat says has a thirst to prove himself. Which is why he'd make a great Slytherin. And I highly doubt a child raised by Lily and James would end up the same way.

So how do you get a canonish Harry? Recreate his Dursley's home life. Then turn up and down the scale on how morally grey you want Harry to be. Next how do you make Harry's parents horrible ? You amplify they're worst traits.

What do we know about Lily? She used to turn tea cups into rats in front of Petunia and her Parents during holidays. She hated James until 7th year. She's intelligent. She seems popular or at least well liked by biased Gryffindors. And she stop being friends with Severus over one slur while he was being duress.

How to we make Lily more good and more bad? Lily can be naïve about her sisters jealousy over magic or more her completely aware of it and just doesn't care. She either witnesses James making leaps and bounds in turning into a good person or she decided it didn't matter anymore. Either she's a kind person that every one likes or she's popular in a mean girl way. And either she reached a breaking point that she couldn't forgive him for or she never really cared about him.

So it just really depends on how you want Harry to act

** One thing that's really weird is that even when there are twins, one boy gets raised up over the other because it's presumed they have the scar. But if the botched Horcrux spirit of Voldemort was trying to latch onto whatever it could, why wouldn't it affect both babies/ They would both be in the room and I doubt that one baby would just be shoved full of the spirit without it having some effect on the other one. The spell backfired but you expect the magic to go in a straight line back to the kid it was cast towards instead of maybe affecting everything in the room? That never made any sent to me.

Harry isn't the boy who lived here but his brother actually is and it doesn't follow the normal recipe of other tropes. For one lily and james aren't horrible or neglectful to harry. His brother also isn't a arrogant douchebag. All in all an amazing fic and i'm surprised it isn't recommended more

They want Harry to be the abused neglected hero who faces all problems in life but emerges as the ultimate hero. They like the sad story arc and do not care how ooc they have it make the characters. Dumbledore is pure evil. James and Lily are abusive an neglecting parents. Harry is not the brave, loyal and selfless hero but cunning, calculating, intelligent survivor.

** Unless I missed the comment, no one has mentioned that this happens in the real world where parents single out one child for abuse but not their other children. It's known as target-child selection/scape goat child abuse. In these cases, which often go undetected or unreported, one child is the "problem child" or the "black sheep" of the family and suffers abuse and neglect, while the other children are healthy, happy, and, in general, spoiled. So it is completely realistic to have a WBWL story where one child, Harry, is abused, but the BWL and other children are not.

Do I think all WBWL stories need to include this? No. I've read ones where it didn't include abuse/neglect of Harry, but I personally do enjoy WBWL stories where James and/or Lily are abusive towards Harry but not to the BWL and other children. I don't have to suspend disbelief in these stories because I know that is a real phenomenon that happens in the real world and the magical world isn't exempt from it. For those that don't think it's plausible, congratulations on living in a sheltered world where you have never known anyone that was the abused targeted-child and that you didn't grow up in a family where you were either the abused targeted-child or saw the abuse of the targeted-child.

*** I mentioned in a previous comment that one child can be singled out for abuse as the scapegoat, while the golden child is protected and loved. This is a very real and tragic phenomenon, with lasting effect. I've noticed reddit shitting on [[/r/raisedbynarcissists][r/raisedbynarcissists]], but to act like it's utterly unimaginable for James and Lily to not be good parents in fic, when we're talking about stories where children play sports on flying broomsticks, is ridiculous.

Too many WBWL fic and other fanfic include too much abuse, abuse and after effects that aren't ever dealt with, absolutely unrealistic depictions of abuse and recovery, but when there's an entire genre across fandoms called "hurt/comfort", the fact that WBWL stories include neglect and abuse isn't the issue.

**** I apologize that I missed your earlier comment where you mentioned it. I can see James and Lily going both directions, I can easily see them being loving parents that make mistakes like all parents but aren't neglectful or abusive and I can see them being the type of parents that target one child for abuse and neglect while being good parents to their other children.

I can agree that a number of fanfics include abuse and after effects that are not adequately addressed and unrealistic depictions of abuse. I think these stem from the writers not fully understanding what abuse actually looks like from either the perspective of the abuser perpetrating the abuse or the victim bring abused (which is a good thing if they don't, because that means they aren't guilty of abusing others or been the victim of abuse themselves). It's also difficult unless you have been a victim of abuse that had gone through counseling to overcome the abuse or a counselor that has gone through training to help victims of abuse to overcome the abuse to truly grasp what the recovery journey looks like with all of its setbacks, starts and stops, and the struggles involved. That being said, I think there is a certain amount of writers that use writing about abuse as a means of coming to terms with their own abuse.

** I can only imagine that the originators of this trope were writing about narcissistic, OCPD parents and the golden child!BWL and scapegoat!Harry. Some neglected and abused children are raised by parents who are considered the pillars of their community, praised for everything they do, but are in secret terrible parents. The parents behave differently towards the children depending on if they have an audience or not.

To answer your last point, "Why would that imply [brother who is the BWL] has to be arrogant?", didn't Dumbledore say that Harry should be raised away from all the fame? With how arrogant James Potter is described as being in his early years at Hogwarts, raised by adoring parents, perhaps he would raise his son to be similarly arrogant as a child (even though James grew out of that).

**** To be fair though James is shown as being arrogant because he was very spoiled when a kid plus being quite grifted both academically and in sports. He wasn't actually that much different from an average jock (not the ones from movies, the ones that are actual people and capable of empathy), and supposedly grew-up from it, so it wasn't the all defining center of his personality as it's so often portrayed.

We have absolutely no reason to believe J&L would follow the same route (and even if they did they would realistically do the same for Harry -overindulgent doting parents would be more likely to spoil both children rather than treat one as the Antichrist), while they probably would never be very strict I honestly can't see them mirroring Vernon and Petunia.

And then there is the fact that even if the twin got to walk around with his adoring public (unlikely with all the security concerns of letting even an average kid roam around on their own, to say nothing of a famous one) chances are that as a kid they would think it either tedious (being stopped at the street by strangers for small-talk when the kid would rather do something else is really aggravating) to outright disturbing (no one likes to be mobbed continuously every time they put their heads out of the door), I can actually see the WBWL ending traumatized by the experience and developing some degree of claustrophobic.

As far as I know in no moment cannon even implied that being the BWL gave Harry any significant benefit (and even if the WBWL were to gain special treatment by the public at large it really wouldn't be that significant considering that his family is already moderately rich and could potentially get the same treatment either way with no significant hardship) so I also don't see the twin getting any significant benefit that makes them think themselves better than the rest.

Really, that comment by Dumbledore doesn't give that great of a reason to leave Harry with the Dursley's, he could have gone with many other reasons. Being or not spoiled has more to do with proper child-raising rather than privilege and even if he would have been spoiled it would still be a better option than child-abuse.

*** Personally, I dislik WBWL because it usually makes Lily and James super OOC. Do you really think Lily "mothers love" Potter would abuse her son? All the evidence we have in the books points to them being good parents who care about their son. And I especially think that Lily, whose relationship with her sister had been destroyed by jealousy, would make ure that the same thing wasn't happening to her sons. Sure, WBWL is a cool concept, but it's so rare to find one that stays true to the characters while creating friction and tension. You could easily have Harry feel jealous of his brother without his parents preferring the other kid over him, or the WBWL feel confused and jealous after it's revealed that Harry is the BWL. Lily and James can still be flawed, and you can have them be changed by fame, but WBWL fics take this to an extreme and turn them into the Dursleys and bash them.
