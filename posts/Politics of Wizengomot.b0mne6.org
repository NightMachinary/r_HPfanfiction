I am an absolute fan of the political side of HP universe, and have found that there are not that many good political stories, and so I have come here for your recommendations.

Note, that an example of political story is something like 'Poison Pen' (in which Harry writes to Quibbler) or 'A Necessary Gift' (in which Harry lands in another world and pretends to be Sirius' out of wedlock son and there's a lot of Black family politics), instead of 'inherence test with goblins that gives 500 lordships that are not adressed in the story at any other point'. But, anyway, just give me political drama.

Edit: my spell check is in another language and keeps changing the words, sorry

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild)

While this certainly has a lot of other stuff going on, there are a lot of politics that also show up throughout the story, especially in the current timeline (Coincidentally, this story actually cannibalizes some of /Poison Pen/ as part of its plot). Spelling and grammar aren't the greatest though. The story is not complete but is updated every month or two usually, although Ebenbild seems to be rather sickly lately so updates have slowed down somewhat.

Cheers.

** I don't know you like male x male pairing,But I did found some political harry potter with it.

[[https://fictionhunt.com/read/8167207/1]] : Harry potter is a dark veela. Mated and bonded to Lucius Malfoy. Harry have 2 lordships and 2 duke titles. Harry is allied with voldemort. Harry will follow pureblood traditions. Dumbledore bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11527977/1/Lord-of-Time]] : Harry is the Master of Death and Lord of Time through his joining of the three Hallows together. During a duel that wasn't going well, he jumps to the 1940's and has a talk with the true Master of Death. Can have prevent the destruction that will occur? Can he change Voldemort prevent him from becoming the darkest wizard of all time? Or will he be caught in Tom's web? Slash TMR/HP? Harry changed his surname into peverell.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9281148/1/The-Dark-Roses]] : Harry has been hiding something ever since the end of his 5th year. What that something turns out to be is going to rock the wizarding world and a few members of the Order to their knees. You didn't think the Death Eaters were the only marked supporters of Voldemort, did you? SLASH, MPREG, mild character bashing, Sirius alive. MAJOR AU. Rabastan/Harry. Harry is a pureblood.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9624663/1/Black-Fortunes]] : Harry breaks the mirror after the end of the war. He is sent back to 1975 and takes up the mantle of Lord Peverell. He hopes to turn around the tragic Black family story. How? By getting newly widowed Lord Orion Black to fall in love with him. SLASH, Mpreg, Time-Travel, mild Character Bashing. Orion Black/Harry Potter, sub!Harry

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5256335/chapters/12128267]] : Harry and Severus find out just how bad the Headmaster is. Just how far he is willing to go to control them both. Harry took his lordships. In a relationship ship with severus snape and voldemort.

That's all I can find right now.

  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.

** Poison Pen is pretty much the only purely political drama I know, but I've recently read linkffn(Divided and Entwined) which has a lot of politics as well as battles and raids. Not winning a war by writing some letters, but winning by faking the death of a Wizengamot member to have the opposition leader trust your spy to expose his murderous plot. It's pretty long but very good and the most political of my favorites.

Harry doesn't have a Wizengamot seat... At least not initially.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
