As the title says. I've read Problem with Purity. I prefer Snape/Hermione and but any decent fic is fine :)

** The only animagus SS/HG fic I've read was [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6685][Naked Journey]] and only Snape was an animagus, I think.

** Again I'm going to recommend my favorite fic, The Lioness Prophecies which has been removed from the net. But I have an epub, so PM me your email if you're interested. Since there is no link bot to help out, I'll provide a description for The Lioness Propechies. It's a Snape/Hermione story written pre-HBP so no horcruxes, Snape is a pureblood. The relationship takes place after Hermione is 18. Just a note: Hermione's animagus form is a key plot point, but we don't actually see her being in that form, nor is the animagus process developed. But it is a fantastic SS/HG story.

** As the Falcon Hath Her Bells by HyacinthMacaw: two books, both complete.

(I also know one where Hermione is a kitten and Snape takes her in unknowingly, but it wasn't very impressive so.)

** Linkffn(The Irony) is pretty good. Hermione gets stuck in her lioness animagus form and Snape has to take care of her. Snape also has an animagus form. It's a WIP. It's also on AO3
