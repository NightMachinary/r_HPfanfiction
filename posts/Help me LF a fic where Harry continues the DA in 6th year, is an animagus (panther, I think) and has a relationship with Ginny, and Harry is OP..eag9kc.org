:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
If I'm not mistaken Harry has more than one animagus and his other form is an owl (maybe), and there's slight Ron/Hermione bashing. It isn't a particularly good or well written fic, but it's a guilty pleasure fic, and sometimes in life it's okay to enjoy those.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12550081/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Polymagus]] is the only one I know of with an owl as one of Harry's animagus forms, but I haven't read more than a few chapters of it and not recently, so I can't be sure if it's the one you mean.
