Harry is really seen as a catch among girls in Hogwarts and because of that Romilda isn't the only one trying to give him a love potion, there are dozens of others. Because of so potions that should make him love someone, it doesn't really force him to do anything. But potions are after all magical and their effects can be quite long lasting. Now, Harry has to live with it - he became harem-sexual.

Mostly crack I think.


** So in other words, an underage celebrity barely avoids getting date-raped because too many people are trying to drug him at the same time, and the overdose of mind-altering substances leaves him with permanent personality changes including some form of hypersexuality?

Sounds more like horror than crack.

** Since he's not willingly taking them, and therefore isn't adjusting his own doses to have a desired effect, I would expect that he'd eventually develop a tolerance if not immunity to them.

At which point he can do this:

Love Potions are the ultimate rape date drug, give it to a rapist and he will have a field day forcing pepole to do shit to his whim lol.

Love potions should be deemed illegall
