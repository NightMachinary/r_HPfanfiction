Basically, all in the title. I mean something like

- Dimension Hopping for Beginners

- On a Pale Horse

- Whiskey Time Travel

- Oh God not Again!

- Time to put your Galleons Where your Mouth is

etc etc... (And just for anyone interested, I would recommend the fics I mentioned above). I'd prefer long fics to one shots, though those too, are welcome


** For an AU I'd have to say A Black Comedy linkffn(3401052)

It's hilarious and a little bit of overpowered Harry. Harry finds Sirius after being sucked into another dimension, cue the laughter.

** None of these are humor/crack, but they are all dimension hopping/time travel to deal with Voldemort.

I'm Still Here linkffn(9704180). Stumbled into another dimension.

There's a bunch of them in Stories of the Lone Traveler linkffn(5751435).

Wastelands of Time and its sequel are time travel stories linkffn(4068153).

Life As She Knows It is a time travel back to the 1970s linkffn(7905430).

I would love for Agape to be updated more. It's dimension travel, linkffn(10058835).

C'est La Vie is a classic dimension hop, but then he isnt the BWL in this new dimension linkffn(8730465).

Stages of Hope is another classic dimension hop, linkffn(6892925).

Savior's Calling, I don't remember much of, linkffn(5990738).

Time to Spare is sort of Time Travel-ish, linkffn(2538955).

And of course linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) is really great. It's so well-written and not meant to be crack exactly but it's not exactly serious either and Harry being overpowered is kinda funny to me, so....

** Linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land) is a classic in my opinion. It has some of the most amazing battle scenes I have ever read filled with so much description and so many amazing visuals. It's long but so worth the read.

** Personally, I've always felt that such fics were wrongheaded. Canon Harry is useful against Voldemort because of the Prophecy, Sacrificial Protection, and Brother Wands. An imported Harry would have none of these things going for him, so in order to be useful, he'd have to actually be a Dumbledore/Voldemort/Grindelwald-grade wizard himself, at which point he might as well be an OC.

In short, if you want to someone someone to help you against Voldemort, summon a Dumbledore. (Now, you might end up summoning one of the ones who actually implemented the Greater Good plan and is co-ruling the world with Grindelwald with an iron fist, but he'll probably still help out.)

*** To be clear, the above post was meant to be ironic, though summoned!Harry is, usually, for all practical purposes, an OC.
