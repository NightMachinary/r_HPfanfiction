I'm looking for any fic, crackish or serious where Dumbledore is embraced as the wonderful lunatic that he is. Shenanigans are a definite bonus


** In /Itachi, Is That A Baby?/, Dumbledore has basically spent his career doing more and more outlandish things waiting for people to call him on it. They don't. He's basically desensitized the wizarding world to his madness (and he exploits it).

It's very crackish, and hilarious, although very far from canon Dumbledore. (Even if it's hinted that he does a lot of behind-the-scenes manipulation to make sure he gets away with it, too. And that some of it is to hide genuine plots of his among the madness.)

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** linkffn(Core Threads by theaceoffire) has a pretty good Dumbledore. It's been a while since I read it, but if I remember right he gives people important things in the form of transfigured fruits quite regularly, and generally just seems absolutely mad.
