** All this is explicitly addressed in the books:

#+begin_quote
  “But surely people realize what's going on?”

  “The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,” said Lupin.

  “The official version of Scrimgeour's murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.”

  [..]

  “Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren't confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.”

The rest:

#+begin_quote
  First: Who sends their child to be tortured by Death Eaters?
#+end_quote

Hogwarts attendance was made compulsory. To those who understood what was going on, it was a choice between attending Hogwarts voluntarily or be dragged to Azkaban. In any case, keeping your head down and finishing school is a lot less risky than going on the run.

#+begin_quote
  Furthermore, why were the Weasley's not attacked during that time-period?
#+end_quote

The Weasleys were pure-blood. Neville did say that they almost never kill pure-bloods. They were also under constant surveillance, and generally seemed to reluctantly side with the ministry.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone has to know about the "Golden Trio" right?
#+end_quote

Well enough to recognize them? It's not as if Ron and Hermione were in the papers every other day. Hermione did get into the papers eventually, and the snatchers did recognize her eventually.

** People were afraid, the thought process may have been that sending kids to school wasn't as risky as the whole family running.

** By sending your child, and informing them to keep their head down and behave, you wouldn't appear to be a threat on glace. If the Dark Lord had seized Hogwarts, the supposed premier school of Magic, then what's saying that he couldn't hunt down those that ran?

** Just possible explanations:

#+begin_quote
  while Death Eaters so obviously had control
#+end_quote

Sure it was obvious to the people who had actually been fighting them (and us, the readers). But remember that most people just got their information from the Daily Prophet, which was mostly a Ministry mouthpiece, and other Ministry propaganda (pamphlets against mudbloods). And Voldemort wasn't the face of the Ministry, Pius Thickness was (who wasn't a famous Death Eater like, say, Bellatrix Lestrange or Sirius Black).

The coup occured on August 1, when Hogwarts letters had probably already gone out, probably from trusty McGonagall, so students might not know Snape had taken over until they got there.

The Weasleys weren't attacked because they were purebloods. As long as Voldemort kept his pograms targeting muggleborns, neutral purebloods would have less reason to resist him. If he started attacking purebloods, he'd get more resistance. Voldemort only attacked Bill and Fleur's wedding because Harry might be there.

#+begin_quote
  Why was there even a moment's doubt that it was indeed Harry that the snatchers has captured and brought to Malfoy manor?
#+end_quote

Because the Malfoys are cowards and the penalty for wasting the Dark Lord's time could be death (the Malfoys had failed Voldemort multiple times before). They had to be /sure/. Maybe Granger and Weasley had established Harry doubles to distract them or waste their time. Maybe Greyback was trying to trick them to improve his own position.

#+begin_quote
  What would you do as say, a half-blood, or blood traitor during that time-period?
#+end_quote

Set up safe houses and start trying to hide muggleborns and their families. I'm not sure they would even need fake identities (at least at first). Britain has a population of over 60 million and Death Eaters don't know how to use a phonebook -- just move somewhere else, don't do magic, and don't say Voldemort's name (unless you can setup an ambush for snatchers).

** The whole Thicknesse Regime was set up as a clear parallel to Nazi Germany, or in fact almost any police state.

- a basically legitimate government
- new laws that excluded a part of the populace
- but procedurally correct laws
- a veneer of lawfulness over everything

So most people handled it the way people always handle it. They tried to keep their heads down. A minority had both the foresight and the means to leave and did, but most people simply didn't have the opportunity to /resist/ or /leave/.

EDIT: There is the basic belief everywhere and everywhen that "It won't be that bad. They can't really do that"
