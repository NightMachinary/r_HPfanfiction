e.g. for some reason Snape is at the hotel and sees them.

Or an old friend of Petunia's recognises her and maybe even realises that Harry must be Lily's son, or just distracts Petunia and Vernon enough that Harry's able to get his letter from the hotel owner.


** Snape walks past the hotel and sees Harry in the window in this one

  Summer 1991. Evading Harry's Hogwarts letters causes the Dursley family to flee to Petunia's childhood town of Cokeworth.But Petunia isn't the only person who calls Cokeworth home. And that dark mysterious man is floored when he spies a face he's not seen in 20 years: an 11 year old James Potter.

** COCA COLA WORTH! :) That would be so cool if Petunia met Snape! :o What if he did get closer to Harry because of it? Like he sees him acting all withdrawn and how they treat him when they think nobody's looking and stuff?

  Dudley demands to go to a fair, it so happens to be in Cokeworth, where Petunia grew up and during the summer...where everyone's favourite hermit called Severus Snape lives. The Vow comes into play and needless to say it has consenquences but who for? Dumbledore? Harry? Severus? Voldemort? well all we can do is wait and see...and hope for the best. Severus rescues Harry story.
