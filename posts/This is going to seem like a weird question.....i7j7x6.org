But is the fantastic beasts series worth watching? I don't want it to be a waste of my time like cursed child


** They're well made movies. Newt is a unique main character, Tina's pretty cool, and Jacob's a nice guy. Is there some stuff that I don't like plot-wise? Yes. Are the special effects pretty nice? Yes. Did I enjoy watching the films? Yes.

*** Well made movies? Eh...

They can be fun to watch, but they don't quite fit in the canon and they don't make all that much sense. I think it mainly has to do with JKR writing movies as if they're books. That problem is more apparent in the second one.

**** They're fun to watch if you pretend the actual Harry Potter series doesn't exist

** They're fun for the effects and some of the characterization is neat, but don't watch them with too sharp of an attention to the plot.

** I would suggest watching them for their own artistic merits, but not trying to imagine them as part of the Harry Potter world, because they don't really line up. Just imagine that this is some other world with witches and wizards, and they're well done.

** The first definitively, and the stress is on the word “watching”. Screenplay is not that great, but wizarding New York in the roaring twenties is just the thing you need, even if you didn't know. Also, the animals are really interesting. The second film, you can probably leave behind: the screenplay is even worse, there is a way less fun and funny animals, and the plot is so stupid, I still wonder what JKR drunk/smoked while writing it. I will most likely not go to the third film, because already the second one felt like the recipe for disappointment.

However, generally, don't worry too much. NOTHING is so bad as the cursed Cursed Child.

** The first definitely, it was great.

The second is kind of a mixed bag though, it has some amazing character interactions and the story is good and the characters are very relatable (even Grindelwald, surprisingly).

But it creates some plot holes that no one has any idea of how they are going to solve and in some scenes the light is really bad, like GOT's “long night” kind of bad (so like watching it in a dark room with minimal brightness settings on the screen while using sunglasses) though admittedly it is only for some scenes and the rest are illuminated well enough.

** Feet up with a few beers or a bottle of wine and you'll have a fun time. Watch them for anything but mindless entertainment and you'll be disappointed.

** I watched them but they didn't really hook me in any way. I don't think they are a waste of time, though. They're just OK.

It seems like the Fantastic Beasts series doesn't bring up the same passionate hatred in fans as the Cursed Child (which I actually didn't mind THAT much, but I know I am in the minority). So even those who aren't crazy about Fantastic Beasts at least are not offended and scarred by the movies, as with the Cursed Child.
