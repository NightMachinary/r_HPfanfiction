** You need to describe the actual fic you are looking for. No one will remember a fic based on how many chapters it might have had.

*** Actually, forget all of that I found it! It's called “19 years”. The only problem is I found it on fanfiction.net but it has 55 chapters, on harrypotterfanfiction.com, it had 80 last I saw before the site went down.

*** I thought they might as I remember it being called one of the longest ones out there. I'm trying to remember stuff, it was after DH with all the canon pairings and such, it followed all the canon information. I read about half of it a few months ago and here are a few random plot points I remember: Harry and Ginny have some problem and end up split up and she's with Oliver Wood for a while and he's drunk everyday until they get back together. Ron and Hermione never have a big problem but don't get married for a while, her mother gets cancer later too. I think all the jobs they have are canon except Draco briefly working in a ministry section for equality of other magical races and Neville as an Auror before being a professor. Ah I wish I could just remember the name
