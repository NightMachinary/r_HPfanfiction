Have some like this ?


** linkao3(My heart is a fist of barbed wire)\\
Follows what would have happened if Tom Riddle wasn't the only wizard at Wool's orphanage. It follows Tom through school, but he goes a different direction from his canon self.

It's a fantastic read, that actually makes a good job characterizing Tom and what a relationship with him would be like. There's no romanticisation there which I love.

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)

** Linkao3(Birds of a Feather by Babylonsheep) is doing this, but be forewarned that it's an AU where Hermione was likewise born in the 1920s, and... Well, one could argue that she mellows him out a bit, but tbh he still gets up to some nasty shit.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.
