Example:

Harry/Hermione discover they have been potioned to love the weaseleys, and investigate together, building up their evidence to confront Dumbledore/Molly/Ron/Ginny.

... And when they do, Molly/Dumbledore are horrified and had nothing to do with it. Turns out it was Lucias Mafloy intending to turn the light on each other.

... And it turns out it was Luna Lovegood, following the instructions of the Nargles to help out her friend Ginny.

Harry decides to grow a backbone/ be less passive than a potted plant. He contacts the goblins, arranges to care for himself and get training away from Hogwarts. Finally, he declares that Pivot Drive is no longer his home

... And promply 30 death eaters show up and kill him+dursleys. Rest of the fic is the remaining cast figuring out what to do now.

The Ministry passes a marriage law to deal with declining population. It looks as if it is going to prompt unconventional relationships or perhaps a bit of rebellion out of the hero's.

... And some creative muggleborn discovers that it doesn't matter who the ministry has you married too if you are married in the muggle world that takes precidence and everyone promply ignored the law.

Egads, yes! I think that far too many people take that once-in-a-century miracle---that stopped an unstoppable curse, slew the mightiest wizard in the land, and remained an inviolable sanctuary until the day Harry left the Dursleys without intent to return---for granted. Most of the time, Harry just moves Chez Sirius, nobody takes any precautions that they didn't take in canon, and nothing bad happens. (Or, Harry is raised elsewhere in the first place, and there are no negative consequences whatsoever.)

I can't really rec without spoiling, but that's what happens in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue by Azjerban). IIRC, Harry lives but loses a leg, and named characters die. I can't think of any others.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

**** More precisely, it's the act of residing there, not the minute-to-minute physical presence. Popping over to get groceries doesn't reduce the protection, or it would, indeed, be pretty useless.

But, yes, it's weaker when Harry is at Hogwarts, since while the Dursleys' remains his "permanent address", he doesn't reside there day-to-day.

***** I'll just chalk it does to Rowling not explaining the nuances correctly. Order of the Phoenix implied the house/nearby area only, while Half-Blood Prince implied that the blood protection was renewed at privet drive.

I think it's twofold. Harry has blood protection from his mother's sacrifice, and that doesn't need to get renewed. It was infact valid after his 17th birthday.

He also had privet drive protection. That's what broke upon his 17th birthday. It's linked, but not the same thing as his innate protection.

Then there's Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality which takes the premise of Hogwarts and puts that premise into the Matrix.

Probably a bad example though as there are existing good deconstruction fics and it would be pretty hard to do a decent curveball after starting steriotypically.

WBWL might fit better, but I don't read those so it is hard to say what a curveball would be.

I felt that they were in character in the book, but it's been so long since I read it that I don't remember what it was called or anything. Also, my cousin really turned me onto the Dramione ship. I never saw it until we were talking one day and she brought it up and pointed out why she shipped it and what not and well she persuaded me and I see it. I personally never liked Ron and Hermione. I was more a Harry and Hermione shipper until she persuaded me to the Dramione ship.

******* Oh damn I suck at explanations, so I doubt that I'll ever convert anybody haha. She convinced me that Draco had a crush on Hermione. I remember that she pointed out that Lucias says something along the line of “Ive heard so much about you from Draco” meaning Draco talks about her even at home. I'm sure it's complaints but at the same time what do young kids do when they like someone? They gripe and complain about them. Not always but it happens often. My cousin then went on to say that she believed Draco really admired Hermione but since he was raised in such a twisted and bigoted environment there was nothing he could do about it and he didn't know how to handle that he admired a muggle born. He resorted to bullying her, which a lot of boys do to the girls they like. (My older cousin bullied his wife constantly and now they've been married over 25 years and I aspire to be like them. They are the most loving family and just great people) I don't know about other people, but that's why I ship them. I also always personally felt that Draco could have been good had he had some sort of support outside of his home life and the Slytherins He hung around with. Hermione would have been good for him. Or so I think. Take all this with a grain of salt because it's basically rambling that probably doesn't make sense.

** For a quick subversion of the marriage law trope, I recommend the very short /Defections/, linkffn(5250119).

There's one vignette subverting the "Ron and Hermione are spying on Harry!" trope in Rorschach's Blot's /Odd Ideas/ anthology, but I unfortunately forget which chapter.

** Tales from Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18720031/chapters/44400358]]

In the modern-day wizarding world, two half-blood wizards attended Durmstrang with hopes of bringing change and justice to all students regardless of blood status. They seemed inseparable until tragedy struck, leading to them departing ways. While one withdrew to the shadows, the other boy continued the rebellion against the pure-blood hierarchy.

This fic subverts most tropes. Check it out!
