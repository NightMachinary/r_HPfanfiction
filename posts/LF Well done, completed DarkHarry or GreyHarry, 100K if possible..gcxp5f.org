Title says it all. Well, almost - prefer no slash, but if it's in the background and/or the story is that good, then I'm down. Thanks in advance!


** It is my duty to recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/][A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned]]. Not only does it fulfill your requirements, but it has several other notable qualities as well. 520k+ words, 103 chapters. It starts at the beginning of Goblet of Fire with a few edits to the background timeline (author explains them before the start of the first chapter, they're all little things and weren't really worth the effort to start the story there). The pairing is Harry/Fleur, it is slow burn and written fantastically. This fic is the sole reason for Harry/Fleur being my OTP and after nearly 9 years of reading fanfiction I can confidently say this is the best story I've ever read.

I have a library of over 250 harry potter fanfics and I judge them on the plot, the pacing, the worldbuilding, the dialogue, the environmental writing *(*a story's ability to make you /feel/ like you're in a specific place*)*, the character development, the editing, the use of planning *(*when you really pay attention it is easy to tell the difference between an author who has thought through where they want to go *[*even if they have multiple possible paths, the point is they still thought them out*]*, and an author who makes it up as they go along*)*, the usage of source material, the integration of original material, and lastly the tone and theme of the story. When I think of all the stories I've ever read, fanfiction or otherwise, this is number one. It is absolutely amazing and I have made it my mission to get as many people to read it as possible.

That said, please don't go in expecting perfection. This story isn't perfect and neither is anything else made by human hands. If you expect perfection you will always be dissapointed, but if you learn to appreciate something for what it is and not what it isn't, then you'll come to realize that it is the flaws that contrast with the beauty and let you appreciate something for what it truly is, amazing. So go in un-biased, un-expecting, and sit down for one hell of a story.

*** /coughs in everyone else who thinks A Cadmean Victory is a cliche ridden piece of trash/

Seriously though A Cadmean Victory is one of those fics everyone has to read at least once. It is well written and has a decent storyline, and is one of the best Harry/Fleur stories I have found.

**** It is very cliched yes, but is that a bad thing? To be cliche just means that that particular element of a story is common, sometimes to the point of predictability, but being common does not make something worthless. Yes A Cadmean Victory is cliched, but the author uses the cliches well. Whether the elements of the story are common are not is irrelevant, what matters is how well the story has been written.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12484195/1/][*/Saviour of Magic/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6779989/Colt01][/Colt01/]]

#+begin_quote
  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

  This is smart! Powerful! Ravenclaw! Harry; How would the wizarding world react to a Boy Who Lived who is much different from what they expected? One that is set to change the course of the magical world forever? Grey Harry; Manipulative! Dumbledore; Harry/Daphne
