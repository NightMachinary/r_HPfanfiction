I've had a head canon for a while about a famous quidditch player, for whom the wronski feint is named. Wronski was known for breaking at least 1 broom a game. Why? Because when he did feints, he caught the snitch, pulled the broom to horizontal and then stood on top of it while HIS momentum forced the broom into the ground, snapping it. He'd then do a sick roll and stand up with the snitch raised in 1 hand in victory, because obviously he is a seeker. I kind of see it as being equivalent to smashing a guitar at the end of a rock concert.

Let me know what you guys think!

Here's a link to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Josef_Wronski][Josef Wronski]], the canon creator of the technique, as well as a link to the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wronski_Feint][Wronski Feint]] (technically it's for tricking the other seeker, not for catching the snitch)
