I've also written a good one myself, at least in the opinion of most reviewers...

*** Just a quick question: What exactly is a 'GAR'?? You used it for both stories and I have no idea what that means.

****** It probably started there. I've never seen it as a fanfic descriptor before now, but it's used among anime/manga fans sometimes which is how I recognized it.

** I would like the idea of book club like this. I am always reading HP fanfiction. I know i read this story before, but that was so many stories ago and i will try and get caught up to chapter 15.

** Yessss! Definitely interested. I'd like to propose either The Black Comedy or Bungle in the Jungle. Oldies but goodies :)

**** It's pretty good, one of the better stories in that genre of fanfiction. If I have any complaints, they'd be that the story is a bit on the unpolished side, particularly toward the beginning. Jim Bernheimer (jbern) was a novice writer when he began it and the sequel (Turn Me Loose) is more professionally done. Jim's stuff really twists canon around and he tends to have several unique ideas and takes on characters. I believe the much-copied "spell chaining" concept originated with Bungle in the Jungle and he was responsible for many popular fanon interpretations of characters (e.g., his take on Bill Weasley has been borrowed in several other stories).

Jim's mostly off writing and publishing original fiction novels now. (Just a week or two ago, he released the second in his YA battle-unicorn trilogy, which is something like his fifth published novel.)

****** I'm told that the fanfiction writer Perspicacity was his beta for it. (Hopefully, he didn't talk Jim into writing it third-person present tense.)

Oh, wonderful! That's what has turned me off of BitJ before. I think I've tried to start it twice since it's always so recommended. I'll read with the Book Club regardless, but does its polish level increase at all?

**** Great, for me will be 11 AM.

I will have to be careful to put only what happen till chapter 15, maybe at the beginning you (or the user that creat the thread) could ask if everyone read till the chapter 23. And we can talk about the entire fanfic.

****** Yeah, only after the first time we will know what we should and shouldn't do.

I don't know about the other but I read fanfics quite fast, for the 8 hours that I will be travelling I will also look for more four or five fanfics to read, I will probably not read all of them, but just in case I get excited.

I am wondering what would happen if we choose a fanfic and the author also participated on the club.
