I am a huge Harry/Ginny fan though I do read all pairings. Most of the stories I have read are set during the Hogwarts years and the few post DH stories I have read have been H/G. I am looking for recommendations for complete stories with different pairings. I just recently read a WIP Harry/OC story that is really good and also read Hope by Jeconais. The fic doesn't have to be completely romance but I am hoping that is a major focus. Stories about meeting someone to help him deal with the aftermath of the war currently soundx appealing to me. Harry/Fleur, Harry/Gabrielle, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Susan, Harry/Hannah, or really anyone other than H/G and H/Hr are welcome. Thanks!


** Do they have to be Harry-centric? My favorite post-Hogwarts stories with a romantic focus tend to be Hermione-centric stories.

*** Yes... I would prefer Harry-centric. I have only ever read a couple non-harry-centric before that I was able to get through.

** There was doc I read a little while ago. I'm blanking on the name and I'm on mobile. But basically Harry come back to teach at hogwarts after retiring from being an Auror. At the start he's secretly dating tonks, but he also get close with the new potions teacher, Daphne Greengrass, and one of his seventh year students, Gabrielle Delacour. It's even complete and I really enjoyed it. I'll check my favourites to see if I can get it for you.

**** Linkffn(the after years) the authors name is something like mbdil but I didn't want to get it wrong by putting it in the brackets, if it's not the right one I'll look it up again but I hope this gives you what you're looking for.

  (Post-war) One witch 7 years his junior, one witch his own age, and one witch 7 years his senior. All vying for Harry Potter's affections. Who will win out? (Not harem, but possible sexual situations/lemons) (All credit to abovethestars@TDA for the banner)
