** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13403866/1/Ouroboros][Ouroboros]]. Salazar Slytherin reincarnates as Harry Potter and Godric Gryffindor reincarnates as Neville Longbottom. Very good, author has their own original version of the story of the founders so whatever Rowling might have said about their history has nothing to do with the fic. linkffn(13403866)

  Salazar Slytherin woke up in the body of a three year old boy with the most ridiculous head of black hair and a runic scar craved into his forehead. The last thing he recalled was dying. Now it is over 900 years in the future. What is a wizard to do?

***** It's interesting in a canon breaking way. Ouroborous goes into old magic, and sets Dumbledore up as an adversary without bashing. Without outright spoiling it, those "protections" do something unforgivable in Salazar's eyes.

I'm of the opinion that it makes indie!Harry fics more believable. It can't be ooc if the person in Harry isn't Harry. It also adds an air of mystery as Salazar tries to find out what happened since he died. It also gives an opportunity to add lore.

** Antithesis linkao3(7322935)

I was hesitant to start this because most wbwl stories are bad, but this was quite a good surprise.

The beginning is a bit weak and requires a trope to get the whole story started, but once it did it's just amazing

The Pros:

1) No manipulative Dumbledore. He's a genuine and enjoyable character

2) Amazing characters that I fell in love with. Harry, Harry's twin, Luna, Harry's Snake, Remus, etc. It's quite surprising how they develop and became characters I enjoy reading about

3) Slight spoiler, but the Basilisk in here is amazing. I don't want to spoiler more, but this is the only story I can think of that characterize the Basilisk in this way. It is just amazing

4) It deals with trauma. Harry isn't an edgelord, he's someone desperately trying to deal with his childhood by doing the wrong thing. He's a complex and flawed character but he develops and change. It's a very well done "dark harry" fic. It just feels natural, his fall and redemption imo

You really do empathize with Harry. There are some amazing scenes that really demonstrate the psychological desperation and damage that Harry is dealing with

5) Amazing lore and worldbuilding in regards to the basilisk, thestral, dark magic, etc.

6) Voldemort's personality feels very genuine. Most story has Voldemort be super nice to the wbwl Harry and it's unrealistic. This Voldemort feels realistic. The author has some amazing insight into the way Voldemort feels about this Harry

The Con:

Its biggest weakness is the "negligent James and Lily" trope that I usually hate. Now to be fair the negligent and abuse is a lot more subtle and less obvious. However it still feels unrealistic.

And I do feel like the author didn't develop Lily and James that much in the later chapters. We don't see much from them, and they still feel 2d, in comparison to the other characters like Harry, Harry's twin, Voldemort, etc.

Overall an amazing story if you could just push through the trope at the beginning

This is just Hadrian but the author decided to end it with "anus" for some reason. I half expected it to turn into a crack fic after that.

**** Yeah it's not perfect and it does use some tropes but it was still a decent surprise for me

Note that I've started and stopped this story a couple of times in the past. But it took me being a bit bored and more invested before I got to the “good part”

What I really appreciated is the minimal bashing. Other than the beginning with James and Lily (and it's small compare to other wbwl fic) most characters are treated pretty fairly. This is what makes the story attractive to me

Anyways, I hope you enjoy it, good luck!

** Linkao3(Of Clones and Wizards) is a promising HP/SW crossover that updates every day. I'm a little worried it's going to end up too cheesy for my taste, but in lieu of The Havoc Side of the Force updates I think it's the best active Star Wars xover.

I read Linkao3(Grey Space) based on a recommendation in another thread and liked it a lot, so I'm reading Linkao3(Turning of the Times) from the same author. It's not at the same level as Grey Space so far, but I'm holding out in hope that it improves.

** I'm hooking into HP stuff for want of something to read. I've spent a week plowing through a few fandom 'classics' - Whats-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff, Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived (And damn if it isn't a shame I can't get at the WbA extras), The Art of Self Fashioning, the Weasley Girl, Echoes, the Monster with Green Eyes and a few others. It's interesting to come into a 'new' set of fanfiction and try to identify tropes, but also get blindsided with stories that I was expecting to be awful and just flipping through on a whim with how good they were.

I've tried flipping through some others that come highly recommended (Before the storm or Stealing witches, for example) but I wasn't quite prepared for how incredibly enthusiastic some of these authors are about their slash. Or how easy it is to get into something that looks like it might be mild, and it quickly switches gears into less a story and more a vehicle for porn. Is that common?

I sort of wish there was a chronological reading guide somewhere so you can spot where the assorted fanfic tropes spring from. I know over in the Worm area of things, there's a lot of really excellent early stories that are ruined by tropes you get tired of, even though they birthed them originally. It'd be nice to be able to read those original stories that spawned the many imitators before being exposed to said imitators.

**** Boy Who Lived and the Handbook of Elf Psychology (also it's sequel). There's an absurd amount of 'almost great' bits that are too short for what they're trying to convey or have a few ridiculous elements (the Stag and the Flower has both) but the above three are great from start to finish.

Also that bizarre one where Harry is a dragon.

** I've been doing a reread of [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614-1/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]]. It's only tangentially related to HP - it's a massive multi-crossover - but some of the other books in the series have a lot more. Book 4, in particular, is a prequel to the others, so it works well as a stand-alone story, with HP canon being reimagined in terms of James Bond style advanced technology instead of magic.

The starting point was a story challenge to write a crossover gathering women from multiple fandoms (including at least HP, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and one other) to fight an apocalyptic threat. Diane Castle took it and ran with it and then wrote other stories about what each of those women did with the meta-knowledge that they gained from their team-up (eg tracking down the local analogues of their teammates).

** First, a thanks to the posters in these threads for giving their thoughts and suggesting fanfics they've enjoyed. It's so hard to find good fics, and your reflections are super helpful.

To add to the discussion, I'm currently reading...

The Black Sheep Dog series on Ao3. A story in which Regulus survives the cave incident and decides to go, bleeding and in need of help, to his estranged brother's house. Naturally, Orion and Walburga show up quickly afterwords, and then seek to repair their relationship with their estranged older son. At first, I didn't like how everyone seemed to be treating Sirius as a hapless child who doesn't have legitimate reasons for choosing not to have a relationship with his family, but his family grows to have depth that makes them sympathetic characters. Also, the romance with an OC character is pretty cute and well done.

I'm also reading Flowers by the Wayside on Ao3, which is a time-traveling Petunia series in which she goes back in time years after the wizarding war has ended and attempts to save her sister's life. With a hefty side of romance with a character I won't name.

One more, then I'll stop (I know, I'm reading a ton and it's silly, I should probably get a life). Check out The Second String on FFN (I think it's on Ao3, too). Probably the best-executed WIP I'm reading right now (and the story is soon to come to an end). A very creative, non-cliched Harry time travel story in which he (unintentionally) goes back in time and lives as the (pretend) squib-bartender/protege of Aberforth Dumbledore, who is a fantastic character in this story. Ariana also appears in portrait form. Great story, highly recommend. Also, a lot of emphasis on/unique speculation about dementors, if you're into that kinda thing. And a set of well-executed lower class, folkloric characters.

  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.

Under the Veil is a Harry Potter/Undertale crossover. And if you don't hate everything about the game, the fic is pretty good.

The premise is that Sirius meets Sans after falling through the veil after he erased himself from the timeline, and the go back in time to the climax of the third year. The story is set in the world of HP, and the time travelers DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING (makes for a much more interesting story.) So maybe give it a shot? Please don't kill my Karma.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13407891/1/The-Archmage-of-Arda)It's]] a HP/lotr crossover.

The basic premise is that Harry gets super magic powers from the combination of basilisk venom and phoenix tears. This makes him immortal and gives him the ability to travel in between dimensions. He goes to middle-earth and is raised by Elrond.

The story goes really fast. It mostly focuses on the highlights of his life and covers hundreds of years in 75k words. The start can be a bit boring but it picks up pace really fast.

I highly recommend the story to anyone who likes lotr crossovers. It's not as good as SoA, but it's close.

**** It takes place before LotR. You don't need anything other than a basic knowledge of the world to read this. Silmarillion would be of much more help, but that's not needed at all.

** Currently reading three that are updating all three updated in July.

First one is Linkffn(Retrograde by Knife Hand) a Harry time travel fic with Amelia Bones mixed in some how wont give anymore because it surprised me so I'll let it surprise you.

Next is Linkffn(In Pursuit of Magic by Zero Rewind) it's a self insert fic where the main character, as the title says focuses on the mysteries of Magic. But does he? It's a good one highly suggest it!

Third on is Linkffn(The Sorcerer'a Gamer by The Violet Imagination) it's a new Harry Potters life gets a gamer style introduction and follows him kinda a guilty pleasure fix that explores a lot of tropes but in a new way.

*** Retrograde had an interesting premise and I checked out a few chapters. But I thought that the way Harry and the person he's shipped with met was cheesy, and their immediate friendship seemed unrealistic to me.
