It's been ages since Grow Young With Me has been updated, and I'm jonesing for new romance fics. Hopefully of the same quality as GYWM. Harry-pairing preferred. No slash, please. If you have a great slash rec that isn't Harry/Draco or Harry/Snape, I might check it out but I'd really prefer Het. Canon pairings are okay.

Adult characters preferred. I'd like to avoid drama around loss of virginity. I'm not looking for smut fics, just fics more realistic about dating in your 20s/30s.

Thanks!


** I am still waiting for Grow Young With Me to Update.

[[/u/Taliesin19]] Please Update!!!! Please!

*** Nice post - I linked a story that features Harry as Ginny's bodyguard but it didn't feel like the right one. Turns out the one I had in mind was Ginny Duty - it must have been removed from FF.net at some point or I forgot where I read it originally. Thanks for reminding me, because I remember enjoying it quite a bit.

** This is one of my favorite genres too. Hogwarts romances are frequently cringeworthy and much more difficult to execute well.

One series which might fulfill your request is the Anguis series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4095/Slide][Slide]], specifically the last two books, Falls the Shadow and Beyond this place. It's largely canon-compliant and the 3rd book features wartime romance between recent Hogwarts graduates while the 4th book focuses on the aftermath of the war.

I'd strongly recommend reading from the beginning as the series has some of the best-developed OCs in all of fanfiction and you can watch them grow from angsty schoolkids into conflicted adults with real challenges. It's not as light as most of the suggestions herO_wraith give you though, which cover the bulk of the common post-Hogwarts romance fics, and it features a lot of action although romance is also a major part of the stories and I enjoy the balance.

I'll also throw in Black coffee, with sugar - it's a fluffy and a bit unrealistic H/D and there's still a lot to go but I've been enjoying it anyway. linkffn(12414949)

If you dig back to pre-DH release there are some decent post-Hogwarts H/G stories as well. I can look for them if you're interested.

**** I dug up some of the ones I've saved over the years. I included everything that met the criteria, but I'll have to reread some of them myself - I'm sure some are a bit dated. If any seem really bad then let me know so I can clean up my C2. Also since some of these are more immediately post-Hogwarts there may be some teenaged characters and virgin-type sex scenes (I also think that earlier in the fandom authors tended to write all the characters and Ginny specifically as more pure, probably due to younger age).

I also wanted to include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/16/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]], which takes place at Hogwarts but features a mature and complex romance between Harry and Ginny and is probably the best story in the Professor!Harry-dates-student category. I've also read it more recently than the others so I can attest that it's well-written. Harry is aged up to about 20.

** linkffn(10728064)

linkffn(11697407) and its other part linkffn(12381694)

linkffn(8262940) unatoned is sometimes considered one of the best written fanfics even if its not as fun as some of the others.

linkffn(9444529) Several of TE7s stories might work.

linkffn(7711029) Another post Hogwarts quidditch fic.

Oh I'll also throw out linkffn(10100723) since I know a few people find it amusing.

Then there is [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] which is pretty meh but pleasant enough.

A quick list that I posted to a similar thread a few days ago. Most are quite well known however since its a commonly requested but little explored area.

*** Thank you! I haven't read a few of these. Yes, it is difficult to find good romance fics. I think because many fanfic writers are young. There are a number of great teenaged writers in the fandom but writing romance without the life experience can sometimes fall flat.
