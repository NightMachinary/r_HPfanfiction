For me it's that unless Harry is a time traveler or stole an advanced potions book from the potions classroom, there is no way for him to know Snape's anti-eavesdropping spell prior to reading the half-blood prince potions book. Snape invented it. He did not find it in a book of spells. Same with that upside-down jinx and the cutter. They are not widely available for public use, so in stories where third year Harry is throwing around Snape's spells just annoy me.

I know my boyfriend is annoyed when characters call the spell by their incantation. "I was hit with a crucio". No, it's the cruciatus.


** For me it really annoys me when characters say "DADA" instead of saying "Defence Against Dark Arts"

Also weird shortened names like "Har" or "Siri" I'm not a huge fan of "Mia" or 'Mione either.

**** Yes, but both IT and PE have an adjective as the first word and the latter word be something fairly generic, which makes it easier to just use the acronym.

During my university time I did have a few courses that weren't like that and most people shortened them to the one word that was the core of its name instead of using an acronym. As such, I think it quite likely that when given a subject like with a name like that people would shorten it to the core word (“Defence”) rather than make an acronym from it.

Don't get me wrong, I can see some people use “DADA” for it. But everyone and their mothers? Not bloody likely.

** Well

- basically everything about Occlumency and Legilimancy

- the Dark Arts as generally portrayed are just... not good at all. Like, pointless, really

- your second point

- basically everything about how Dumbledore is often portrayed

- Hogwarts letters *don't* arrive on your 11th birthday, they show up early-mid July as evidenced by the request to receive an owl back no later than July 31st. Harry only actually got to read his on his birthday because Vernon is a little shit.

- The way that purebloods are portrayed as the absolute rule in the wizarding world (or, more accurately, wizarding Britain) because if that was the case /Voldemort would never have become what he was on the issue of Blood Supremacy/. He still probably would have rose as the Dark Lord, but under some other banner.

- Ron wasn't angry that Harry was in the Triwizard Tournament and that Ron wasn't. It was that /he thought Harry figured out a way to enter the Tournament and didn't give Ron a chance to enter/.

- On the subject of Ron: Ron would have been back virtually instantly during /DH/ if he didn't apparate into a group of Snatchers. It was that delay in getting away from the Snatchers that lead to Harry and Hermione leaving before Ron could get back. He just wasn't able to find them again until the whole Doe Patronus, Sword in the Pond, Locket stabbing deal. Heck, he almost found them once, but Harry and Hermione's protections of their campsite were so good that he just couldn't find them.

That's really all that gets my goat that I can think of off the top of my head.

While I agree that Snape is a damn good occlumens (better at it than Voldemort was at Legilimency, or the whole spying thing probably would have never worked out), I have to disagree about why Dumbledore kept his distance from Harry that year.

It wasn't about keeping Voldemort from reading /Dumbledore's/ mind, but to make Voldemort think that Dumbledore and Harry weren't any closer than any normal headmaster and student relationship to keep Voldemort from (a) reading Harry's mind to find out what Dumbledore is up to and (b) possessing Harry to attack/kill/harm Dumbledore.

****** I have an essay that explains my thoughts on this, if you're interested, but the TL,DR is that firstly, Dumbledore was partially correct, but also partially wrong. Dumbledore thought Voldemort would use Dumbledore's affection for Harry to hurt him (Dumbledore), but really Voldemort circumvented Dumbledore entirely and used Harry's affection for Sirius to hurt Harry.

So while Dumbledore was correct to think Voldemort would take advantage of Harry's love through their strange connection, he was still wrong on the particular details.

Voldemort was basically an opportunist that year, and took advantage of Harry using what knowledge he was privvy to, so I think it's likely that, had Dumbledore been closer to Harry that year, Voldemort /would/ have acted how Dumbledore predicted he would. What Dumbledore failed to predict was how Voldemort /and/ Harry would react deprived of the knowledge Dumbledore was depriving them of.

So on one hand you have Dumbledore working to prevent one disaster, but by preventing that one, he really just created another.

I also think that Dumbledore might still have feared the consequences of being close to Harry if Voldemort hadn't possessed Harry at the Ministry that night. Harry's ability to repel Voldemort not only told Dumbledore that he'd been way off the mark with how to handle Harry that year (something I don't think he would have realized without Harry being possessed), but also told Dumbledore how afraid Voldemort now was of Harry (by how quickly Voldemort fled). Snape even says that the Harry-Voldemort connection doesn't seem to abide by the same rules as Occlumency/Legilimency, but Occlumency was all they could think of at the time, since this was all new terrain. These answers would help Dumbledore figure out how to proceed, which is why there's a 180 degrees in his confidence between OotP and HBP, he finally knows what to do about things.

I'm curious why you think there are lots of holes?

The Mind Control Curse would be handy for prisoner transfer (if you can't stun a person for some reason) or for getting a person in an altered mental state to act safely. For instance, someone undergoing severe hallucinations on a cliff edge.

The Torture Curse, depending on how it functions, might be useful in detecting the nature of damage in someone unable to feel.

***** It's recently been my head-fanon that there are in fact both Light and Dark Arts. They are magics that rely on the positive and negative emotional spectrum, respectively. And that they're both addicting in their own way: Good begets the need for good, and bad begets the need for bad.

There are also the White and Black Arts. While I'm still pondering on what the White Arts might include, the Black Arts are literal Abominations of the Natural Order. A Horcrux would be a Black Art, as would Necromancy (though I consider Inferi to be a sort of "poor man's necromancy". Basically you preserve and animate a corpse through transfiguration. Binding a soul to the corpse would be actual Necromancy).

Is that so? A cutting hex/jinx/curse presumably can be used for, say, tailoring in a way an entrails-expelling curse can not. A trip hex or the dancing thing don't cause direct harm at all, and the purpose of anti-intrusion jinxes is clearly to prevent intrusion rather than cause harm.

Rowling's magic is simultaneously too detailed to be mysterious fantasy (think Tolkien, where Galadriel never yells "mind-rape") and too inconsistent to be sci-fi, but I think it's not as bad as you suggest.

******* It's a very unlikely way to slaughter anything, in truth. Vanishing the brain or cutting off the head would be much more practical.

On that note, I don't like that the killing curse works on spiders. I haven't read the books but I think that's canon. It still works within the "purpose to harm" framework to identify it as dark magic, but it would be much better if it destroyed the soul, which exists in HP, thereby being only useful on ensouled beings. This would also be interesting with regards to dementors, which differ in that they do not destroy, merely displace the soul, thereby rendering victims catatonic, and horcruxes, which are "anchored" soul-parts that gain some agency through this anchor to objects.

Ron as portrayed in canon is awful. How can you know a guy for 4 years - with them being almost exclusively only friends with each other - and then pull that shit? The whole thing with Ron was awfully contrived and unrealistic, and that applies to the whole "ima leave you in your greatest hour of need". Who cares if he came back? The problem is that he left in the first place.

Anyway, I think it's silly that people like you jump to defend Ron, and vice versa when he's merely a victim of bad writing.

Wards: the ones we see in the books are not a class them self they are either charms or jinxes cast on a area and not some runesstone placed somewhere or runes engraved in the walls.

Runes being anything beyond a language: In canon runes are used as way to write a language, nothing more.

Like all spells, it's only broken if you don't impose limitations. A proper notice-me-not charm would only work in a crowd when the caster or object cast upon /is not/ being looked for. I find that it's better to call it a Distraction Charm, as it distracts people from the fact that they've seen something of significance /only/ if they are doing something that is of higher personal priority. A woman doing her shopping would be distracted from the fact that she saw the famous Harry Potter because her last milk jug had spoiled and her children were whining so she needed more milk or so help her-

But a person specifically looking for the caster would not be dissuaded, as the caster is of personal significance to them. If the caster were alone, there would be nothing to distract observers with, especially if the caster is not supposed to be in that area.

***** I think people get upset more about the term "ward" instead of their existence. "Ward" is never heard through 6 years of Hogwarts education; thus the word either doesn't exist or isn't relevant to magic that a student would learn.

A strict interpretation of canon says that protective enchantments are the real permanent defenses. Obviously they must exist in some form to defend homes, etc.

If "wards" do exist, then the term probably refers to some esoteric, complex magic far beyond average knowledge.

If an author wants to use the term, fine; it doesn't harm the quality of the story. But the world immediately become AU; claiming it's a canon divergence is incorrect.

This suggests that as far as canon is concerned spells that rely on a steady and low power output over long time are quite unlikely to be a thing. That applies to warming charms as such a thing would require a steady and low output. I could see potions with the effect of warming the one drinking it, or a charm that would make the clothing more insular and thus able to protect the wearer from the cold better (and would probably make it quite hot inside of the clothing after a period of wearing it due to all the accumulated body heat).

Sexism isn't explicitly portrayed; that much is true. When women are portrayed, they are portrayed in similar ways to men.

But men are portrayed more often than women. Just comparing gendered terms, we've got something like a 4:1 ratio. If you order characters by importance and look at the gender ratio of any prefix, it's going to be heavily skewed toward boys. It's something like Harry, Tom Riddle, Dumbledore, Hermione, Ron Weasley, Severus, Minerva, Draco, Sirius, Remus, Hagrid, Peter Pettigrew, Lucius, Rita Skeeter -- you get where I'm going here. If you take the top four, you're at a 3:1 ratio; top 10, you're at 4:1.

**** As always, never trust JK with numbers.

In my head canon, the £5 is a historical value, disregarding inflation. Back in the day, five pounds could buy you quite a bit. Five pounds in 1900 are the equivalent of $600 today.

I don't think the exchange rate is quite that drastic, but I think 50-100 of today's pounds is a good rate for a galleon.

***** And my headcanon is that someone didn't pay attention to the fact that a pound now has an actual set value instead of being equivalent to one pound of silver. Because the one time we were told that a galleon costs five pounds to get is the time when five pounds of silver would give you about 25 grams of gold, a bit large for a coin but not unrealistically so, and even less than that if the goblins have a fee for exchanging money.

Though both takes on it work, really, and both make the whole thing equally silly.

****** Keep in mind that the article is using relative purchasing power, not actual equivalency.

What I mean is: JKR created a world that has only 3 denominations of money. Their relative worth to each other is set at 1:17:493 [17x29]. On the basis of that, and the idea that there are no paper bills, you'd want to make the smallest denomination as small as is practical, the middle one as a good baseline and the large one a meaningful multiple. If you set 1 Knut to be worth $.05 [or pounds or whatever], then a Sickle = 1.45 and a Galleon =$24.65.

No one buys things for a cent; even a nickle is arguably near-worthless except in multiples, but this society sells the daily paper for 5 knuts, only 1 or 2 if you've got a subscription. A Knight Bus ticket runs ~$15 to go anywhere in the country... eventually. Harry's wand set him back ~$175.

It's a serious curse that requires some dedicated treatment, so unless people wanted to use it to harm others they wouldn't use it after seeing it and if people did use it then someone would land in the hospital wing and Snape would land in trouble over it.

2. Saying something like that in a crowded train station to a little kid won't gain any attention, and no one will instantly think magic is real off of a ten year old and a mother talking about it. Even if it was about dragons and a recipe for a magic potion no one would believe magic is real from it.\\

That said, I will point out that Sirius does have a bit of trouble to see Harry as “Harry” rather than “James, MK II” after his prolonged stay in Winter Resort Azkaban, and for what it's worth we do see him trying to do better in canon, which means that though he might or might not have used that nickname when Harry was a little kid he is unlikely to do that after his escape because of how similar it is to James's nickname. The same applies to “pup” in a way: it could have been something that he did call Harry when he was a little kid, but as it would later serve to focus on the connection between James and Harry (father--son) and Sirius is trying not to get them mixed up he is unlikely to use that one either.

- Magical Cores. Fuck that. nuff said.

- Manipulative Dumbledore who got stuck on a "Its for the GREATER GOOD REEEEEEE" loop. In the same vein, a Dumbledore who can't outmaneuver a 14 year old.

- Character bashing. Just awful writing. Period.

- Metamorphmagus romance with "I like you how you /really look/" lines in it.

- So, so many portrayals of how Occlumency and Legilimency work.

- A potion is required to find your spirit animal / animagus form aka. You need to get high as a kite, drop some serious acid-potion and go to wonderland where your spirit animal stares at you meaningfully. Also the animal has to be a goddamn wolf or nah... make that a dragon.

  Character Bashing
#+end_quote

Character bashing has a few definitions, but since the word used is "bashing" as in "to bash something/someone", I mean something other than making a friendly character a villainous one. I mean the reduction of a character to its worst traits, a focus on those traits and then a repeated exploit of them to paint them in a constant bad light. Bashed characters are (made) 2 dimensional cutouts of what their characters once were, only to use them as a constant, easy target for the protagonist and his friends to yell at.

I'm the last one who would claim that making a character a villain is something bad. Quite the contrary. If you do it well, I'll applaud you for a job well done. But character bashing, as seen above, is just bad writing.

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I think I mostly hate the way so many fanfictions handle it. I can't really explain it, but you'll know what I mean when you next see some Lord Potter do the animagus thing.

#+begin_quote
  it's because there is no stealthy way
#+end_quote

Then get creative or make your protagonist face the music. The thing about this charm is that I simply don't buy that there is no counter charm. Institutions and people who's job it is to find people who often don't want to be found, would probably know how to counter it. A big part of my annoyance here also comes from the fact that its such an often used charm in fanfiction that many began to think its canon. I mean, I got people PMing me on FFN, asking why a protagonist didn'T simply use a Notice-Me-Not - have I forgotten about it?

And there is nothing wrong with you liking "Prongslet". I just think its a super cringey nichname and kind of a dick move to call Harry that.

***** Fics I've read have things like "bashing of x character", when mainly it isn't bashing (at least by that definition), it's having them act badly in their character in that story. If I'm reading a story where James Potter hates all Slytherins, had Harry goto the Dursleys, and Hates all things Slytherin because of a prophecy related to Slytherin, and he dislikes his son because he is in Slytherin I wouldn't call that bashing, yet it's described as such in the description of the story.(Talking about Prince of Slytherin)

The mind castle bit on Occlumency/Legillimancy can be ridiculous, especially if they learn it even to half of Snape/Dumbledore/Voldemort's ability in first year. Some stories do that well too.

True, the notice-me-not charm is an easy cop out. It's easier to just have them sneak past the people instead of staging a confrontation, or other things.\\
I was mildly confused by the notice-me-not charm when I first saw it in a story (as well as Tempus).

** The ones that annoy me the most?

The Weasleys /must/ be stealing Harry's money, because they have access to his vaults and have withdrawn money for him on a couple of occasions.

Ron Weasley in particular is an incompetent wannabe manipulator, because he told a tiny fib that the other compartments were full on the train.

Dumbledore is totally evil too because something something Dursleys something manipulative something Gringotts vaults.

--------------

Also, Harry's vault #687 in Gringotts is only his 'trust vault' and he has way more tons of money stashed away somewhere.

Nevermind that...look, go find 10 coins, of any variety, and stack them up next to each other, remember the height, then put them side by side in a line. Then use that to visualize how big a 1000-coin not-quite-a-cube would be.

--------------

Oh, wait, there's one more! 'Right of Conquest' where Harry can somehow magically drain Voldemort of power due to 'winning' battles with him or whatnot, and claim any pureblood vault he feels like due to Dark Marks being considered equivalent to marking slaves as property and something like that.

Anything to do with Ron really. People place him as a below/average student when we're told that:

  That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in lessons.

Also several subjects appear to have perquisites such as Transfiguration (E) and Potions (O), most likely DADA (E) as well. Ron continues on all the same subjects as Harry so he achieved an E in Transfiguration, an E in Potions, and almost certainly an E in DADA and Charms as well, suggesting that Ron is at least above average. Conversely, I've seen people turn Ron into a tactical genius, which frustrates me to no end, as in some respects it undermines his character. Ron shows not an ounce of tactical planning bar chess, Harry and Hermione do most of the planning, giving Ron an ability he doesn't have as a main focus in fics implies he has no 'important' abilities. This is not the case, Ron might not excel at anything quantifiable, but he is certainly important when it comes to emotional support, consider Harry's lack of motivation without Ron. He has a knack for suggesting an angle neither Hermione nor Harry had considered, such as his suggestion of using Felix Felcis in HBP or basilisk fangs in DH. He also, along with Ginny, appears to be skilled at mimicking. I imagine that Ron was a vital part in turning Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes into an 'enormous money-spinner'.

All the Pureblood nonsense is grating as well 'Lord Potter' etc.

In general I can be really picky about authors writing canon compliant stories, I can bend believability, but it does annoy me when something is directly contradicted by the original text.

Yet, Ron has been consistently undervalued by authors because he doesn't have any obvious talents. Neville has Herbology, Ginny is both a good Chaser/Seeker and Bat-Bogey savant, Hermione and Harry are both very talented people and Luna can be wise.

Ron is an inconsistent Keeper, although he did win them the cup twice, important in maintaining Harry's sanity, and a fairly decent, but not exceptional, student/wizard. I would like to think he's the most successful of his brothers but sadly he's only really the most famous.

Unfortunately almost all fics that turn Ron into a tactical genius are terrible written, and often it's introduced suddenly without prior explanation, as though Ron has always been a tactical genius. Nevertheless, I have read several good ones including: 'Reign of the Serpent' it's an AU that introduces Ron's tactical thinking in a fairly logical way and [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] an AU where magic is replaced by spy skills, it's well written and Ron has a much grander position than he does in canon. linkffn(9783012)

Harry, and Hermione has certain blocks in her behariour, whereas Ron is almost always surrounded by people, even when he's not with Harry and Hermione at the moment. That might not be of too much use when you write a story in which only those three characters interact with each other and everyone else is a background tree, but when the characters are actual people this can be quite a skill/trait/whatever.

He may also not be a real-life tactical genius---with his self-confidence problem I can see him needing more time than is optimal during fights and the turn-based nature of chess can be a sign of a good and adaptable mind but does not automatically translate to real-time tacticing (pardon the inexistent word)---I could see him being given what they know about some situation and after some pondering throwing some guesses of which one would happen to be somewhat accurate.

Not to mention the fact that, outside of the times when something struck him straight in the gut and he lashed out on impulse, he actually is very damn loyal. It went forgotten because bashing, but those who know why the 4th year and the 7th year “betrayals” happened know that these cannot be held as the standard of his behaviour but rather exceptions.

A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*** The practice of “godparenting” was a thing even before Christianity, though. In Ancient Rome, for example, you could have a legionnaire swear to another to teach their son if the latter died. It wasn't quite being a substitute parent, more about becoming a teacher with the kid being an apprentice if there was a need for it, and any closeness between the two coming being something that happened if it happened rather than being guaranteed.

This practice, along with some others, got adopted by Christians and then called “godfathering” which is why it's called that way in the story, but it didn't really originate from the religion itself.

That said, the practice was most common amongst people who fought and thus were at a high risk of dying in the process, so I don't see most purebloods as having godparents simply because they aren't fighting and thus would see no need in the practice (the death eaters were probably all or almost all too assured of their superiority to fear dying). Honestly, I could see a pureblood asking someone else to act as their kid's (or kids') godparent in two situations: one being when they were dying, knew they were dying, knew it cannot be prevented, and did not have enough wealth and someone left behind who could throw money at other people for their children, and the other being the same situation as James's and Lily's with them hiding and actually being afraid that they might be killed.

Another thing to add, because of the practice's roots, it means people given godparents don't have a godfather and a godmother both because again they're not substitute parents but someone who is supposed to teach them what parents cannot so one person is seen as sufficient for that.

*** The pure-bloods being christians makes sense if you consider that the statue of secrecy was only put in place 300 years ago. Its noted that wealthy pure-blood families like the Malfoys associated with the upper class of muggles and its even suggested that some of them were part of nobility or worked as wizards for the royal court. It would be almost impossible to live like that without at least learning to pretend to be Christians and adopting christian traditions.

** On the topic of Snape's spells, at least one of them was used by someone to whom Snape would never have taught it (i.e the Levicorpus was used by James). I isn't inconceivable that other spells invented by Snape were learned by other people who may have taught them to Harry.

One thing though that the HBP spells do negate for me though is the idea that shows up in many a fanfic - that performing magic properly is about intent and not incantations and wand movements. Twice in HBP Harry performs spells where he has no idea (beyond the vaguest hint in one case "for enemies") about what the spells actually do, he could not have formed any intent. Both times the spells work perfectly.

OTOH, in the Order of the Phoenix Harry is only able to perform a substandard Cruciatus and the implication is that it is because he has no real intent to torture, his fury and a general wish for revenge aren't enough he has to intend for the spell to cause extreme pain.

So essentially like so much in canon there is contradictory evidence as to whether intent matters, or some spells work perfectly without it, some don't?

- Something of a pet peeve, but I get very annoyed at authors who harbour the impression that Voldemort didn't start looking like a snake until after his Triwizard Tournament resurrection. The Dark Rituals he went through throughout his life (Horcruxes chief among them) are responsible, not the potion. In fact, that's the point of the ritual --- it created a perfect replica of his original body rather than some random flesh golem.

- Death Eaters knowing all the other Death Eaters. No, I doubt Snape and Pettigrew knew that each other were DE's because they were both new, and Pettigrew was the flip floppiest DE ever as well.

- Even the name Death Eater wasn't well known during part of Voldemort's initial rise. See when he applied for the DADA job. The name was a secret.

- Harry's scar doesn't begin to hurt (Edit: While Voldemort is far away from him) until his fourth year. And it's a big deal when it does. I read a fic where Hermione and Ron assumed his scar was hurting "again" and it was before 4th year.

- Dumbledore didn't know that Harry was a Horcrux for a while. He suspected something had happened, but it was 1) the first time someone had survived the AK, 2) the first time someone had made so many Horcruxes, 3) likely the first time someone had made a person a Horcrux, and 4) likely the first accidental Horcrux.

If Dumbledore knew, he didn't see it pressing enough information to give it to Sirius in book 4.

I think the other commenter is correct in that it has more to do with the writing. The tattoos are one of the mysteries of book 4 and if Harry saw the marks being addressed in the trials he saw in the Pensieve, or had Sirius say "yeah I think you're talking about the magic tattoos that all the DE's have Harry" then it would have spoiled the mystery.

Harry tells Sirius about Karkaroff showing Snape something on his arm, and Sirius has no idea what it means. Sirius, who had a brother who was a Death Eater, and was in prison with Death Eaters like BC Jr for years and years, had no idea about the mark. Either he's abnormally out of the loop or it was a well kept secret.

I'm also inferring that the Ministry doesn't know because Sirius was labeled as a Death Eater despite not having the tattoo. If it were as easy as finding all the people who had tattoos, the Ministry wouldn't have had such a tough time finding all the DE's.

**** Everyone knew about the skull-snake image in the sky because it had been used as an incontrovertible sign that Voldemort's forces had done evil in that place. What no one except true Death Eaters knew until the 4th book was that they had a mark on their arms as well.

Not a tattoo.

It was a raised scar that appeared as if the flesh had been burnt, and when it was invoked it would sear black, as if the owner were being burned all over again. Snape and Karkaroff were arguing about how it was getting 'clearer' as the year went on; this is interesting in two ways.

First, it suggests that the leftover scar didn't look like anything but marred flesh until Voldemort got close and more powerful, which made the lines and edges of the Mark more distinct. Second, it's interesting that it was changing at all since Voldemort wasn't actually doing anything at the time Snape and Karkaroff were discussing it but hanging at Crouch's, sucking down venom-potion and waiting. This may hint to another reason why Voldemort had to wait until the end of the year to steal Harry for the restoration ritual. In some way, he needed to regrow his influence before he could step up into full threat status.

All this tattoo business is a case of movie compromises turning into fanon; though, even in the movies the Dark Mark on their arms doesn't show up unless they will it, like when Snape and Yaxley entered the gate at Malfoy Manor.

EDIT: damnit now I'm conflating movie and book scenes. In the film, Snape enters alone and makes a swoop as if casting a spell to make the gate insubstantial. In the book:

#+begin_quote
  They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men's way. Neither of them broke step: in silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through as though the dark metal were smoke.

Getting a permanent tattoo that marks you as a criminal is one of the worst ideas ever, even though Voldemort doesn't act on logic, just on pride. If they had a way to hide it, it would go against what I think Voldemort's intentions are - after all he values DE's that stood up for him instead of lying - but it would make sense for the sake of the story.

**** Alas, considering the treatment many canon things received by the writer of that story, it is best if we don't think too much about his rendition of it and just let it be forgotten. It isn't a bad idea per se, I mean, it just really isn't something we want to think about in a thread about misconceptions.

*** On the tattoos, what do you mean partway through the second war. My understanding is that Snape became a spy for Dumbledore before the end of the first war. Is there some reason for you to believe that a) Snape wouldn't have shown dumbledore his tattoo and b) Dumbledore wouldn't have shared any information about it with the order. You specifically mentioned the order and not the ministry.

**** Sirius didn't know about the marks, and he was part of the first Order and the secret keeper of Lily and James, putting him in a vulnerable position. I can accept that Dumbledore knew, but he didn't tell the Order, or he purposely excluded Sirius (unlikely?). Harry found out about the marks in the fourth book and told everyone.

***** This is pure speculation on my part, but I choose to interpret Sirius as being incredibly unreliable for information on anything.

He spent 12 years being mentally assaulted, during which he said that only two things kept him alive. The ability to transform into a dog where his thought processes were inhuman enough to dull the dementor's effect. And second the thought of his innocence, which he was able to hold onto because it wasn't a happy thought.

It wouldn't surprise me if his memory wasn't the best even a year and a half after breaking out.

On the other hand, a fairly common fanfiction trope is Dumbledore's inability to share information, and I have no trouble buying that.

*** Dumbledore knew about Snape's dark mark so the order knew the existed
