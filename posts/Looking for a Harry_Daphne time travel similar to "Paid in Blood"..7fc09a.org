So, preferebly complete, but ongoing/abandoned is ok if its 100k+. I've read a few like that, but what made me like this one so much was the extended universe and the Oberon/Titania "arc" and the sadness over Daffy. I think i've read almost every Daphne/Harry fic with TT there is, or at least, every one that I could read, cuz I can't for the life of me read massively broken english, like the one in "bellatrix second chance" I know the person isn't native (i'm not either), and he's actually translating his own original work in his native tongue, but english like that turns me off too much. So yeah, i've read a buttload of Daph/Harry fics over time, so i'm just trying if someone has a good suggestion on one that is good and i haven't read it yet. Thank for your help.


** linkffn(12384509) Is a lot like Paid in Blood.

*** not necessarily, but i like the theme, of those that i liked that weren't TT or dimension travel, a few of note are Honor Thy Blood, The Legacy, Saviour of Magic and there's a "new" one of about 2 or 3 months called No More Games, which should be a super!Harry, but its actually quite different from a lot of the usual supers i've read, most of which i hate.

**** I tried No More Games (Harry/Daphne - how could I not?) but abandonned it earlier than normal upon the goblins declaring him Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Flamel, which got my spidy-senses tingling fairly strongly.

***** Yeah, i know, i felt the same when he suddendly got 10000 different powers and such, but believe me, its not remotely like those crack!Harry stories, he's still struggling against multiple stuff and life isn't easy. This story feels like every crack!Harry should've been, extremely powerful but with opposition. You see it clearly by the end of the Triwizard. Try to brave it for a few more chapters, it isn't that trope of just bash/godlike/smartaleck so many ppl like to do.
