The purpose of this thread is to get updates on chapter progress for our favorite WIP fics.

- Authors can preemptively provide updates for their WIP fics
- Readers may reply to this thread with a story (or author) for which they would like an update
- Authors can respond to requests
- Readers can provide updates if they've heard news from the author elsewhere

I hope this thread isn't terribly uncouth. I understand that some authors may not like the attention or don't want to provide such updates. Please feel free to happily ignore this thread if your name comes up. We all understand life gets in the way sometimes, and we won't hold it against you if you don't respond.


** Just in case anyone's wondering, HP and the Untitled Tome isn't on hiatus. The updates for the past two years have been slow due to number of things, not excluding a working holiday, a disastrous love life, rehabilitation from major surgery, living with an abusive would-be domestic terrorist who tried to (I'm just gonna stop there), and possible long-term neurological changes from short-term but heavy recreational use of psychedelics.

​

Phew - well that covers the author's note that I always want to post but don't for lack of balls. And, erm, yeah - get at me if you've got any other questions, I guess?

...

Oh, yes, concerning Shadow of Angmar: The news isn't great. The next chapter is not especially close to being completed and I have not written anything in more than a month. I have simply found myself with less free time this year than I previously had, and while I often think about continuing the story (and often add new notes to my outline), I rarely find myself with sufficient time to both get myself into the correct head space, and actually achieve some noteworthy writing. I realise that these are excuses, and not especially good ones at that, but it's really all I can offer at the moment.

On the flip side, I'm always only one 'Good Week' away from a new chapter.

**** Hi steel,

Just want to express my sincere appreciation for the work that you've done on your stories in general and SoA in specific. You've blown me away with your immersive storytelling.

Whilst it's unfortunate to hear about the delay I fully understand that these things are of secundary priority. Hope that whatever's keeping you busy is good news!

****** I don't know if you're looking for feedback or not, but I decided to give it a try and, honestly, found my interest waning by the third paragraph. My problem was that everything is so incredibly long: the sentences, the paragraphs, the descriptions -- it's so bloated with information that figuring out what's actually important requires extra effort. Consequently, that made my attentiveness wander.

Take, for example, the third paragraph. At it's core, it uses Harry's office as a way to describe a little bit of his character and highlight the stature of his station. It's also very long. My question is: does it have to be? Are all the details -- like that he has portraits of his ancestors on the walls, the furniture is brown and shiny, or that his toilet has a propensity for chit-chat -- actually necessary? Does any of that move the plot along?

Then, there's the /way/ it's written. And I want to stress that it's not bad. There's a certain cadence, a pleasing lilt. But it's also very, very long. Almost every sentence, in fact, feels like it's filled to the brim.

There's, of course, nothing wrong with adding a long, detailed sentence every once in a while, but if that's not interspersed by smaller ones, then it begins to read like Dostoevsky on steroids. It's hard.

There's a really fantastic quote by Gary Provost that highlights this issue. I'll copy it below:

“This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals--sounds that say listen to this, it is important.”

Those are my thoughts. Others may have opposing views; that's fine. If my review was unwanted, I apologize in advance.

******** Well, getting a meaningful review on FFN is like finding an oasis in the Sahara: pleasing when it happens, but boy is it rare.

I just want to add that there's a lot of fundamentally good things: an expansive vocabulary, an obvious proficiency with syntax and sentence structure, and so forth. It's just brought down by what I see as a desire to describe everything in a way that could use a little tweaking. And that strikes a little close to home to me, because I was -- and still am probably -- just like that.

Thing is, readers have imagination. They can fill in the blanks; there's no need to explain every little piece of the puzzle. Figuring that out is still the hardest part of writing...for me, at least.

Also, FFN caters mostly to a crowd that prefers easy literature (and there's nothing wrong with that). But anything overly complex won't be followed.
