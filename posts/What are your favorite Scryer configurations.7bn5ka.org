**** not OP, but I exclude Hermione first and foremost. Most of the fics with her are stupid romance fics where she can't do anything wrong + she is the single most beautiful and smart witch in the whole universe. From this point it can be either something like soul bond at age 11 or some variation of good girl-bad guy romance.

***** Well, can't you just filter out "Romance" and possibly "Angst", but still leave "Hermione"? There /are/ quite a few good fics where she is the main character that don't at all focus on any sort of relationship. /Lady Archimedes/ and /Divided and Entwined/, to cite the most popular examples.

****** You would be surprised how many authors of these kind of stories don't label their fics as romance. And anyway, it's not just romance I avoid, but also 'perfect Hermione' genre. There is always a chance, of course, that there would be some story that's not bad, but then you can hear about that from other people.

******* Now that I think about it, the only fics I can remember with H as major character were the stuff of Starfox and Murder Most Horrid. I'm sure there were more but I don't remeber them, which does not invoce hope in me.

**** Essentially the list was arrived at by iteration. First I excluded the obvious male characters like Malfoy and Snape. Did a search. Vast majority of the results were still slash, so then returned to the search page and added more excluded characters based on who the "new" dominant pairings were on the previous search. Repeat.

********* actually no, at this point Scryer no longer bases slash tag just on the presense of "slash" word iirc.

It also takes into account what's in [ ... ] (and sometimes that misfires rather spectacularly)

*** Some clever chaps over at Dark Lord Potter, or it might have been a woman for all I know but they built a fan fiction search engine. Its not perfect but if you have an idea of what you want to read there is no better tool. While has filters like ffn it also uses words in the summary etc to categorise fics.

** I am not using Scryer, instead I use my own search app and for me most searches are:

#+begin_quote
  bigger than 60k

  exclude drama tragedy angst romance

  exclude fics with reviews/favourites > 2.5

  exclude fics that I have already seen and marked with any tag
#+end_quote

I really couldn't care less about specific characters and slash problem doesn't exist cause I only see any specific slash fic once, tag it and its gone from my search results forever
