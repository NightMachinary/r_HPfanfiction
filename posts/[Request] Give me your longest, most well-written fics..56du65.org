** linkffn(11793088) is one of the best fics I've read in recent times. I absolutely love the characterizations and a general low-drama fic, who is rare in Draco-Hermione stories. The friendships between the characters are portrayed brilliantly, the golden trio remain golden and Hermione-Lucius interactions alone are worth reading this fic for.

*** I read all of this over the last couple of days, and while it is fun and well written, it is definitely going under the label of guilty pleasure. I'd say it is the least terrible dramione fic I've read. It still feels wrong, but not as much as the other ones. I'd like it a lot more if the Malfoys(the parents more than Draco) did more to make up for their role in the war, but it feels like they don't deserve the acceptance they are getting.

**** Actually DraMione itself is a hard pairing to accept, unless canon has been drastically changed. Honestly I've always thought of pureblood mentality as racism, so it seems a bit like a rich white couple and son who believed in racism, constantly called the girl racial slurs would somehow make a good couple. But with a lot of fics there is the suspension of disbelief.

Because, he like turned 36 and was still in love with her. And it didn't even happen outright after the war (the relationship I mean), Harry waited a while before approaching her again. Like I said, It's fine to have Harry as OOC, but canon Harry is completely straight, if he wasn't, he wouldn't have been. This disturbs me, however. If JKR just did a better job with characterization, this wouldn't have happened. She gave him feminine responses to male problems, and thus, people thought he was bi or homo, when in reality it's just bad writing. I'm sure if he was, it would have been said in an interview, after all, she did that for Albus.

I make exceptions for fics like Murder Most Horrid, which is the only Bellatrix/Hermione that I liked , because the story is pretty AU, and it could work there. Even in that fic I ended up skipping over almost every sex scene. I'm up to fourth year in Saving Connor, and I will probably skip scenes here as well, but I think this series is worth it.

Not only that, but also, the fact that Lily would most likely not consider Snape in the slightest as a romantic interest, people think a character getting a slight redemption (not that big really, he is still a creep and a dick), and JKR's bad epilog (and writing in general) makes it so that he is the best character in the franchise.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. OotP - DH will continue in a separate installment. Future Snape/Harriet.

*** How much manipulative dumbledore would you say there is on a scale from one to ten? 1 being none, 5 being canon and 10 being robst.

**** Maybe slightly less than canon, actually, once the plot gets going. They take the stance that he's in the habit of manipulation but willing to change in theory, so there's a few cycles of Dumbledore is at it again and they get annoyed and confront him and he genuinely apologizes. And he does do something redeeming at the end. It's more of a focus than in canon, but overall a slightly more helpful Dumbledore. That help?

***** Yes, thank you. As I read more fanfic it gets harder to tolerate. Canon Dumbledore was competent(as much as rowling allowed), and didn't spend thousands of words manipulating people, and was great at improvising. From what you said , I'll probably enjoy the fic.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...

*** Does Harry cheat on his girlfriend/wife in this? Asking because of the "dalliance that ends in disaster" - i usually can't read stories where cheating/adultery is a major element. But if they weren't together yet that's fine.
