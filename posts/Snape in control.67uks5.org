Whenever we see Snape in a fanfic he is usually Dumbledore or Voldemort's right hand,but ultimately he answers to one of them.

It would be great if there was a fic where either Dumbledore and/or Voldemort end up answering to him instead.


** linkffn(Darkness Visible by plutoplex) does this. I personally didn't like some plot points or how many characters are treated in this fic but it's the closest to the whole amoral, independent, badass Snape trope.

The Snape in linkffa(Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor) is interesting and becomes independent but overall I didn't like this fic much because of Harry and Tonks's characterization.
