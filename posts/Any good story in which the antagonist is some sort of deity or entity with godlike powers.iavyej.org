I am wondering if you know any good story where the antagonist is a god or a person of legendary power. It can be someone that appears in the stories such as Salazar Slytherin or Herpo the Foul or an entirely OC as long as they are some sort of juggernaut who cannot be stopped through magical skill alone but needs to be tricked or outsmarted.

** Linkffn(a simple act of vengeance)

Harry, in trying to power up to avenge his family, unseals a forgotten god. Gritty, violent, woe-filled. IP, regular updates (i plan to have ch38 out this week).

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
