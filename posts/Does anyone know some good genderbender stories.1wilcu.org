Like Harry being a girl instead of a boy? Things like that. Thanks.


** I'll second Alpha_Wolf79's rec of Equal and Opposite, but here's a few more recs of my own.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and The Distaff Side]]

This is incomplete. But it's still worth reading. After the third task, Voldemort sends Harry to another universe, so he doesn't have to worry about the prophecy. Harry winds up in a world where everyone is genderbent except Luna Lovegood. It's weird, interesting and Harry meeting the girl version of himself is funny.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and The Spiral Path]]

I haven't read this myself, but some people seem to like it.

Heres the summary: "Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived][Harry Potter and The Mysterious Curse of The Girl Who Lived]]

Harry's a boy in this one, but everyone in the wizarding world sees a girl because of a curse. Entertaining and hilarious. You feel for poor Harry in this one. The author does a good job of portraying how a normal boy would react to being seen as the wrong gender.

** The Mad Mad Reviewer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] - Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. 77k words, complete.

** Here are two girl!Harry fics that are pretty decent. Neither is complete, but I don't think they're abandoned, since both were updated in December.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/422080/chapters/704262][Girl in the War]] by astridfire. "Who says you can't fight evil and be pretty? A Girl!Harry AU, starting with Rose Potter's first year at Hogwarts." This is pretty good, but sometimes Rose got on my nerves. It's still worth checking out.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621][The Never-ending Road]] by laventadorn. "AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet." This is probably my favorite girl!Harry fic. Don't let the pairing squick you if that's not your thing -- nearly 400k words in, and they're still not together! I don't think the author is planning on that until well after Harriet is of age.

And this is a girl!Ron. Worth reading if only for the novelty of the plot, but also pretty well-written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]] by Hyaroo. "We all know the stories that ask "What if Harry Potter was a girl," right? But what if Ron Weasley was a girl? Imagine that the first person Harry befriends on the Hogwarts Express is not Ronald Weasley, but Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first born daughter of the Weasley clan for generations... what might happen then? STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED."

** Alright this took some serious searching to find something decent. (I haven't read either of them personally but they come highly recommended so I'll be giving them a shot alongside you :P) alright firstly:

[[http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/girlwholived/info]]

You'll need to create a yahoo account for this (and be over the age of consent) but this is supposed to be excellent. A little on the "follows canon too closely" side. But the divergences (particularly Rose's druidess magic) are brilliant. Beware the squickness though, she's naked a lot due to how being a druidess works.

Number 2!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/]]

This one is...complex. Morally and thematically and if you're not at least 16 I'm gonna recommend you don't read it. But otherwise I'll let the summary speak for itself.

Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE

**** My pleasure. And it's basically a matter of creating an account with yahoo. Then you can access the material. Kind of a pain in the ass but it's a good story. Oh and I remembered another recently that I haven't read in years, but it was a cool guilty pleasure. The girl who lived by silver aegis. Last I checked someone else had taken it over. Still a cool concept though, if a little squicky :P

***** Silver Aegis' story was rewritten into [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived][a complete story]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/325962/Agnostics-Puppet][Agnostics Puppet]].

Seems like that happened a lot with Silver Aegis back in the day- he'd spork an interesting concept and then someone else would write a far superior version.
