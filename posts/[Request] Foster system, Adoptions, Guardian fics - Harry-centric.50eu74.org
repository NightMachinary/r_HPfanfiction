Hi all. Looking for any fics featuring Harry (preferably as a post-Hogwarts adult playing the part of the adopter/guardian/foster parent) that feature adoptions, legal guardianships, or the foster system. If there are no adult-Harry fics featuring this, then I would be glad to see a fic that explores the idea of the foster system or adoption procedures with Harry as the child-to-be-adopted. Thanks!


** I'm currently reading linkffn(Riddle's World) . Harry lands in other world and well, got place in foster house for magical children. Till now, it's quite a big part of this fiction.

** Young Harry: linkffn(7247199) Is the only one I can think of off hand. It's enjoyable and "frying pans, who knew, right?!"

** linkffn(Prince of a Dark Kingdom) has quite a bit of the second, but it's dead fic at this point.

linkffn(Dudley's memories) has Harry as an adoptive parent.

[[http://hpthemes.livejournal.com/12850.html]] is a link I found doing some googling

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** A bit surprised linkffn(Knowledge is Power by Robst) hasn't been listed. Mostly meets your criteria and is mostly well executed.

Like all of Robst's stuff, it's fluffy and low danger throughout.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.
