I've not so recently discovered that if I like a writing style, I will devour everything from an author. The HP fandom is huge and i've been reading for over 10 years now, but i barely scratched the surface. So i'm looking for authors that absolutely blow your mind with their writing style, regardlees of pairings.

My list: scumblackentropy on ffn Zigadenus on ao3 Lena1987 on ffn Nerys on ffn and ao3

So, what are your favs?

**** Philo - check out "Fate is a Four Letter Word". Mindblowing. After I finished it, I stopped reading fanfic for 5 months bc I couldn't stand the average fanfic. "Fate" is about a 40+ Harry married to Ginny, Al and James have graduated while Lily is still in school. A grisly murder happens. For the Aurors it looks like an open-and-shut case but Harry, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Snape quickly figure out that more is going on. Harry and his friends and family as well as old enemies must work together to catch the real killer. Murder mystery that keeps you glued to the screen throughout the story. Slash and a rare pairing that has most people run screaming for the hills, but this is undeserved.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4267422/chapters/9661617]]

Beren_Writes: This author mostly writes H/D where Harry is a creature of some sorts. I usually dislike creature fic but this is really well done and not over the top outlandish or creepy. I am fond of "Hecatemus". [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/620263]]

cjr2 - both "Sub Rosa" and "The Most Powerful Magic" are classics when it comes to Harry/Snape. Very well done. Some HP/SS fics with a 16 to 18 year old Harry can leave you feeling icky bc they describe Snape acting like a sexual predator and call it love, but not "Sub Rosa". [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/cjr2/pseuds/cjr2/works?fandom_id=136512]]

geoviki aka Duinn Fionn - an H/D author with many masterpieces. They are best known for the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/28580]["A Thousand Beautiful Things" series]], but this one is long. One of their shorter fics that I really like is "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/413571][One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This]]", so if you need something snack-sized try this. It is funny, absurd and really cute.

** JacobApples used to be. As he was the only one who gave Andromeda a fair Harry/Andy romance shot. Even did a passable Harry/Tonks fic. But I believe they've gone off the rails deleting their works then trying to recreate one of their fics to preserve it and fudge that up so bad that it turns a nearly 30 page 100k fic into a 1 page 60k fic. Still I love them for who they used to be.

The Black's Resurgence is probably my favorite. Theyve done a really nice Daphne/Harry indie fic. A Bellatrix/Harry time travel. And now are in the middle of a, if not closing towards an end, Tonks/Harry wbwl didn't attend hogwarts fic. I love their use of Arcturus in everything they do. A dark wizard for sure but highly honorable and willing to help when it comes to family. Probably the reason I enjoy their writing so much is they take highly tropey subjects and kind of subvert(?) them. If not subvert just kind of not go slapstick comedy where the comedy is unintended most others in the same category suffer from.

*** Used to love this guy. Then he went and abandoned all his HP stories without a word until he started writing Star Wars. Then for like a year and a half he said he was still working on the HP stories, only to delete them all and reupload elsewhere on a separate account since he just wanted to write Star Wars.

Already he's going the route he went with the HP stuff. He's just starting story and story without actually finishing anything. I can't believe at all that people still trust him to finish any of the new Star Wars shit he's got up. Isn't he at like six Star Wars stories with none of them near completion? Ugh.

***** I don't mind drawn out stories to a point, nor do I mind smutty stories because I have a filthy mind. But his smut is all written the same way, it's always straight up sex without any romance interwoven or different flavours, nor does he seem to skip it when it's not relevant to the story. Quick edit: with flavours I mean that when you have sex, personalities need to come into play, not every woman likes sex the same way, nor does every man. It always seems the same mindless animalistic sex.

Once again, this is my personal preference, I still think his stories have great story lines that could actually develop into fascinating stories.
