Hey guys, looking for a favorite story of mine I can't find again-it was a one off about Dobby as a senile old house elf, many years past the events of the books. Obviously slightly alternate universe, I believe written before the last book came out. I remember reading it about ten years ago, hosted on some nice, well designed and illustrated HP fanfic website. (Nothing like the text-only ones I can find now) Any help finding this piece again would be hugely appreciated, thanks so much!
