She cared so much about them. Mrs. Figg was dedicated to her cats like people to their families. Connect the dots, and you'll get it.


** Are they animagi?

No. Mrs. Figg is quite a bit more careful about her cats since she caught Mr. Whiskers spying on her in the bath.

** Eh, real people are dedicated to real cats like that. And I can't see what would motivate that many animagi to hang out with Mrs. Figg.
