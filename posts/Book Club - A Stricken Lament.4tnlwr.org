The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1277839/1/Seeking-Ginny][Seeking Ginny]]

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269724/1/A-Stricken-Lament][A Stricken Lament]]?

Also, I try to include a wide variety of types of fics. If you think there's a genre or pairing that I haven't gotten to yet and you'd like to see featured, let me know.

** Combines two of my most disliked things in fanfiction. Ron-heavy stories and Auror stories.

I gave it a try because it was in the book club, but I found myself very easily distracted from it after a few chapters. Not my cup of tea.

** I sympathize with this author, there aren't enough Ron based stories out there. That being said, I'm not sure how I felt about this fic, it didn't really catch my interest. The writing was good, but I think the plot was just not really my thing.

** The author takes /way/ too many words to do very little. The humor is hit and miss too. I've been following this story since the beginning, and while it does have its moments, it's meandering and rather wearisome at times.

That said, it seems to have picked up a bit the last couple of chapters. I hope we get a tighter story now, with less bullshit.

*** Thats an issue with a lot of stories. I've read a ton of post-battle fics that take about 200,000 words to get through the summer after the battle. It would be ok if there was some fast-moving plot involved but there often isn't.

One of the things I just realized about northumbrian that makes him so good is that he can do something similar (write 100k words that just cover a few months) and somehow make it incredibly fast-paced and engaging so your attention never slips.

** Sought out Trio post-DH fics after Cursed Child, and really enjoyed Stricken Lament! I love that Ron gets center-stage, and the plot definitely picks up in the most recent chapters!

  Harry's left him for a desk job, citing concerns that he wants his kids to have a father and his wife to have a husband. But that's not dissuading Senior Auror Ron Weasley from dragging the new Head Auror back to where he belongs: investigating murdered magical creatures and vanishing witches and wizards. ---Auror mystery, Harry-Ron friendship, and canon ships.

** I've been following this story for a few weeks now. At first it was a little dry, but it's really picked up [[/spoiler][now that Harry has been taken]]. I need to know what happens!
