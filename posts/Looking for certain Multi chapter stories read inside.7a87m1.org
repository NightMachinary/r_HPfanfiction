Looking for Multi chapter stories. Harry doesn't have to be the main character as long as it's interesting.

Doesn't have to be set in the Golden Trio Era.

NO bashing. Meaning no Dumbledore or Weasley bashing of any kind. I suppose bashing of Percy is fine, but no other Weasley bashing.

No Harems. No Incest. Any rating is fine.

Would rather have it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

If Daphne Greengrass is in the story I don't want her to have the ice princess/ice queen persona. I get annoyed with that view of her.

Harry can be a little more smarter or a little more powerful then he was in canon but nothing crazy please.

NO Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione stories.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash


** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle) this one is a slash, but for most of the story you won't even notice it.

This is a multi part story that is not complete yet, but the author has finished three parts (I haven't checked if part 4 is in progress yet) so you have about 60+ chapters to start with. Once the author starts a part he updates at least weekly and usually more often than that.

This story follows Snape and an OC through time and back. I won't say anything else so I don't spoil it.

Edit: a word

  In September of 1971, Severus Snape finds a forgotten portrait of the Slytherin family in a dark corner of the Slytherin Common Room. At the time, he has no idea that talking portrait will affect the rest of his life.
