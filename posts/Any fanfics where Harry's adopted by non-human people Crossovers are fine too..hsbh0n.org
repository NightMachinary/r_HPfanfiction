  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

***** It's a bit of a love-it-or-hate it fic. The technical aspects (grammar etc.) are very solid, the plot makes a good deal of sense in-universe, it's long, and it's complete.

On the other hand, Harry is OOC, überpowerful, and practically flawless, teaching Professor McGonagall a new method of transfiguration (that invalidates the entire wizarding technique and is far easier) on the first day of class. The antagonists are always outthought and there are no problems with the perfect, instant pairing. If you like those tropes, it's a great fic. If not, you'll probably put it right down.

I haven't read Harry Crow in a while, please correct any mistakes I may have made.

****** The same goes for most of RobSt's fics - technical execution great, but they're pretty much all "Harry is crazy powerful and Hermione's practically his soulmate".

**** It could also be linkffn(Harry Amidst the Vaults of Stone by NothingPretentious). Unfinished, and strange, but I like it.

  Following the fall of Voldemort, it is up to the Gringotts goblins to carry out the terms of the Potters' will. What will happen when young Harry Potter - halfblood, Parselmouth, curse-scarred, outsider - is raised in the stalagmite city of Underfoot?
