Fans of D&D and Dropout (CollegeHumor's website) have probably watched fantasy high and wondered what would happen if Arthur Aguefort was replaced with Albus Dumbledore and what chaos would ensure.

I'm pretty sure that Arthur Aguefort was written as a parody character who reflected Dumbledore so it would be pretty funny to read a prompt or fic which entertained the idea of replacing Arthur Aguefort with Dumbledore

If you're not familiar with who Arthur Aguefort is he is a even more eccentric and more insane Headmaster/Wizard than Dumbledore and if you are even the tiniest bit interested in D&D or finding out who Arthur Agurefort is I would recommend watching Fantasy High on Youtube.
