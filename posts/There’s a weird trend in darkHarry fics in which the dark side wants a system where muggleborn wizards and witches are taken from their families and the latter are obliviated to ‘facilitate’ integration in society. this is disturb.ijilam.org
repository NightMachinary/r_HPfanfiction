** Taking away the Muggleborns at the first sign of accidental magic actually sound like a practical solution, and one I would not be surprised to see proposed by the Ministry.

Since its creation, the main goal of the Ministry is to maintain the Statute of Secrecy. As an example, dragon breeding is illegal not because having a 10 meters long fire breathing lizard in your garden is a fucked up idea, but because they would be extremely hard to hide from Muggle if people could keep them in their garden. And the Treaty on Underage magic is only enforced for the Muggle raised children, since the Ministry can't really know who use magic in a magical household and the Ministry chose to let the parents deal with it, a kid like Ron would be in a lot of trouble if caught, but he would need to do a lot of damages before either being caught.

With that in mind, the Muggleborns are one of the biggest risk of leak for the Ministry. Taking them away and raising them in the Magical world would be an excellent way to reduce this risk. Add at that some examples like Harry and Tom, and you could even sell it as "Protecting our children from the bad Muggles".

Now sure, you could argue that it's horribly immoral, and that most Muggle parents raise their child well. But a society that decide to send their own into the litteral Hell on Earth for the smallest offence, and that look down on pretty much anything that is not a wizard, does not sound like a very moral one for me.

Pretty sure the only reason it was never done in Magical Britain is because big shot like Dumbledore opposed it.

****** I'm not saying that those areas don't do harmful things (although american media does exaggerate to an extent), I'm mostly just commenting that the ministry probably wouldnt interfere to that extent for muggle borns unless its an area that consistently murders children, which pretty much doesn't happen literally anywhere in the world.

Again to clarify I don't think what happens around the world is anywhere near excusable. I just want to make the point that from what I know of canon, the magical community is way too regressive to give a shit in all but the most extreme cases, and I don't think somewhere like egypt would apply.

As an aside, I think that you are exaggerating how bad egypt is. I'm inclined to think that accidental magic (if the community even noticed an instance of it) probably wouldn't be received all that poorly, because the circumstances and age in which it occurs would make it difficult to construe as apostasy or something along those lines. Furthermore, the cultural context of people in this setting (muggleborns and accidental magic having existed for a very long time) might lead people to chalk it up to a literal act of god.

**** One of the cons of this solution would indeed be an estrangement between the Muggle and the Magical world. But it's not like it's that big of a problem.

Even if the canon (where Muggleborn grow up with their parent), the average witch or wizard never interact with the Muggle world. Even Arthur Weasley (who, by his position, is forced to regularly go in the Muggle world) is barely able to function in the Muggle world and would seem extremely suspicious for the Muggles around.

In the end, for the Ministry, Muggleborn (at least the minors ones) are more dangerous than adult wizard because they are harder to handle. An adult wizard in the Muggle world would just look like a weirdo (dressed strangely, unable to use currencies, seem surprised by everything). In comparaison, a Muggleborn will fit perfectly in the Muggle world most of the time, but in the rare instance where he doesn't "fit", it's mean a case of Underage Magic (sometimes in front of witness) that has to be dealt with by the Ministry with at the very least an intervention of Oblivator.

Once again, a complete separation between the 2 worlds may bring some problems in the long term, especially the wizards not being able to follow the evolution of the Muggle world. But "Muggle studies" exist for a reason, and it could be an easy task for the Ministry to create a "Muggle surveillance office" to keep in touch with the other side.

Honestly, if you ignore the moral problems, it's not that bad of a plan.

Why should there be a pan American magical nation and not a bunch of local ones? Even if you instituted the SoS in 1692, that still leaves you with a bunch of colonial areas and natives. Why should they unify?

Why is it not dominated by the French? If you look at [[http://gorhistory.com/Hist%20110/NorthAmerica1700Map.png][the map of 1700]], most of North America is French claimed, and if you separate the muggle and magical world in 1692, it still goes to magical France, magical Britian, Magical Spain and so on. There is no reason for colonial independence in the magical world, especially given their fast communication and transportation methods. And these magical nations would certainly not give up their claims to various natives since no one gives up claims before, well 1945 at least.

So even if the people in Salem felt betrayed, that wouldn't apply to the other colonies unless it is a widespread issue such as taxation without representation.

Because again, government remains with their magical nations, which would certainly not give up their claims to even a grain of dirt because no one voluntarily gives up a claim, and given magical transportation, you can bring your power to bear much easier.

And war is unlikely to work since the French could deploy their entire might much earlier with magical transportation and the "America" colonies are most likely not united. And if it comes to war, a peaceful cooperation is unlikely to follow to say the least. Because there were actual French settlements south of the lakes and around New Orleans, which block a Manifest Destiny quite easily.

**** Pottermore Canon is "Representatives from magical communities all over North America were elected to MACUSA to create laws that both policed and protected American wizardkind."

That makes sense to me in how a continent wide government might be formed, if the wizards weren't overly bothered by their own historical nationalities and simply banded together from expedience. As for why its anglo centric rather than franco centric, I think that could be either the influence of the early representatives determining the overall appearance of the state, or a gradual transition as America has become anglo centric with the wizarding populations slowly following on behind. You could go with either explanation.

There's nothing to say that there aren't substantial wizarding communities in the US where French is still the language du jour, or some Spanish speaking ones in the South. That'd tie nicely into probable history, and be cool world building.

******** The mistake you're making there is to assume there was a magical French Empire, rather than America being populated with outcasts and exiles. There's no canon evidence for magical empires, you're simply assuming that where a muggle nation pursued imperialist goals so to did their wizards.

The fact is that there's no evidence what form the wizarding settlement of the Americas took. It could be imperialist as you describe, or it could be that the folk who felt they had no home or no opportunity in Europe fled to this new continent where there were no authorities, no prejudices, and huge areas of land that could be spelled into isolation without any consequences.

What we do know is that MACUSA was formed in response the Scourer threat as I outlined above. That is canon. And so we can look at what must have been the case prior to the forming of MACUSA in that light - as you say, if the wizarding population of the Americas was part of a larger, international Empire then the Scourers would have been no threat, and so MACUSA would not have been formed.

Thus it cannot be the case that America's wizarding communities were part of an Empire. They must have been isolated and independent, in order to be vulnerable to the Scourers. That is canon.

** I think it's also important to remember that much of the time, the actions that are taken in the story aren't the view of the author, and there are a lot of people who enjoy stories with disturbing and darker tones, nothing wrong with that, the same way people enjoy slasher films and gritty crime drama. I've been a bit disturbed how often on this thread I see people decrying the fact certain genres of fanfiction are written as "the characters would never act that way" when it's /fanfiction/ meaning a reimagining of a universe according to the story that fan wants to tell. Yet we never see this happen for mainstream media e.g. Breaking Bad, where the protagonist is a literal drug dealer/(at a certain point) mass murderer. Honestly my policy is if I don't like a fic for whatever reason be it thematic issues, grammar, pairings, or what have you, I don't read it. I don't review it, I just close the tab and move on. Yes it's disturbing and a lot of the dark Harry fics that do this will show it's disturbing. For instance, in Rise of the Wizards where this exact scenario happens, it shows Harry showing up to Dudleys house to take his kids for being magical even though Dudley grew up and changed, becoming a better man who regretted his childhood actions . Even in the fics where it doesn't show this as a very disturbing act, you also need to remember that narrator bias is a thing even in third person. Fanfiction is rarely a place where people express their own political views or beliefs, it's where people want to tell a story. I think in the end, very few people wouldn't argue that kidnapping children from their families /isn't/ disturbing, and that's kind of the point. The story is meant to be disturbing, because that's the story the author wanted to tell, for the kind of reader who enjoys reading about a dystopian society. Or maybe in the alternate universe that the author imagined, it could actually be a horrible idea to leave kids with their nonmagical family because maybe in that /fictional alternate/ /universe/ non magical people are generally horrible, especially to those who are different.

Fundamentally, if you enter a new world, with different history, customs, laws and norms at age 11, you are going to be at a disadvantage. The world can be as "accepting" as it wants; you will have to invest an inordinate amount of time playing catch-up learning new rules while everyone else is already playing the game.

Of course, that is only the best case. In practice, it's worse, because people are people and discrimination will exist as long as people exist, so instead of getting on equal footing eventually, to some extent you'll be behind forever. Aften seven years of schooling, your bottomline then looks something like this:

- You are lacking opportunities in the magical world (or are being treated as a straight-up second-class citizen)
- You have no education in Muggle world
- Your friends are in the magical world
- Your parents, relatives etc. have seen you only during hols for years and don't understand you anymore, even if you were allowed to talk about your life

And I don't know about you, but that sounds like a thoroughly shitty place to be. It's half-in, half-out for either world, really belonging to neither. If you then start thinking in terms of solutions, given that the above result fundamentally is due to entering a different world, you really only have three options:

- You somehow bind magic at birth, and leave Muggleborns in the bliss of ignorance, keeping them out of the magical world and allowing them to live as Muggles
- You take the Muggleborns at birth, and raise them in foster families, so that they have the same opportunities and face at least reduced discrimination on account of not being noticeably different
- You keep everything as is

And in the process of deciding which way to go, you will have considered at least the following items:

The welfare of the child:

- How to deal with dangerous accidental magic
- How to make the child feel understood
- How to offer a comprehensive education
- How to avoid the heartbreak of losing and growing estranged to friends and family
- How to avoid the heartbreak of never having known your birth family
- How to avoid lying due to keeping the child out of the magical world
- How to avoid lying due to keeping the child in the magical world
- How to allow for agency and choice
- How to offer equal opportunities

The welfare of society:

- How to obtain a steady influx of new magical talent
- How to maintain social cohesion
- How to assure secrecy and maintain the Statute

None of that is easy or trivial and I'm sure I forgot some aspects. Some of them are mutually exclusive. The ultimate outcome is the result of weighing different aspects and assigning priorities. I'll leave it to you which solution is preferable, but arguing that any one is a priori obviously superior is, tbh, what /I/ would call a lack of depth on the issue.

** As I understand it the Dark!Harry genre is defined as: In Harry Potter fan fiction, *Dark!Harry* is a shorthand for a type of AU in which Harry becomes a dark wizard and even in some cases a Dark Lord (Taken from [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Dark_Harry_(Harry_Potter_trope][fanlore.org/wiki/Dark_Harry_(Harry_Potter_trope)]]))

Now as an author of Dark!Harry fan fiction I can only guess why some authors do somethings. I'm not going to comment on the "disturbing" aspects of it because honestly it's one of the more tamed things I've seen some people write. I can already see the random commentator "But that doesn't excuse it or make it any less disturbing!!!" my answer is yes it does for me at least. I've seen some pretty horrible shit that some people wrote and kidnapping kids is by far the least disturbing aspect of it. "Does that mean you read really crazy stuff?" No I stumbled upon it and quit it when I saw that shit.

  Why would Harry, raised by muggles, ever think that taking muggleborn children from their families and putting them in wizarding orphanages would benefit the kids and the society?
#+end_quote

Preface, I've never used this trope, I've seen it done before and the usually thought process has something do with Harry being abused by muggles. Using that abuse Harry/Snape/Lucius/Voldemort come up with plan that okay we can't kill all muggleborns, maybe we can just take them from muggles so that all wizards are raised in wizard society and culture. It's often an easier way to stop the "dark side" from eradicating all muggles and muggleborns. Usually (in an unrealisitic tone) Harry/Hermione/insert random geneticist usually points out "Hey Voldemort don't you know that all muggleborns are actually descended from squibs" Then Voldemort/Lucius/Snape is suddenly changed "Wow I didn't know that Harry/Hermione/whoever I'm not Dark anymore! Let's not kill them all anymore! Let's just take them so we can raise them!" Now I've never seen them expressly specify the age they would take children, I always assumed it would be taken from birth with some spell that's stronger than the enchantments on the Book of Admittance.

#+begin_quote
  It's weird bc it's this perverted communist ideology that absolutely doesn't fit with the hierarchical, feudalistic structure of wizarding Britain (and Harry's political ideals in these fics).
#+end_quote

If it's built up off of a relationship of only abuse with muggles, I can logically see that a Dark Harry might come to the conclusion that he wouldn't want any child to ever go through that, and lead him to the idea of kidnapping them in a dark themed story I don't think it's out of line with that character.

#+begin_quote
  I guess this is just a call for writers to think about this muggle-dislike Problem in more depth and stop being death eater apologists. maybe the death eaters are actual racists (bc they are lol) and there's a whole larger community of dark wizards who have nothing against muggles or muggle Borns ?
#+end_quote

I do agree with you somewhat here. Even though one of my dark stories, does involve muggle dislike. I think most people choose the connection really because the two examples of Dark Lord's we've seen have both been muggle haters. There is the notion in the HP world that wizards have to live "underground" whose fault/ who is the reason for that? Muggles. So it's an easy choice to pick Muggles as the bad guy because if they weren't around wizards wouldn't have to hide. If they weren't around no "Mudbloods changing our laws"

In my own story, where the "Dark" will win, they will not kidnap kids but they will solve the "Muggle/Mudblood problem" and it won't be by killing all of them, that would be too easy. Especially since muggles literally have no way of ever hoping to fight Voldemort, dark magic, or dark creatures ever.

** I don't understand a lot of fanfics that try to portray clearly villainous behavior remotely, including a lot of dark harry fics.

The shift from ethnic cleansing ("kill all muggleborns and muggles those with the best blood survive") to a more cultural hegemony focus ("We can't let the muggle ideas infect our society") is one I understand. For one thing, ethnic cleansing has pretty much been completely refuted in the modern context, while forced separation and cultural indoctrination, while widely condemned, is a bit more modern of an issue. Thus from a social commentary point of view, the fics can comment on more modern situations. You'd basically be shifting Death Eathers from Magic-Nazi's to commentary on situations in China, the USSR, The USA, or Africa over the last hundred years.

​

Further, I think its safe to say that the system described in the books, if not completely unworkable in the 90's, would have collapsed completely by the early 2000's. It strains credibility to say that a secret like that could be maintained in an ever more modern setting, especially with the people who are most likely to cause a problem (muggleborns) being shunned and discriminated against.

​

The only way that would really work is with an extremely competent and powerful central government to enforce the isolation, but we also see in the books a very weak and incompetent government.

​

Now, imaging a system where kids were kidnapped and indoctrinated, it becomes a lot more believable that such a state could be maintained. There would be far less friction, and thus much easier to maintain even with generally incompetent government.

The one take i really liked on this was actually not a direct HP related item: the Magical Diary visual novel, which (if you take the wildseed (muggleborn) path) you end up finding out that wildseed's families are basically cursed to gradually forget about them / not think about them unless directly encountered. The wildseeds are not told, it simply results in a mellowing of interest in them while they are at boarding school. It was.... really disturbing.

*** I've always thought that the story had way more similarities with class structures based on wealth and genealogy. JK Rowling has way more experience with poverty than racism and British society in general has some obsessed with how distantly they are or aren't related to noble blood. That's why Blaise Zabini is a pureblood, because with royalty, being from another royal family is more important than being from another country. Lord Voldemort is another trumped up wannabe Lord who thinks letting commoners have power is why his family no longer gets to steal everyones riches. Squibs are like when old noble families try to create a heir but the child is born disabled and can't carry on family business. classism is often racist just because those who are classist are often racist.

the biggest nazi similarites only happened later in the series, Grindewalds whole thing smacks of nazis and Voldemort didn't have muggle registration as a plot point until DH.

on another note, I remember reading about some of these adopted children and how after growing up around nazis they were shocked to know they weren't German. Even if they no longer subscribed to Nazi ideology, there was still the feeling of being ripped away from their culture (for the second time in their life).

** Well, I mean, what else are you gonna do?

You're a wizard who has a goal: No muggles/muggle influence in the wizard world.

And you have a problem: Muggleborns are a thing and you can't stop it from happening.

And you have a complication: The statute of secrecy. You can't just leave the muggleborns flapping in the wind, /someone/ is going to figure out at least rudimentary control over their magic, and suddenly the world knows about magic. Or at least notice accidental magic.

So how do you resolve the problem? How do you keep with the program while dealing with the problem, taking into consideration the complication?

Do you just monitor the kids and later adult untrained muggleborns /forever/ and hope you don't ever miss any magic?

Do you just kill the kids and be done with it?

Do you figure out some way to curse them so that they can never actually do magic (and ensure that method will /never/ be able to be used against a 'real' wizard to squibify them)?

Or do you take the "humane" approach and ... induct the children into your society before they become culturally muggleborn?

Is it monstrous from our sensibilities? Sure. But from the perspective of those dark wizards and in keeping with their goals, it's one of the better solutions out there that doesn't involve a huge amount of ongoing effort and luck.

Muggle upbringing is inferior, we can treat them better and make them more civilised. No different from how mixed-race native children in Canada and Australia were taken from their families.

This is actually my headcanon for why Harry had to stay with the Dursleys, beyond just the protection. To prevent Muggleborn children being taken away, someone (possibly Dumbledore himself) had previously instituted a law that said children could not be taken from their legal Muggle guardians for any reason (as the purebloods would argue that any non-magical upbringing constituted abuse).

You do realise this is objectively true?

Assuming, of course, you actually want the child in the magical world. If you don't, then it's whatever, but let's ignore pureblood propaganda here. In that case, upbringing is (as usual) intended to equip you with knowledge and skills so that eventually, you can live in the world by yourself. However, this is the /magical/ world. How can a Muggle, who literally knows nothing about magic, including that it exists, raise a child so that it's well-prepared to deal with it?

Magical children growing up in the magical world live and breath magic. Magical children growing up in the Muggle world ... feel confused, possibly weird, realise they don't fit in because they are /different/, have no one to talk to that understands them and explain what is going on, and in the worst cases, get bullied or abused and endanger themselves and others with accidental magic and no competent adult magic user around to fix it. And when they finally do enter the wizarding world, they are behind, and face more obstacles and have less chances than their peers who lived there their entire life.

All of which sounds like the definition of "inferior upbringing" to me.

It's not like taking babies from families is a great solution, but then neither is forcing magical children to stay in the Muggle world.

**** Riiight... Being torn from your actual family is "objectively better".

Children need very little preparation to be able to deal with magic, as demonstrated by the fact that all the Muggleborns at Hogwarts get along just fine. You've been reading too much fanon where they're at some sort of disadvantage in terms of their knowledge. No one is learning magic at home before Hogwarts. In fact the wizards don't seem to be learning anything much at all, unlike their Muggle counterparts. In canon, the only disadvantages Muggleborns have comes from prejudice

Yes, things might be better if they received some information earlier to explain their accidental magic. But that is not sufficient to tear families apart by force and brainwash them to forget their children ever existed.

We don't make policy for everyone based on "the worst cases" where people are abused. Chances are they would have been abused anyway, just as many children in the wizarding world suffered abuse, despite their "objectively superior" upbringings.

At any rate, you have to decide what you want to argue about.

In that case, what I wrote is just an obvious extrapolation: it makes no sense that Muggleborns /aren't/ facing all the problems I described, making their upbringing inferior; which then presumably is used as justification for those characters that argue for the thread topic.

Note also that it doesn't contradict Canon, because our sample size is terrible and we don't even get much into Hermione's home life and possible struggles.

Conversely, pointing out that something that isn't happening in Canon makes no sense happening in Canon is a rather circular logic.

** It is disturbing. But here's the thing - it's something groups of humans have done in the real world. There are many instances where children of group A are removed from their parents to be raised by group B in B's culture. It also rather neatly solves a problem for magical society in that it means it's harder for the statute of secrecy to be broken, it makes enforcement of the statute easier for wizards, and if you're a blood purist, means even less Muggle influence on your culture.

I would be completely unsurprised if policies like this were in place in vast parts of the canon series's wizarding world. MACUSA stands out as possibly having had laws like this, at least historically. In some parts of the real world such laws would be the compassionate and sensible response to Muggle born children - there are places where today, children accused of witchcraft are killed.

In the context of the UK and Ireland, yeah it's obviously unethical. But the thing is, the central premise is sound. I could see it happening even in Britain and Ireland where things seem fairly permissive in that you can marry muggles and Muggle born children live with their parents.

Canon gives us a 'registration commission' and the idea that Muggle borns 'steal' magic. I could see a 'moderate' voice arguing that removal of magical children from Muggle homes to be raised as wizards is a better solution, because in our own history, 'moderate' and 'progressive' voices argued literally that.
