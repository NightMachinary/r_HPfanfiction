There are so many things in OOTP that I would love to see work out differently. For instance, what if Harry actual opened his gift from serious and USED THE FREAKING MIRRORS?! Not that I'm bitter about that or anything. Anyway, for some reason I am in the mood for some alternate OOTP fics if anyone has any to recommend.


** You mean like in the end of the chapter 5 of “A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14041326)? And no, it is not complete rewrite of OOTP.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

**** That sounds like it may be more parody than I am wanting, but I will definitely check it out. Thanks!
