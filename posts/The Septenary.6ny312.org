** *Summary:*The Order? Destroyed. The Ministry? In shambles. Voldemort? Lording over Britain. But, Harry refuses to accept this reality. Long forgotten and plenty dangerous, he approaches the Gate.

This is a largely AU story about an older Harry. That's about all I can say without spoiling the plot.
