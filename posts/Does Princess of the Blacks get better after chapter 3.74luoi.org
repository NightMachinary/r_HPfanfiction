I honestly can't suspend my disbelief anymore. These people are joking about pedophilia and acting like it's not that big of a deal. Tonks says fucked up things, Andromeda seems fine with Narcissa's pedophilia, and Sirius got over his disgust pretty quickly it seems, seeing as he's joking about it now.


** yeah I could never get past the casual pedophilia myself, it was a huge gross-out factor for me, and I'm amazed at how popular and recommended it is solely for that reason tbh

*** I don't even consider it the worst part of the story. Sure, it's gross and everything, but it annoyed me more that the author didn't utilize it in the plot in /any/ meaningful way.

Imagine yourself planning out this story: "Okay, so, the Dursleys abandon Jennifer. She ends up in A) an orphanage, B) a foster home, C) a child brothel. Whatever, lets go with C." It reads that this is how much thought the author invested into it.

If anything, the /casual/ way he treats pedophilia is more disgusting than the pedophilia itself. You can't include such a controversial, inflammatory plot device and then for one million words treat it as an afterthought. It's just insulting to the reader.

I have nothing against indulging in such a heavy topic, but that fic just does it wrong in every kind of way. I just can't read a story where I have to pretend the first three chapters didn't happen.

A mediocre plot, an abudance of author fiat in keeping the protagonist powerful, terrible characterization (they might as well be made out of cardboard, for how one-dimensional the characters are), decent pacing and technical aspects. There is some saving grace in the wider wizarding lore the author has cultivated (truthfully, the only thing that kept me reading).

There are so many times when things are poorly explained that it makes things confusing (I loathe when plot/whatever are being blatantly glossed over in order to keep the reader in the dark, it just screams "don't look behind the curtain"). The pedophilia thing just felt like a cheap shock, and really needed to be handled better considering its seriousness.

** I really couldn´t get over the pedophilia shit, and what really annoyed me about it, was the Authors attitude about it, like we should accept this as some little weird detail and anyone who is disgusted by it, is just a snowflake who can´t take a dark story, I feel like this was just a lame attempt at being edgy. I really can´t see how this story got so popular, well except that it is in a very specific niche, but even in that niche there are better stories.

** Honestly, your enjoyment of that fic depends pretty much entirely on your tolerance for squick. Aside from the shit you've already seen, the main character does some /seriously/ evil things, including sacrificing random muggles for rituals. I'd compare it to A Clockwork Orange. If you liked that book/film, you can probably handle Princess of the Blacks. If not, I'd skip it.

** Yes and no. The world-building is good, and the conflict and action set pieces are also pretty great. It's got one of the better Voldemorts in fanon (sane and very dangerous).

The characters though are swing and miss. Jen's friends (except for Luna, Tracey, and Susan) are all the same character (they have no characterization beyond they're her friends). The Black Family is filled with pedos, bestiality and other creepy shit, and it plays little part in the story, so its just there for shock value. Dumbledore is a dumb stupid FOR THE GREATER GOOD caricature. Death is pretty cool. The other side characters (Amelia, Marchbanks) are just there to make Jen's school enemies (Dumbles and Danny Potter) look dumb. And Jen...

I'm split on Jen. She's cool. Has cool powers. But is too powerful? The only characters that can fight her equally are Voldy and a White Wizard in the 3rd book. Also the gods or Powers. But even so, I do sorta like her. She's not a perfect Mary Sue. She's got issues, moral qualms, shit she works through. I don't like the fact she's a stepford smiler.

There's also inconsistencies. Her Raven plays a big part in the early story, but then disappears in later books. Other plot threads are introduced and ignored entirely.

In all, as a piece of fan fiction, it's better than 90% of the stuff out there. The grammar is solid, and the plotting at least follows some semblance of logic. As a piece of fiction, it's average. Not wholly bad, but not great.

** I enjoyed Princess of the Blacks when I first started reading it. I could easily ignore the pedophilia of Narcissa and some of those other things. (They just don't faze me). The story is a bit depressing, and Jennifer is /evil/. Though I still rooted for her and sometimes despised her. To me she was semi-well-written, though I eventually quit the story for reasons I can't remember.

** I 100% understand where everyone comes from when they say they don't like this story. It's squicky right off the bat and unapologetic about it, like a stranger ripping off a band-aid fast. Yea, taking it off quickly will probably hurt less in the long run but your immediate reaction, "dude, wtf who are you?"

I love this story but one of the criticisms I have with it is that it does little to create a relationship between author and reader before it dives head first into the uncomfortable stuff. Since I have no suggestions on how to rewrite it to be better, I'll just leave it at that rather than overly criticize.

The thing is, it isn't supposed to be a 'nice' story and Jen isn't supposed to be a 'good' character. This is a story about an girl who does evil unapologetically for the sake of herself (and eventually her family and close friends.) She is only nominally the Hero. The only reason I've come to love her as a character is because I've spent nearly the entire four books reading from her perspective. If I were reading from Danny's I'd probably like him more than Jen.

And speaking of perspective, that's a huge thing in this series. The good guys aren't suddenly all bad people or abusive and hateful. They just look that way from a certain perspective i.e. Jen/Serious. From Jen's perspective, the "Light" is a bunch of incompetent limp noodles because they're civilians trying to act like aurors without the backbone to do what, in her eyes, is necessary. To Serious, the Potters never truly loved or cared for Jen because they did, they would have kept her even if she was a squib. To the Potters, they loved Jen dearly but didn't want her growing up in a world where being a squib would cause nothing but hardship for her, thus they thought living with the Dursleys would be a good idea. Jen is a malicious, murdering lier who needs to be stopped at any and all opportunities possible to Hermione. Tracy Davis considers Jen a good friend with a questionable moral compass but with good intentions.

I'm getting somewhat off topic.

Look, I don't know how SW could have done it better but all the squick at the beginning does serve a purpose. Like jumping right into cold water, it lets you know immediately that its not going to be a 'nice' story. It's going to delve into voodoo, black magic, torture and murder. It's going to be a story about Evil vs a lesser evil. I agree that the Blacks shouldn't have been so flippant with all the sexual deviancies but since I don't know a way he could have better handled it, I won't overly criticize SW. That scene did however establish Serious, for all that he is, is still a Black and family comes first. His big motivator is revitalize the Black family and try to take it in a different direction from its past. Also, Narcissa isn't immediately forgiven for her pedophillia, in fact its mentioned a number of times that the other members simply choose to keep it "out of sight, out of mind."

I'm rambling again. What I'm trying to say is, this story is polarizing from the get go, yes. It is, however, one of the best stories I've seen in handling alternate character interpretations through varying perspectives. It's got the best exploration of magic I've seen, you can tell the author has put tens of hours into researching things like voodoo, ancient gods and myths, divination/astrology. The world building is fantastic, consistent, and just plain interesting. Everything has an explanation, why Jen was considered a squib, why Elsie ever picked her up in the first place, yada yada.

I'm going to end this here before I ramble again but I just want to say one last time that if you're going to read the story, you need to read it from Jen Black's perspective, not yours.

That's the problem. I don't want to read it from a perspective of someone who finds child rape okay. All those other things don't matter if I can't relate to any of the characters.

That's somewhat hard to do when you haven't gotten passed chapter 3. Look, start at chapter 6, that's about an hours read and starts the Hogwarts arc. You might miss some information but it can be mostly filled in through context. From there, I think you might start to like it enough to come back and read the read the first few chapters without immediately squicking.

edit: "That's the problem. I don't want to read it from a perspective of someone who finds child rape okay." She doesn't. In fact she has a special place for rapists in her voodoo rituals. Her world view has just been so fucked that she grew up believing that the brothel was safer for the kids than child protective services, no small thanks to the Dursleys.

** Andromeda had known about Narcissa's pedophilia for more than a decade by the start of the story, and iirc all of the Blacks had some rather odd fetishes. (Sirius fucking dogs in Hogsmeade, Andromeda "knowing far more about her parents sex lives than any teenager wants to", and Nymphadora changing gender mid-coitus)

As for Sirius? I'd call it a combination of "nope not dealing with that" and repression. Start of the first story, he's just happy to get his goddaughter back.

Also, traditionally dark family. I'm pretty sure that Narcissa doesn't actually consider Muggles to be human, so it isn't child abuse. ಠ_ಠ Elements of that culture might still effect the rest of the family's decisions.

So, there are a variety of reasons things move past the horror so quickly. Author Fiat is one of them. But that doesn't mean that it has to completely kill your suspension of disbelief.

Edit: Also worth noting that one of the main themes of the series is "no one gives much of a fuck about Muggles". Not Dumbledore, not the Order, and barely the Muggleborn themselves.

***** You can not seriously be comparing bestiality to pedophilia. No dogs walked away traumatized from Sirius's actions, not likely at least. It's completely different things. Unlike muggles, dogs actually are animals. Pedophilia involves little fucking children who are going to grow up likely traumatized, who are so much more complex than dogs. While it's fucked up and really strange, it's not anywhere near as bad as pedophilia. I really don't get how anyone can think that it's roughly the same. You're comparing an animal that'll live a decade or so, that won't be traumatized and super fucked up from another dog fucking it, to freaking children.
