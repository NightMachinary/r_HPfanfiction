"Excuse me! Would you happen to know where Platform 9 3/4 is?" Harry asked.

A man and a woman, who he assumed were the mother and father, turned to him.

The mother said with a kind smile, "Oh! You're looking for the Platform as well? So are we. You must be a wizard like Paddington here"

The parents, along with the grandmother, the son, and the daughter, parted away for the mentioned person. To Harry's absolute shock, he was met with the sight of a short, brown bear standing upright. It wore a red hat and a blue coat.

To his further shock, the bear greeted kindly "Good morning! My name is Paddington."

A talking.... bear?

It felt like an eternity for Harry to before he got a hold of himself and greeted back.

"M-my name is Harry, Harry Potter. How do you do?"

"I'm doing splendid, and excited to go to Hogwarts. A magic school... doesn't it sound amazing?" Paddington said with a smile and wonder in his eyes.

Harry couldn't help but smile as well.

"Yes. It Does."

****** Yay! I need something to keep me busy make me feel productive anyways, so no problem! I have only one request if you go through with writing it: I was doing beta work for this guy's Haphne fic, and 3 chapters in he just straight up forgot about me or something. Stopped sending me stuff. I checked out the fic on ao3, and he was still posting. I sent him my revision of chapter 4, and got no response. I would prefer if that didn't happen again. So yeah, totally happy to help, just please don't ghost me lol.

** This is good, but my headcanon is that there is Shoppe for the Youngest Witches and Wizards of Frederick August Otto Schwarz with direct import from the Ravensberg Hills in the Diagon Alley. The fun part is to imagine what kind of toys you would create if you had magic at your disposal. Talking slightly autonomous teddy bear is just too obvious idea, so my theory is that Paddington the Bear (from the fairy-tale) was just one such teddy bear who was lost to a Muggleborn child at the Paddington Station, and whole fairy-tale and book were just attempts to cover-up its existence by the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.
