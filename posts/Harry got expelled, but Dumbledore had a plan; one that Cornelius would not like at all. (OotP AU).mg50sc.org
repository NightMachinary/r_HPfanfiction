So the Ministry wanted to play dirty, huh? Albus pondered in his office, still a little shocked that they really had expelled Harry at the hearing. The poor boy looked devastated, and was currently back at Grimmald Place.

Albus had been called many things, a hero, a powerful wizard, brilliant, but also manipulative, scheming, senile, and just about every negative connotation there was. While yes, he could occasionally pull some strings, most of those accusations were greatly exaggerated.

However, he rather did feel like steepling his fingers as he read Harry Potter's Defense scores.

While a bit unmotivated in his school work, he was a bit above average in every class. His practical work always outshines his written work, which was obviously not inspired. But in Defense Against the Dark Arts, well.

The fact that his percentage was higher than even Hermione Granger's was telling. While yes, it was only by a few, it was still very promising. Promising enough to take his OWL in it, and maybe NEWT if he studied a bit.

Looking back at the letter the Minister had sent him, he was gleeful to write back that yes; he had found a suitable replacement. The perfect way to hit two birds with a single stone.

After all, they had only expelled him. Harry could still take his OWLs and NEWTs, for a fee of course. And when he did, well, Hagrid was a teacher.

Why couldn't Harry do it?

(Harry gets expelled, and Dumbledore finds a way to keep him at the school by making Harry the new DADA proffesor. Umbridge would show up anyway, but as a lowly inspector she can't do too much. Especially since Dumbledore made sure Harry became "fully qualified" (in his eyes). He had some trouble with getting respect like Dumbledore, but everyone eventually settled.

He was independently schooled in everything else with the help of the staff and his friends, and was able to rejoin his year in HBP. But everyone preferred Harry's methods over Snape lol.)

Harry gets good DADA scores, so I can see him getting fast-tracked through getting at least his OWL within the summer with a lot of encouragement from Dumbledore.

He's motivated to do it, as well - he spends the entirety of fifth year /wanting/ to be useful, wanting to be trained, playing that angle would absolutely motivate him to race through the material.

A NEWT would require some exaggeration, but hey. Fanfic.

I can't remember him performing any feat of magic extraordinary enough to parallel that. Also in sixth year Harry was not able to cast DADA spells silently. They were definitely part of the syllabus and not just extremely advanced stuff Snape made them do because McGonagall and Flitwick also expected them to do so.

To the silent casting thing, I imagine it would be more of a finesse, not a Strength aspect of magic.

We don't know much about Merrythought or Rakepick, so Quirrell and Lockhart makes 2/7. It could be argued that Snape and especially Crouch also weren't qualified or teach, not in the sense that they didn't know the subject matter, but rather that they shouldn't be around children in the first place. So at least 4/7 unsuitable hires.

I'm not sure I would consider Rakepick as Canon since she is in Hogwarts mystery. I have not particular problem with her but Hogwarts Mystery has several things I have trouble considering canon (as the PC fighting a Werewolf during his 2nd year as an example) and I tend to pretty much ignore everything from it.

But ignoring this, Voldemort cursed the post around the mid 1960's right? So by the time Harry at Hogwarts, the Curse had already been in place for around 25 years. Considering the "limited" population of the Magical World, plus the rumours about said Curse, it is kinda understandable that Dumbledore became unable to find any "suitable" candidates.

After all, every teachers during canon were either complete fools (Lockart), or people who had a specific goal in mind and didn't plan to stay in place more than one year anyways (Quirrel with the Stone, Lupin with Black, Maugrey with his retirement/ Crouch Jr with the Tournament . . .).
