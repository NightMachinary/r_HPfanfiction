Okay so not that long ago i was reading a fic where harry (MOD) is reborn as a banished daughter of black (I think like 7 or 8) and is taken to the orphanage tom is at and i only remember a few select moments after that. Fem HP stabs her grandfather in the hand. I think harry just decides to follow tom no matter what he does even if he becomes evil again.


** Some of that sounds like linkffn(Fire Born by wickedlfairy17), but some of it doesn't.

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter

  When Harry and Voldemort died at each others hands, Harry awoke in an alley as a ten year old girl. Perplexed at this turn of events but not overly surprised, she is taken to Wool's Orphanage. Now known as Iris Black, she is roomed with Tom Riddle, who she decides to befriend because honestly, why not see how things unfold from the other side? It might be fun.
