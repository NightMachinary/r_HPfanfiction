*** Okay, so this is going to be a doozy. First off, let's get a couple of points addressed before I go to formulate my argument in another post-I do not believe that either side has the moral high ground, period. This is not due to anything particularly insightful regarding the material at hand. Rather, it's because the two are so fundamentally dissimilar that stepping from one side of the barrier in King's Cross to the other is basically travelling to an alien, english-speaking country. Let me elaborate on this:

Muggle Britain is a highly developed first-world nation with an economic base, population density and Infrastructure to match. It plays a number of important roles on the world stage and has, since the end of the second world war, undergone a huge number of extremely radical changes. It's also notable for being one of the few nations on earth that can honestly say to have centuries' worth of experience in fighting terrorism (Guy Fawkes et al were not isolated cases, merely so ambitious the government of the time couldn't sweep their idiocy under a rug like they normally did). Talking about history, Britain plays a central role in most of it after the 16th century. The rise & fall of the British Empire is one of the defining moments in modern history, after all. Most importantly of all, though, is the fact that Britain hadn't seen an enemy force large enough to threaten the population as a whole attack the country since the end of the second world war.

Magical Britain is a different story.

During the Harry Potter series, what we are seeing is a society still in the midst of recovering from a long & arduous civil war where terrorism, hit and run guerilla tactics and outright murder were the norm rather than the exception. These tactics, combined with the capabilities of assailants such as Voldemort (a sadistic insane genius) left Magical Britain in a state that feels almost gutted to me, what with the complete lack of actual magical locations outside of a shopping centre, the local red light/crime/murder district, a school and a small village on offer from a society that has existed for centuries in evidence. This is further compounded by how small that society seems to be based purely on the number of students at Hogwarts in the books hovering at close to around 150 at most. Consider that 150 students is 30 students smaller than the size of the average kindergarten in the UK.

Now that aside, there are several things that it does have going for itself-a functional economy, key positions within the ICW thanks to Dumbledore's positions as Chief Warlock/Supreme Mugwump, a thriving position in international relations (based upon the fact that the Ministry held two major sporting events-the triwiz and the quidditch world cup-on British soil in the same year) and a thriving business culture (though having most of their owners murdered during the war will probably have put a crimp on that) shows that magical britain's well on its way to recovery.

What we could be arguing here is two things-the individual ethical decision-making mechanisms instilled in entrants to both societies from the start (which Hogwarts, though at times questionable, still does a decent job at instilling notions of 'this is right' vs 'this is wrong') and the general moral ground the countries stand on as a whole (and though things have greatly improved, the last time the UK's moral high ground was more of an open cast mine that had just reached sea level is still well within living memory), but both fall short of a simple truth that makes this very complicated;

With magic, doing the wrong thing has direct and quantifiable consequences thanks to the existence of Dark Magic. So the rationale would be that any magic that doesn't provoke long-term damage on caster or target (brain damage, deformities etc) would not be deemed 'wrong' by magic and is, therefore, okay to cast on others when needed.

This may sound like a moot point really, but a society that has relied on magic as a distinguishing feature since its inception will be heavily influenced by this viewpoint-as long as there's no visible damage, it's reversible and, therefore, acceptable upon the point of reversal.

This being said, I am off to prepare my argument. Claiming the UK has the moral high ground over their puny magical tagalong society on a consistent & appreciable enough basis to actually win this argument is going to be a tough one.

*** FOR:

Due to the rather... confusing means by which one can argue for or against the morality of both parties involved, I shall limit my argument in the following manner:

- I shall be referring to the timeline taking place within the Harry Potter books minus the epilogue (1991-1998) and ONLY referring to that timeline as doing otherwise involves a nigh-complete lack of data when it comes to the actual historical events in the wizarding world over the past 300 years, not to mention a rather distressingly complete account of the events taking place on the muggle side of things at the same time (namely, the subject whose superior morality you are arguing for conquering the goddamn world and trying to turn entire landmasses into superprisons).

- I shall not be arguing the innate morality of the individuals present in either world. Rather, I shall try to limit my focus on macromorality-as in the actions taken by society as a whole in the form of legislation, economic measures and politics over the course of the allotted period.

- I shall note shortcomings in the subject of my defence and help clarify just why the subject of my scorn has chosen to act in a way that may seem reprehensible. In this case, though, I shall go above prior limitations and point out any historical similarities between the muggle and magical worlds with regards to things such as, for example, class discrimination. I will not dwell on these, though, as they are for erudition purposes only and not for the sake of the argument.

- At no time shall I point to a single factor as being the deciding example of the muggle UK being morally superior to the magical side. Doing so would be cheap and completely negate the actual value of observing the differing states of morality in either world, namely the degree of development a society has experienced as well as the degree of efficiency its denizens can expect when rising or falling to a position their skills, talents and hard work allows them to attain.

This is the driving reason behind the argument for me-with two societies developing in fundamentally different ways, with completely different founding principles and approaches to problems, illustrating just how good both are at discerning what is 'right' and what is 'wrong' is more important than saying this group is better than the other at doing that. Where my argument is satisfied is the point at which I can demonstrate that muggle Britain is more organised and thorough in determining right from wrong than its magical counterpart is whilst taking the differing requirements an ideal state of morality existing in either society would entail.

Simply put, I consider myself as having made the argument when I can say that muggle Britain is closer to a perfectly moral state than its magical counterpart is-or at least has the tools to get there quicker.

The points I plan to make are the following:

-Muggle Britain is not perfect, but it is working towards said perfection.

-Its system of checks on political power exist to ensure that the immoral actions of the few politicians out there that do abuse their position eventually end up regretting it.

-Its education system actually includes ethics & morality in its makeup back in the nineties.

-As a country with a long history of both championing and stifling individual rights, modern Britain's rocky relationship with applying morality to its inner workings generally trends towards the better... mostly.

-Muggle Britain, while no more inherently moralistic than any other society, does have the means to enforce its view of morality on itself-namely, law enforcement and institutions specialising in different aspects of right vs wrong.

I shall post the actual argument by editing this post later. For now, it's sleepytime for me :).

**** FOR:

The UK has a long and rocky relationship with the concept of morality. Indeed, the list of things that the UK has accomplished in terms of human rights and ensuring that its inhabitants adhered to a standard of behavior by enshrining into cultural & social conventions is long indeed.

The Magna Carta, for instance, was one of the first solid steps taken towards the creation of a human rights charter, something that the UK subsequently had a part in establishing at the UN in 1946.

A judicial ruling made by Lord Mansfield in 1772 abolished the practice of slavery in the British Isles proper, which led to the 1807 abolition of the slave trade throughout the Empire and, finally, the abolition of slavery proper in 1833-except for the territories held by the British East India Company, what is now Sri Lanka and the Island of St Helena, exemptions that would remain in place for the next ten years.

While not the first country to do so, having been beaten to the punch by 18 centuries thanks to Wang Mang (Xin Dynasty in China, 9-12 C.E.), it is notable that this meant that half the planet completely abolished slavery in one fell swoop.

Since there are few things more moral than to ensure the fair treatment of all people in the eyes of the world and since I do not really have much in the way of space to actually write up the history of human rights in the UK, I will simply link to a [[https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/history-human-rights][history timeline]] for those who are interested.

That being said, Britain is not, historically, a paragon of moral behavior or human rights by any means. Running a global empire is the domain of supervillains in fiction for a very good reason. The number of things the British did during and after their conquest of half the planet is abhorrent and terrifying in both breadth and scope.

For example, the British used [[https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp#The_British_Empire][concentration camps]] during the Boer War. Before the abolition of slavery, one of its biggest conglomerates included the British East India Company. These are but two examples of acts of absolute depravity that the British Empire committed. Rest assure that there are many, many more.

So while its history with regards to human rights is pretty rocky, the same cannot be said for the UK during the years spanning 1991 to 1998.

During this time, the UK played a role the [[http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/former-yugoslavia-and-the-role-of-british-forces][UN intervention in Yugoslavia]] in an attempt to stabilise the area (it didn't really work, but the thought had to count for something), not to mention the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_and_the_United_Nations][UN in general]], implemented the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Act_1998][Human Rights Act 1998]] and contributed heavily towards diplomatic efforts designed to curb civil and national wars from getting worse or even occurring in the first place.

Morality & ethics were subjects taught at schools & universities across the country. Though nobody could really claim or pretend that ethnic tension did not exist, to clearly discriminate against another was considered [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_anti-discrimination_acts#.C2.A0United_Kingdom][illegal]] on general principle.

In the UK of the nineties, any citizen living there knew they were entitled to equal treatment of anybody else, could be tried by a jury of their peers if they were suspected of a crime, had a degree of protection against slander in the press, the right to an education under the law and protection by the police and the armed forces of the country in case of an attack on their person or the country in general.

In exchange, they were expected to not engage in acts such as discrimination, crimes against others, resorting to violence as a problem-solving mechanism etcetera. If they ended up in financial trouble, they had a social security net that could help them get back on their feet if needed (which, okay, was far from simple to navigate, but it existed).

There were downsides to the UK at the time too-just because discrimination was discouraged didn't mean that it didn't exist-far from it. They were still recovering from an extremely difficult economic period that had yet to resolve itself. Social, cultural and political upheavals had dominated the landscape for over 20 years by the time the nineties hit and the fall of the Soviet Union brought problems of their own-namely a new source of economic refugees that were just as controversial & divisive then as the flood of Syrian refugees is to the UK these days (with the added drawback of having David Cameron being in power rather than a caricature of a far-right hoodlum screeching on from the sidelines) and the involvement of UK troops in yugoslavia and elsewhere was also a fairly divisive issue as well.

Of course, the additional ghosts of colonialist tendencies past had been fairly obvious as well-1992 marked the ten-year anniversary of the Falklands War, a war waged over one of the last pieces of colonial real estate left after the fall of the Empire. Legal action stemming from actions taken by British authorities & citizens in collapsing colonies is still a constant issue today, let alone 20-odd years ago when there were far more survivors finding themselves in a position to bring their former occupiers' actions to light.

Britain, though struggling with many, many issues both new and inherited, struggled to do the right thing back in the nineties. Overall, it succeeded. Not completely, but in general.

From a moral standpoint, the UK back then was on the right track-not perfect, but willing to do better.

Now, compare and contrast with Magical Britain of the nineties.

***** CONTINUED:

In magical Britain, large scale discrimination is a fact of life. Not necessarily just against muggleborns either, but definitely against werewolves, giants and other sapient humanoids that are very near, at or probably even above human-level intelligence.

As a citizen of Magical Britain, you are not likely to be given a trial by your peers if you are not a pureblood. With cases brought to trial before the Wizengamot (the magical british equivalent to the House of Lords, though details are scant in canon), most of the people determining whether you are guilty or not are pureblood members of Houses such as the Malfoys. If you happen to be a muggleborn and you are accused of committing a crime against a pureblood in '90s wizarding England, the possibility of walking out of the trial chamber free, be you guilty or innocent, is not the same as if judged by an impartial jury.

And if you do get sentenced to prison, you end up in Azkaban. Azkaban is, simply put, mental torture of the worst sort. A prison with conditions akin to those found in third world countries, you are imprisoned in the middle of the freezing Atlantic with only standard prison garments to wear-which, given the health impact such conditions would cause by themselves, would make them horribly illegal in virtually every western country except maybe the current US environment due to the already inhumane conditions such a description implies. But the wizarding world takes it one step further and has the grounds patrolled by dementors. Dementors, if they were known to the wider world as real, would feature on top of a very limited 'to exterminate' list when it comes to biological organisms posing a threat to human life. They feed of souls and negative emotions, mindfuck people into constantly living through a loop of their worst memories and will inflict a fate worse than death on those that they catch unawares.

The wizarding world uses them as /prison guards/.

If that weren't enough, the clear stratification and innate discrimination of society would seal the deal. Though the UK has struggled with the same issues for centuries, magical Britain's approach to dealing with it has been one of wilful ignorance rather than attempting to tackle the issue.

With two false imprisonments in canon, a slew of situations where discrimination has been shown to be widespread (especially with regards to Remus Lupin and, well, everyone who isn't an established member of society or a national hero practically since birth-though even the national hero bit doesn't prevent such issues from being apparent) and numerous practices (mass obliviations, use of dementors as prison guards, abuses of ministerial power gone unchecked etcetera) that would have seen everyone involved dragged in front of the International Criminal Court for widespread human rights infractions, racial and species discrimination, possible mass fraud etcetera, there is ample evidence that while morality plays a big role in casting magic, its application to the everyday running of the country is severely lacking.

And that's before 1996, by the way. When Voldemort shows up & kick-starts a second civil war (which he wins), things get a lot worse, including the implication of mass murder of undesirables, the transformation of the country into a facsimile of nazi-occupied Poland and the rampant collaborationist attitude amongst the members of the magical government that survived.

In magical Britain in peace time, the likelihood of you being able to find fair representation under the law is determined by your money and blood status-the closer in both you are to the members of the Wizengamot, the more likely you are to at least get a fair trial if not walk free outright. While services such as medical and educational facilities are free according to JK Rowling, everything else very much isn't. The way the wizards treat the muggles in case of statute of secrecy breaches (namely erasing memories and manipulating minds) is both dangerous and highly immoral on its own. Couple that with a prison designed to torture its inmates into insanity, a legal system that does not recognise the six billion plus other humans inhabiting the planet as people in the first place, active discrimination against people and sapients to the point where there is a separate department dedicated to exterminating them when the going gets difficult (the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, the blokes that hired Macnair after Voldemort bit the dust in the '80s) and a slew of other things, it is clear that the country has a very long way to go before the Dumbledorean paradigm of right vs wrong, dark vs light approach to classifying magic itself is applied to the country at large.

Before you cast judgement though, please remember one thing-magical Britain as described above is very much in line with what the UK was like at the start of the 1800's-heavily stratified, discriminatory, corrupt often beyond belief and notoriously lenient towards anyone with money & status whilst punishing even the slightest misdemeanour amongst the commoners with either exile or execution. The practical implementation of the ideas & ideals of people such as Dumbledore takes decades, centuries even, to actualise and turn into real progress. Though the state of magical Britain is dire, so was the UK's not that long ago. The sheer murderous immorality of the likes of Voldemort will only spur on change as witnessed in the epilogue where a halfblood heads the Auror corps whilst a muggleborn heads the DMLE as a whole-with the half-werewolf metamorphmagus the head Auror fosters actually survives past graduation day.

So whilst immoral to the extreme in the books, magical british society is on the right path.

A shame, then, that the UK wins simply by being a century or more ahead in terms of country-scale moral & ethical behavior at the time of the books. As for what the situation will be like on 01/09/2017 (aka when the epilogue takes place), well we'll have to wait and see.

A/N: Sorry it took so long. My initial one was simply too long, so I had to re-edit it. Then I lost it. This is my last-minute do-over. I will be hammered over this, so please bear in mind my post below. As for adhering to my own rules, well, I cut corners in order to write this during a 4-hour window, so please forgive any grievous mistakes on my part. Please comment on this, feedback is appreciated-even though it's a mess.

*** Sorry for the delay but here is my opening statement:

The Hogwarts House system is not only detrimental to the students as a whole, but also encourage like-minded sentiments to fester and ultimately corrupt the ideas behind each individual house.

The four houses of Hogwarts are as follows:

- Gryffindor, valuing bravery, daring, nerve, and chivalry.
- Hufflepuff, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.
- Ravenclaw, valuing intelligence, knowledge, and wit.
- Slytherin, valuing ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness.

This housing system is largely based off of the British housing system for their Boarding Schools. The largest discrepancy between the British system and the Hogwarts system is that students are randomly placed into a house upon enrollment in real world British boarding schools while Hogwarts uses an enchanted hat to place students into their houses.

It is stated by J.K. Rowling in Pottermore that the Sorting Hat does in fact use legilimency to look into the minds of students to best determine the house that they belong in. It is also mentioned that even -

"On those occasions when Slytherins behave altruistically or selflessly, when Ravenclaws flunk all their exams, when Hufflepuffs prove lazy yet academically gifted and when Gryffindors exhibit cowardice, the Hat steadfastly backs its original decision."

If this is the case, then why does the Hat not give reasoning for its original decision? The Hat makes mistakes, and those mistakes affect a person's entire school life and maybe even beyond. Let's take the Weasley and Malfoy families for example, not a single member of either family in their long history (both being purebloods), have ever strayed from their respective Hogwarts houses. The Sorting Hat barely, if even, touches their heads before sending them straight to the house their father, and their father's father went to. What if Ron or Draco would have fit in better in other houses? Ron for all his lauding of the Gryffindor ideals is possibly the least chivalrous student in his year, disregarding Draco Malfoy, while his "bravery,daring, nerve" either comes and goes depending on his mood. Yes, he came back during the Horcrux hunt and saved Harry but let's not forget that if he didn't run on Harry and Hermione, Harry might never have been in that situation in the first place. He abandoned his two closest friends, there is absolutely no excuse or recourse for that.

Harry is the seemingly perfect Gryffindor with overflowing amounts of bravery, daring, nerve, and chivalry. Or is he? For the first 11 years of his life (his formative years), he lived in a cupboard under the stairs, was underfed, was given a cruel amount of chores, was beaten up by his cousin, and I'm sure there is evidence in the books where his aunt and uncle physically abused him as well, even after starting Hogwarts. How on earth can anyone, after undergoing 10 years of that, be anything like the perfect Gryffindor. I'm still shocked that he never went into therapy for his childhood abuse. I strongly believe that if the Sorting Hat wasn't influenced by the knowledge of who Harry was, Harry would have been placed into Hufflepuff. He's worked hard his entire life. He's extremely dedicated when he needs to be (learning the patronus charm in third year). His loyalty, if given a lantern ring (from DC) based on loyalty, he'd be all powerful. He has never thought about using underhanded tricks to win anything. And last but not least, he should have the patience of a monk with all he's been through. He survived somehow for ten years under Durseleys' treatment and after all that suffering, he's given the gift of magic. If anything can teach you patience, that would be it.

Since the books are written from Harry Potter's perspective , most of what we know or can reasonably infer are from a Gryffindor's point of view. This is significant due to the outstanding rivalry between the Gryffindor and Slytherin houses. As shown primarily in the second and fourth book when Harry Potter was ostracized and shunned by his house for "acting" and "behaving" as a Slytherin due to his Parseltongue abilities and having become a Tri-Wizard champion, to act in a way unfitting for your house is to be both shunned inside and outside of the house.

This is a highly toxic environment.

There are either 1000 students at Hogwarts as stated by J.K. Rowling, or there are an average of 280 students at Hogwarts as evidenced by the book series. What this means is that each house has either 250 students, with an average of 36 per year group or there are 70 total students per house, with 10 in each year group.

Let's start under the assumption that there are 36 students per year group in each house. With the exception of NEWT level classes (6th year and 7th year), classes are primarily composed of either one or two houses. While the composition of these classes are supposedly random, Gryffindor is paired up with Slytherin the majority of the time with Ravenclaw being matched with Hufflepuff. There is also a discrepancy between the books and the movies concerning the topic of which house was paired with which in certain classes so some of the following might be false. By the time Harry and company founded the D.A. they had roughly four and a half years to get to know their peers. Assuming that all four houses shared classes with one another, along with a class size of roughly 140, there should have been both ample time and opportunity for everyone to know each other.

I'm almost positive that during High School, with a vastly larger student population than that of Hogwarts, each and every single one of you made friends with at least 150 people. Sure, you might not be close with many of them, but you do know their names or can at least remember their faces. As shown in The Order of the Phoenix, Chapter 16 "In The Hogs Head" -

“You mean, Dumbledore believes him,” said the blond boy, nodding at Harry.

“Who are you?” said Ron rather rudely.

“Zacharias Smith,” said the boy, “and I think we've got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who's back.”

This excerpt from the novels indicate that neither Harry nor Ron even knew about Smith's EXISTENCE at all before this encounter even though they shared classes with the Hufflepuffs for Herbology at least twice before this. How can you justify the house system when it isolates members of each house to such an extent that two members of Gryffindor house are unable to even recognize one of their fellow classmates? Sure, forgetting about one classmate out of around 140 isn't horrible, but let's continue with another excerpt from the same chapter -

“Is it true,” interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, “that you can produce a Patronus?”

There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.

“Yeah,” said Harry slightly defensively.

“A corporeal Patronus?”

The phrase stirred something in Harry's memory.

“Er --- you don't know Madam Bones, do you?” he asked.

The girl smiled. “She's my auntie,” she said. “I'm Susan Bones. She told me about your hearing. So --- is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?”

This is evidence of another instance where Harry has no idea who one of his classmates is. If I were to re-read the entire series, I'm sure I can find a few more examples of Harry and company having no clue whatsoever about any of their fellow classmates that aren't in Gryffindor.

If the class sizes were what they were portrayed to be in the books, then the argument against Hogwarts Houses is even stronger. Assuming that there are 40 students per year group, then that means Harry and Ron had no idea that TWO (most likely more) of their 38 fellow classmates (40 minus Harry and Ron) even existed.

In conclusion, the Hogwarts House system not only causes extreme isolationism between students, but also exacerbates a person's negative traits while reducing their more general ones.

**** I somehow lost a few paragraphs but, a Hufflepuff such as Cedric might not resort to underhanded tricks in a life or death scenario due to his Hufflepuff background while a Ravenclaw, even though intellectually knows that the odds of success in a venture might be 90%, he or she might not go through the risk due to not wanting their fellow ravenclaws thinking that they're ambitious as Slytherins or as daring as Gryffindors.

*** First, we have to consider the basic WHY of the housing system. Houses are in place so that all students have their progress monitored in an organized manner and a safe space when not in classes to live for the school year. With the sheer number of students a structured housing system is integral to the school running smoothly.

Consider this: There are anywhere between 280 (if we assume each year is the same as Harry's dorm, there is no more than 5 per dorm and 10 total per year, 7 years, and 4 houses) and 1000 (the number given by JK Rowling) students at Hogwarts. We know of 12 classes that have one teacher, so 12 teachers, plus Dumbledore, Filch, Madam Pince, Madam Pomfrey and Madam Hooch. However, we know that Trelawney rarely comes down from her tower, and Binns is a ghost, so they would not be involved with student body for the majority of the day and on weekends. Madam Pince does not leave the library, I assume, just as Madam Pomfrey would stay in the Infirmary. Madam Hooch as well only does the Quidditch matches and flying courses, so she may or may not be at Hogwarts full time. This leaves us 17 staff members (19, the years Hagrid was only the gamekeeper and Kettleburn was the COMC teacher, and the year Firenze also taught Divination, but Firenze would not be with the general student body.) Taking out the staff members that are shown not to interact with students (Binns, Trelawney, Hooch, Pomfrey, Pince), and I am generally thinking of professors who are seen in hallways or at meals who do interact with the students, that leaves 12 staff members to supervise the students of Hogwarts. This gives a ratio of between 23 students to 1 staff member (which is a good classroom size here in the US) up to 83 students per staff member. We know that staff members supervise detentions, have meetings with students outside of class, and have to have time to plan their classes and generally be humans and sleep for a few hours of the day. We can assume from this then, that the students are generally unsupervised outside of classes.

Out of these staff members, only four are in charge of the four houses. This can be between 70 and 250 students in each house, all of whom one staff member is responsible for. That is a lot of students to monitor, which is why as set up, the housing system works well at Hogwarts. On a personal level, staff members would not be able to give help to all students or manage daily issues with all of the students. Therefore, the prefect system comes into play. There are up to 6 prefects in a house, and these prefects are responsible for the well-being of their house-mates, ensuring their safety by enforcing the rules and regulations of Hogwarts and assisting them with day to day issues. However, because of the nature of the prefect system, a house has to be unified, otherwise the system will fall apart. If there is no sense of unity, the prefect cannot gain respect, and if the prefect cannot gain the respect of their housemates, then they will be ineffective in their jobs and the House will become more chaotic. The sorting now comes into play.

Now we think of the HOW of the sorting. We know that each house exemplifies several traits. Gryffindors are known for bravery and courageousness, as well as recklessness and daring, along with a desire to achieve. (Being the House of the main character, we know much more about the inhabitants of Gryffindor than the other houses, so I have more traits listed.) Hufflepuffs are known for loyalty, hard work, caring and protectiveness. Slytherins are known for their cunning, ambition, and self-preservation. And Ravenclaws are known for wit, intelligence, metacognition (thinking about thinking,) and a love of learning. Now, all of these traits can be either good or bad. It can be highly personal in how the traits are applied. All of the characters we know exemplify some of these traits attributed to their house, whether they be good or bad.

A wonderful example of this would be the Gryffindor trait of the desire for glory and achievement. We have examples like Hermione, whose love of learning strove her to be an exemplary student, Percy Weasley, who was very ambitious even at the cost of his family, Oliver Wood, who was near obsessive about his Quidditch career, and even Peter Pettigrew who seemed to flock to those who would bring him more power. These people are very driven to succeed, no matter the way this is achieved.

Another example would be the Slytherin trait of self-preservation. A large number of Slytherins were pro-Voldemort, not purely because of his agenda, but also because that would be the only way to survive the war. We also see the saga of the Malfoys throughout the books, staunch Voldemort supporters, they abandon and betray him at the Battle of Hogwarts as soon as their son is in danger and they have a chance to flee Voldemort. We also see two types of ambition out of Slytherins, the insane ambition of then Tom Riddle Jr., who killed and cursed his way to the top, and the laid back ambition of Slughorn, who used his position to gather those who were successful around him to connect with others and made a social network to boost himself up.

We see many members of houses that raise eyebrows. Quirrel and Lockhart were both Ravenclaws and at first, you'd be shocked because “they're not good people!” but they are both very intelligent and both pursue scholarly careers (say what you will about Lockhart, but tracking down these people, charming their memories, and writing books takes skill.) You also see members of Hufflepuff that may not seem “nice” or “duffers” like Ernie MacMillan or Justin Finch-Fletchley who were very anti-Harry at a few points in the story, however, you will see that they were “not nice” because they were loyal to their house, and protective of those within.

These houses may have many different people in them, who exemplify the House traits in different ways, but generally, the groups are fairly homogenous. Because of this the people in the houses get along better than if the houses were divided into groups by, say, by location of their homes. As a result, there is a better culture in the House and a good sense of unity, making the job for prefects and the Head Boy/Girl and in extension the single adult assigned to watch up to 250 students much easier. Not only does this system help the staff members keep the peace, but students are more likely to be similar when grouped by similar traits. This is helpful from an academic perspective, because learning styles would be more likely to be similar. We know this is not always the case with everyone, with Ron and Hermione's differences being a great example, but because there is this culture of unity in the House, and many different ages, we can assume that help for academics is fairly easy to come by at Hogwarts, without going to a professor outside of class.

I firmly believe that the Hogwarts' House system is the best system for the way the school is set up. Because there are so few staff members to students, it's important that each House has a unity and sense of community so that the school is successful. With this support system of students relying on students and not just the professors, it's important that there is this unity inside of the Houses, without it, students would not be able to adequately rely on having enough help or guidance at school, which would result often in lower grades, and even failure. The small staff of Hogwarts just doesn't have the time to cater to 1,000 students on a personal level.

Generally, most come out of Hogwarts alive and well and are productive members of the Magical society. Not only that but Hogwarts has been around for over 1,000 years, so we know that the system has been successful, as it has not been scrapped, nor have more teachers been hired. Not only does this House culture help form a sense of community in Hogwarts, but it carries on to afterwards, where the relationships you form and the bonds you make in your House will continue onwards, linking the magical community in deeply personal ways. In magical Britain, your house connects you to 1,000 years' worth of students who've stayed in those hallowed halls of your House and is a deep source of pride for many, encouraging them to succeed like their housemates before them.

TL;DR Houses help bring together a community within the school so the short staff of Hogwarts doesn't go insane.

**** Your first point brings up a good analysis on the ratios between Hogwarts students, professors, and prefects. Let's go with your ratio of 83 students per staff member as the 23 students per staff member would favor my argument too heavily. Assuming that the professors get to know their students, especially the ones in their house, they would only need to learn 83 new names per year to do a good job as a professor. In most American (where I'm from) high schools and universities, a professor is expected to learn at the very minimum 120 names per semester. Since Hogwarts professors not only retain the same students for up to seven years, but there are also only 83 new students per year as opposed to the professors in American schools that are required to know the names of at least 240 students per year. If the Hogwarts professors are unable to achieve such a feat, even with magic and taking roll call, is that really anyone's fault but theirs?

Furthermore, as shown in many fanfics - mostly due to one or two instances in the books - the house professors rarely if ever actually help their students. We've seen Professor McGonagall ignore the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione countless times when they try to bring something to her attention such as the philosopher's stone being in danger. Let's give her the benefit of the doubt and just say she had too many things going on at the time, what with it being exam season. Your point also brings up the prefect system which is an add-on to the house system where the six prefects of each house are meant to be "responsible for the well-being of their house-mates, ensuring their safety by enforcing the rules and regulations of Hogwarts and assisting them with day to day issues." Have we seen a single instance of a prefect helping anyone with the exception of Hermione? I can't think of any off the top of my head but if you can elucidate me, I'd be grateful.

So out of the 24 prefects of Hogwarts, a head boy and a head girl, along with the 11 staff members (minus one for Delores Umbridge), are we really supposed to believe that no one noticed a good portion of their students or housemates having been tortured with a blood quill? I'm not sure if I'm recalling this from the novels or a fanfic but, one of the only instances (with the exception of 3 protagonists) of a student helping another with the aftereffects of the blood quill were Fred and George comforting one of the Creevey brothers.

If everyone is so seemingly ineffectual, then why not do away with the system completely and implement a new one?

I quote the following passage from you -

" These houses may have many different people in them, who exemplify the House traits in different ways, but generally, the groups are fairly homogeneous. Because of this the people in the houses get along better than if the houses were divided into groups by, say, by location of their homes."

Yes, the groups are fairly homogeneous but you forget, what if you do not conform to the standard of the house as in the case of Luna Lovegood? Would she not have had gotten better along with others such as Ginny and Colin? In a group where everyone is the same, those who are not are either ostracized or simply thrown out. As you yourself said, people exemplify the house traits in different ways. What would happen if for example, Harry exemplified the trait of chivalry, but had no bravery to speak for. Would he be bullied by his housemates (who exemplify bravery but not chivalry) for his lack of bravery?

A hodgepodge group of students with varying personality traits would better compliment each other in their endeavors. As seen with the DA and the events of the seventh novel, a Hogwarts united is a near impenetrable fortress. However, if the entire student population were replaced with solely Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, Slytherins, or Gryffindors, they would not have stood a chance against the Death Eater army. It takes a mix of cunning, bravery, hard work, and intelligence to truly be a force to be reckoned with.

Generally, most come out of Hogwarts alive and well without any real skills whatsoever. A group of Hogwarts students can either match or better a group of Hogwarts graduates. The books show that after graduation, most wizards and witches do nothing to better themselves in either magical education or worldly knowledge. Furthermore, the community between fellow housemates is nearly non-existent as seen with how most people only have one or two actual friends. The house system not only isolates members of differing houses from each other, but also isolates those from within from those in their own house. For example, the books with the exception of Cedric, never mention a person hanging out with more than two other people. The rule of thumb is that everyone in Hogwarts is either in a duo or a trio. Fred, George, Lee Jordan. Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson. Draco Malfoy, Gregory Goyle, Vincent Crabbe. Cho Chang, Marietta Edgecombe. The list goes on.

The Hogwarts house system is not only outdated, but ultimately inefficient. With 24 prefects, 4 heads of house, and 8 other staff members, that comes out to roughly 27 students per overseer. This is neither too little or too many for any one person to handle but even so, we have no evidence of any actual benefits of such a system.

*** Where do we comment/ask questions? I'll just do it here.

For [[/u/orangekayla]]:

I feel that you not adequately counter your opponent's assertion that the House System is "toxic." I understand your argument of House Unity and camaraderie, but must the students necessarily be /sorted/ as in canon in order to have that spirit of cooperation, as opposed to random selection e.g. in many colleges?

**** I think the sorting allows people with not only similar traits, but similar opinions of traits that are important to them, to come together. With random sortings, you would have people who value cunning together with people who favor bravery, which might cause clashes, not only on the surface, but deep disagreements about core values. This could cause some serious rifts among house members and infighting.

***** Would you not say, especially with the awarding of the house-cup each year, that the members of each house would become inclined to staunchly support the characteristics of their house to an extreme? Would you not agree that a truly balanced person is someone that exemplifies the traits of all four houses?

By sorting students based on their beliefs at the age of eleven, a time where most children do not have any pre-conceived notions of their own but rather their parents, would that not lead to bigotry and the like? For example, each year when either Slytherin or Gryffindor win the house-cup, they are given a sense of proof that their individual house aspects are better than the other three.

Your point with clashes or deep disagreements about core values is well made but wouldn't you agree that after the initial clashes between eleven to seventeen year olds that the group as a whole would benefit and incorporate elements from all four houses instead of just one?

Surely you cannot mean to say that focusing on solely cunning or bravery is better than being well grounded in all four aspects.

****** You have to consider what I mean by core values to get my point. At age 11, children will know right from wrong, and will know what is most important to them. There are certain personality traits that will be with them forever, and putting a bunch of clashing 11 year olds for most of the day for an entire school year would spell chaos.

Had there been more of an outside influence to encourage the children beyond Hogwarts, that may have quelled clashes inside a house. Think of it this way: first and second years do not go to Hogsmede, so they do not leave the school except on breaks. Most of that time is spent with their houses, and as I argued before, largely unsupervised in down time. If you put together a large group who have different learning styles, personalities, and core values, there will be discord.

I will say, it is a shame for the odd one that does not fit in, but for the majority, this system works, and with how many children go through Hogwarts, I think it is the best system.

******* At age 11, children will know what will get them in trouble with their teachers and what won't. They will definitely not know right from wrong if their peers nearly double their age don't. For example, the Marauders at the age of 15-16 during their OWL year consisted of future head-boy (James) and a prefect (Remus) and felt that it was okay for them to bully Severus as a form of entertainment. From both the books and the movies, we see that there is a size-able group of students watching the four and cheering them on as they humiliated Snape. Is this right? No, no it is not and cannot be argued as such.

Yes, it is a shame that Snape didn't fit in with the majority of the school. It's a shame that he was placed in Slytherin which made it okay for three-fourths of the school to target him as the subject of their bullying. This system works. It works so well that out of the thousands of Hogwarts graduates there were at most fifteen who actively opposed Voldemort and didn't act as, pardon the cliche/trope phrase, "sheep."

At the age of eleven, most children make friends with those around them and hardly ever question others beliefs or whether or not they value etc. over etc. The only reason why the four traits are prevalent in Magical Britain's society is due to the fact that the four founders of Hogwarts exhibited those traits well over a thousand years ago.

Hogwarts houses matter even outside of school. They seem more like a fraternity than a school boarding house. Imagine this, a Gryffindor graduate is seeking employment in the Ministry of Magic and the interviewer was from Slytherin. Do you think the Gryffindor will get the job as opposed to a Ravenclaw even with the same credentials?
