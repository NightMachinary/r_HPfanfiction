#+begin_quote
  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, whilst politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming. AU. Complete.

** I really enjoyed this.

I think the ending could probably be fleshed out a little bit more, and some of the misunderstandings were a little bit far-fetched. But overall I thought it was well written and I enjoyed reading through it.

** I loved it. It was well written and the story was pretty well paced, although the end came fast. Lily's character was developed really well, building on some of Harry's character traits in canon. Similarly for other canon characters.

Some of the OCs were good, [[/spoiler][especially Gertrude, and I loved the twist at the end with her and Sirius.]]

I also loved [[/spoiler][the game - I now have an unsatisfied desire to play lasertag again.]]

Thanks for bringing this to Book Club.

** I'm new here, but I stumbled upon this post so I hope it's okay if I interject -- Prelude to Destiny is one of my favorite J/L fics. I really like the [[/spoiler][parallel development of the J/L relationship with the R/L.]]. I think the characters are well developed and rounded out, and the OCs are interesting -- especially Gertrude!

** I think it's time to change the story, [[/u/denarii][u/denarii]]. The one's been here almost a month.
