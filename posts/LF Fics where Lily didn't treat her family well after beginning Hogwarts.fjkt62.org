Petunia was a bitch but Lily wasn't perfect either. Like Hermione I'm sure she embraced magic wholeheartedly and over time became distant from her family (Petunia's jealousy not helping matters between the two sisters).

Are there any fics that show Lily's growing distance/[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing][Cultural Postering]] in favour of the Wizarding world, like in the first chapter of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11064921/1/New-Blood-International-Academy]])?
