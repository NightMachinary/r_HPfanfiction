What non slash story should I read that will last me a few days? I don't really have any other wants.


** I haven't had a chance yet to read it but in terms of just something to read this looks decent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina]]

Seems very self aware and the actual writing seems solid.

Obviously it's riddled with tropes and cliches but I think that it's the point for the story.

** This is my favorite fic (although not my favorite pairing) It's Luna Lovegood and George Weasley. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5152267/1/Fred-s-Gift]]

** I have two on my author page that I can offer:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305303][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] - Set 50 years after the end of Deathly Hallows. Action/mystery. Trio-focused, but with a large supporting cast. 262,000 words.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=320684][Detox]] - Set immediately after Deathly Hallows. Action/romance. Focused on Draco Malfoy. 97,000 words.

** Lasting a few days is a pretty epic undertaking. There aren't many fics that are long enough to meet that requirement.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] is the obvious reply as it comes in at 1.2 million words. I personally have a few issues with it, but it's extremely readable. The fic isn't yet finished, but she's still updating it and we're almost there, now mid-way through 7th year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2954601/1/Taking-Control][Taking Control]] is a Harry/Ginny post-OotP fic with training!Harry. I read it years ago so I don't know how I'd feel about it now, but I remember it being ok. 520k words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][Stranger in an Unholy Land]] is 470k words. It has a bit of a rocky start and you may be tempted to give up on it, but the quality goes up a lot.

Finally, something a bit out of left-field: a Star Wars fanfic author. I normally wouldn't recommend something not-HP here, but it fits your epicness requirement so well that I thought I might as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1584073/blank101][blank101]]. This author has a Star Wars trilogy where Luke is caught by the Empire during A New Hope and taken to Coruscant. He also has a stand-along Star Wars fic of 378k words which features a Luke raised as an Emperor's Hand. Both are amazing.

** [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] by Bobmin356 is really good. Very early stuff, written about 2005. It also as a sequel, both are insanely long. It will last you way more than a few days, depending on how fast you read! One thing that's always been fun about their early stuff is that they were early on enough before somethings became annoyingly tropey. Really any of their stuff is good. (I say their because they are a husband and wife writing team)

** Incomplete, but one of my all time favorite HP crossover fics (with Star Wars, but no canon knowledge necessary) that veers heavily into the awesome action and clever side of things: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]]

Business, by the legendary esama: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588]] (Harry saves the world by being a damn good businessman)

Or anything by Celebony on FFnet, who is a master at doing family feels, with special mention going to "Family Night" for being the most beautiful, moving fic ever that managed to actually make me hate Remus: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2682144/1/Family-Night]]

Also a great crossover: Cardcaptor Harry, by LunaStorm on FFNet, for great writing and pulling up all the beautiful things I liked about Cardcaptors: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7845282/1/Cardcaptor-Harry]]

** I have the quirk of only reading stories with fully original main characters who are unrelated to any notable character in the books. Recently I was recommended to the Anguis series, by Slide, which is about 4 Slytherin students one year older than Harry. There are 3 stories on fanfiction.net.

Latet Anguis in Herba

Shade to Shade

Falls the Shadow

I picked it up 3 days ago and I'm already almost done with Shade to Shade. It has blown my mind several times already. The 4 main characters are all interesting in their own way, the pace is good, the story is packed with action, and it's sufficiently dark and gritty for me to enjoy while still having that Hogwartsy charm. I definitely recommend it.

** It's incomplete, but "A Marauder's Plan" by CatsAreCool - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]] is excellent. (Incomplete, but updated fairly regularly)

Muggledad has a variety of novel-length H/Hr fics, if those are your thing. Bobmin (mentioned below for Sunset Over Britain and on ff.net here - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356]]) has some more recent stuff that is also fun.
