So yeah. Just post little bits of fics you're working on, see if anyone's interested, get some criticism, all that fun stuff. Here's a bit from mine, a sequel to another unpublished fic:

------

“Athena! I need to see Athena immediately!” The unnatural stillness of the room, like a tomb, wasn't disturbed overly much by the bustling of black-cloaked figures. Unlike their red counterparts, no one stopped to stare or attempt to accost him. One broke away from their desk and approached.

“Albus Dumbledore,” a woman's voice rattled from beneath the shadow of her hood. “You are not in handcuffs.”

“No, I'm not. We have a problem.”

“Yes. You are supposed to be under arrest.”

“Bigger than that.” He steeled himself for her reaction. “We have an active mirror creature.” The air around them chilled, and beneath her hood, two green eyes lit up in a fiery glow.

“What?” Athena hissed. Now the black figures in the room were paying attention. All activity had stilled, breaths held.

“Yes. And I don't know where it is. We tried to contain it with the ritual but we were-“

“IT GOT OUT?!” Athena screeched, and around them the shadowy figures gasped and immediately began scurrying around like ants in a kicked nest. A wand, made of wood that looked to have rotted years ago, was drawn from Athena's cloak, grasped in a hand that had rotted centuries ago. Dumbledore stared impassively, long since used to the appearance of one of the three lich who had been employed by the DoM for longer than even records could remember.


** I wrote this in 2011--just a short little bit. Dunno if it'll ever go anywhere.

--------------

Harry burrowed deeper into the covers, searching out Ginny's warmth as the tingling in his shoulder built into a burn. "No," he groaned quietly as he shifted away from the warm pocket and into the chill air of the flat. Sitting on the edge of the bed, he scrubbed his face with his hands, willing his brain to start working and remember where his trousers had ended up.

The burning summons grew steadily stronger as he finally located and pulled on his jeans and fumbled into his boots and socks. Squinting out of the window next to the bed, he frowned at the deep darkness and added a black sweater over his black tee shirt. 'Almost Halloween and the nights are becoming very crisp,' he thought.

A rustling of sheets and covers announced that Ginny was awake. "What is it?" she asked quietly.

"Dunno. I'll find out when I get there," Harry answered, kissing her softly on the cheek.

"Be safe."

"I always am." The burn ratcheted up another notch. Whoever was doing the summoning was growing impatient. "Gotta go." Harry concentrated and silently Disapparated out of the room and was promptly slapped in the face by a cold wet rain.

"Oh thank God you're here, Harry!" Shaking off the momentary disorientation, Harry focused on a soaking wet Ron in front of him.

"What's going on?" Harry quickly determined a few things. He was wet, cold, and in Ron's garden.

"I'm buggered, that's what's going on." Ron cast an anxious look to the darkened windows of the tidy little house and swallowed. "Harry, I need you to help me hide a body."

Harry felt a bright shocking jolt and looked around the soggy garden. "What?" he asked incredulously.

"It was an accident, I swear!" Ron ran agitated hands through his soaking hair.

"What do you mean? Accident? Hide a body?" Grabbing Ron's shoulders, Harry shook him until his teeth rattled.

Twisting out of his grip, Ron shoved him backwards and Harry almost went down in the mud. "Gerroff, Harry! I didn't kill the little bugger!" He picked up a small cardboard box that had been sheltering under the eaves and lifted the lid. "I left the hutch door unlatched and the gormless blighter got out!"

Relief washed through Harry, leaving him weak-kneed as he peered into the box to see the small brown and white rabbit inside. "Mr Hoppy! Ron, Rose is going to kill you!"

"I know," he said glumly as he stroked the fur with a finger before putting the lid back on.

"What the hell happened?"

"Rose is on a sleepover and I told her I'd feed the bunnies and she told me, 'Dad, be sure you latch the door!' just like I tell her all the time and goddammit I forgot the bloody thing!"

** Ten Duel Commandments [COMPANY] Number one!

[LAURENS] The challenge: demand satisfaction If they apologize, no need for further action

Harry laughed at the wizard's earnest expression. "Tell the "esteemed" Wizard Thadwich his demand for satisfaction is the actions of a craven coward. How he graduated from Hogwarts astounds me if he truly believes the shite he spews."

The wizard scowled and turned away to return to his compatriot.

"Harry, are you sure you know what you're doing?" Sophie asked breathlessly. Hermione nodded while Ron and Neville both just looked resigned.

He looked over at his friends and was about to speak when Wizard Wallace approached, scowling. "Harry..., did you just accept a duel?" "Yes." "Har---! Sirius hired me to protect you, must you make it harder to protect you?" Harry shrugged. "He's insulted me enough times but he insulted my mother. The duel is accepted."

[COMPANY] Number two!

[LAURENS] If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

[HAMILTON] Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

"Then I'm your second," Wallace said. He looked to the bodyguards who looked annoyed he was usurping the role while Neville looked slightly relieved and Ron started to raise his hand in objection. Hermione pulled his hand back.

[COMPANY] Number three!

[LEE] Have your seconds meet face to face

Wallace met with the wizard who had approached Harry.

[BURR] Negotiate a peace...

"Thadwich only requires an apology and his position returned at the Academy."

[HAMILTON] Or negotiate a time and place

"Thadwich lost his position for experimenting in ways that were ruinous to his department. A witch lost her life. He was lucky to not be arrested. "Time and place."

[BURR] This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

[COMPANY] Most disputes die, and no one shoots Number four!

[LAURENS] If they don't reach a peace, that's alright Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

Wallace accepted the package and left Ollivander's. His father-in-law's antique dueling wands---a pair of blackthorn wands with liquified leprechaun gold cores---were in excellent condition he now knew and since Harry was the challenged, it was his duty to supply the weaponry. He stopped just outside Ollivander's and looked up, searching the sky for a sign.

[HAMILTON] You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

Medi-Wizard Voodoo dropped the heavy bag of gold in the fountain of St. Mungo's then apparated. He recognized Harry's friend and accepted the sock from her. "It'll activate at five am," she told him. She bit her lip as he nodded. "He'll be fine," Voodoo told her. "I'm sure Thadwich will realize how foolish he is to face off against Harry Potter."

[BURR] You have him turn around so he can have deniability

Voodoo finished verifying both wizards were healthy enough. "Well, you're both of sound body. Now show you're of sound mind and stop this stupid shit." "He insulted me," Thadwich replied. "He killed a young witch with his stupidity."

[COMPANY] Five!

[LEE] Duel before the sun is in the sky

The horizon began to fill with light.

[COMPANY] Pick a place to die where it's high and dry Number six!

Harry knew the exact point he wanted and selected the beginning point for the duel.

[HAMILTON] Leave a note for your next of kin Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

Harry handed over the letters, even though this duel was not to the death, they were still required.

[COMPANY] Seven!

[LEE] Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY] Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR] Your last chance to negotiate Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight...

[BURR] Alexander

[HAMILTON] Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR] Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON] Sure But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR] With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

[HAMILTON] Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR] Okay, so we're doin' this

Wallace walked from his place and nodded at Thadwich's second. "There's no way your man will stand down?" "No." "Then we do this," he said, looking to Harry. He approached the young wizard and nodded.

[COMPANY] Number nine!

[HAMILTON] Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher Summon all the courage you require Then count

Harry and Thadwich stood back to back as their seconds and medi-wizard Voodoo turned their backs.

"Begin the steps."

"One."

They took one step forward each then brought their trailing leg to heel.

[MEN] One two three four

[FULL COMPANY] Five six seven eight nine

[HAMILTON/BURR] Number

[COMPANY] Ten paces!

[HAMILTON/BURR] Fire!

Harry turned at the tenth pace and let off a spell wordlessly, a sickly green light that took the shape of a skull as it seemed to chew the air, pulling itself forward in eagerness to hit the other wizard. ~•~ Thadwich's spell fell from his mind as the green light rocketed towards him. How? He tried to summon a stone between himself and the green light of the Killing Curse racing towards him, unable to concentrate on anything else. ~•~ Harry apparated behind the the wizard, drew his personal wand and activated the blades in its hilt, then stabbed the man in the kidneys, twisting the blade. The quick, brutal stab and its flawless placement left the wizard dying as Harry's wand flicked out and 'caught' the spell before sending it up into the sky.

"Thus to murderers," Harry muttered.

** Sitting at dinner that night, Harry listened as Hermione, Cartwright, and Musta waxed ecstatically about the latrine they had spent the day digging up and the limerick they had just finished translating.

"Okay, okay. Here it is," Hermione said, standing up. "'Here's a riddle to leave you appalled: I'm hairy beneath; above, bald; I'm purple and red, And stand up in the bed; Women weep at me. What am I called?'"

Harry raised an eyebrow then a technical sergeant called out, "An onion." "The Major's dick," said the captain at the same time.

Laughter burst out at the Major's spit take.

** “Hey, little me.”

“Huh,” Harry asked.

“Harry, this is you, from the future. We're not exactly sure how he's been sent back but after a few tests, it is you but not beholden to the normal issues of time-travel.”

“Yeah, we don't understand that,” the older Harry said. “I'm you from about fifteen years in the future and normally I couldn't change things or it would cause a great big boom and end the universe but I can and am changing the future. So you get to have a normal school life instead of nearly dying at the end of this year, next year, the year after that, being tortured by a ministry employee in fifth year, seeing dumbass---err, dumbledore,” who merely smiled at the insult for he knew the Elder Harry didn't actually mean it,” here die in our sixth year, or spending our seventh year on a horrible camping trip while evading Voldemort's soldiers since he controls the ministry. So, wanna go to America during the Easter Break? I know Ron is staying this break so I figured you would still wanna stay.”

** "We could have been something, you know," [she] said, eyes fluttering rapidly. Her breathing was shallow. She was most certainly dead.

"I think we both know that's not true." Harry's voice was harsh and colder than ice. His tone sent shivers down her spine.

"Perhaps," [she] said before lunging up. Her lips mashed against his hungrily. Her kiss was not returned. With a final tear streaking down her cheek, she let out a final breath. [she] was no more. Harry gently laid her body on the cool marble and limped outside. His injuries were severe. With a pop, he was gone.

I added brackets around the [she] to prevent any spoilers for a future fic. ;)

** I don't really have an excerpt from an unfinished fic so much as an idea for a fic that I may or may not write.

I'm considering writing a Harry/Daphne fic (because I'm trash and want that ship to be good.)

The story would take place in an AU where Tom Riddle (for whatever reason) never became Voldemort. Maybe Dumbledore mentors him or something, I'm not sure how I'd have this change come about, but for whatever reason, there is no Voldemort.

As a result, a number of things change significantly from canon. The most notable of which are: James and Lily live, Peter Pettigrew remains a loyal friend, Sirius is free, and while there is still prejudice against half-bloods, Muggle-borns, and muggles, it's not being stirred up by a charismatic and powerful leader.

Harry grows up with his parents and is frequently visited by his parent's friends: mostly Sirius, Remus, and Peter, but also the Longbottoms. Obviously growing up in a loving household instead of with the Dursleys would change Harry's personality a fair amount, so here are some notes I have about what I'd change.

Academics: Growing up with Lily and James as parents and Sirius, Remus, and (to a much lesser extent) Peter as honorary uncles, means Harry has little chance to be anything other than a good student. I'm would not being the super!powerful!OP!ReincarnationOfMerlin!Harry or anything like that but Harry would be talented and studious. Harry would be particularly good at Charms and potions (influenced and or tutored by his mother) and Transfiguration (influenced and or tutored by his father). As a trade-off, Harry would not be as good at DADA as in canon. I also imagine this version of Harry having little interest in Herbology, Astronomy, and History of Magic, but he'd still study these enough to get good grades. A bit of nerd when it comes to his favorite subjects: Charms, Potions, and Transfiguration. He's also interested in studying things like spell creation.

Personality: A similar sense of humor to canon Harry, Sarcastic and often a bit cheeky. Rather than getting angry, he uses humor to deflect, however, when he does lose his temper it's quite similar to canon. The thing that will most often trigger his temper is if someone messes with his friends. Despite the influence of the marauders, he doesn't have a taste for pranks, but he is curious, and a bit interfering, he explores Hogwarts and roams the halls sometimes after hours, and generally has a similar sense of adventure as in canon.

Flying: He's not nearly as good at flying as he is in canon and never gets involved in Quidditch at school, though he is known to play with his parents and uncles at home.

Daphne: I'm planning on having Daphne avoid all of or most of the usual tropes associated with her. So definitely not an ice queen for example. The way I imagine her is she has a similar sense of humor to Harry and that's what initially causes their friendship. They happen to sit together in History of Magic and one of them makes a sarcastic remark about how it would be a shame if they actually learned things from Binns, the other laughs and returns a witty comment. Daphne is very calm/easy going, she's rational and levelheaded. She's placed in Slytherin mostly because she's resourceful, though the hat also considered her for Ravenclaw. Academically, she's also similar to Harry except, her areas of expertise are different than his (not sure which classes she's good or not so good at other than potions). In terms of her beliefs on blood purity, she's grown in close proximity to a lot of people who firmly believe in blood purity but after meeting certain people has come to question the whole concept. Harry, Dumbledore, Professor Riddle and (DADA), are all half-bloods and yet they're all pretty damn smart. Lily (who I imagine is the potions professor for at least years 1 - 5) is someone she personally comes to admire quite a bit and of course is muggle-born. All these people and others eventually convince her that blood purity can't be all it's cracked up to be. The Greengrass parents (and maybe Astoria) I imagine being the kind of people who would say something like "Oh, you're one of the good ones" about Lily, or "We don't believe in all that blood purity nonsense our son/brother-in-law is a half-blood!"

Harry and Daphne's relationship: best friends until it eventually (probably around 4th year and the yule ball) becomes something more. They bounce ideas off each other academically and play off each other in terms of humor. They have other friends but they are closest to each other and it's obvious, other students make a lot of jokes about how almost inseparable they are. They are at or near the top of their class in their respective houses (Hermione is top of the year total and is in Ravenclaw, has a slight friendly rivalry with Harry and Daphne). More than a few students dislike Harry and Daphne because they get a lot of positive attention from professors. Though unlike Hermione they don't memorize their textbooks so they don't do as well in theory portions. Harry for his part, for example, has a hard time connecting with his dorm mates (other than Neville, who he grew up with) because he's more studious than them.

The only canon plot that happens still is the Triwizard tournament, though this time Harry is not a champion because there is no Voldemort, though he does become a champion in his seventh year when he's old enough. In terms of post-Hogwarts, I imagine Harry and Daphne become either unspeakables or professors or maybe unspeakables and then later professors.

Finally done, those are all of my thoughts and notes on a story that I may in fact never write. The problem is that while I feel confident in my ability to write characters and dialogue, I feel I suck at basically everything else. I really wanted to get this idea off my chest though, so thank you to anyone who read this way too long post.

** They don't ask. They think they have the answer so why ask the question. Why be told something you already know?

No one ever asked her why. Why she stood up in front of a school of hostile people and offered up one life to save them all. Not that they would have been safe. But no one asked why she'd done it. They all knew already after all.

The colour of her tie was green.

When they had been shuffled off to the dungeons to wait out their fate she had been alone. Ostracised by everyone, she had sat in a chair in the corner of the common room while the castle trembled around them. The others had huddled together, the eldest offering scant comfort to the youngest.

She hadn't known that the castle made of stone centuries old, seemingly impenetrable, could tremble. Shoved up against the wall as she was, she felt the shocks that ran through the stone to the foundations, and she'd known that like the castle she too was being rocked to her core.

It had all come to ahead much sooner and much slower than expected. Imprisonment had ended, and they had been led upwards towards the light. The light and the smoking ruin that was the castle and the last vestiges of her childhood. As soon as she had been released from interrogation by the Aurors, she had run to the ward line and apparated away. It didn't matter what had happened at Hogwarts, it mattered what had taken place in a small corner of Hertfordshire she called home.

The gates of the manor opened under her touch, and she was relieved that the protective enchantments were still holding. She ran up the drive careless of how her uniform was in disarray, her hair was tangled, and her face bore smudges of dust and ash.

The door was opened by Fenwick one of her family's elderly elves. She nodded a greeting and thanks as she passed headed directly for the stairs. Manners, breeding and scoldings were forgotten as she took them at a near run.

Down the corridor of the family wing to the bookcase at the end she reached for the copy of Shakespeare, an incongruous muggle book in a pureblood home. The bookcase swung to the side to reveal the rooms hidden beyond.

Tisbury looked up from the menial task he was performing bowing he raised an arm indicating the closed door in the right rear corner of the room.

Pansy took a long slow breath trying to calm her racing heartbeat. It would not do to rush through the door, she would cause upset and concern, and she knew now that she couldn't.

Tisbury approached carefully. “Miss cannot be seen in such a state,” he chided as much as a subservient creature could. Since Tisbury was quite old and had been a Parkinson elf for several decades, it was fairly chiding. His bony fingers snapped together, and Pansy felt the magic wash over her fixing her clothes her hair removing the smudges of rubble dust from her skin. She gave the elf one grateful glance before approaching the door and opening it.

“Pansy!” The sole occupant cried out in surprised delight before leaping out of the bed and racing across the room to throw themselves at her legs in a furious hug. Pansy let her hand settle on the soft hair of her six-year-old brother in grateful benediction. He was safe.

Pure relief washed over her making her knees wobble.

No, they never asked why she had been willing to stand up and hand over Harry Potter to the Dark Lord. They had their answer, and it was based on her tie colour.

** The Premise: Take all the good things from RWBY (worldbuilding), dump the bad (literally. everything. else.), mix rigorously with HP and presto! Magical Not!Zombie apocalypse writ large.

Summary: "Magic is a curious thing, capable of creating beings that are the embodiment of human emotion; the Boggarts who are Fear, the Dementors who are Despair...and the Grimm, shadowy creatures who feed on pandemonium and Turn those they kill. The Grindelwald Plan has spared us from annihilation, but this war will only end in one of two ways and I'm not one for dying." -Tom Marvolo Riddle

It didn't take them long to reach the middle of the city and the small storefront that couldn't have been owned by anyone else. The sign outside flashed “WEASLEY'S WICKED WARTHINGS” in a dazzling array of colors, like fireworks on a night sky. Tiny figures wielding mimicries of weaponry danced about the lettering, occasionally killing a tiny Grimm or kicking a fellow hunter.

There were a few people inside, mostly trainees perusing the limited arsenal on display. Unpacked boxes were stacked in the corner. One hunter was by the counter, rattling off some specifications for a custom weapon to a clerk.

“Harry, you made it!” Fred said with good cheer as they walked in. Harry knew it was Fred because he had both his ears on him. “And you've brought Ickle Ronniekins with you. How'd the alterations on your hammer go?”

“Don't call me that! And I -uh- haven't finished it yet,” Ron said.

Fred shook his head. “Tisk, tisk, that's no good.” He held out a hand to his brother.

Ron stared at it, weight shifting from one leg to another.

“Give it here, Ron. I haven't got all day and this should only take a minute,” Fred said, drawing his wand.

The hammer changed hands and Fred disappeared into another room.

“Two galleons says it gives Ron a nasty shock,” Neville said.

“Deal,” Harry said, sealing the pact with a shake.

Ron pouted. “You guys suck.”

It was George -his lack of an ear noticeable- that appeared first, carrying a case while Fred followed after, still visibly fiddling. “Great to see you again, Harry!” he said. “We've got your new weapon right here. We tempered the metal in dragonfire and soaked the component pieces in a double strength hardening solution this time, just to be safe.”

Harry felt his wand warm up in his pocket. “Thanks George, how much do I owe you?”

“No can do this time, Harry,” Fred said. “You're representing Gryffindor. We haven't had one of our own win the Triwizard in ages.”

“It's a privilege,” George said, “nay, a duty to provide you the best possible weapon. It's a matter of House Pride.”

“You owe us four galleons and a sickle though, Ron.”

Ron spluttered. “What!? I'm your brother!”

“Hmm, he isn't wrong, Fred.”

“Right you are, George. Let's call it an even four galleons then.”

“That's two galleons for the advice,” George said.

“And two more for being too much of a pussy to see it through,” finished Fred. “It's a good thing you want to be a hunter. You'd have never made it in forge school.”

Ron grumbled, but handed over the gold anyway.

“I appreciate the sentiment, but really, how much was it? I don't want to shortchange you guys especially when you're just starting up,” Harry said.

“If you're dead set on paying us back, Harry, then make sure you win,” George said.

Fred nodded. “Not just because Gryffindor needs one, but because people'll be dying to know where you got your weapon from. No amount of gold you pay us will match the take from good publicity.”

“If you're sure...” Harry said.

“We are,” they replied together.

“If it makes you feel better, think of it as an investment on our part,” Fred said.

“Treat our babies good, Potter,” George said, handing over the case.

It felt heavier than it should have in Harry's hands. “Thanks.”

So yeah this is a thing now. I have like 17k words sitting around.
