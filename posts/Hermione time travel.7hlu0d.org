Stubbled upon a tread in which several dozens time travel fics involving Hermione was recommended. Have read several of them, and really liked them. Especially linkffn(11790377) and linkffn(11758961). And I want to read more. Have read all the Hermione goes to the Marauders era and ends up with one of them. But I would like to read other stories where she either goes to that era or further back. Pairing is irrelevant, but the story has to be finished and over 120k wording.

Thank you!

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

*** Just finished it. Liked it. There were some parts that I skimmed, but on the whole I liked it. Got a little annoyed when they did the last turn, but it ended up working.

** I have recently finished reading, and loving, The Minister's Secret by Canimal. It can be very dark, and sometimes sad, but definitely and amazing piece of work and worth reading. I am currently reading through the additional scenes that accompany the story. linkffn(11802503)

#+begin_quote
  The love of the Minister's life disappeared just before the end of the First Wizarding War. When he finds her again, he can hardly trust his sanity. His first action as the new Minister for Magic is to break at least a dozen international laws to bring her home. Hermione soon finds herself in the early 70s surrounded by future followers of the Dark Lord. **Causal Loop Time Travel**

  The war is much larger, far longer, and much deeper than they could have imagined: fought on a scale that baffles the limits of human understanding. In such a world, perhaps it isn't surprising when Hermione Granger is sent back in time to rescue Tom Riddle's soul before he has the chance to destroy it. Rated M.

  With the war looking bleak, the Golden Trio, Ginny, Draco, and Lavender go back to Tom Riddle's 7th Year to destroy Lord Voldemort once and for all. What Hermione DIDN'T count on, however, is a shared common room, a curse, and a crazy little thing called love.
