Been thinking about this off and on for the past week, but I can't come up with any combination of words that lets me find it via Google.

I don't remember it well, but I believe the overarching theme is that Harry discovers he's just as popular/famous with magical creatures as he is with wizards and witches. I think it occurs entirely during his 4th year and the tournament.

The only scene/event that I'm reasonably sure about takes place during the third task where the acromantula he encounters wants to interview him instead of eat him - she's a reporter for some sort of creature magazine and his absolutely thrilled to have the chance to interview The Boy Who Lived.

Does this ring any bells with anyone else? I didn't hallucinate this story, did I?


** I had no recollection of this until you mentioned the Acromantula journalist, but now I do. Rest easy, this fic does exist.

**** Well.... Hell. As many times as I've gone over this fic recently (because everyone remembers /something/ about it - bribing the merfolk, Slappy Malfoy, the dragon family, you name it), you'd think I'd remember Missy Aranea.

Hey, [[/u/clell65619]], if nobody's mentioned it lately - good fic.

***** Missy was easy, the character I was proudest of coming up with was Brenda the Sphinx. She actually asked for an autograph after going all fan-girl over Harry.

****** Brenda was fun, also greatly enjoyed the Holy Grail reference with her questions. Much more subtle than most Monty Python homages.

******* Honestly Missy got the most specific mentions in reviews in any fic right up until I had Superman get grounded for messing with Harry.

********* Harry is dealing with three the Wicked Witch's foot soldiers, the Bloody Winkies, before going to the school to find out that the cursed class isn't Defense.

They've got a protection racket going on, and Harry hasn't paid his dues.

I've got to get Technomage 26 out before I put much effort into 2nd Life.

** It never is shown. But antithetis speaks about how frendly magical creatures are with harry. But i warn you this story isen't for the faint pf heart. It is a dark AU where child neglect has serius conseqvenses. Though the storie magical creatures begin liking him less and less beacuse of his corruption. Best harry potter story out there people say and i think so to.
