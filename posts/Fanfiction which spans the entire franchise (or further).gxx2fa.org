Hey. I just got finished reading To Be a Slytherin, it's a fic that spans from Philosopher's Stone to Deathly Hallows. I also believe I remember reading They Shook Hands which is split into 7 books.

Are there other fics that are this long?


** linkao3(The Changeling) covers books 2 through 7, and there are a bunch of fantastic sequels as well.

** Many, not all of them finished:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214][Animagus-Verse by White_Squirrel]] starting with linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) is now somewhere in the sixth [?] year, but it is heavily AU right now.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/993900][Arithmancer-Verse by White_Squirrel]] starting with linkao3(The Arithmancer by White_Squirrel) has been finished
- I am just in the middle of the Dangerverse series, linkffn(Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow) and its sequels (unfortunately, FFN doesn't allow good grouping in to series, so you have to pick it up from the authors profile)
- The same problems of FFN are with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter by Sorcerer's Muse) and its sequels, which is WIP (right now publishing the seventh book of the series covering the sixth year of Harry at Hogwarts)
- linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) covers all seven years of the next-generation in itself
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] starting with linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts: Now and Forever by Forest_of_Holly) is also the next-generation series covering all seven years of the Dudley's daughter (not that well known, but really good)

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** I'm reading through [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895][The Cupboard series by Stargon]] right now, and it's complete. Avoids most stations of canon, but I have no idea if it goes til year seven (as I'm reading through year five at the moment).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/945579][Hermione Granger and the Child Protection Movement by LadyWinterknight and NerdyKat]] is another complete one.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/338101][Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven by Bakenandeggs]] - Warning: goblin tropes at the very least. It's been a long time since I've read this though. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590][Leo Inter Serpentes by Aeternum]] goes to sixth year. I remember absolutely nothing about this series lol. Incomplete. I think.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir by Mad_fairy]] is a fun read that starts off over-the-top cracky and then evens out later. The bashing goes away, I promise. Begins during the summer of second year and ends when... well... That's a spoiler. Some crossover elements with marvel, but its minimal and knowledge via osmosis is perfectly fine. My favourite of the bunch, even if its not to everyone's taste.

Part one of each is here: linkao3(13054572; 13695783; 4762385; 922767; 4629198)
