Hierarchy of Canon in HP

With the negative fan reaction to “The Cursed Child”, “The Crimes of Grindelwald”, and some twitter statements, especially in regards to what it adds/changes to specific books (Super trunks, Nagani, super time turners, Voldy's daughter, older McGonagall, pooping on the floor or worse) I think it's important to decide what we mean by “canon”. This is especially important for fanfic: if a fic says “canon compliant” what does that mean? Moreover, most (good) fanfic echwes exposition when it aligns with “canon”, devoting more time to explaining what is /different/ to some assumed body of knowledge. For-want-of-a-nail fics are, ideally, “canon” up to a specific point.

Other fandoms have faced this issue, and in the case of pre-Disney star wars, this was [[https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Canon#Canon_in_the_Holocron_continuity_database][officially resolved]]. This divided SW materials into a number of hierarchical positions. If material on a lower hierarchy conflicted with one above it was ignored in favor of the higher one. The key takeaway from this is Canon started with George Lucas and “flowed out” from him: the more involved he was, the higher on the hierarchy the work sat. I think we can extend this idea to HP canon.

To me, HP materials fall into about 9 different forms, here in no strict order

*B*: The original 7 books. Self-explanatory this is mainline HP

*S*: Supplemental books solely authored by JKR (ex. Quidditch Through the Ages)

*P*: Pottermore

*T*: Statements on twitter from JKR

*I*: Statements in interviews by JKR

*C*: Cursed Child; JKR is one of three credited authors

*F*: The fantastic beasts movies; JKR is writer but not director

*M*: The original 8 HP movies; JKR is a producer but no writing or directing credits

*O*: Other peripheral material with little direct JKR involvement (ex: copy in the theme parks)

Some of these could be combined. Do you merge *P* into *S*? After all Pottermore started life as a supplemental encyclopedia before turning into a website. Are twitter statements “published” like pottermore pieces, or are they close to off the cuff interview statements?

As for assembling into a hierarchy, some choices are obvious. *B* should go on top, and *O* on the bottom. *M* should be lower than most others as JKR has no writing credit at all, other than credited as writing the source material. Some are less obvious, for example do we put *F* above or below *C*? She is the only credited writer in *F*, but a film production may have less creative control for JKR than a play, even though there are co-authors. Another hard one is where to put *I*. She is the sole author of them, but interview statements may be less firm then published material even if she doesn't have full creative control.

As for fanfic, this has utility in many cases. Example: Daphne Greengrass. In *B* canon she is a total blank slate with name, house, and year only. In *I* she is in Pansy's gang. In *P* info is known about her family and background, mostly through her sister. So if a fanfic is “canon compliant” what info should be assumed as true? This could help.

Is this a good approach and if so, how would you organize the hierarchy?


** This actually makes a lot of sense and if i ever get into writing again i will use it.

In fact i vote that this is Pinned in the sub.

** Yes, this is a good approach I think. I don't like contradictory "Canon" IE Pottermore saying McGonagall was born in 1935 then JK saying McGonagall was there with Dumbles teaching DADA pre-1935.

My order would be: B>S=P>I=T and M>F=O don't exist in canon for me. Now, will I cherry-pick cool little things from M, F, and O that I like to add flavor to my story, yes, do I consider it canon, hell no.

Notice I didn't put C in there, because I consider that fanfiction. Less canon than the games, which aren't canon at all, and basically any other fanfiction but it has the stamp of approval to get money made off it.

*** Didn't even think about the games. I suppose they would *O* since JKR isn't exactly looking over the programmers' shoulders or even close.

I think you could comfortably include *M* in canon, since there's very little that is not either redundant with *B* or contradicted by it: mostly aesthetic fill in for Hogwarts and such.

**** True true, honestly one of the things I like to include most from the movies, is stuff in wizarding society, ie in the movies, they had a goblin stockbroker that talked about the potion market. That little thing adds so much to the economy and flushes out the world, or like the Malfoy's owning an apothecary that sells 1,000 yr old wine, Superior Red.

****** Everybody hangs on the clincher of: "You have to internalize hatred of your magic."

But JK honestly expects us to believe a child that was called a freak and made to live in a cupboard didn't internalize his hatred of magic on top of his torment by his cousin. Yeah okay.

Sure I guess he didn't even though child psychology tells us almost every other child would as they do with other things.

** I think the idea of "canon" in HP is like "Canon" in classic Dr. Who or the Marvel universe. It's whatever the current story requires to be true at the moment.

For my own ranking, it's

Headcanon

Main Books

Main Movies

Original notes from main books

Other books

Interviews

Other movies

...

Fanon

...

...

Random hot takes from JKR on twitter.

I'm sorry, but author or not, once she said wizards used to shit all over the floor prior to plumbing, she was cut off from making further canon pronouncements for me.

I'm not sure that's really an interesting question and might be missing the point. Depending in which major camp a person falls in it's either clearly canon or clearly not canon. Does it really matter which one is slightly more or less canon? I can't imagine many people exist for whom the dividing line about canon is between Fantastic Beasts and Cursed Child.

IMHO if you accept Cursed Child you don't have much leg to stand on in order to dismiss Fantastic Beasts and vice versa.

Most of these kinds of discussions just fall deeply into the motivated reasoning trap anyway: "I really like X so I now have to make up many reasons why it must be canon!"

** Thank you for putting into words. I've always just gone off of the primary books and then let everything else trickle in.

For example, the whole no toilets thing I chalk up to something that 7th years tell firsties with absolute conviction. It, of course, being like the swimming pool on the school roof: fake.

** I would push M a little bit higher (there seems to be trend of JKR getting more and more crazy in her statements, films were so early after books, actually first films were released before the last books were, which is the explanation why later Ron and Snape in books are film personas not the book ones). Also, F should be split: the first film was to some extent reasonable (and for example the concept of Obscurial is probably the best explanation of what happened to Ariana Dumbledore and I can happily have it in canon), the second film just went out to the deep end on the same level C ... just forget it ever happened and pretend it didn't.

** F>C

I've read the cursed child. In book form is was really awful. However, someone here mentioned that it was better on stage. So why should it be below fantastic beasts? Because fantastic beasts was available to everyone. Not to the minority that lives in the correct area or has enough money to take a flight to watch it.

** I would not say C&F to be canon at all, and for the rest the parts that don't contradict the books could be considered canon, but I would definitely rank the original movies much higher on the list as they were made when JKR still put more effort in the series. I don't know why you would put the Fantastic Beasts movies above them, I would put them above everything but the supplementary books solely authored by JKR. For T&I I think when the statements were made should be taken into account as you can certainly see they get stranger as time goes on.

However, the reason I would put the original movies below most is only because JKR does not have a writing credit. She is the sole (credited) writer on both fantastic beasts movies, so operating under the framework of canon "flowing out" from JKR, they are closer to the source.

** Personally, I go for B, Headcanon (interpretation of B), F, and sprinkles of P.

I haven't really touched the supplemental books, as I'm hesitant on the fact that JKR could have ballsed it up.

F is only good for names, some events (if you are doing marauders/grindelwald era. Also can be a good canon source over the movies, as F doesn't have a book series to contradict like the original 7 books does for their movies.

And by sprinkles of P, I mean names, families, books, potions, spells, etc. Nothing to do with dates or hard numbers. Because JKR contradicts herself with them a lot.

​

T, I, M, and O I throw out immediately. JKR contradicts herself or messes up the numbers religiously with T and I. O because reasons, and M because it mangles the books up to no end.

C on the other hand, has a special place in my heart. The only thing I consider canon in that is that adults in the HP world are incompetent idiots that mess up EVERYTHING and leave it up to the kids to fix.

** I like the idea of degrees of canon. For me it's

1. original 7 books
2. supplemental books - Tales of Beedle the Bard, Quidditch, Fantastic Beasts
3. JKR's interview statements up to ~2008

With the interviews, dates and math can be tweakable to make sense (Black family tree). After this it is picking and choosing what I like from:

1. Pottermore (some articles are really good others are trash)
2. Movies (the original 8) (Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are Co-ed)
3. JKR tweets

I also consider HP Lexicon to be a more authoritative source for quick lookup or fact checking than HP Wiki

** What I typically consider relevant canon, in order, is the 7 books, then Pottermore/Wizarding World, then everything else. Harry Potter is a massive franchise, owned by a massive company, that makes a ton of money. Like most things that make a ton of money there are a lot of cooks in the kitchen, so to speak, and the original intention gets muddled, nuiance gets lost, and little details often change.

Magic, for example, in the movie looks different in notable ways than it's described in the books because film is a different medium and you have to cater to it while also trying to get the gist of things, and that means you gotta change or cut things entirely, and that's ok. But abridgement is still abridgement, however necessary, and shouldn't be taken as gospel IMO.

Cursed Child and the Fantastic Beast movies I consider apocryphal at best because they are, in my opinion, rather blantant attempts to cash in on the popularity of the franchise and not born of something genuine or conceived with some artistic merit in mind. The numerous ways that Cursed Child contradicts, leans on, and rips off it's source material supports that.

(Not to say there's anything wrong with wanting to make money, but when the result is as bad as Cursed Child and Crimes of Grindelwald I become significantly less forgiving.)

But in the end what is or isn't canon is all semantics to me when it comes to fanfiction, because the point of fanfiction, to me, is to twist the canon in new and interesting ways. For example The Albus Potter series feels like a truer continuation to the books than the Cursed Child could ever hope to, and Contractual Invalidation is just a more interesting romance than anything we ever got in the books.
