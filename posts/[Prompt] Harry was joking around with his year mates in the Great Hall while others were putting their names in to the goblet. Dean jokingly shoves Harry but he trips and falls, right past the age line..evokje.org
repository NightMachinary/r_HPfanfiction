I was thinking maybe everyone is confused at why this happened. Harry could or could not be. You could also do either Harry is an immortal or it's the soul shard overriding the age line. Have fun!


** Before the professors can stop them, they've passed Harry bits of paper with the names of every student present, half the teaching staff, a house elf, a werewolf, a wanted fugitive, and Mrs. Norris. He drops them all into the goblet

Dumbledore is chosen as the Hogwarts champion, Harry as the fourth champion. In the interest of fairness, Karkaroff and Madame Maxime also enter the tournament to compete alongside their school's champion.

I see no way that this doesn't become a crack fic lmao, but I hope the ladylike Madame Maxime punches a dragon after Fleur gets burned.

** "Yeah, right, Harry. You'd be chosen for sure, give it a go!" Dean's eyes showed his mock challenge as he followed the dare up with a gentle shove.

"No thanks, *I'm out*!" Harry finished with a shout as he attempted to brace himself against the invisible wall he expected to be above the age line.

His shout of surprise was muffled by a sense of magic pressing all around him, like he was sinking into a wall of honey. His front seemed to resurface and he felt a buzzing pressure that made his ears pop. He sprawled onto the ground, thoroughly disoriented, taking care not to knock into the Goblet of Fire.

Then he heard a sound like a brush through hair. Then another and another. He looked up to see Dean with a two foot beard. Seamus and Ron had them, too. *Rhip rhip rhip* And Hermione, and... All through the great hall, every underage student felt themselves graced with Dumbledore's likeness. Silence reigned as the students stared, gobsmacked, at one another.

"Well, Harry," Dumbledore's smile was evident under his vintage beard, "If you're out of the ward, I suppose that makes the rest of us in."

** I just finished reading an [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2772010][OP dragon!harry]] (personality wise) where he attempted it just for the beard. He dressed up in robes like Dumbledore and everything afterward. Sure, it wasn't the best fic by any means, but his personality in it was pretty interesting.

** Even more weird.

He isn't James son, more like his brother. His Father and Mother did a weird device plot one time use spell to place the "seed" of his father into Lily because they both new James was for plot reasons infertile.

Nobody ever knows and this isnt even relevant in anyway to the plot.

**** Could be they did IVF, he's James's full brother and Lily the surrogate. Then the Goblet read his age as from the moment of conception, not birth.

Though if it worked that way, Fred and George would be able to enter, I think.

Unless everyone knows it works that way and that you have to add nine months to the number you set on your age line.
