So, I'm sitting on a couple of ideas that I might write as prompts, eventually.

One is a silly crossover fic, with Neville's toad Trevor being replaced by a different toad, Captain Toad. I haven't thought of a plot yet, just imagining how having a treasure-seeking Toad could replace a Remembrall.

The other is one I've been sitting on for a while, the concept that the Goblet of Fire's magically binding contract actually manifests as summoned daemons who act to physically enforce the contract's terms; I came up with a trio of such devils, Elvin, Liz and Gor, who follow Harry around to both help him prepare for the Triwizard, but also ensure he doesn't skive off.

--------------

The thing is, though, if those OCs are introduced, and interact with the main character (Neville or Harry), then when their dialogue and actions help to set up events, establish plot points, et-cetera, they're taking screen time away from canon characters who would normally do the same thing. I'm fairly sure that's a thing you want to avoid.

So, if you're introducing an OC to a fic, who's integral to the plot, how do you design things so that they don't completely take over everyone else's appearances?

Why would you want to avoid that? Some of the least creative fics out there are canon rehashes where the OC just adds nothing. Your goal should be to change the plot and setting because you are introducing new characters, otherwise, it is just Rowling's books but with X along the ride. Having someone else as Harry's friend will change situations like they don't fit under the cloak together, the OC was raised amongst the pureblood elite and therefore hates "that Weasley disgrace", therefore Harry has to mediate between the boys or a friendship ends because Hermione is jealous of the upstart outshining her.

And generally speaking, you want to introduce characters slowly. So when Harry and your OC share a class, it should be something along the lines of

#+begin_quote
  Harry entered the classroom, where Ron, Seamus and Hermione were already seated. There was also a new student, a rather mousy boy wearing Hufflepuff robes...
#+end_quote

and then slowly add more detail. Avoid introductions like

There was also a new student, a rather particular boy with cerulean eyes as cold as the Scottish winter, hidden behind a binge of golden hair.

*** This is good, succinct advice. There are few things more boring than a fic that adds in a completely new factor (OC) and then tells the same old story.

Also this

** These are wonderful ideas! If you do write these stories, it would be nice if you could message me the link.

Anyway, when you're introducing plot-important OCs, have them mentioned briefly. Then have them start setting up their task - briefly too. Slowly build up the OC until they make their confrontation. Be careful not to accidentally dive too fast, lest you need to battle writer's block when you're stuck with a giant time skip between scenes where you simply can't have a giant time skip!

** I don't think it's about screen-time so much as it is about the OCs taking over the ROLES of the canon characters, or in one way or the other making the canon characters redundant. You can have an OC as a major character no problem. You can even have a very powerful OC without too many problems., but the worst OCs are the ones who watlz in to show how much COOLER they are than the canon characters and who make everything about THEM.

Broadly speaking, an OC shouldn't be more famous than Harry, or be smarter than Hermione, or better at chess than Ron, or better with plants than Neville.

Also, of course, the OC shouldn't become the center of the canon characters' lives for no reason. If they ever become close to Homer Simpson's proposed treatment for Poochie (you know the one: "whenever Poochie's not on-screen, all the other characters should be asking ‘Where's Poochie?'”) you're doing it wrong.

An OC can, however, affect the plot. In some cases they can take over one of the functions of a canon character. That's fine; adding a new character will necessarily change the story up a bit. In fact, inserting a character might change things in the long run.

Take your trio of devils, for instance. They might end up taking over some of the roles of canon characters... for example, it doesn't seem likely that Harry would take that long finding out the clue with the egg with them around, neither would he be unable to find any ways of breathing underwater and have to be bailed out by Dobby's Gillyweed.

This means both Cedric and Dobby get one less function in the story. Cedric does not need to tell Harry about taking a bath with the egg (though he still might try to, just to show off that he's a decent person who wants things to be fair), and Dobby doesn't have to steal Gillyweed for Harry. This again means that Snape can't accuse Harry of stealing Gillyweed from his office and threaten with Veritaserum, which means Harry never overhears the conversation between Snape and Karakoff... the changes are small, but they add up after a while.

** It's a tricky balance if you want an OC to be interesting without turning them into a blackhole that sucks all life from the rest of the story. I'm not going to advise against Mary Sues, though -- there are a lot of canon characters who could qualify under the anti-Sue tests, and it's a term that has something of a stifling effect on new writers. Most pro authors have probably started out writing characters who could be considered Sues (regardless of gender), so it's not exactly a sin, just part of writing.

I like to think that OCs in fic are a lot like CGI in movies: highly noticeable when bad, and a seamless part of the story when done well.

One way you can keep an OC manageable is by having someone other than your OC be the POV character -- in other words, your OC is not the lens through whom we see the rest of the story. This lowers the ability for the OC to be too clever, or too awesome -- provided that the POV character isn't [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling][shilling]] the OC to the audience.

A similar route would be having a omniscient-style narrator to place some distance between the OC and the audience. Narrators are found in more old-fashioned stories, but there are modern examples, like /A Series of Unfortunate Events/ (although Lemony Snicket is a more overt/active example).

The third route would be reading some examples of good OCs and learning from them. One favorite example that comes to mind for me is actually a Self-Insert/SI-OC from *Dreaming of Sunshine" by Silver Queen, linkffn(7347955).

The /Naruto/ fandom actually has quite a few good examples of SI-OC fics done well, though not as many flat-out OCs. For /Harry Potter/ OCs, here's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/39ljsh/well_written_original_characters/][post]] on fics with them that people have liked.

Basically, a good OC is a lot like a good character in an original work -- someone who has depth. Depth is created through contrasting skills and flaws, and how they work with a particular character's past and personality. People who write bad OCs forget to add the flaws, or add ones that aren't really flaws: being too beautiful, or being clumsy, or being so great that people are jealous of them, just to name a few overdone and/or terrible examples.

These skills/strengths and flaws can change over time, a process that is called a "character arc," or sometimes "character development." It's mostly reserved for main characters, or ones who are vital to the plot in some way, though mini-arcs can sometimes occur for smaller characters. Most main characters will probably have some kind of arc that ends in them somehow changing (either for good or ill).

Occasionally, you can see well-written main characters who have no arc. This would make them a static character, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. In this case, the arc is shifted to either other characters (who grow and change, usually in reaction to the main character), or to the audience (who have their perception of the story and themselves change).
