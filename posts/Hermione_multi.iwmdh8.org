So Molly didn't think Hermione was good enough to marry into her family so Hermione does a ritual that will bring back people from the dead for her to marry, but the catch is that they are all related to Molly. So I remember Fred coming back and I think Fabian and Gideon and a few others.

Thanks for the help!!


** I think that this is it. It is the beginning of the fic even though it's labelled chapter three, I checked.
