So I've just finished PotDK up to where the author left it, and am a bit miffed/saddened/too desperately in love with this fic to accept that it's probably over. Accordingly, with the knowledge that a) some of the more popular fanfic south there have fanfic about them (HPMOR to name one) and b) this seems to be one of this sub's most popular works, I was wondering if anyone had done something similar with this, either diverging off at one point, picking up where the author seems to have left off, or just written something else in this specific alternate verse. Please let me know if you've ever come across/are writing/intend to write something of this nature. Thanks!
