Thoughts?

Thank you Mr [[/u/SteelbadgerMk2]] :)


** SB, I forgive you for not showing us everybody's reaction to Harry's Patronus, but just barely.

I was expecting time skip to be spread out over several chapters, but given the update rate as of late I can see why he decided to move the story along in one go. There's a lot of information to work with here.

*** Yeah, I'll admit my early plans actually had this arc extend to the fall of Minas Ithil in full Harry pov, and in that plan you would have got your wish.

Sadly, it was going to end up very disjointed, with many small time skips being needed to stitch the events together.

Also, a pet peeve of mine is crossovers where the narrative is just a loop of 'Harry does awesome thing, crossover people react with awe and amazement because he's so awesome!'. I may over correct.

**** Just to be clear, I absolutely adore your story, and I think the timeskip was probably a good idea. That said, it wouldn't have been awful to show us the ten minutes after he casts the patronus before the timeskip. :)

** I was half tempted to make a post similar to this.

I may have to let this sit for a bit before I give it a full review. I liked the format, even as I didn't like the fact we barely saw Harry. It was cool to see that he's had that large of an effect.

I also caught the bit that apparently the banners of the proto-Rohirrim include Prongs. That was a nice touch.

** You're welcome. But thank you for reading and prompting some great discussion. I love seeing just what goes through people's minds as they read my stories.

In other news, apparently Nimbus Llewelyn was sufficiently invested in a story that has updated like 2 times in the last two years that he made a TV Tropes page for my story.

I have spent far too much time on TV Tropes. In fact, I first started reading Harry Potter fanfiction many a year ago because I happened to discover the HPMoR page on TV Tropes and it intrigued me enough to go and read it. Of course, I quickly became disillusioned with it, but it created an itch that just needed to be scratched. The rest, as they say, is history.

I feel like I've come full circle.

*** You don't update the story very often, but you have fanatical fans. /Fanatical./

The care you've put in to thinking through the legendarium and Harry's impact on it is appreciated; it's one of the reasons the story feels so rich. Another is that it took quite so long for Harry to climb out of having practically no power at all into becoming a stupendous badass --- that made it feel earned, and thus vastly more satisfying.

Anyway, it seems to only happen once a year but whenever this updates I pretty much drop everything. I hope that it updates again soon; it would be nice to get more PoV Harry; this last chapter was interesting but it lacked some of the emotional satisfaction of watching Harry's long slow struggle close up, as well as his relationships with those around him. (One thing canon never hints at is what it must be like to form friendships over centuries; I suppose now we have a chance to see that through Harry's eyes.)

Oh, and did I mention that your fanatical fans would love it if you updated soon? Just in case I didn't, and just in case you weren't aware, /we love you, update soon./

I'm kinda miffed that we don't get to see Harry's growth and understanding of magic over the hundreds of years that have been timeskipped but it makes sense that would just be way too much to time to cover and it would've had little to no plot.

If not, what makes you think that? This update only shows a folktale passed down via word of mouth over a long time. We don't know that the actual fight was anything like what was described. I'd even say it was fairly clearly implied that they were embellishing heavily, given the description of Harry casting his patronus.

***** Right.. so that means Voldemort's dead, no? Harry meets Dumbledore, they see the fetus Voldemort, and in canon Harry comes back to life and it's over. Surely if Voldemort was still alive and a threat then a prominent part of Harry's motivation to return would be to deal with that situation. He just seems to want to go home, there's no concern for his friends' safety.

Is the witch-king really? I have to wonder what makes you say that, because this is the villain who got killed by an inexperienced sword-wielding muggle.

The only really worthwhile thing HP can offer LOTR is its magic and characters, LOTR just has such a better world. Maybe I could see someone coming through via the veil of death or something?

Soon it appeared as a great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night. Fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water.

I've not yet read the books in English, so beyond this and another excerpt i've read, i can't really judge how well Steelbadger copies the style of Tolkien. But at his time Tolkien was regarder as one of the formost authorities of the English language. Iirc.

Shadow of Angmar is very much a love letter to the Lord of thet Rings.

**** Well most of the lore mentioned comes neither from 'The Hobbit' nor LotR but from 'The Silmarillion', which is like a history collection from the creation of the world by the gods untill the LotR storyline, so that would be the most important lore. Thankfully the author does explain things very well and created this useful website with info. Though if you are a fan of the LotR franchise then I'd recommend reading 'The Silmarillion'. It is a long (and in my opinion relatively difficult) read but well worth it if you want to be an expert on middleearth.
