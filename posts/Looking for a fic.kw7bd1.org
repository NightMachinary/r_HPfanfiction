:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay so I remember reading a fic on ao3 with a fem harry that was the master of death and a necromancer and she wasnt the only one. Anyone who collected all three Hallows could become a master of death, so gellert grindelwald was one too and he was the bad guy for lack of a better term. Voldemort wasnt a thing if I remember correctly. I just can't remember the name and I've tried searching for it but I just cant find it so if anyone has read it, please let me know.
