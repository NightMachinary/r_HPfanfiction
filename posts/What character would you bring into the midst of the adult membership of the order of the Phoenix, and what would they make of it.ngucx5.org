Jumping off of NotSoSnarky's post, what character from another universe/franchise/book would you use to either ‘fix' the order of the Phoenix, or mess it up in an amusing fashion?


** Inspector Gadget... incompetent and oblivious but through sheer dumb luck and his dog and his niece's help he'd fuck the Death Eaters up without even knowing it. Then everyone would be praising him as a hero.

** I have several ideas of characters that could, maybe with magical help, seriously fuck up Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

Frank Castle, aka The Punisher. Castle discovers that his illegitimate daughter (happens in the MAX publishing line) is a witch about to start attending Hogwarts. He also discovers that she was injured in a Death Eater attack on Diagon Alley. Castle then decides to hunt down and slaughter every last Death Eater and Voldemort ally.

The resulting bloodshed leaves many in the Order, the Ministry and Voldemort's side horrified and sickened.

Other idea- /John Wick/(universe, not necessarily the character).

Voldemort runs afoul of the Continental or the High Table.

Deadpool or Wolverine (or both) get involved. They revive from the killing curse unharmed but angry. Crucioing them only makes them angrier.

**** The original Hellblazer run of Constantine was a low magic conman who finessed his way through the supernatural in his universe. He's definitely very morally gray, as in the first issue of Hellblazer he sacrifices one of his old friends who accidently let a demonic parasite loose as a means of pacifying it, albeit he does it reluctantly. The Constantine in the DC universe is much more watered down, with him acting more like DC's Dr. Strange instead with him using magic more often.

  The city is in chaos. Huge events are taking place in the Back Alley Market, and Legosi and Melon are battling for the heart of a civilized society while Louis appeals to the world at his press conference, but back at Cherryton, the students are anxious and terrified. The Drama Club still has to put on their new production of Adler with Juno and Pina in the lead roles, and the student body nervously gathers in the auditorium to watch while their world burns in the city nearby.

Also, imagine the look of bafflement on their faces when Strange tries to explain that he was just an average No-Maj who /learned to do magic/ instead of just inheriting it (like the wizards).

** I realised that I never actually contributed, so I'll admit that I currently have two crossover wips:

One involves a Sirius Black who is ex boyfriends with Remus stumbling upon Dr John Watson in a Muggle pub. He wears cardigans, is even tempered, and is /exactly/ Sirius' type. After a few beers they go back to John's place and make out like teenagers but then fall asleep together because Sirius is not in a place to be having sex straight away.

Obviously Sherlock stumbles upon them, and says something like ‘I knew you weren't really a mass murderer' or something (I'm having trouble with writing Sherlock, I have to admit. I'm not exactly a Sherlock fan so it's slow in coming). Obviously these very rational Muggles are going to bring a dose of scepticism and sarcasm to the Order, and possibly kidnap Harry or something...I haven't gotten to that bit yet. Can't wait to introduce Tonks to Sherlock, it's going to be a blast. And Moody. That will be fun too.
