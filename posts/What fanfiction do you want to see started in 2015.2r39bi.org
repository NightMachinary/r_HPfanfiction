The tag says HP/LV, but honestly what's there is rather light all things considered, and the story is still focused on the plot--separation of wizards and muggles. I can't remember if there was any bashing, but I don't think there was any in Harry's canon circle of allies.

Basically, Harry's doing a time travel fix-it, and his solution is to move the WW up to the moon. Complete at 11 chapters, 145k word count.

*** I think that Slytherin Ron /without/ Slytherin Harry would be very interesting and, as far as I know, pretty rare.

I'd posted a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2p39mq/what_novel_or_oneshot_idea_would_you_like_to_see/cmtb5vt][description of the premise]] a few weeks ago: Ron feels overshadowed by his brothers and neglected in favour of his baby sister; per the mirror of Erised, he wants, more than anything, to be important, to be admired and respected, so the Hat puts him in Slytherin, and, suddenly, it's much harder to be known for being Harry Potter's best mate.

Frustrated by Draco's constant flaunting of his wealth and digs about Ron's family's poverty, Ron turns his efforts to pursuit of wealth and influence, parlaying his vaunted talents for chess into networking, trading favours, negotiation, eventually brokering. His brothers, who were previously unreachable high-achievers, are now invaluable connections.

In short, he becomes his generation's Horace Slughorn (sans Potions).

I don't disagree. However, it's the closest thing to a "special ability" he has in canon, and it fits neatly into the premise.

Actually, I think the best SlytheRon would be one who is just as lazy when it comes to studying as he is in canon, perhaps even more so. Let others be good at magic. If Ron needs some complicated magic done, he is going to call in a favor here and there to get the Hermiones of the world to do it for him.

Nevertheless, I admit I very much enjoyed reading this particular fem!Harry--it's rather different than what's normally being updated.

Gray/Dark, manipulative, emotionally stunted, kind of mob-boss-like--well, pretty much a mob boss yeah. No bashing on Draco, Ron, or Hermione. Big plans, mostly involving illegal things. Like the underworld.

A warning: there are hints of romance and relationships, the diary!TMR/HP becoming more hinted at in the most recent chapters, but the author hasn't confirmed in her A/Ns if there will be a clear cut relationship for Harry (or more specifically TMR/HP).

Either way, imo the (possible) pairing doesn't detract from what made the fem!Harry of the story attractive to begin with.
