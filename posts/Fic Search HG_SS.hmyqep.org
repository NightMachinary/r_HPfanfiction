:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a Hermione/Severus story. 99% positive it's a Marriage Law fic as the scene I remember, they are married and its during the war.

The scene I remember: Hermione is joining the Order of the Phoenix and to do so, she needs another Order member to become her oathkeeper (or something like that). Naturally, she chooses her husband, Snape. Everyone goes quiet and/or gets upset saying she needs someone more "trustworthy"...as if he's not good enough. She gets mad and refuses to pick anyone else.

I dont remember much else that goes with this story as I'm afraid I would mix it up with other fics.


** Following. I can picture this scene in my head and remember enjoying the story but can't remember the title.
