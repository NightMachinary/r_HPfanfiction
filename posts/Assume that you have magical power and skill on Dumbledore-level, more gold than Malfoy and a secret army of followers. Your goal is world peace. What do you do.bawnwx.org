** Conquering the world by yourself is unlikely to work properly. It'll make you too many enemies to handle. But what if you're the one saving the world from getting conquered?

Create a new threat to the entire world. Make them seem a lot more powerful than they are and easy to hate. Aliens would work and with a flying invisible car being something an average ministry worker can create as a hobby project, a giant spaceship suddenly appearing in orbit should be doable. The aliens will be stupid artificial magical creations, seemingly controlled by an alien AI but actually by yourself.

The attack will start with aliens demonstrating power by blowing up monuments, lots of outrage with minimal effort. Then during the second attack you'll just happen to be there and demonstrate that they can be killed with magic, also breaking secrecy. Then you'll call for everyone, wizards and muggles, to unite against the aliens, and eventually after a lot of battles you'll arrange it for aliens getting captured and revealing a hidden weakness in the ship (which you placed there in advance), resulting in a star wars-esque heroic victory for humanity.

But that won't be it, just when everyone thinks it's over and they can go back to fighting each other, the last captured alien will reveal that their home planet is preparing for a much bigger attack, and that they aren't expecting a counterattack and the only way for humanity to win is to attack the alien home planet. Unfortunately the alien will die before revealing the location of the planet (since it doesn't exist).

Thus, united humanity has to stay united and use the freshly developed magical spaceship technology to build up a counter attack force and explore the galaxy to find the alien home. Decades later the alien home will still not have been found and the expected second attack has never happened, but humanity has colonized half the galaxy and magic is mostly integrated with technology, with wizards getting very well paid jobs in the spaceship industry, enchanting warp drives and transporters. You get bored getting celebrated as the heroic leader in the fight against the aliens and decide to leave the civilization for a while and explore the galaxy on one of the new ships. Maybe you'll find real aliens.

These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no man has gone before!
