** This has been done a 1000 times. To be honest i didnt finish the third paragraph because /I already knew what you were going to say/. Everybody that has read fanfiction for a certain amount of time /know these facts/. If your story is about harry ranting and ranting and ranting then I already know your story. If it isn't done in an interesting way then it will be flamed because its neither new nor original nor entretaining.

EDIT:

If you condone bashing in any way in fanfiction then you /will/ deserve what its coming. WE ALL "know* abusing and meddling in a childs life is wrong, i dont want to read about it all the freaking time.

*** Oh ok. So it doesn't matter what I want Harry's story to be. If I want to be read he has to follow the classic path. Well I hadn't plan for Harry to rant and rant. I had planned for him to declare his intention and then do as he pleased. Sure there would have been opposition here and there but I would have been minor. If it isn't new, original and entertaining. Nothing really is. The canon and tropes have been used up. Yes I decided to play into some well-known tropes but that doesn't mean it won't be entertaining, and that doesn't mean I should get flames. I'm not paid for what I do, I do it willingly and put the effort, I do not deserve to receive hate comments. The end of the story is one click away. What would you consider an interesting fanfiction?

**** You were ranting all over the post. If your writing is any similar to your fic then it is bashing and i am not going to indulge in counter arguing.

I can read your fic and if it seems bashing i /am/ going to point it out. So yeah send me the link. It wont be the first nor the last fic like that i read.

***** I have taken it down. I will not continue it. But yes, I was ranting in the post. No, I don't rant when I write. Perhaps you would think so. Everyone is entitled to their opinion after all.

How would you write an independent Harry without falling into bashing? Because he has to improve his situation somehow.

****** Several ways:

studying topics outside the norm: runes, arithmancy. this gives the freedom of JKR not saying anything about this topic so you have complete freedom about this. Hell all the magic system can be anything you make it and then make Harry really do something with it.

Make harry not go to Hogwarts and lead a path that crossed the other characters but its not forces.

Eg. Fantastic Elves and where to find them.

To me Harry being independent should not be a focus but merely a trait. When you center everything on Indy!Harry to me its already biases in some way.

** It depends on how you had him establish those boundaries Did he rant at everybody? Did he even try to simply push them or politely tell them to back off? Or did he simply blow up? Because that's less establishing boundaries more throwing a temper tantrum

** The arguments over this have been hashed multiple times over. I would, however, like to point out that according to your principles of autonomy, people are more than welcome to their own opinion of your work.

** There are two things to say:

- Most of fanfics are as far as I know written by teenagers for teenagers. Therefore, it is very natural, that the authority figures (and anybody supposedly “good” or “light”) are suspicious and even despised. See [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][my review]] of linkffn(11916243) for more.

- What I wrote yesterday in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/eu8jh5/canon_conjecture_and_confusion_of_the_two/ffmv248/]] ... if you try to analyse especially PS from the point of view of the whole HP universe as revealed later (and even on Pottermore) you get to rather awful image of Albus Dumbledore (and some things are never explained at all ... if he was the Chief Warlock of Wizengamot, why he cannot order the trial for Sirius Black who hadn't one? ... I think JKR just never thought about it and it hangs out as pretty ugly stain on his character).

** If you had all that in one chapter, I'm not surprised at the reaction. I didn't read it, but it sounds like something that would come across as more of an author rant and less of a fic, which is unfortunate because otherwise, it sounds like something I would really like.

That sort of revolt generally starts slowly; first pushing against non-authority figures (say Ron and Hermoine), expanding the nominal authority figures (Sirius, Molly, etc.), and then to real authority figures (Dumbledore, the Dursleys), as the character learns their own power and gains confidence. If the fic had started with a triggering incident and the rebellion took place over a number of chapters, I suspect it could have had a much different reaction. Sticking it all in chapter one would feel to me more like an author's agenda than a story.
