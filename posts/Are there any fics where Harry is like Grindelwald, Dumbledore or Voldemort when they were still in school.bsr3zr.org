  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=190897&chapter=0][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] might scratch that itch. I've linked to a 3rd party backup of the story that has 23 chapters as uposed to FF.net which only has 12.

*** The issue is that he's closer to the three aforementioned as adults than they are as teens in most of those fics. I like to think Voldemort only became a serious threat to Dumbledore around the time he returned to apply for DADA. Grindelwald was always a threat, simply because no one aside from Dumbledore really had the capabilities to stop him.

My favorite read of canon is that Dumbledore is slowing down. He has the elder wand, but without it, he probably wouldn't be able to duel Voldemort like he does. I feel even Dumbledore would have eventually succumbed to Voldemort before Harry disembodied him.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
