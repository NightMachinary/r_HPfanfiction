Does anyone know of any good Weasley twins-centric fics? I love them so terribly much, and some fanfic authors write them so well! I.E: I love how they finish each other's sentences, how they literally feed off of each other, and their general prankster-ness. But I find that I don't find that many /good/ fanfics that actually star them? Either they're just background characters, or they don't fit my standards of... decent quality, really.

I literally have just about no standards, plot-wise. It can be purely humor, with nothing in terms of goals other than to cause as much of a menace in Hogwarts as possible; it could be a romance (twincest or otherwise), I just really really really want good twin interaction. And... I mean, I am a bit of a grammar nazi, so there's that as well. If any of you have anything in mind, I'll definitely check it out!


** This one is short but I absolutely love it. I hope you do to! Linkffn(4556057)

*** Ah, thank you! (:\\
I normally don't read oneshots, mostly because I have such a thing for long, novel-length fics that I can sink my teeth into. I've come to realize however, that the more obscure the request, the more you need to just take what you can get xD .\\
I haven't come across this yet, so I'll definitely give it a go! Thanks again!
