I've read a couple of Harry/Muggle fics, but not any with the other parts of the trio dating muggles, so rec what you got!

Thanks in advance! :)


** That could be interesting. I can't see Ron managing it, though, unless the girl in question was allowed to know about magic; he just wouldn't have the world knowledge nor deception/misdirection skills. Hermione might be able to pull it off. Sorry, though, I can't think of any offhand.

*** Canon!Ron can't pull it off. But a canon-ish Ron might *almost* manage it if he had /a lot/ of input from Harry and Hermione. Or maybe if he had a job where he had to interact w/ muggles regularly, or if Hermione had introduced him to certain aspects of the muggle world that he really enjoyed like RTS video games (I can totally see Ron going crazy over something like Starcraft or Warcraft III).

  At the reading of Sirius Black's will several shocking revelations leave Harry Potter and Nymphadora Tonks reeling. How will things change for them? And what about that crazy, drunken contract between James Potter and Sirius? What will this mean for Harry and Tonks? AU after Order of the Phoenix. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

**** Thanks. Sorry about the slow updates. I'm having trouble channeling that 1920s optimism these days.

For the impatient, I have a different story in which Lucius Malfoy marries a muggle. It's fast and complete.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
