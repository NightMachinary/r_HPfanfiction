** Try linkffn(Lord of Time by debstheslytherinsnapefan) It's done really well (one of my fav authors) it has good progression and it's basically MoD!Harry in the Riddle-era. No MPreg and Dark!Harry.

Or you linkffn(Embracing his true self by debstheslytherinsnapefan) this one is still in the golden era and it's basically Harry his been hiding in a mask his whole life and now he lives with Voldemort that slowly progresses to a relationship.

These are both by Debstheslytherinsnapefan. They right really good fanfics.

  Harry is the Master of Death and Lord of Time through his joining of the three Hallows together. During a duel that wasn't going well, he jumps to the 1940's and has a talk with the true Master of Death. Can have prevent the destruction that will occur? Can he change Voldemort prevent him from becoming the darkest wizard of all time? Or will he be caught in Tom's web? Slash TMR/HP?

** linkffn(Death is but the Next Great Adventure by ObsidianQuill; Of Lies and Deceit and Hidden Personas by Jessiikaa15)

Both are unfortunately not finished but they are very good and the authors do post another chapter every once in a blue moon.

  What if that night in Godric's Hollow went differently? What if Harry did die? What if Death stepped in and made a deal with the Savior of the Wizarding World? How different would Harry's life be after that deal? (Or, Harry makes a deal with Death and in exchange gains something Voldemort has fought his entire life for. Immortality. And a strange friendship with Death) (Harry/Tom)

  Everything changes the summer of 5th year when a mere letter causes Harry's magic to react wildly and he finds out that Dumbledore has been controlling him and his friends a lot more than first thought. With the truth revealed to him, Harry shows everyone he isn't the Gryffindor Golden Boy everyone thinks he is and he isn't the only the one with masks. DarkEvilTrio! SLASH
