Is there any fic out there that matches the criteria of indy!Harry, so manipulative!Dumbledore, evil!Weasleys, conspiracy against BWL and so on (doesn't have to hit all the numbers, but you get the idea), but where Harry is actually careful, thoughtful and genuinely smart, rather than angry and hotheaded?

I think you're going to have trouble finding this. Not because it wouldn't be interesting, but because...well...the whole bashing/evil characters/WBWL/etc. ideas are not really canon and are almost exclusively used as a reasoning for why Harry is not a super-genius ubermensch who never gets anything wrong. In other words, the former aspects are invented and/or magnified to ridiculous proportions to justify the latter, aka Harry's frankly above-average but not prodigious abilities and intellect in canon being 'everyone else' fault.'

I think a more interesting spin on the whole Indy!Harry idea would be Harry going the way of Indy!Harry and thinking everyone is against him, only to find that view is incredibly simplistic and born out of skin-deep thinking of the situation(s). The best example I have found of this (and possibly your request) might be linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane), as a fic that starts Indy-ish and slowly morphs into something with more nuance. I have actually found this tends to happen as authors improve and write for longer; they think more about how the characters and world they have set-up actually stack up to real world situations and people. This is also why a /lot/ of Indy fics are almost exclusively abandoned, as the longer the authors write the more they dislike the characterizations (and realize that without the whole bashing/manipulation/power-wank the story ends up somewhat hollow).

Sorry for the long response by the way.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

*** Yeah, I figured there can't be many fics around here matching these specs, I was just hoping some people knew of a few. Nice rec anyway.
