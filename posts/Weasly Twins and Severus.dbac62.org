The Twins learn that their inventing and potions prowess comes from a family member.... Severus Snape. The professor may not be ready for what is coming.

**** I'd love to see a fic that does Snape/Molly well ðŸ¤” I guess Snape could have had twins with Lily, which Lily wanted to hide from James and thus gave them to the Weasleys... it would explain the red hair at least :)

***** I've seen Snape/Molly once (or at least the fic seemed to be heading in that direction) during the Second Wizarding War. I stopped reading it because I found the fic far too angsty (it was a huge epic with a lot of filler portraying how miserable his life was).

Personally I always saw the Weasleys as having orange-red hair and Lily as auburn (dark red), meaning that the twins would have a rather distinct hair color, so passing off Lily's children as Weasleys would be rather tricky (since they'd be bound to have other differences as well, with a different hair color making them stand out).
