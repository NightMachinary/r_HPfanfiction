Does anyone know if it is cannon that any children born to those who are under a love spell/potion unable to feel love?

I've seen a lot of people saying that the reason Voldemort is so awful and unable to feel empathy and such is because his father was under a love potion, and this means Voldemort is unable to feel love, or other emotions related to love.

Is this canon, or is it one of those Fanon theories that's been around so long people only thin it is canon?


** The potion probably played some part, yes, but not to the extent of what we see in Voldemort. Surely he wasn't the only child conceived that way?

No, my view is that love-potion children might find it harder to love, but not impossible. What happened to Voldemort was probably a combination of:

- The love potion.

- Inbreeding Gaunt-madness.

- Haughty Riddle (and Gaunt) arrogance.

- A lack of family.

- The effects of World War II (Tom did sound hesitant to return, while talking to Dippet in the office).

- Living in an old-fashioned orphanage (they weren't exactly the best of places, though we don't know whether or not Wool's was all that bad).

- His own innate vision of being superior to others.

It's hard to say just where, exactly, Voldemort went wrong and how effective various treatments might've been on him specifically, but I highly doubt that the complete package stemmed from being conceived under the love potion itself.

That's more likely fanon.

** Rowling said that was what it symbolically represented but that things could have been different. So, fanon but only just, it could be canon debatable.

** Literally 'being concieved when one of your parents had a lover potion in your system magically removes your ability to feel lover permentantly' is entirely fanon, if that. Given how avaliable love potions seem to be, if that was the case, even wizards must have noticed.

Metaphorically, the fact that Voldemort's father was magically raped by his mother, so that he abadoned his son in an orphanage and then Voldemort finding this out probably didn't do wonders for his empathy, but that is more of a generic 'nurture' effect than anything to do with magic I feel.

** Fanon.

But there's plenty of real-world evidence that kids raised in loveless orphanages are unable to feel love.

*** Yeah, being held by a human as a baby has been proven to help develop baby's brains, it's so wild!

So it was definitely nurture over nature/potioned rape of the father that â€˜made him evil'

** I'm pretty sure it was either implied by Dumbledore or JKR mentioned it in an interview

** I think it's one of those post canon Joanne keeps adding stuff canon. I hate it personally so I've thrown it out the window (but I'm not exactly known for adhering to canon religiously anyway)

But yeah that one was Jo, not fans
