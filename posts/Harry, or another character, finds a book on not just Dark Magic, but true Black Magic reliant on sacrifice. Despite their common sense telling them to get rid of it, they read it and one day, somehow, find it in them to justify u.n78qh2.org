Who found it?

What kind of Black Magic is it?

Where did they find it?

When will it come back to haunt them?

Why did they justify using it?

How did they find a use for Black Magic?

â€‹

For note, I am of the thinking that Dark and Light Magic uses negative and positive emotions respectively, while Black and White Magic use unwilling and willing sacrifices (people, animals, things, ect). Feel free to interperate the terms Black and White Magic differently. It is fantasy after all.


** Dark rituals that can destroy weakened main soul of individual with Horcruxes, without the need find them.

The price is sacrificing innocent children.

This book is hidden among Dumbledore's secret stash, dark magic books he had acquired, but unwilling to destroy. It was however Grindelwald who first found this particular book in Magical Egypt and translated into German. After Dumbledore became aware of Voldemort's Horcruxes, he translated this section into English, with the intention of using it as a final resort.

Hermione read this book during their Horcrux hunt, as she found it curious that Dumbledore kept a German magic book. But when she explained that section to Harry, he completely ruled it out.

Several months later, after they were stuck on their hunt, Hermione mentioned it again. Harry again refused, after a somewhat heated argument. Then they came across an extremely gruesome Death Eater atrocity, and he finally changed his mind:

"If we do not stop him, hundreds, thousands, or even millions will suffer their horrible fate. The lives of 7 innocent children may very well be worth it, if this ritual works!"

*** I love the seduction of the Dark Arts. It's JUST 7 children... and then the next Dark Lord appears and it's JUST one life... and then it's just one life to help protect Hogwarts for generations, and only a few lives to root out the traitors in the Ministry. Eventually it is yearly rituals to help safeguard against future Dark Lords.... etcetera etcetera

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
