#+TITLE: There's a reason the daily prophet is dangerous. Unlike muggles the collective unconscious of wizards is real and is even studied by the unspeakables. Every dark lord that has ever risen understands this. Because if the public believes they are invincible they really might become it.

** I really like the idea of magic being a collective subconscious 'consciousness'. I remember a fic where there were no horcruxes, but Voldemort couldn't truly die until Dumbledore and Harry managed to break the death eaters' belief in him.

Like it was horribly written, but one of those rare cases where you push through because it's interesting.

** You could spin the ministry's denial at Voldemort being back as a desperate attempt to suppress his resurgence, but Dumbledore's insistence as an (unknowing) aid to prevent it.

** Sounds like the Ork effect on the warp with their Waagh. If enough orcs believe red goes faster, then ships painted red go faster. If enough believe da warboss is de toughest git around, then he becomes the toughtlest gir around.
