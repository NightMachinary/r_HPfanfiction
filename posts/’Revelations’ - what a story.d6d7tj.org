I had recently started exploring rare pairings, specifically Hermione/anyone and everyone, and managed to stumble across this fic. It's a Hermione/Lucius, something I had avoided for a long time since I just don't really see it happening...

But oh my God, was I wrong! This book is so freaking good! It has everything you could ask for; romance, drama, hurt/comfort, action, mystery, family, tragedy, etc... It's beautiful and so well written, that I just had to recommend it.

Read it, you won't regret it, I promise you!

** Tried to read it, sorry, but that was bad. I never get how people can honestly say all these stories are /good/, like people who write praising comments in Oh God Again and MOR and shit. It's just bad. They have low standards, or they don't even recognize what standards are.

*** Or we simply don't have the same taste in books... I liked it, you didn't and that is fine... But to accuse me of having low standards because you found the book lacking, is just unnecessary and uncalled for, not to mention rude...

** I'll give it a try. :)

The only Hermione/Lucius (Lucimione?) fic I've read was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3494886/1/Eden][Eden]] and it was such an incredibly intense, emotionally devastating story that I just couldn't put down until the end. It's very dark and has a ton of trigger warnings, but if that's something you can get past then you should give it a chance. I've read it years ago and it's still the first thing that pops into my mind when I hear Hermione/Lucius.
