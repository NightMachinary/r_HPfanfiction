:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've read "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]]" and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8046571/1/The-Diadone-Method][The Diadone Method]]", both have Lupin as this muggle criminal...

Both have their hilarities, looking for something similar.

EDIT: Also, read the Triwizard AU "One Wizard Too Many":\\
Lupin was an arms dealer before taking the DADA position.

Basically, looking for fics with Lupin working in the legally grey professions.
