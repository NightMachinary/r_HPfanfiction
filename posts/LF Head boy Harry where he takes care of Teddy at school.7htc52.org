I don't remember all the details, but Harry ends up head boy and has to take care of Teddy. I think Greengrass is head girl and Ron cheats on Hermione at some point.

*** Thanks that's probably it. The second half was too similar to what I was thinking to not be it unless someone blatantly plagiarized.

  What if Hermione had accidently Disapparated along with Ron during the hunt while trying to stop him? How would Harry have managed to defeat Voldemort alone? Watch as Harry takes a bold step forward with determination and new allies. This is canon compliant until the scene where Harry and Ron fight in Book 7. Two shot -- COMPLETE
