Hi there,

a while ago I printed a hardcover version of the Fan Fiction James Potter and the Hall of Elders Crossing.

Now I want to print the sequels too. For the first one I had a version where the pagination was on top. Also this version had a front, spine and a back cover. (the one with the drawing). I can't find equivalent ones for the sequels. Does any one have them?


** The author deleted his website so I'm not sure if the printable copies are still around. His twitter account is still up so you could try DMing him that way and ask for them?
