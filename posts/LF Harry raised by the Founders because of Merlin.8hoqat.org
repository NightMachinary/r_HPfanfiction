I read this story a few years ago and absolutely loved it, but I can't seem to find it anywhere right now. These are some key points about the story:

- Merlin could travel to anywhen he wanted. He took Harry from his time and brought him to Hogwarts during the Founders' time.
- Harry got private lessons from the Founders with each founder teaching their specialty (e.g. Slytherin taught Potions, Gryffindor transfiguration etc.)
- Harry learned wandless magic. He 'edited' the accio spell to bring the object to him immediately in a blink instead of having to travel the whole way.
- At first, Slytherin couldn't stand Harry. But then it got out that Harry was a parselmouth, so Slytherin had to help him control his gift. Pretty sure that he was eventually nicknamed Sal.
- When he had to be sent back to his own time (at 11 years of age), the Founders all gave him some things to remember them by in a trunk.

I hope someone knows this story and can link it, because I'd love to read it again. Thanks for the help!

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.
