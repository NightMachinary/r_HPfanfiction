So now that I've posted the second chapter I feel like there's enough there for people to get a feel for exactly where I'm going with this story.

Femdom isn't exactly everyone's cup of tea, but I decided to write this story because that particular subject has a jarring lack of content.

This story will eventually get quite explicit, but it obviously won't just be pure smut.

This fic will be updated on Wednesdays.

** The story has its moments, but sometimes Harry's issues feel almost comically exaggerated. Like the time when Hermione leaves for some research and he is at a complete loss what to do. Not just "no idea what to do, let's turn on the telly or rub one out", but more like "Harry.exe has stopped working."

Harry enjoying Hermione's directions and even his inner struggle feel believable (I have no personal experience in that regard, but it is not outstandingly odd), but someone who had managed to survive alone for a year wouldn't forget everything within a couple of days.

*** Well I at least tried to show that "not knowing what to do" is basically what Harry was doing while he was surviving for the last year. That wasn't supposed to be so much a comment on Hermione specifically, as a contrast to how he was behaving before she showed up.

**** But he had to do something for that time, even if it was just watching the telly. I mean, you can't just stare at a wall for twelve months.

And Harry's musings seem a little... Drastic, for the lack of a better term. He goes from not really knowing what's going on straight down the deep end. Hermione feels on point and their interactions are fine as well, but Harry seems a little extreme for someone who hasn't even properly realised what he is feeling.

***** Hmmm... perhaps this is more difficult for me to see without outside input because I have much more of the story in my head than I've published. Thank you very much for the insight, there are certain things I was going to get into in later chapters that I should have perhaps touched on in these two.

I wasn't going to deeply explore Harry's mental state until Hermione started to see it as something that would stop them from getting into a proper relationship, I was just planning on covering the surface of it until then.

But, in doing so, I can see how it would leave Harry's character feeling a bit incomplete until I do that.

I'll have to think about whether or not I'd prefer to just continue forward until I reach the point I was planning on or update the chapters already posted.

Again, thank you for reading and also for being so willing to give such constructive feedback.

** Woohoo.. God bless scheduled'ish updates.. Truely a magnificent thing.. I am unbelievably exited to see this story and TBW in particular.. Especially because most BDSM stories are just smut.. Having stories that try to do a Slice Of Life take on stuff with a BDSM twist is not something i can recall ever coming across.. and mad bonus points for flipping roles between stories.. .. I'm not as enthusiastic about Baby Fever, truth be told.. not entirely sure why.. will probably still keep with it though..

*** I'm glad you're enjoying all my current stories! I can't link TBW here because of Rule 5, but I'm glad you found it and thought it was interesting.

Baby Fever is really supposed to be something closer to unrepentant smut but with enough strong characterization among all the characters and comedy to make it an entertaining read in between. The sequel to Baby Fever though, which I'm tentatively calling *Go Ask Your Mothers*, will basically be a story of all their kids growing up in a crazy, unrealistic harem family, and how that unrealistic situation might realistically turn out, especially with all of them pregnant at the same time (approximately).

That's to make sure I continue having at least one story that I don't have to be quite as careful with the plot about, or spend so much time crafting each chapter.

After an update slot opens up (that is, a story is finished), the next one up is *Just Magic*

** Just Magic
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: just-magic
   :END:
*Harry/Fleur Romance*

#+begin_quote
  When Fleur asked for Harry's help with a bit of magic that is fairly rare, Harry thought she was playing a joke on him at first. He'd never heard about sex-powered spells in school... granted, that didn't seem like something they would teach there. But Fleur had insisted that it was just magic, nothing more. Well, just sex and magic, nothing more. Nothing more...
#+end_quote

Then we have two more stories that I'll start releasing as I have more update slots open:

** Patchwork Soul
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: patchwork-soul
   :END:
*Harry/fem!Riddle or Harry/Ginny/Riddle depending on perspective, Angst & Romance*

#+begin_quote
  Tom's teenage self was reeling. Having your soul shattered and then forced to absorb parts of an 11 year old girl would do that. But this wasn't the world or the time he --- or she now --- remembered, and unfortunately the only person that could understand felt nothing but hatred. Oh yes, Harry was most unhappy about Ginny being killed.
#+end_quote

** Kismet Entwined
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: kismet-entwined
   :END:
*Harry/fem!Neville Adventure & Romance*

#+begin_quote
  When Harry first arrived at Hogwarts he was pleased to find himself making friends. Ron was someone he got along with easily, but he quickly started to get close to one of the first year Gryffindors who seemed to have a lot in common with him: Cecilia Longbottom. No matter what happened, it seemed their fates were connected by threads that neither could understand.
#+end_quote

Finally, I'm still developing concepts for the following stories:

- A story that basically focuses on the futa kink that's much more in the style of Baby Fever, though probably not a mass harem fic.
- An Avatar: The Last Airbender story that is Zuko-centric (though probably not Zutara) that is set at the beginning of Season 2 or end of Season 1 (possibility I might do a crossover with this, but unlikely)
- A time-travel fic where Harry involuntarily keeps reliving his entire life every time he dies (sometimes young, sometimes old) and when we join him has lived a total of something close to 250,000 years worth of lives

EDIT:

Also, next chapter of TBW should be released within 24 hours.
