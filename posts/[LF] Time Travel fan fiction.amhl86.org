I'm looking for a fan fiction where Harry Potter goes back in time and then returns to the present taking the long way. (Not Basilisk-born)


** A Long Journey Home is another great one, albeit incomplete and possibly abandoned.

*** It's endlessly amusing to me that these fic searches are just rock/paper/scissors of long journey home/ basilisk born/ wizard from earth

** Linkffn(Voldemort's Last Spell by Louis IX) It has some crossover with X Men and maybe Naruto (it has been a long time since I read it). It is abandoned though but it fulfills your Harry sent back in time criteria.

Linkffn(The Wishmaster by lokilette) Harry is sent back to the Founders' time. He is raised by Slytherin (it does not go into the details as much as you'd expect.) It deals more with the Deathly Hallows than the time travel in the later parts.

  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?

#+begin_quote
  Lily is prepared to do anything to save her son, so with her dying breath she finishes the ritual to cast her wish to the Wishmaster, asking to send Harry back into the past. Years before that fateful event, a green-eyed toddler is found by Salazar Slytherin, who decides to take him in as an heir. But the child has dreams much greater than simply being Slytherin's heir.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
