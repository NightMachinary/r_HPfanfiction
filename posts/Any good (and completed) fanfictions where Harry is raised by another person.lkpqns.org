Does anyone have any good fanfictions that are *completed* where Harry was raised by someone else? He doesn't have to be a light. or dark wizard, as long as he has political power. Preferably with Weasley/Hermione bashing, Dumbledore is optional.

​

Could even include time travel, I honestly don't care as long as the fic is good


** "When in Doubt, Obliviate" probably has the most unique take on someone else raising him: Harry Potter, adopted son of Gilderoy Lockhart.

** I hope you're still looking for recommendations! I saved this on mobile a month ago hoping to come back when I had time.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]]: The story you never knew you wanted. The year: 1987. The place: Muggle London. The situation: The Boy-Who-Lived is being treated horribly by his Muggle relatives. A young witch must take him in for the Ministry's good and his. The witch's name: Dolores Umbridge. COMPLETE.\\
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is perhaps the most unique fic I've read in the fandom. The writing style and concept are just totally different than anything else I've read. You'll note that I'm not giving up any information; it's best to go into this one blind. It's a oneshot
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]] Harry gets adopted by a different Remus, one whose parents abandoned him for being a werewolf so he had to start a life of crime. This is a oneshot.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. Harry is raised by Remus and Severus. It is complete.
- Also by the author of TSLoP (see previous) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter, so he raises himself. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.

** I don't have a lot with Weasley bashing so some of these might contain it and some might not but they are all raising harry/harry eventually gets a family. It's been awhile since I have read some of these. There a couple where the writing might not be great, but the stories were enjoyable - they were included.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1555228][Aftermath of Hogwarts]] this one is a little different from the others. It starts after the battle of Hogwarts and has different scenarios. Some are better than others.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][Wise One Series]]. The link is for book one.

This one starts in the Marauders Era and is basically canon up until POA. Sirius doesn't stay in hiding, he gets his freedom and gets custody of Harry [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/61511][A Bond of Family]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/487526][A Marauders Plan]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2129089/1/Truths][Truths Series]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1449436][Building Family]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12484195/1/][Savior of Magic]] this one kind of goes off the rails at one point. Harry is kind of raised by a ghost. Powerful Harry - Ravenclaw Harry - Harry/Daphne

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13306737/1/][A Marauder's Legacy]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1989831/chapters/4309809][Raised by Wolves]] - I do remember having some issues with how this was written but I enjoyed the premise.
