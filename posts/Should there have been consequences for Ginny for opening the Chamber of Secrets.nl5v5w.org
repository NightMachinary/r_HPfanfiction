** You should always prioritize avoiding permanent damage to someone over teaching them discipline for the sake of discipline. We like to talk about traumatic experiences, as if that's a feature of the experience in itself, but a large part of whether someone is meaningfully traumatized by something is decided by how supported and understood they feel afterward. So it would be just plain evil to punish Ginny. Do you want to cause as much PTSD as possible? Because that's how you cause as much PTSD as possible.

*** That's a good point. I don't know much about PTSD, but that makes sense.

** If anyone should have been punished for the Chamber of Secrets it would have been Lucius. He knew, or at least had an idea, of what the diary could do.

Ginny was ignorant of what the diary was when she first started using it and was victim to an extremely talented manipulator for months before discovering what it was doing.

** It infuriates me just thinking that there are fics out there that penalize Ginny for this. She was eleven years old, and a /victim./ She was essentially groomed by an evil spirit who took advantage of her naivete and loneliness to use her for its own gain.

#+begin_quote
  she chose to write in the diary despite Arthur making it clear in the text that he had taught her better
#+end_quote

Arthur didn't even know she had the diary, and he never specifically told her not to write in it. Just because she was generally taught to be cautious of magical artifacts doesn't mean she would have been capable of translating that lesson to the diary. Eleven-year-olds aren't best known for their discernment.

#+begin_quote
  From her ditching the diary, it could be concluded that the possession wasn't constant, which meant she could have reached out for help at anytime, but chose not to.
#+end_quote

Would you blame a real-life grooming victim for not coming forward earlier? Jesus. By the time she would have realized something was wrong, she was too far gone to able to think rationally. Also, need I mention that she was /eleven?/

#+begin_quote
  She clearly made a mistake, but how can someone learn from a mistake if they don't face consequences?
#+end_quote

Is being possessed and probably experiencing long-term PTSD not enough of a consequence? The point of consequences handed out by authority figures is to educate a child that what they did was wrong and deter them from repeating it. She clearly understands that without receiving consequences beyond, you know, lifelong trauma.

Basically, of course she shouldn't have been punished, and I can't wrap my head around the idea that anyone would think otherwise.

*** I do agree with you that she should not be punished but I do think it would have been better if the effects of her actions (both possessed and not) along with being made aware of the true depth of danger that not only she was in but had also placed others in were explored a lot more in depth not just for Ginny but for all Hogwarts Students

That said given the sheer ease it took to slip a child Dark Object capable of possessing them is honestly terrifying and I have no idea why there was never any mention of classes or training designed to help in identifying any such Objects or how to tell if anyone is being influenced by such an Object

It also seriously raises the question of just how little the Teachers actually pay attention to their Students and their fellow Teachers as the Dark Lord was able to to possess both for an entire year each without them noticing a single thing out of place

I mean after learning that your now dead colleague had spent the previous year with the Ex Dark Lord literally living out the back of his head in essentially constant contact with your entire student population, including the very child responsible for his downfall, how the fuck do you not check for any signs of Dark Magic on your students when an unknown monster belonging to the very same bloodline the Dark Lord does suddenly begins petrifying people but instead choose to vilify the fucking kid responsible for stopping said Dark Lord in the first place

Fucking wizards.....

**** I do think that Ginny very much understood the consequences of her actions, and I'm not sure what else should have been said. There was no way she'd ever make the same mistake after that. And it wasn't really her who placed the school in danger, it was Lucius Malfoy when he slipped her the diary knowing full well what it would lead to. She was just a tool to him, and if it hasn't been her it would have been someone else.

Nearly every disaster that's ever happened at Hogwarts was the fault of various incompetent adults. But then, it's a children's adventure series, and if the adults were doing their jobs there'd be no story...

** No more than Harry should be for writing in the diary and keeping it between him, Ron, Hermione, and Tom Riddle.

Sure, Mr and Mrs Weasley can punish her, but, school wise, it would be ooc for Dumbledore to do anything beyond have a convo about her experience.

#+end_quote

She almost did, but Percy interrupted thinking she was about to say something about him and Penelope.

#+begin_quote
  Also Lockhart appears to have been permanently damaged

This isn't Ginny's fault.

** You'd have to hate Ginny so much that it is literally harming your ability to form rational thought in order to think she should be blamed or punished.

#+begin_quote
  Arthur making it clear in the text that he had taught her better
#+end_quote

This part especially stands out because Arthur was so blatantly wrong. The magical world is full of portraits, mirrors, a very famous hat, and plenty of other harmless enchanted objects that appear to think for themselves and don't have brains. A diary that writes back to you is downright mundane by those standards. And it seems like a very reasonable and useful thing to exist. I think every insecure teen would love to have someone who is always there to listen to their troubles and offer them advice without judgement or the risk of them revealing anything they're told.

#+begin_quote
  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
