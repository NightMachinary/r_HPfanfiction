I feel in a lot of the non canon pairings, sometimes the friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione kind of fades away. I've definitely read some where the maintain a really close friendship -but more often or not it dwindles or turns to bashing. I have to imagine that after their experience together-which only they know and can relate to one another with, in the years after Hogwarts they depend on each other. I mean Hermione offered to go with Harry to his death(in the movie-though Im sure if Harry saw them again in the books she and ron would do the same)-that friendship wouldn't disappear because Harry was dating someone she didn't like. So are there any fics (with a pairings or no pairings idc), where the friendship remains really truly strong? Thanks!!


** linkffn(Forging the Sword) has the best trio friendship I've ever read. The third year story is complete, but it's tragically abandoned shortly into fourth year.

Ah, screw that movie scene in which Ron was shown as an emotionless idiot standing there. In the DH book, Harry never met them again, but instructed Neville to kill the snake and watched Ginny comforting an injured girl in the courtyard. The repeated bashing of Ginny and Ron in the movies is a major contributing factor to many fics discarding the Trio friendship and canon pairings.

If you want non canon pairings with strong Trio friendships, here are some really good ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Ron and Hermione don't appear much, but they are obviously Harry's closest confidants. Even Harry's ex Ginny gives some good advice about how to deal with Daphne.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771): All of them are in a romantic relationship in this rare crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), has no explicit pairings, but is implied that the Trio got together. Here, Harry and his friends had enough of the incorrigible establishment and began their own revolution...

*** Whoops I can't believe I forgot that. Harry couldn't bring himself to say goodbye right? I just watched a fan video and that scene from the movie was in it -I guess it was on my mind. I agree-I can't stand what the movies did to Ron and Ginny. They really did screw them over. I get so mad when I read fics the Weasleys are just so out of character and bashed for stupid reasons. Thanks so much for your recommendations! I can't wait to check them out!

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”
