** linkffn(Recnac Transfaerso) It was written pre-OotP, but is still a great fic. The first few chapters do have some scenes that go over the top in my opinion, but other wise it answers your question. EDIT: There's another one like this with Ron, but don't remember the name and can't vouch for its quality.

** linkffn(Basilisk-born)

It's still in progess but I think it's almost complete. It's a unique Time Travel fic, with great world building. The main character dying part doesn't happen towards the end. It's easily my favourite Fanfic to date and probably of all time.

Also don't take the Slytherin Harry to seriously. He isn't sorted there, if you read it you'll understand. And Dumbledore isn't getting bashed by the author (it's not that type of manipulative! evil! Dumbledore fic) it's well worth the read.

  Complete. Sick!Harry. Voldemort was defeated in Harry's 6th year. Now in his 7th year, Harry struggles with PTSD. However, surviving the killing curse resulted in more damage to Harry's body than anyone could have suspected. He develops an incurable, unknown form of cancer that only very dark magic can cause. How will everyone deal with it? Deathfic. Trio-centric.

** .......why?

I have a friend like this, who has a genetic neural disease which is excruciatingly painful, which has no known cure, which will end up killing him. He's the most charitable and nicest guys I know, incredibly smart as well. He doesn't show his conditions or complain about it, and he graduated with triple fucking majors ahead of everyone in our year.

Thing is, the knowledge of this suck for everyone involved. It sucks knowing what he's going through, and it sucks that he probably won't live as long as many other people that don't have a fraction of his compassion or a fraction of his intellect.

Thing is, he has his own goals, which he avidly pursues and largely succeeds in. He uplifts everyone around him whilst retaining a sharp and focused mind for his own goals. Heoesn't let it get him down, and he doesn't just live for others.

There *is* such a thing as pathological altruism, and such a character which has no goals outside of other people isn't very engaging to read. Also, if you treat the whole "prophecy" thing as a death sentence, then canon Harry is already like that. Canon Harry already doesn't have a goal, he already lives for others. Fuck that.

Personally, I read fanfiction to escape for the harsh realities of life, not to further immerse myself in them. But I guess some people are different.
