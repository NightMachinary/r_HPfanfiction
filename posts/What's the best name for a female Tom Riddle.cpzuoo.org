I tried my best and came up with Tomya Molva Riddle. This is clearly the best name ever! /s

** I named my fem!Riddle character Tamelyn Merope Riddle.

I will be completely honest. I think the anagram is incredibly stupid and contrived. I purposefully distanced myself from any potential anagrams when I wrote my fem!Riddle fic, and just made Tamelyn come up with the name "Voldemort" by being less than stellar at French.

Seriously, though, why does someone who hates their name and want to distance themself from it decide that their new name should be formed from an anagram of his old one? It's such a melodramatic villain thing to do.

Well, a serious argument can be made that Riddle suffered from a terminal case of Chuunibyou, also known as "Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome"; which often manifests in it's victims as a belief they have a special destiny, unique powers/abilities, and an overwhelming desire to craft a new, unique name for themselves. Sound familiar?

** Using /I am Lady Voldemort/ It's the "y" that is the killer, in my opinion. Keeping Riddle as the surname I got Oval Maytom Riddle, Oval Myatom Riddle (you could rearrange the middle name to your liking as I am sure JKR did) or May Altomov Riddle (actually I kind of like this one best). It looks like May and Oval are the best female-like first names though.\\

***** Maybe that could work, yeah.

I've always associated Thomasin(a) with the character in the Hardy novel, but now I see it's a less old-fashioned name than I thought. However, the short form ‘T(h)om' would usually still be used for a boy. I think Thomasin(a) tends to have diminutives starting with Tam-, such as Tammy or Tamsin. Or, in rarer cases, I've seen ‘Tommi' or ‘Tommy'.
