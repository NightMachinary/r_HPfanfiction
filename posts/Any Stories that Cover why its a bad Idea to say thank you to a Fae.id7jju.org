Generally in myths about the Fae it was not a very good idea idea to say Thank you or tell them your full name and other things like that. Any stories that cover stuff like that?


** If you thank a fairy, you're admitting you owe them a favour.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
