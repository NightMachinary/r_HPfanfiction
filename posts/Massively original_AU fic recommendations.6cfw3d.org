** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Even Muggle world was very different as they never developed nuclear weapons. In the Magical world, James and Lily didn't trust Dumbledore and survived Halloween 1981. They ran off to Germany and Harry never went to Hogwarts. Instead he began his career in the British military. When Spain attacked Gibraltar in 2008, he saw his opportunity arriving....

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is set in a non magic AU. You might be interested in how canon events would play without magic. The kids were bloody scary here as Hogwarts was a spy school. This fic also has significant number of OCs.

**** "Emperor" definitely has its problems.

"HG & BWL" has different weightings for each year. The first three years took only 58 chapters out of 200, the last two years 97, and Year 7 (which lasted only 5 months) made up a third of the story.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** If you liked /Outcast's Alley/, I might recommend /Fantastic Elves and Where To Find Them/, even though it's not actually all that AU. And you might enjoy /Blindness/ if you get over the OPness of Harry --- it has a very creative magic system and afterlife, Hallows that work differently, and vampires developped so far beyond what little we know in canon they might as well fit in your "new race" category. I guess you could say the same about /Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone/ to an extent, with things like Dwarves.

**** --- Yes, that's the right one.

--- It is, although it's unfortunately abandoned.

--- The thing about /Fantastic Elves/ is that Harry is /not/ an elf --- that's what's so creative and hilarious. The story takes place before Harry receives his letter. You see, he begins finding out about his magic, but, taking his info from Muggle fantasy books, draws all the wrong conclusions and becomes convinced that he's a forest elf. Acting on this knowledge, he begins living in the forest, where his encounters with snakes and Jarveys reinforce him in his belief (aren't Elves supposed to talk to animals), and making 'boons' with humans. Hogwarts is not featured at all until the sequel.

** You should give linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold) a go, a bit rough to start but certainly improves around when Harry meets his new school friends.

Another one that's slightly less polished and certainly borrows heavily from the above is linkffn(snow point) .

Unfortunately both of these fics are abandoned but aSCaL is complete with a sequel but is an unfinished trilogy, the Voldemort arc is however complete and compelling in of itself.

** I'm going to bite the bullet and recommend Firebird's Son:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]])

It's massively AU. No new races though. It's quite adult oriented though and the quality dips (a lot) later on. Still, some of my favourite world-building in there...
