The sequel is the actual fic where it is actually post Hogwarts. The prequel is during the war, but I recommend reading it anyways since it basically builds up Percy as a character. The basic outline is the fact these are Percy centric and reveals how he was more Gryffindor then he thought. And it's how the author imagines how he met Audrey.
