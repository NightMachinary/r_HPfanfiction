[[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], AO3 and lots of sites have a great deal of fics but I don't dare to read randomly, I *only ship Draco!top x Harry!bot* from the head to toe. Nonetheless, despite the clear tags, there are many fics containing such elements like switching or Harry!top x Draco!bot, so sad. Could you give the names of the your favorite, impressed fics which have a great influence to you at heart? I love the kind of fics as The silent world within you, Paint my spirit gold, You send me (honest you do), Make me a headline (I want to be that bold), Cauldron full of hot strong love, The twelve trials of Christmas, In inceptum finis est, Partners Unpartened, The Coefficient of friction,... Many thanks in advance <3


** Maybe [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550?view_full_work=true][Running on Air]], I read it a few months ago and I can't stop thinking about it. It's a masterpiece, extremely slowburn, and a tad wistful, but beautiful nonetheless.
