#+TITLE: After defeating Voldemort, Harry decided to try and figure out this whole 'normal life' thing everyone seems so keen on having. Unfortunately, Harry never was one for 'normal.' Being virtually immortal doesn't help things either. So imagine his friends surprise when the headlines start reporting...

Harry Potter seduces princess! Declared king of small nation!

** It would be even funnier if all of this would be done by accident, or by Harry actively trying to /not/ do it. Reminds me of Make a Wish.

** /"So Harry, I heard you seduced a princess."/

"I swear Hermione, it wasn't like that. I just saved her from breaking her nose when she tripped. She recognized me and asked me to visit her little brother as he was a big fan of mine. There were these menacing people in Hoods that had surrounded us and I think I would died hundreds of time if they had a Basilisks power.

I thought it was best to go along with the princess to avoid them and that I would slip away under the Cloak when no one was looking."

/"What happened then? They say you stayed there for the night and were both you and the princess were exhausted the next morning and there is a photo of her hugging you."/

" We got tired because of the..."

/"Because of what Harry?"/

"...(sigh) Her brother was really cute and energetic. We played with him the whole day and when it was time for him to go to bed he said he wanted to play one round of hide and seek and that we had to find him. Turns out he knows his way around his home as well as I know my way around Hogwarts. We spent the whole night searching for him. We finally found him at dawn sleeping on his bed. Turns out he got tired of hiding and went to sleep. She was just thanking me for helping her find her brother. I don't know where that rumor came from."

/" Why didn't you use the point me spell?"/

".... I ... uh ... that would not have worked. If it did all that Voldemort would have used it to find me."

/"..... that's a good point but just admit that you forgot to use it."/

** And then there is Luna who heard Trelawney make her 3rd prophecy which says that Harry will keep doing those miracles until one day he will somehow create a new universe, and only thereafter, he may live a normal life. So Luna just grabs her popcorn and enjoys the show knowing that it won't stop for a while.

I'm sorry but I would so rather read Harry stopping a Rogue Chimera or fighting a Vampire Coven instead of just showing up in Iron Man or Thor and just saying "Well I fought Voldemort"

*** Oh god, that makes me so frustrated. There's so many Marvel, particularly Avengers, crossovers. A bunch of super popular fem!Harry ones too. I don't even know who Bucky (Rogers?) is, and I feel like he's half of the ships. Beyond my dislike of superheroes, I just don't like how it doesn't make sense that in a lot of the fics Marvel and HP just somehow coexist and SHIELD knows about all the magical happenings but not vice versa. There's also a lot of MOD dimension hopping which is par for the trope, but I also like my MOD!Harrys more ethereal and really powerful than what you normally see in Marvel crossovers.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
