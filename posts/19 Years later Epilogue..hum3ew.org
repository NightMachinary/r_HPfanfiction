*** There's a reason I read fanfiction that ignores books 6 and 7. Book 6 was /boring/. Book 7 had me asking "why are they /doing this?/". The utter stupidity of /wearing a horcrux/ is a perfect example of the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][idiot ball]] trope.

And I can't imagine why Dumbledore tried to condition everyone to use a name that was known to trigger a taboo. He knew the problems it had caused, and he knew that Voldemort would return. How could he be so arrogantly stupid?

I don't think it was a thing during the First war. The Death Eaters took advantage of the fact that Dumbledore was conditioning everyone to use the name, specifically the Order members, and put a Taboo on it.

Severus is a little harder to replace - he doesn't have a middle name in canon, and even if it was Tobias, honoring Snape's memory by naming a kid after his father would be a slap in the face.

The French do like that name however, as [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ship_Hermione][they named 12 ships]] after her.

I have exactly the opposite opinion here.

If Ginny ever agrees with naming her son "Severus", Snape must have bailed her out of several tight spots and covered up her transgressions from Voldemort. We readers already know the Sword Incident in which she got a detention with Hagrid instead of Cruciatus or worse. In the aftermath, Ginny should have realized how much she owed to Snape for not being hurt much much worse.

Snape himself was walking a tightrope between maintaining his cover and protecting the students. He seems to be able to reign in the Carrows until Easter, when Ron's involvement with Harry was uncovered and all Weasleys went into hiding. Only after that point were the Carrows able to torture students at will. In a sense, Ginny had escaped the worst of that year.

******** Been saying this for years now. Every time she "clarifies" something it takes away an avenue of interpretation, destroys possible canon and narrows the entire world down to the most boring possibility. It's like she specifically thinks about the lamest possible thing that something could be interpreted as and then says it. And anyone who asks will be treated to meticulous, boring details that narrow it further.

For example.

- No schools outside the big ones

- Wand magic is all there is, and is superior to all other forms

- Wizard culture is derived from rome yet does not know plumbing, yet does, because otherwise sewer technicians connected a weird snake chamber to the system in the 18 hundreds and never told anyone

- Wandless magic is always weaker than wanded magic, and is completely useless in all ways

- spells are bound by physical laws

- etc etc, it goes on like this.

All she has to do is tease things. Write small passages on twitter. A couple of lines of dialogue. Leave it completely open-ended and you light a fire in your community like you can't even believe. The people will be scrambling at your words, forming entire universes based on what you left open, or purposefully vague.

But rather than caring for her work, she is transphobic on twitter and posts about wizards shitting on floors.

**** You could make an argument that Luna was Ginny's idea, rather than Harry's. The names aren't my biggest problem with the epilogue, it's mostly how lazy it felt to stick Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny with the people they were dating in school. I never saw Ginny and Harry getting back together after the war, or at least if they did, not forever. I can't imagine that Ginny spent her 6th year at Hogwarts single and pining over Harry. And if that last year of the war didn't cause significant trauma to Harry then there would be something really wrong with him. Even if they tried to get back together they would both be different people.

This, and also, I feel like JKR really glossed over the Ginny/diary/possession trauma. Apparently it didn't affect Ginny at all to not have chunks of her memory, almost kill a dozen students, and nearly bring Voldemort back to life??

I feel like JKR was going for a softer, sympathetic character to "heal" Harry and bring him into the Weasley fold properly, but I think between the possession, and the horrors of her 6th year at Hogwarts, she'd actually be a very different person.

** The thing that always bothered me about the epilogue was Harry ending up an Auror. Obviously that's what he says he wants to do in book 5 (although he wasn't that decisive about it), people change their minds all the time and I always imagined him as a teacher. I could maybe see him being an Auror for a few years to round up the last of the death eaters, before going back to Hogwarts as the DADA teacher. He was so passionate and proud of the DA and deeply admired Lupin as his professor. Of course there's also the fact that Hogwarts was his first home.

By the end of the battle he seemed so tired of fighting that I struggle to imagine him making a career of it. Particularly when his Auror buddies may die on him (he already watched so many of his friends die). Only way I can see it is if he stuck with it because of everyone else's expectations, which would just be sad. I feel like even professional quidditch would have made more sense than being an Auror.

I feel like he'd just be frustrated with it and want to take a different path to change. Educating people is the best way to enact change and Harry's mentors and role models were primarily educators.

****** Well I would consider pureblood supremacy, rampant ministry corruption, and racism to be underlying issues. Killing Voldemort doesn't change the sentiment that he built his power base on. He likely had many sympathizers who agreed with his cause, but weren't necessarily willing to commit crimes. They may have supplied him with money or political support. Think Malfoy after the first war. In addition, neither Umbridge or Fudge were death eaters and we're very high up in the ministry. Umbridge believed in pureblood supremacy and Fudge hated half-giants. Of course, we can say they are simply terrible people, but such blatantly terrible people getting that high up in the government suggests deeper problems to me. We also know that the ministry passed terrible creature laws restricting werewolf rights before Voldemort ever took over. Lupin resigned when it got out he was a werewolf and Dumbledore faced heavy critism when it was revealed by Skeeter that Hagrid was half giant. Abuse of house elves also seemed to be an issue.

Killing Voldemort is great and it destroys the rallying point for some of these ideals, but it doesn't change the mindset. Enough people agreed with Voldemort that he was able to gain a lot of power and influence. The ministry was also corrupt before Voldemort took over as shown by how many death eaters managed to buy their way out while Sirius was never even given a trial.

Obviously I don't expect these to be addressed in the book and I'm willing to assume that after the war they worked to reform the ministry and thats great, but that takes time. Harry goes to work for the ministry right after the events of the book. I just struggle to imagine him working in a non-reformed ministry.

As for the question on aurors, I guess a part of it is just how prevenalent are dark wizards that they need a special taskforce for them? What do they do if there aren't dark wizards? Does dark wizards include dark creatures like werewolves and vampires? Who does the non-dark policing? Also what about hit-wizards? Not expecting answers, just little thoughts I've had.

Voldemort used his power to make 'neutrals' or people who did not vocally support him change their methods and either fully declare for him or be ground underneath his heel, as we see in canon.

Umbridge was totally on board to sign up with the Death Eaters, as seen during Book 7. Fudge was just an idiot, a fact which was repeatedly stated over the course of the books. He was weak-willed and being leaned on by Lucius Malfoy, and he was convinced that he was in the midst of an armed insurrection that involved child soldiers, hence his restriction werewolves. No matter which way you look at it, the werewolves signed on with Voldemort last time, and were being stirred up again by Greyback. That's not corruption on Fudge's part.

We don't really know enough about Half-Giants to say what was going on there, except that Ron - who holds some pretty conservative opinions about such issues - gets over it within a second. Giants, at least, are legitimately dangerous.

House Elves are an Uncle Tom story from our perspective, but in-universe they aren't usually abused and participate in their chosen lifestyle with total consent. Furthermore, Hermione is in a position to put any needed legislation through. Interfering in their culture otherwise is a paternalistic colonial attitude.

Dark Wizards aren't usually Voldemort-level threats, but there's low-level stuff, like the people in Knockturn Alley. They'll probably just train and patrol when they aren't in an active investigation. Werewolves can be Dark Wizards, like Greyback. Vampires are likely able to be wizards - The Quibbler published an article saying Rufus Scrimgeour was one. DMLE officers do non-Dark policing. Hit-wizards are DMLE officers, like a SWAT team is for Muggle cops.

Dobby's treatment was obviously way out of the ordinary - not one other elf displays nearly as much evidence of abuse nor his ingrained desire to injure himself as punishment. Winky is half-crazy because she can't help Crouch Sr., who by all accounts had a relationship of genuine affection and mutual respect with her. Kreature is actively disobedient and spiteful towards Sirius in a way I have a hard time believing is standard for House Elves. Again, with the other Blacks, he seems to have been content and valued. It seems weird to us that his life's goal was to have his head mounted on a wall after his death, but that's how xenofiction works. The Hogwarts elves, the only other ones we see in main canon and the only ones who aren't in an exceptional situation, are treated well and only refuse pay and time off because their culture rejects it.

Based on the recommendation of a Death Eater, no less.

There's /so much wrong/ with being an Auror.

- Working for a Ministry that treated him like shit

- The Ministry was totally corrupt, and everyone knew it

- The corruption was enabled by still-living blood supremacists

And now he's taking orders from them.

I can't see how anything really changed. Voldemort wasn't the problem, he was only a symptom of a violently bigoted culture. If Harry wanted to fix anything he'd be Minister. He'd be voted in unanimously. Didn't they outright offer the job to Dumbledore?

No, being an Auror would be ridiculous. As Minister, teacher, or Headmaster he would be in a perfect position to influence coming generations. Why would he be so content with the Status Quo that he'd choose to support it?

He could also easily be a Quidditch star player.

He's always been the one to step up and protect those that can't protect themselves. So in this way I personally don't see him becoming fatigued with the job the way some people think it would. I think it could be a fulfilling career where he can do a lot of meaningful stuff, both on and off the field.

I can't really picture him at Hogwarts full time, but I can see him doing guest lectures and things like that. But I see why professor Potter is a popular profession for him as well.

********* You certainly have a point. I feel that Harry would have been too close to the issue to judge it properly though. Malfoy should in no way have been Harry's problem, excluding giving honest testimony. I'm not fond of Malfoy, but it seems implied that his parents were being held hostage. Not an excuse, but a mitigating factor. I do feel he, and especially his parents, should have faced at least some consequences for their actions.

I wonder how something like this would be judged in real life. I think coercing someone to commit a crime is a crime, but I'm not sure how harshly the coerced are judged. Also not sure if he was legally an adult at that point.

I'll probably always prefer Professor Potter, but that explanation makes the Auror job feel a little more natural for me. Plenty of people end up in jobs because they are good at something and I could see him mentoring in other ways. Perhaps he would even spend some time instructing new aurors.

Harry saying that it doesn't matter if he gets in Slytherin and that the hat can take your choice in the matter shows that he's “matured”, even though we never got to see this newfound maturity.

*** I actually think that the opposite is true. Ron and Hermione were acting the whole time like an old married couple. They were bickering all the time but they were usually getting over it rather quickly. Despite what [[/u/ClawedRavenesque][u/ClawedRavenesque]] says, Ron only acted nastily towards Hermione during the whole Won-Won fiasco. And so did Hermione, when she ignored Crookshanks' attempts to kill his pet rat (despite what we learn of Scabbers later). Both were outshone by Harry despite Hermione's intelligence and Ron's worldly knowledge, both were rather shy in public settings and both cared for each other a lot.

I think Ginny is specifically written as to be Harry's girl but overall he is quite an unrelatable character because he is always so focused on his mission and on himself that he doesn't care whom he hurts in the process. So JK had to come up with a rather thick skinned funny girl to counter that.

Furthermore it's healthier to have someone criticize for your short-comings rather than a love-sick puppy. Neither Hermione, nor Ron seem like the type who would appreciate the latter.

And 19 years later, I would have also expected for the trio's friendship to have fallen apart like it does in Muggle world, but according to JK's universe things are far more traditional and people tend to marry the ones they fall in love with towards the end of the school.

It's a different kind of ambitious but not in anyway wrong or less worthwhile.

I will say that older media holds different values so I'm sure this doesn't apply to a pot of pre 90s media.

**** First year, Ron stayed loud enough for Hermione to hear: “It's no wonder no one could stand her” in retaliation for Hermione being a “know-it-all” in class. This leads to the troll incident as Hermione was so hurt she locked herself in a bathroom to cry. But, they were young kids so I'll move.

I don't see that they moved on quickly from the Scabbers/Crookshanks fiasco when it was implied that the friendship looked to be over. He never apologized when Scabbers was found alive either.

When I think of an old married couple bickering, I think of little, inconsequential arguments about how hot the tea is or what to watch on tv. In GoF, Ron insulted Hermione with: “Oi...Hermione, you're a girl!” Showing her that she was a last choice out of desperation. No girl wants to hear that. Yes, he's a dumb teen but still. He treats her horribly at the Yule Ball by accusing her of fraternizing with the “enemy” and helping Viktor win against Harry. He then chooses to ignore her and when she calls him out on his behavior, he doesn't apologize. It's funny that he tried apologizing to Harry for acting like a jerk but never bothered with Hermione.

Then in the HBP, Ron gets worse. He basically slut-shames his sister for going out different boys and kissing her current boyfriend “in public.” When Ron thinks that Hermione more than likely kissed Viktor two years before, he rides his jealousy and gives her the cold shoulder without bothering to explain why. They plan a date together and he chooses to be derisive to her and kisses Lavender instead in full view of the entire House. This is humiliating and hurtful to Hermione. But we agree on that. I don't need to get into the mustache scene.

In DH, Ron admits it himself, even without the Horcrux around his neck, he was an absolute terror. He focused on his needs and damn everyone else. When Ron finally blows up, he accuses Hermione of “choosing Harry” when she refuses to abandon Harry in his quest to defeat Voldemort. Like it was her purpose to automatically jump and go with him despite her having her own mind on things. He changes a bit after this and that quickly results in the two being meant for each other to end the story.

I just never saw the spark between them personally. Most people argue that we can't see everything that happened between them and yes, that's true. But everything significant just gives me the sense that it would take a lot of work for the relationship to work out. I never thought they belonged together. Just my opinion. Since they have two kids in cannon and all that, I guess they sure showed me lol.

Scabbers/Crookshanks

How was she supposed to control a cat 24/7? Crookshanks also proved to be very intelligent so it might not have worked anyway. Also, from Hermione's viewpoint there wasn't much proof that Scabbers was killed by Crookshanks and she did apologize to Ron before they found out that Scabbers was still alive. Hé didn't return the favor when it turned out that Crookshanks hadn't eaten him.

The mustache scene. Harry laughed too! Said it was the stupidest thing he'd ever seen and I'm sure a lot of the class did too. But Ron singles out Hermione and imitates her cruelly. If we're being fair, Ron should have hexed everyone he felt so offended by.

Hermione and Ron were already fighting at this point. It's reasonable that Ron would be less forgiving with her then. I think that's fair. This is them being assholes to each other.

******** My whole point is this: based on the interactions between the two of them, I just couldn't see a romantic relationship. Is Hermione prideful? Yes. Could Ron be a jerk? Absolutely. But as demonstrated in the Scabbers situation, she was genuinely sorry and grew from that.

Ron also grew a lot but, for me, the books initially set up a relationship with Harry as opposed to Ron for Hermione.

Ron is not a shitty friend. He's loyal, he's shrewd in tough situations and is humorous. But as Luna noted, he could also be unkind. Just as Hermione could be stubborn and prideful.

I'm not denying there were good times, it just seems to me that they weren't all that compatible. But that's just me.

******* I agree that Hermione and Ron would have really had to work to stay together, but I don't know if your case works just on Ron not being empathetic or understanding enough for her. I think she also had a lot of flaws that most people either weren't willing to overlook (which is why she didn't have many friends) or that people overlooked in favour of her intelligence (why she really like teachers). Harry and Ginny are her only other friends, and we see Harry get irritated with her antics. I think both of them had a lot of growing up to do, and it's fair they both did grow up once they weren't in the middle of a war... Assuming we ignore Cursed Child, which we always do.

** Well, there is an entire subgenre of fics called "Epilogue, what epilogue?" so I think it's safe to say quite a few people dislike it. Personally I dislike it because it ropes everyone in relationships and careers. Voldemort's death is closure enough and if the book ended right after the battle readers could come up with their own endings.

Besides that, I don't like the children's names. Naming new characters on already existing ones is super confusing and I avoid next- gen fics because of this. It would be as stupid as naming Ray, Poe and Kylo- Leia, Han and Luke in the new Star Wars movies. As bad as those movies were at least they had the common decency to come up with new names for the new characters.

As for the movies- they were pretty terrible since Order of the Phoenix (God, I genuinely hate David Yates) but they hit a new low with Harry breaking the Elder wand without repairing his own. The makeup in the epilogue was absolutely terrible. Ginny looked like Harry was abusing her and she was abusing substances.

It's a bit of a side note but I don't understand this obsession Hollywood has about aging actors up/ down through makeup and CGI. Just hire other actors. This way you'll give younger and less known actors a chance to build a career. The Irishman was incredibly awkward to watch with seemingly young faces and bodies that move like old people.

** I broadly liked it on first read and can see where it came from JKR's life, as a neat tying up of ends (although having said that even I had some issues, although I understand from a storywriting perspective why they were there - e.g. everyone marrying highschool sweethearts 20 years later is kinda weird, but it saves having to introduce new characters at the last minute when the aim was to portray beloved characters having a happy ending, as JKR envisioned that).

However, I've seen since a stellar set of posts about it which basically concluded that the reason this ending felt like a misstep for a lot of millennial and younger fans was because it was - especially for a series that had managed to so far otherwise capture tone with readers of that age pretty damn well - something of an old-fashioned view of what a happy ending entailed, that didn't really reflect anything of how millennial readers imagined their lives might be - with stable jobs, safety and assured comfort and harmony, and traditional relationships with multiple children by age mid 30s something of a relic of the past or at the very least an unrealistic idea of a goal or possible achievement for today's young folks.

There's also the critique brought up that this ending kinda undermines what had become core themes of the series - that is, it's a poor defense of muggle- and muggleborn equality if Hermione has left that world behind to live full-time in the wizarding world, the only muggle characters we knew in the books never again mentioned, and the suggestion that anti-Slytherin prejudice still remains nearly two decades on despite the fact that the last few books preached unity and evolving on from bigotry and early judgement of children. This is likely because, iirc, this ending epilogue was one of the first parts of the series written, before JKR did all the middle bits. A revisit and update of this section before publication may have improved it to remove these inconsistencies.

I don't like it because it feels like fanservice: "ooh let's show all the ships, the 2nd gen characters, everything a rose coloured version of the beginning of the series". It's tropey and trite and completely unnecessary as it doesn't give you closure at all, since it skips all the conflicts left, it just tells you that all was well in the end.

** Am I the only one who actually /likes/ the name Albus Severus? There's a deeper meaning behind the middle name! Albus has Lily's eyes, Harry was able to forgive Snape, and Harry wanted to thank Snape as well. Even if Snape was an utter douchebag to Hermione, Neville, and Harry, he was the one who did the most to ensure Harry's survival, even going as far as vilifying his own name. If he hadn't been muttering the counter-curse in Book 1, Harry would've died. The reason why Harry didn't give Albus a middle name of Rubeus is because Hagrid, though he was nice, didn't do as much to protect him. He didn't name his child Albus Remus either because Remus already had a son, which meant he already had someone to continue the name. Also, Remus didn't show up in Harry's life until 3rd year, and even then, Harry only learned about his association with his father at the end of Book 3. On the other hand, Snape was always there, behind the scenes, making sure that Harry was safe. He wasn't obligated to /like/ the kid, just to protect him. Out of everyone who protected Harry Potter, Snape did the most and sacrificed the most. Harry understands that fully, which is why he wanted to honor Snape by naming the kid who inherited Lily's eyes after the man who loved her.

3rd

Draco Malfoy

2nd year he was more then ok with muggleborn dying to the heir of slytherin.

3rd year he got an innocent creature executed.

6th year he took the mark, bragged to his friends voldemort gave him special task, imperio rosmareta, attempted murder number 1 on dumbledore nearly killed katie, attempted murder number 2 nearly killed ron, he let 6 known terrorists inside the school, the only reason he didn't kill dumbledore is because he's a coward

It shows the war over; it shows Harry having reached his desire for a family; it shows forgiveness, etc. I don't love aspects of it, like Harry naming his kid after Snape, but I can understand why JKR did that.

** I didn't like the epilogue and it feels like it was written as an afterthought considering how brilliant of a work JK did writing the whole series. But I appreciate the fact that it had its role. Basically it was intended to let the reader know that everything was well, Harry's kids got to grow in a loving environment (unlike him) protected from the evils of the world and it offered the series a sense of finality. I think it was also meant to deter (unsuccessfully) people from writing fics about the next gen because there was no more bigotry, no more dark lords and the Potter or Weasley kids could never be the same as Harry/Dumbledore/Voldemort/Snape since they never experienced tragic losses and - at the very least it's expected that - throughout their Hogwarts years they'll have someone to lean on. It's supposed to be the happy ending of a rather sad story which has as main theme death. That's why I actually hate CC so much... instead of leaving the story at that, they had to exploit it because it was a readily available cash cow.

** Albus Severus? I mean, the name make sense but that name for a 11 year old kid? I think that because of that name I hate that character. And the thing I hate the most is the movie epilogue, Harry looks to young and unrealistic, and his sons are so different to their parents. It's like James and lily, they are young persons, James has black hair, lily has green eyes, it's almost the most important thing of both characters, and they are not even close to be similar. The same happened with albus and James, they are not similar to their parents, the only kid I like it lily Luna.

I hate the epilogue of the movies, and because of that adaptation I also hate the book part.

** Right there with you! I was already disappointed with book 7 for the excessive camping and Fred and Lupin's deaths, then I turned the page to see that “19 years later” and cringed inwardly because I knew it would be lame...

I remember pre-DH reading that the last word the book would be “scar” and feeling so excited. Then I read the Epilogue and felt so disappointed. It was just so...smooth. Predictable. Boring. It was -too- neatly tied together. Not that I needed a cliffhanger ending, no way, but...it was just too unrealistic and perfect. I didn't like it then and haven't hoon rereading over the years, either.

** I've never read the book epilogue (I'm struggling to get through the books because I find fanfiction so much more interesting) but I've see the movies quite a bit.

To me the only character that didn't seem weird was Harry, the way he dressed and look seemed so like someone who didn't care about their appearance in terms of fashions and such. Ginny seemed so different, and I know from the books she was hugely independent so there's no way she would have cut her hair and become that stereotypical looking housewife. Can't remember Hermione and Ron too much acc.

The overall vibe of the movie epilogue was really depressing too, like after the war everyone was still super depressed cause everything had this grey tinge to it. And no one smiled all that much to my knowledge.

All in all it seemed really really depressing when it should be happy, and the “personality” of the main characters didn't seem to fit much

** The fact literally nothing changes in 19 years. Hermione and Ron's very different lifestyles, beliefs, and career goals never come into conflict. Harry and Ginny never face issues given he's a human and she wanted to date an infallible idol. All the other relationships seem to have been fixed since school.

Like Draco not marrying Pansy despite dating for years at school is the only sign of difference in the entire section.

And Albus Severus.

Personally I wasn't to fussed on it but when I got to read it (at 11~12 yo) I felt really disappointed, but more because I didn't care for these characters and there was no reason for me to care. Maybe if there had been another book afterwards about the children or better yet, the 19 year period I would have appreciated it but as it was, it felt like a copout.

It felt to me that Rowling treated the end of the series like I did my homework: a rushed job that work on only the barest of technicalities.

Only George, Fleur, and the Golden Trio iirc. Neville, Percy, and Draco married women they didn't start dating/contract until after Hogwarts; Luna wound up marrying an iirc significantly older man (Rolf Scamander); and I don't remember if we find out what happened to Pansy or Penny.

Yeah it's bit high of a percentage, but dating pool for Wizarding Britain being basically the people you went to Hogwarts with probably puts a lot of pressure on staying with them.

** The reason that epilogue (I'm talking about the books) feels jarring and abrupt is because of how good the preceding chapters are. The writing is absolutely brilliant. The exposition is fantastic. JKR knows that legions of fans have hung on with the characters she's created, that they've laughed with them, cried with them, lived with them for years and years. She knows that she's got to craft a fitting end to the series, and boy, does she deliver. After the end, you're left overwhelmed, at a loss for words, but incredibly satisfied and content that this was the conclusion Harry Potter deserved (talking from a literary standpoint here).

Then the scene shifts abruptly to nineteen years later. Harry's close to forty years old. He has three children, he's asking them to behave, he's being a /parent,/ Ron's telling him how he confounded a driving instructor, and its all so /domestic./ That's why many people go UGH at that, because it goes against their view of Harry Potter as this plucky, adventurous boy who's ready to fight evil and save the world. No one wants to envision a Harry Potter as a grown-up man who's at his desk by nine and is owls healers because his four year old son has the loosies.

** Not even touching the name thing since everyone is already mentioning that from all angles.

While it's popular to have epilogue's pick up in a similar place to where the OG starts (going to Hogwarts for the first time- inspiring a new generation) I just don't feel like it was the right move for HP. Or at least, they jumped way to ahead. Maybe if it was like James II going off for the first time, or like Ginny is expecting and they're sending Teddy off. Gives more "unknown and hope for the future" vibes. 19 years is also such an odd number to go for.

Also, they did Ron dirty with the epilogue (also Percy). And the movie versions didn't help. They didn't really age them well or realistically. I also like Draco so I wish there was more with him, but that's just me personally. They did him alright (but that beard... no).

Overall, book was alright/bearable. The kid casting looked decent in the movie, but the adults were really badly aged. Also the lighting/cinematography had a lot of things I wouldn't have chosen.

** Am I the only one who actually /likes/ the name Albus Severus? There's a deeper meaning behind the middle name! Albus has Lily's eyes, Harry was able to forgive Snape, and Harry wanted to thank Snape as well. Even if Snape was an utter douchebag to Hermione, Neville, and Harry, he was the one who did the most to ensure Harry's survival, even going as far as vilifying his own name. If he hadn't been muttering the counter-curse in Book 1, Harry would've died. The reason why Harry didn't give Albus a middle name of Rubeus is because Hagrid, though he was nice, didn't do as much to protect him. He didn't name his child Albus Remus either because Remus already had a son, which meant he already had someone to continue the name. Also, Remus didn't show up in Harry's life until 3rd year, and even then, Harry only learned about his association with his father at the end of Book 3. On the other hand, Snape was always there, behind the scenes, making sure that Harry is safe. He wasn't obligated to /like/ the kid, just to protect him, and out of everyone who protected Harry Potter, Snape did the most and sacrificed the most. Harry understands that, which is why he wanted to honor Snape by naming the kid who inherited Lily's eyes after him.

*** You are not alone. I love Albus Severus's name. I get more frustrated with Dumbledore than Snape. Yes, Snape was a dick, but he never tried to seem like anything else. Albus just kept up his paragon of the light attitude while planning for a child to die to save the world. I'm not a Dumbledore hater, but he wasn't perfect either. And Snape is owed more credit than most people give him. Also, Harry would give him that credit, even if others wouldn't.

*** I find myself somewhat sympathetic to Snape, or at least the younger version of him. However, I still think it's a terrible name. Even if you consider Snape redeemed in the aftermath, would you really want to saddle your child with the name of a person (let alone two) as prominent as Albus and Severus? Let alone someone who a lot of the Wizarding World is still likely to harbor dislike for, because no matter what side Snape was ultimately on, he was very much still an ass to basically everyone. The poor child is going to be living in the shadow of his namesakes, and we all know how cruel kids can be -- I could very much see him being bullied over the name.

****** Children's books are usually meant to teach kids something. I think, realistically, Harry and Ginny /wouldn't/ have named their children such heavy names. But, since this is a children's book, JK wanted to make a lasting impact by showing Harry's ability to forgive and to also show his growth and maturity. It shows children that, even if you may not like someone, you shouldn't hold a grudge against said someone, especially if they're dead. I think that she wanted to show that Harry was able to forgive Snape, unlike the latter, who couldn't let go of what James Potter did to him in their school days. She wanted to show that Harry, unlike Snape, was able to let go of his hatred for his dead tormentor and be at peace.

I agree that JK could've done better, like make Harry lobby for a posthumous Order of Merlin to be awarded to Snape or some sort of recognition, but I also think that Albus Severus's name holds heavy symbolism, especially for the latter name. Albus Severus has green eyes just like his grandmother's which are the same eyes Snape asked to look into before he died and the same eyes of the woman Snape loved dearly.

This is why I like the name.

From the first to the last line, I find it absolutely awful, and though I read the books multiple times, I forced myself to read the epilogue only twice: the first time I read Deathly Hallows(I didn't know it would be so awful), and on a re-read after a few years of break from HP(it found it even worse the second time if that's even possible).\\
Albus Severus makes me wanna puke, and frankly question Harry's mental state after the war.\\
I don't know why Rowling went with it. I think it would be much better if she ended the book with, I don't know, Harry, Ron and Hermione watching the sunrise after the battle or something like that.\\

** I have three main reasons why I don't like the epilogue. They may be minor and petty, but they still bother me.

1. The names, especially Harry's kids' names. They're awful. James Sirius I get. Lily Luna, maybe, because hopefully Luna was Ginny's suggestion. But Albus Severus? Are you actually kidding me? Hell, I could list at least 5 other male characters who deserved the honor more than Snape and Dumbledore, people who actually cared about Harry as a person and not just as a pawn or as the kid of the woman they loved.

2. Everyone married their high school sweetheart. This one just rubs me the wrong way. While I'm not the biggest fan of Ron/Hermione, I do actually like Harry/Ginny. That said, I still don't like that they all got together at 17 (16 in Ginny's case) and stayed together. Not very realistic imho.

3. The literal 2.5 kids. I could go on and on about JoKe Trolling's concept of motherhood and the way she uses it to define the women's value throughout the saga, but damn, that's just awful. And again, unrealistic.
