Less in the sense of female!Harry (though I don't mind if it is) and more about having secrets, living double (triple? quadruple?) lives, Slytherinning, political machinations, lots and lots of characters, complex plotting, alive Marauders, that kind of stuff.

Doesn't need ALL of those elements, of course, but anything with the same... feel, if that makes sense? Harry doesn't even have to be the main character.

No preference of length; I read anywhere from a thousand to a million words.

And it doesn't even have to be a Harry Potter fanfic, to be honest, lol


** It's not as good as the pureblood pretense imho but linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches) has Harry with multiple, highly divergent identities and a lot of political plotting.

Also linkffn(reign of the serpent) is heavy on politics.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
