Generally, I don't read fics shorter than 100k words, prefer the bulkier 200k-800k works. This is mainly because I feel that shorter fics dont have the opertunity to have a deep and detailed world which for me is central to a good fiction. Sadly, I have pretty much read all the long fics out there at this point, so I will have to start transitioning to smaller fics.

How about you? Do you prefer longer or shorter fics? Why?

Edit: Seems I got the tag system wrong, oops?


** I prefer quality over quantity. If the writer can get their story across in 40k words and it's good, awesome. if they take 200k to get it through by padding out with extraneous crap then the quality goes downhill.

I just recently finished an 800k fic that could have easily been streamed down to about 120k by following Harry alone instead of having every character in the story have their separate storyline explored.

*** I agree. I used to be all about word count in my early fanfic days, but in the last year or two I've come to prefer fics that can do more with less words. Nowadays, I'll think twice before committing to anything above 250k.

** I prefer longer fics, but mostly read shorter ones. Many longer fics are in dire need of a /lot/ of editing, and so after a few dozen chapters I can't stay focused on the story because the author can't stay focused on the story.

** I prefer the 20k-100k word fics. Especially if they are already set in an existing world (the wizarding world). I don't need every department of St. Mungo's to be visited or every goblin of Gringotts to have a backstory. I find those shorter fics to be more beatifully crafted and the author can take time making every word and scene perfect. Those are the ones that stick in my memory the most because it's easier to remember all of the plot.

** I prefer longer fics. I'll read the 100-200k ones on occasion, but I prefer longer fics. My attention span can handle around 800,000 to a million before I get bored. That's how far I got into Prince of the Dark Kingdom before I stopped reading it.

** I prefer shorter stories and one-shots generally. I'm sure there are exceptions, but all the longer ones I have looked at would have benefited from some ruthless editing. Also I don't engage as well reading on a screen as I do reading a book and I prefer things I can read in one or two sessions. Plus I would hate to invest a lot of time on a fic only to find it lost its way plot-wise after 100k words - and to be fair, that seems to happen a lot in fanfiction. If I find a fic that is written at a professional level I might make an exception, but those are few and far between.

** I like the 50k-200k range. I /have/ read some million-word behemoths, but I'm a lot pickier about those and will search for reviews here or on DLP before committing.

** I prefer longer, substantive fics that don't have too much filler/fluff/unnecessary stuff. But these are getting harder to find. Recently I've been losing interest halfway though 500k+ fics and just skip to the last few chapters to figure out what happened.

For shorter fics, I prefer longish one shots so I don't have to worry about updates. These tend to be very polished

** Shorter stories, for the most part. I tend to be leery of fics that are over 70-80k long. A lot of the time, I'll lose interest in a fic about midway through if it's very long because the author has started to drag the story along by trying to add in too much detail or subplots or something.

** I prefer longer as long as it's a completed story or is actively updating, but it depends on how I'm feeling on any given day as to what I'm reading.

** Is it good? Then I'll read it. I'm less likely to read short stories (and no one-shots, unless they come highly recommended). I generally will only read a fic if it's completed or it's ongoing. I don't like shorter stories because I'm a fast reader. 40,000 words will be over in under a day, and then I have to take the time to find another fic.

*** This exactly. The only time I read one shots is if they're outtakes from a longer fic. I really prefer my fic over 100k, but that really cuts down my options. But I basically won't read anything under 40k.

** Is it done? Then I'll hit anything over 20k. If it's not done, and I have options to be picky, 50k or more is the goal

** Long and well writen please :) (a long fic that's badly writen is chust a chore to get through, just like something that was supposed to be long but is WIP/unfinished...just so frustrating!)

ps: One-Shots are great sometimes as well, but over all? I prefer to be entertained for a while instead of being done after 5 minutes or less (I am quite the fast reader...(100-150 pages per hour even in English, which is not my native language - that would be German!))
