New Chapter of The Tales of Everest Scamander is out now! Chapter Eight: The Heir of Gaunt.

This is a super spicy chapter so I highly recommend a good read. I'm not going to give a summary of this upcoming chapter because it would spoil too much.

For those who haven't read this story yet, here is a brief description!

This story is about a young girl who was born into the Scamander family during the time of Harry Potter. Inheriting the legilimens ability, her Grandparents decided it was best to send her off to America to live with Queenie. As time passes the young Everest follows her natural path to attend Ilvermorny. Everest thrives there, but due to dark and terrifying circumstances she must transfer to Hogwarts. At her new school she must face her own darkness, along with the great danger that is to come.

Future pairings are DracoxOC and FredxOC

Let's go on an adventure together!
