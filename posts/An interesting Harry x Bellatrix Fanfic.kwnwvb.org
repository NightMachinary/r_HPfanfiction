  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.
