:END:
Dumbledore sends harry, Ron, Hermione, ginny, and I think Luna back to 70's Hogwarts to stop draco from doing something (I think). He warns them though that the 70's were a different time, Hogwarts was a little more open about sexuality. 18+ situations ensue. I think maurader might be in the name but I'm not sure about that. I remember reading it a while ago but I haven't been able to find it, I think it was on archiveofourown so that's where I've been looking.
