Would rather have canon abuse than fanon abuse but if there's fanon abuse that's fine.

I want Harry to actually be realistically affected by the abuse, others try to help him.

No OP Harry, super intelligent Harry or Harem Harry.

No character bashing, characters having flaws or characters disliking or hating each other is fine, but an author going out of their way to bash a character is usually a no go.

Am fine with/het/slash/femslash

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione. If Ron isn't bashed I'll allow it, otherwise I don't want it.

Can be on ANY Site.

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12365453/1/The-Memento][The Memento]] Harry experiences realistic results of canon-level abuse.

  Until he befriends a grass snake in his aunt's garden Harry believes his relatives when they say there is no such thing as magic. Looking for a place to belong, he ventures into an elusive world shackled by age-old prejudices and fear of a man who may or may not be his father. What he finds is more than he expected, but less than he hoped. First Year AU

** Grey Space comes to mind, and I'm sure there's more that I can't remember at the moment but.... Grey Space is awesome.

+linkffn(12424344)+ This is ao3, not ffn and its linked correcly below. Who's the troll upvoting the big bang theory story? LOL

Edit: Crap. The Perils of Innocence, maybe? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/][It's abandoned,]] even if the author is still active and says it isn't. If two years without an update isn't abandonment, I don't know what is.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  Sheldon and his oldest Daughter, Karlene, got into a heated debate when she was 18, simply because she didn't want to pursue science like her parents or siblings. That caused her to up and move to New York, and everyone misses her so bad they have a big family reunion to reunite. Hopefully, it will be what Sheldon and Karlene need, to be close again. Let's see. Happy reading.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important.

I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other. Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

** linkffn(11591125) and sequels fits what you're looking for. Harry responds to canon-level abuse by trying to become more 'normal' to please the Dursleys. It sort of works, and they do treat him better, but still don't really love him.

  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.
