Does anything at all change other than people living? Do any of the plot points change? I've gotten through 7 chapters and I'm bored out of my mind already.


** One of the most important abilities when reading fanfiction is that you are able to say ‚ÄúI don't like this, I should stop.‚Äù and then stop, leave it, and start reading something else. There is too much trash on the Internet. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law][Sturgeon's law]].

*** I've got remarkably high tolerance for crap fanfiction, and I still drop probably about 75% of what I read within five chapters. Life's too short to fill it with swill.

*** *Sturgeon's law*

Sturgeon's revelation (as originally expounded by Theodore Sturgeon), commonly referred to as Sturgeon's law, is an adage commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap." The sentence derives from quotations by Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic; although Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law," the "ninety percent crap" remark has become Sturgeon's law.

The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

** Yup. I left a few comments on the first and second year fics, and they promised me they diverges from canon in fourth year. I have only limited time on this planet, so I declined reading further.

I get from the author's replies that they kind of regret the early choices they made in the fic, but are too far in to re-write now.

** It's the most rigid rehash I've ever read. You'd think a world with a free Sirius and dead Peter woul mean a brand new plot for year 3 right? But no, it's practically identical but with a few names changed.\\
I gave up on it before reaching the end of fifth year, so dull.\\
Every time some possible divergence shows up the author finds a way to shoehorn in the original plot. I wouldn't be surprised if it still ends with Harry facing Voldemort, dieing, coming back, and winning thanks to the loyalty of a wand.
