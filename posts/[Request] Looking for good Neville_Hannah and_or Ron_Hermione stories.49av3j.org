Just as the title says, I'm hoping to find good stories involving those pairs, whether just one or both - preferably longer stories that aren't /super/ angsty but also aren't super fluffy (though I certainly won't complain if they are).

I'm mostly looking for Neville/Hannah, as I've not had an easy time finding good fics involving that pair.

  They were happy. They were healthy. Their lives were coming beautifully together. Follow Neville and Hannah Longbottom on their journey to start their family.

I find they're a really underwritten pairing. I've had a hard time finding much with Neville, never mind featuring Hannah. (People seem so adverse to it, almost let down that Neville/Luna wasn't canon? ) There's some lovely one-shots, but very little for longer stories.

  Since their first day of school, Hannah has always been kind to Neville when few others have. As his feelings start to grow, along with their friendship, he tries to push them away only to find he can't hide the truth forever. M rating just to be safe

It's been a while since I read it, but I remember it being enjoyable enough to go on my follow list.

  Hannah feels she has spent half her life smiling in her friends' faces as they became parents and then crying behind closed doors. Infertility may be the one battle she and Neville can't win. Neville/Hannah

It's a lovely oneshot.

*** Thank you! I agree - there aren't nearly as many fics as I would like to see on those two.
