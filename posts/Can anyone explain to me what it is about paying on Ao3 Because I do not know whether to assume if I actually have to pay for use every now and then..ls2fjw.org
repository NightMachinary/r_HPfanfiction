My main point is that the ao3 format is generally better than on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], so I want to register there. I just read about some payment for posting a job and I don't know now whether to assume it or leave it and bother with [[https://ff.net][ff.net]].

I know that this is the page where you are looking for ff and other things, but I was seriously scared when I read the regulations.


** I am on ao3 for a long time. I don't need to pay for anything and am actually a bit confused with your question, having never read/heard something like that.

I personally prefer ao3 over ff.net for a few reasons: you can search for tags, filter stuff out and in my opinion the people there are in general a lot nicer than people on ff.net (haven't seen death threats there).

**** Yes. People who comment anonymously on stories threatening the author with killing them (and other threats) if they don't update their story soon.

******* Can confirm, it's happened to me as well. Generally "Why not kill yourself" type threats, albeit with far worse spelling.

Seriously, kill has only four letters. I've seen it spelled Lill, Kull, Koll, Kiol, Jukk*...

But, yeah. It's one of the reasons I moved from FFN to AO3.

** There is no obligation to pay anything. AO3 run donation drives for a week or (I think once a year) where there's a temporary banner at the top of the homepage asking for donations. You can ignore this and just get on with using the site if you see it, and there's no need to give them any money.

** You don't HAVE TO pay for anything. However, AO3 is run by [[https://www.transformativeworks.org/][Organization for Transformative Works]], which is the US 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so they are constantly [[https://otw.cividesk.com/civicrm/index.php?q=civicrm/contribute/transact&reset=1&id=17][soliciting for donations]].

*** I wouldn't say they're “constantly” soliciting. They have occasional fund drives that are a lot less intrusive than the ads on any other site.

*** Exactly yeah. You won't have to pay to use AO3 but you can donate to the cause! AO3 and fan fics really helped me get through the pandemic this year, so I actually donated a few times. It is cool. The money goes toward keeping the servers running and paying the people who work hard to maintain the site. And...you get stickers/water bottles other swag when you donate.

** You don't have to pay for ao3. Sometimes they ask for donations. It's lile wikipedia when every other month there is a popup window on top where it asks for donations and you can close it with a click
