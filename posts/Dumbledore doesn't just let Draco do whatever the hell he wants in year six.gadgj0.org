I can understand that he was planning his own death. But what I really cannot believe is that he would just let innocents get in the crossfire.

Not one but two innocent students nearly died because of Draco trying to murder Dumbledore. There is no freaking way Dumbledore should've let that slide. This could go in mainly two directions:

1. He gives an immense verbal and/or physical beatdown to Snape for not controlling Draco.
2. He just flatout expels Draco or gets him arrested, because students' safety is still more important than his planned assisted suicide.


** Draco got away with everything. I don't care about his bullying, it was normal for rich doichebags. I don't think he changed later in his life. I mean he almost killed Ron and Katie, only Harry's quick thinking and luck saved them.

He let the murdering scum into Hogwarts, only Liquid Luck saved the students from certain death.

I don't want to know what atrocies he committed in 7th year where he got free reign. He throwed lethal curses at Harry and other like candy in RoR.

***** Does anyone believe that if Harry told Narcissa that Draco was dead that she would have still told Voldemort that Harry was dead? I don't think so.

At a minimum her one decent act there may have allowed for some leniency but that would truly depend on what crimes she committed.

Lucius did nothing to warrant any leniency and should have been executed for his crimes. Hell if the dementors kiss was considered valid for Barty Crouch Jr. and Sirius just for escaping from Azkaban than why wasn't it good for Lucius.

And quite frankly Draco should have been executed as well. At a minimum two attempted murders (Katie and Ron), conspiracy to commit murder (Dumbledore), and facilitating a murder (Dumbledore). Let alone what he did to earn his death mark and any other crimes he committed (including terrorism/treason for participating in an armed conflict against the legitimate government).

So the canon message at least if you're a Malfoy is you can assault, rape, murder, etc anyone and if a single member of your family does one single decent act you all get off with a slap on the wrist. So why should you ever stop doing what you want?

******* I suppose it depends on the interpretation and writing. Throughout the books Lucius Malfoy is mentioned as a Death Eater, but no one really suggests Narcissa is. JKR has confirmed that despite being equally as bigoted as Lucius, Narcissa never was a Death Eater. This was my impression from the book, also.

We know that Draco was inducted young and put up to his task as a punishment for Lucius' failings. I think Voldemort invites Narcissa to the dinner out of a twisted 'respect' to the hosts, to further drive fear into them. I would say she attends only to protect Draco, but the position of the Malfoys at this point meant that Voldemort called all the shots.

In this regard, Narcissa wasn't so much as an accomplice as under threat of death/held hostage herself.

Illegal artifacts, it sounded like Arthur Weasley considered these to belong to Lucius - perhaps an inheritance line thing. A more dubious innocence here.

******* I don't remember the Burbage murder, can't comment. I don't remember any unlawful imprisonment committed by her, only Bellatrix. Obstruction of justice, I just don't see where that happened. She did posses illegal objects, but then, so did Harry, with the sword, and Serius, technically, with the locker and other dark artifacts in Grimmauld place. We don't know for certain if she was involved at the world cup, but I doubt it, as she doesn't really do anything herself the entire series. She also wasn't present at the graveyard.

You did read the previous books, right? If Dumbledore is sane and competent, unless he's hideously hemmed-in by circumstances he's 100% okay with risking the students if it furthers his plans.

- Someone super-dangerous is trying to steal this Stone? Better keep it in a school full of children that could end up as hostages and/or collateral damage.
- Deadly creature behind nothing more than a locked door that a firstie can open, complete with an announcement at start of term that points inquisitive students straight to it.
- Troll in the dungeon? Better send the kids out of the Great Hall where they can all be defended by the staff and to their common rooms, one of which is in the dungeons.
- Mirror that he himself admits is dangerous just left out in an unused classroom without even bothering with a locked door.

And all that's just in Book One...

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
