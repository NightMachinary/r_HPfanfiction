:END:
Ok so I vaguely recall reading this fanfiction (my memory is very spotty and I forgot to keep the tab with this story saved somewhere) that I was trying to find after it popped into my head. I may even be confusing two different stories at this point.

It features Dumbledore bashing as far as I can remember and the beginning is post-war where Harry goes to Gringotts and the goblins test his blood and realize that he's been placed under a wide range of compulsions by Dumbledore over the years and during this test it reveals that Tom Riddle was/is Harry's soulmate and that Dumbledore knew but still trained him to defeat Voldemort. Harry goes back in time now knowing that the person who he is supposed to kill is his soulmate and he begins talking to Diary!Tom and if I recall lives with Sirius and Remus after some time when it's revealed they too had compulsions placed upon them by Dumbledore.

That's all I can really recall and if you could help me find this story I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm honestly just wanting to indulge in my guilty pleasure stories haha. Thank you!
