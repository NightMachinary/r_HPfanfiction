This piss anyone else off.


** I mean, we don't really use the word 'Dork' in the UK anyway. It's very much a US thing. Same with most of the variations of that 'insult'. We might use Dumbles, but that'd end up sounding more affectionate to a British person than insulting. Most of my friends call one another 'cunts' in joyful tones upon seeing each other.

So, it doesn't piss me off. It just makes me think the story is written by a tweenage US American kid.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
