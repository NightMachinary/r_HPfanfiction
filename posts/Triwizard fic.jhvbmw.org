  AU Fourth Year: Harry has been entered into the GOF. With his best friends and quidditch team by his side, can he handle the tournament, a nefarious plot to kill him (again), and a blossoming relationship with the Beauxbatons champion? Follow Harry as he fights for the cup, and for his life. All rights go to J.K. Rowling. Everything in bold is from original story.

***** Well, the title and author are listed right there. Are you seriously asking for somebody else to do a simple search for you instead of doing it yourself?
