** I hate romance only fics, but The Girl from Whirlpool was too amazing. I had read a series of fics about Sakumo meeting his wife too but I've since forgot what the titles are though.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** It isn't 100% romance, there's a lot of adventure and battles in it, but its def a major focus, I'd say around 40-50% of the fic is just romance and its really really good and well done imo. linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky)

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.
