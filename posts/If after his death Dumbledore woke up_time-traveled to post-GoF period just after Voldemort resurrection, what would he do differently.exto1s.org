** He would teach Harry Occlumency himself instead of leaving it to Snape. He would probably be a lot more careful when he tackles the ring Horcrux. He would also train Harry a lot more to ensure that Harry has a chance after the scar Horcrux is removed.

He could do any number of things differently like saving Amelia and Vance and people at the bridge that collapsed, etc.

*** He wouldn't teach Harry Occlumency. He can't even look Harry in the eye without Harry getting the urge to murder him. For this same reason, he wouldn't want to train Harry personally.

He'd definitely be able to destroy both the ring and locket quickly though.

**** That's not accurate. He wouldn't look Harry in the eye because he was worried about possession or some bollocks. He later discovered that this wasn't a concern.

Well, yeah? Possession which would lead to Harry attacking Dumbledore. Harry nearly does attack Dumbledore. Dumbledore's fear was that Voldemort would use Harry to spy on Dumbledore and to attack Dumbledore in hopes that Dumbledore would kill Harry.

#+end_quote

No he didn't. It stopped being a concern after the possession, because then Voldemort wanted nothing to do with Harry's mind.

Either way, Dumbledore would not teach Harry anything personally.

****** Just have Voldemort learn that Harry's mind is anathema to him earlier on.

** Destroy the ring and locket quickly. Avoid Harry. Let things play out. Have Arthur or whoever kill the snake when it comes in December. Make sure he isn't ousted from the school. Find the rest of the horcruxes.

When Harry tries to go after Sirius, maybe polyjuice into Harry and have his Order polyjuice into Harry's friends. Bring Harry along but leave him under his invisibility cloak until the right moment.

Death Eaters get completely obliterated, let Voldemort come. Let Harry take a killing curse to the face, then kill Voldemort.
