** Reread the Dumbledore visiting Riddle at the orphanage chapter and it struck me that Young Riddle would have definitely ended up as a psychopathic crime lord in the muggle world if he never went to Hogwarts. Any fics on this?

Bonus if he still uses some magic to abet his crimes. Or. Aurors realise he's magical and get involved.
