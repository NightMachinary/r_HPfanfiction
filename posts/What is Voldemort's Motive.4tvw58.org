Voldemort is a halfblood and he is shown to be highly intelligent. Yet, he is working with blood purists in an attempt to cleanse the world of muggleborns/etc. My assumption is that it's a grand scheme to gain power for himself, i.e. become ruler of Britain eventually. But does he care for blood purity at all? Is it a subpoint of his desire to be unique?


** I believe he is a wizard extremist, and merely uses the Purebloods to supply him with funds and followers. Of course, there is also the strong sense that he feels he is the only one worthy of power, given how he looks down on all others.

**** In my opinion, yes. Riddle is, if you'll excuse the simplification, a very one-dimensional person. Your typical villain with delusions of grandeur and just enough talent and initiative to have his way. But throughout the series, we see plenty of flaws in Riddle that really go to show how mentally undeveloped and short-sighted he is.

Riddle is like the bully in the playground who always pretended he was king, but never grew up.

** Anything is posisble. He could simply have chosen blood purity as the easiest way to gather followers, using his own heritage. Or he could be an example of the "converts are the worst fanatics", where he loathes his muggle heritage to an extreme point. Or he could have started as a cynical user of the movement, and ended up believing his own drivel at the end.

** Voldemort... in order to understand his motives you have to understand what he sees in the world.

Voldemort in the PS/SS states that there is no good or evil, only power. This fits in what we know of his childhood. He grew up in an orphanage during the 20s and the Great Depression. He would have seen that people with the power were the only ones who succeeded. Those who went for their goals with as much viciousness and ruthless aggression and cunning as possible, were the ones that ended up with the prize.

It is my belief that he started bullying, and terrorizing others as a way to survive. I believe that every summer, he saw the people around him become more and more desperate for survival. As he grew, he began to see muggles as filth, as every summer he starved or had to use his abilities to gain what he should have been given every day. So I believe that by the time he was 15, he had decided that muggles were nothing but animals that were feral.

I would say that sometime between opening the Chamber of Secrets and seventh year, He murdered his father and his family using their deaths in making the diary horcrux. I think in that moment he realized that cruelty gave him power, and power gave him the world. I do believe however that there was a point where he questioned what he wanted... when he asked Professor Dippet to teach DADA. Professor Dippet replied in a way that firmed Tom's belief that power was the only constant in the world. Dippet was WRONG to turn down Tom due to youth, especially since Tom was a prodigy even at that age. Tom could have easily taught the younger years while gaining his mastery. But Dippet felt that he was incapable due to his youth and his lack of experience, which Tom took as Dippet calling him weak.

Throughout his adventures, Tom descended down the Dark Magic Path, most likely creating the horcruxes, and solidifying his abilities. In the Post Grindlewald Wizarding World Tom would have seen nothing but the results of war, and a power vacuum. Grindlewald was gone, but everyone wanted his place... there would be fighting in the streets as Dark Wizards and Witches battled for the position, and foreign Aurors battled the Dark Witches and Wizards back out of fear of a resurrection of Grindlewald. I fully believe that war, even a silent one like the one Voldemort would have traveled into, changes people. It makes those who are kind, kinder, those who are hard, harder, and tempers even the most resiliant of people. Voldemort... Voldemort is not a good person, he is not very resiliant. He fears death, since he blamed death for his situation as a child. His mother abandoned him.. left him powerless, and every scrap of power Voldemort earned.

Basically, Voldemort's motive is not just world domination. He wants to eliminate the feral beasts he believes muggles to be. He does this the only way he knows how, via power. He had already gained "immortality", he knew that as soon as he became powerless he would die. He feared death so much because of that lack of power. For Tom Riddle, power was EVERYTHING. Without power you didnt eat, without power, you didnt drink, without power you didnt breathe. Tom Riddle sought power. Power to change his world so that he never had to be powerless.

*** I think you really hit the nail on the head here with his motives for desiring power and fearing death. As for OP's question about 'why blood purism?', I'd say I agree with most of the other posters here that he was just using them to further his ends and they happened to have the most money, knowledge and resources to be the more useful faction. However, I think there was bit more to it than them just being useful pawns.

Like you said, his experiences would have shaped his world view. With that in mind, let's consider what young Tom Riddle would have experienced upon entering the wizarding world. Though we know he's a half blood he did not know that until years later and entered the wizarding world with a muggle upbringing. Therefore he would have gotten the full brunt of what it was like to be a muggleborn in wizarding Britain. We can then conclude that he likely has a massive grudge against pureblood society for how they would have treated him.

Now fast-forward to his war. The most significant outcome of the war was the large death toll. We have multiple instances of entire houses, both light aligned and dark aligned, wiped out or nearly wiped out. The pureblood families, limited in number as they are, will never recover from this. The muggleborn deaths, on the other hand, will recover quite easily. Should he have actually won, any inevitable insurgency would have whittled pureblood numbers down even more while the tide of muggleborn would never end. The purebloods would thus eventually loose by way of bloody attrition as they killed themselves off.

We know Tom Riddle is extremely intelligent and had decades to plan his war. I find it hard to believe he would not realize this outcome. Therefore I think it's highly probable that this was by design. That he intended to use his war to grab power while simultaneously exacting his bloody revenge upon pureblood society by tricking them into to tearing themselves apart. Note that the Chamber of Secrets fiasco was likely meant as part of his plans to stir up the latent conflict.

On top of all this, lets remember that Tom was around for The Blitz, WWII, and its aftermath including the height of the Cold War. With this in mind, I'd like to draw attention to how he marked all his followers, the baddest of the bad and those purebloods he likely hated the most, with a very obvious tattoo, much like a certain dictator did to those he didn't like. I can only speculate about this, but given what we've already concluded as well as what we /know/ about the Dark Mark, he could have easily used it to find and exterminate all his leftover followers once he was done with them, perhaps taking on the guise of his true identity (which was unknown to the public) to ride in as the new vanquisher of the Dark Lord and claim power and prestige just like Dumbledore had. I also think may have intended the war to last a bit longer in order to force everyone to choose a side and show their true colors in order to better remove those he found undesirable.

As for his desire to conquer the muggles, there is, on top of his belief in wizarding supremacy, his desire to live forever. This plays a factor because he undoubtedly knew how WWII ended and about the ensuing global nuclear standoff. He was probably terrified that the muggles would blow up the world, ruining everything for him. Thus, he wants to conquer the world to save the world, if only for himself. Along a similar note, he's also probably an environmentalist, as I doubt he would want to rule over a sweltering, inundated, garbage heap of a planet any more that he would a nuclear wasteland.

I think, really, the only reason he didn't follow through with this plan was a) he didn't expect his Death Eaters to be so damn successful, and b) his continued creation of more horcruxes sent his sanity further and further off the deep end until Tom Riddle was truly gone and all that remained was the worst aspects of his Voldemort persona.

--------------

tl;dr: Tom brilliantly played the purebloods against themselves as revenge while secretly being a pro-muggleborn, anti-nuclear, environmentalist, but then he went crazy due to horcrux overdose.

** The only thing he ever seems to want is power. I believe the pureblooded movement was simply the easiest way he could find to get supporters, since knowledge of the dark arts is often tied to pureblooded families.

It's also possible that he genuinely believes in the pureblooded superiority. Perhaps he finds himself to be the exception to the rule.

** Keep in mind his eventual goal was control of not only Wizarding Britain, but beyond. And that included the muggle world. He wished to run it as he saw fit. As others have said, he "used" the pure bloods for funds, influence, power, and because they would be the most supportive of his goals, even though hes not exactly a pure blood extremist himself.

So at the end of the day, his goal (and motive) is simply power. Power to shape the world as he wishes. This goal likely stems from his self absorbed views of his strength and power, twisted by his family history and upbringing.

** I don't think this is intentional in canon, but, a fun theory is that Voldemort as an extremely powerful and intelligent halfblood is aware that mixed blood produces stronger wizards. So he allies himself with Purebloods in order to get rid of Muggleborns and stop intermarriages in order that he can remain at the top of the food chain, while the remaining Purebloods keep marrying each other and weakening the magic of their lines.
