Hi ! I remember reading this fic awhile go, it was about how Harry gets teleported from his post-war reality to another dimension, thanks to a ritual performed by his AU alive parents. Their Harry was killed by Voldemort as a baby, and they had another son, who was called Jonathan (I think).

It was incomplete and in my memory, the plot was a bit all over the place. But I remember one of the first scenes, when Harry confronts this AU Order of the Phenix and his parents, was really touching and even made me tear up a bit.

Does any of this ring a bell to anyone?

*** Oh thank you! Have you read it? Do you recommend it? (the previous one left me disappointed so I'm more cautious now)

**** Its really really good, though with a lot of angst, imagine a more emotionally unbalanced Harry meeting himself (though older) and his parents from another dimension that haven't had any break during the war. Combined with AU Harry's problems and his sister (which I forgot her name, but I'm pretty sure its flower-related) and 2 Voldemorts and a suspicious Dumbledore against him. Though its mentioned abuse, its mild compared to most fanon. The most interesting thing is the relationship between Canon Harry and AU James, and Canon Harry and Canon Sirius. Its been a while since the last update, but the author haven't abandoned, and he responds to reviews, which is nice. IMO, is worth. IF you want another fic, though this one is A METRIC FUCKTON Dark , there's linkffn(Imprisioned Realm) which is fantastic but really really dark, with a lot of graphical analysis(medical reports) of rape and torture (on Harry) and its generally angst-filled, but not in the teenage emo-way. Real heavy shit. If you can stomach that, you'll get a fan-fucking-tastic fanfiction, which is about 2 chapters to ending.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? This is a very dark fic. Warnings within. A/N: Currently editing fic.
