*** Oh god, within chapter one he's gone to the goblins, who are, for some reason, Horcrux experts, got a blood adoption, and is now Harry-Potter-Black of the "Potter-Black Clan". It's already mentioned betrothals and house elves have become his minions.

Is there a fanfiction cliche bingo board?

Edit: It just keeps getting worse. Ron only wants to go back because the conniving shrew Molly convinced Ron to love potion Harry and Hermione to keep them apart.

Edit 2: He's now a dark magic expert, his patronus has changed to a hungarian horntail for no particular reason, and Dumbledore is an idiot. Oh, and Daphne came out of nowhere and they fell in love.

And it's done. That was awful.

  What if Hermione had accidently Disapparated along with Ron during the hunt while trying to stop him? How would Harry have managed to defeat Voldemort alone?

** So, I am more or less good writing action and plot, so I have been reading these romance fics thinking they can help me improve at that department and found this linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13639243/1/Still-Searching]])

It is a WIP but it is updating once or twice per week.

It is well written, even if chaps are not that long and plot is advance but little between them. It focuses on characterization. It does feel like the main focus is romance, though there are also seeds there to move the adventure forward. No weird leap in logic or canon faithfulness which usually put me off on single point of divergence fics.
