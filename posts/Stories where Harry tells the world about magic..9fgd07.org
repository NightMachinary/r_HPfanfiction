Are there any stories where Harry spills the beans on magic. Any stories where he either builds up to it via releasing "miracle potions", and/or charmed objects first, or where he just outright tells everyone. It has to be deliberate though, no accidentally releasing the secret, it has to be done purposely.

As usual, the more words the merrier.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** linkffn(The Fight For Rights) does this awesomely.

*** this story is good so far. it's got a good cast of varied characters, all colorful types. the author writes nice characters and character interactions, but the plot is pretty epic in scope too and it's got some huge worldbuilding going on, and i like that. i always like the huge globe trotting fantasies or planet hopping scifi stories. xD so this is a pretty nice story for me so far. i hope it only gets bigger with that.

** I'm not a fan of /Damn Wizards/ linkffn(7782623), but it does have Harry telling the world about magic and some on how that works out. It's a sequel to an angsty one shot linkffn(7573003).

  This is the sequel to Harry's Had Enough. You don't have to read that first, but it might be better if you do. Harry in a position on power, he's a bit unscrupulous in this one. Dumbledore, Ministry and Death Eater bashing. Also a bit of Ron bashing and general wizard society bashing. H/Hr. Now Complete!

  Title pretty much says it all. OotP AU, some swear words. No pairing, though HP/HG is hinted at a little. Harry does what he should have done. Complete for now. Author's Note added!

** I'm not sure if they fully count, but lots of fics have Harry as... not the prime mover in the breakdown of the Statue of Secrecy, but a contributor, or there helping the process be less catastrophic. Some examples:

With Strength of Steel Wings linkffn(9036071) - Harry is involved with a (mostly muggle) conspiracy to destroy the SoS. long but dead.

For Love of Magic linkffn(11669575) - Voldemort irrevocably breaks the SOS without Harry's help, but while the ICW is busy panicing ineffectively, Harry does TV interviews to help the muggle world understand magic. long and complete.

The Queen who fell to Earth linkffn(7591040) - I don't actually remember the details anymore, but the SoS collapsed and muggles took over (not necessarily in that order), and Harry might have given it a little helping hand. Er... in the whole series, the link is just book 1. long and complete.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
