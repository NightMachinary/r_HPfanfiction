What story do you want to read?

What plot bunny do you wish was turned into a full fledged story?

What challenge do you want to be picked up?

What oneshot do you /need/ to be expanded on?

Hopefully we can share some ideas and maybe inspire some original stories. If anyone does write any ideas please let us know.

I've posted something similar a few times, if you're interested in having a look at previous responses [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5z4b1c/what_story_would_you_love_to_read/][here]] is a link.


** One where harry is a bit of an antiestablishment asshole.

Premise: Harry at a young age realized that no matter what he did he was going to get into trouble. Harry also learned the phrase "Malicious Compliance." The result? A bit of an asshole who creatively misinterprets what assholes in authority tell him to do as his way of fighting back.

So Snape taking points off in the first potions class for not stopping Neville (who wasn't his lab partner, mind you) from screwing up the potion? /Clearly/ Snape was telling him that his brewing skills were second to none and he needed to act as an impromptu teaching assistant. And since Draco was also an asshole to him, he decides to spend the next class constantly telling draco what to do (and being hilariously wrong about it) under the guise of "Doing what Professor Snape told me to do and keeping an eye out on the students with less talent than me."

Basically force snape into the position of reversing punishments because he's trying to punish harry for mutually exclusive things.

The famous "points off for breathing" fannon? Harry holds his breath until he passes out. Stuff like that. Just Harrys civil disobedience against unfair punishments.

** I want to read a fic where magic stops working and everyone has to figure out what happened and bring it back. It would be entertaining to see wizards, especially purebloods try to figure out how to do things, especially once they realize there are no more house elves, no more floo network, household charms to do everything and you can no longer apparate across the country in a second. The chaos would be glorious. Imagine Hogwarts now visible to muggles, how would you explain a random castle and village appearing out of nowhere.

Would purebloods start to understand muggle world and would their hate towards everything muggle lessen? How would they handle now having to rely on halfbloods and muggleborns to explain things to them. Would Voldemort disappear and what would death eaters do when they have no idea how to function without magic?

*** A sudden loss of magic would be extremely catastrophic for them:

Since Voldemort was basically a magical construct at that time, his body would crumple, his horcruxes would dissipate, and he would simply die.

The Burrow would implode on itself and kill/injure anyone inside, but its effect wouldn't be nearly as spectacular as Malfoy Manor's implosion. Similarly across the world, all expansion charms and magically supported structures would collapse on themselves and kill most people inside.

Items stored inside magically enlarged bags and trunks would simply be destroyed. All conjured objects would disappear, and all transfigured objects would revert to its original state.

Broom riders would crash to ground instantly, Those apparating or in the Floo network would be annihilated.

All wards, including Fidelius Charms, would break and reveal their contents to the world. The Muggles would become utterly baffled by all the sudden destructions.

*** I've always wanted to see this too, except in my head magic stops working, but only the creation of magic by wizards and other beings. So no one can cast a spell or brew potions that require a wand, but things that already have magical properties can still be used (i.e. Floo Powder or charmed objects until the charm wears off). This could be interesting because while wizards have to deal with the consequence of not being able to produce and propagate magic, they still have proof it can exist, setting many on a quest to discover how it can be restored.

****** I am not sure since since I haven't read a first person book in a while, but I believe literature in 1st person is fine, especially since most published works have good writing or are actually told from that person's perspective so they match that persons voice and feel right. I am also perfectly happy to read first person POV responses on [[/r/writingprompts]] too. I believe it's because it makes sense for them because they are not told from established characters POV and writers on there are generally good about making a convincing first person POV work for the prompts.

There is something about 1st person POV fanfiction that I absolutely can't stand though. Maybe it's because it completely doesn't match the voice I imagine for the characters and makes me cringe. Everyone sounds like a teenager, or the descriptions just don't make sense for first person and it sounds ridiculous and horrible. I feel like it amplifies any mistakes in writing and characterizations and makes it sound completely off and wrong if not done right. In the fic for example, Snapes POV sounds nothing like him and the writing style just completely turns me off. They take this complex, absolutely amazing character and make a fic about him sound nothing like him and make it boring with descriptions of random things in first person.

Can you really imagine Snape of all people having this though process? He may even do the action described, but actively thinking that he needs to tuck his hair. No, there is just no way.

I do love the seventh horcrux though so there are definitely some fics where first person POV works. It's funny, it's interesting, you feel like you are in harrymonts head following his crazy though processes and observations and actions. First person POV of characters like Snape, Dumbledore, or even Harry describing how they are gasping and tucking their hair between the ears just sounds stupid.

******* That's a very interesting perspective. I mainly ask because I'm currently writing a first person fic (actually about Snape, lol), and I'm doing my best to try and avoid common pitfalls.

I guess for me any bad writing is enough to put me off, and I don't especially tolerate bad third person fics better than bad first person fics.

The description of random things I don't necessarily mind, although I definitely think it can get quickly tedious. I like the occasional touches that add a bit of visual flair to writing, although I think there's sort of this trope in fan fic with authors excessively describing things like scenery and clothing and such.

Anyway, thanks for sharing!

** I really want a longer story dealing with Harry falling prey to the lure of the Resurrection Stone. So many important figures in his life died. I know and love the one shot based around this but there is so much scope for expansion. I really want Tom Riddle hating death so much that he's by far the most useful shade Harry ever summons as Tom will do anything to avoid being sent back. As Harry has to deal with the idea that his best teacher and friend is a dead dark lord who killed his parents. Tom Riddle can be incredibly charming if he needs to be but after he became Voldemort he used fear instead. Harry knows this but does he care so long as Tom keeps being so useful?

His parents, his 'uncles' his teachers, the man who shaped his life (Voldemort) all dead, Hedwig too. Harry had been so strong for so long, would anyone blame him for his slight weakness.

Eventually someone from his past has to come and try and break him out of his funk but how does life compare to the dead? What problems have arisen while he's been in his self imposed exile?

*** I had this weird headcanon the moment I finished Deathly Hallows when it first came out that Teddy Lupin finds the Resurrection Stone some time in his early Hogwarts years. He uses it and gets to know what his parents were like through the shadows of their former selves.

His conversations with them shape some of his innocent decisions early on- he asks his mother and father for advice on dealing with a strict teacher, or asking out a girl, or how to live with being different than other kids in more than one way.

As he grows older, he falls prey to the Resurrection Stone as the second brother did. He struggles to not see his parents as real people he has real relationships with, though they are merely shadows of people he has never really known. They cannot hold him when he is in pain, or defend him from the evils of the world. He starts to retreat into the obsession with the stone- no one else can be a part of this world with these infallible ghosts of his parents.

Teddy becomes more and more depressed in his later years of Hogwarts. His grades are reasonably good early on, but when he starts to fail even Transfiguration, Andromeda, Harry and Victoire can all tell something is up. One day Teddy goes into his room during summer holiday visit to the Burrow and finds the stone is gone. He is horrified, convinced someone has discovered his secret, and suspects Victoire. He finally confronts her in a climactic scene where her life is unintentionally put in danger, when Harry talks him down by revealing he confiscated the Stone, which snaps him out of this obsession. At the end, Teddy slowly recovers, and at the start of his seventh year goes with Victoire into the Hidden Items hall of the Room of Requirment, where the Gabrathian Fire still smoke in some places. He throws the ring in and starts to rebuild his life, letting go of idealized versions of people he will never know, while embracing the imperfect people who care about him the most.

I was gonna write a version of it, then I realized that someone else already wrote a book or two about destroying a ring that drives you to obsession. Pretty sure there are a couple wizards in it too.

** Remember how in Book 7 it's mentioned that if a Secret Keeper dies, everyone who they told the secret becomes a Secret Keeper in turn?

Suppose in the Shrieking Shack in book 3, Peter accused Sirius of this, and being the spy? That is, when Peter became the Secret Keeper, Sirius helped to capture him and deliver him to the Death Eaters, and gave him an ultimatum; tell Voldemort the secret, or die so that Sirius can tell Voldemort the secret (when in actuality, a Death Eater, Barty Crouch Jr with his amazing talent for mimicry perhaps, impersonated Sirius to interrogate Peter).

Peter chose to tell the secret (and gets branded with a dark mark as a 'reward'), with the full intention of escaping and warning the Potters. Successfully escaping captivity (although too late to warn the Potters), he catches up to Sirius and publicly accuses him...and that's when an assassin sent to kill Peter for escaping blasts him (which Peter manages to survive), conveniently framing Sirius for the murder at the same time. He's been in hiding ever since for fear that the servants of the Dark Lord would catch him and use him to get their spy out of jail.

--------------

From there, the story could go in a number of directions:

- The group believe Peter over Sirius; a heartbroken Sirius flees the Shack for places unknown. Fearing that the 'evil' Sirius Black is going to reunite with Voldemort, the trio and Lupin work with Peter to spy on Malfoy and other former followers for signs that the Dark Lord has contacted them/has been resurrected, all the while beginning to doubt Sirius's actual guilt.

- The group believe Sirius over Peter; feeling betrayed, Peter escapes as per canon, utterly corrupted by his newfound hatred for both dark and light. He joins Voldemort, but backstabs him after killing Frank Bryce and making Nagini a Horcrux, having learned Voldemort's secret of immortality, setting out on a campaign to bring down the Statute of Secrecy and the whole wizarding world.

- With both sides managing to prove that they're telling the truth (from their perspectives, anyway), the group figure out that a Death Eater impersonated Sirius to trick Peter. Before they can go back to the castle and exonerate both parties, though, the assassin from 13 years ago, tracking Peter through his Dark Mark, blows up the Shrieking Shack to try and kill everyone again; Hermione, Ron, Harry (and possibly Snape?) escape death by using Hermione's time turner, while Sirius, Peter and a transformed-into-werewolf Lupin team up to escape the burning Shack and flee to places unknown.

Maybe he was kidnapped and gave up the secret for his life-- that's pretty plausible as well. We knew he was a coward from the books too.

But with a boy on the verge of a breakdown, and a potions master still harbouring a school-day grudge, will they be able to put aside their differences and learn to trust in each other?

But Harry thinks of Hermione as a sister... so that must mean... her mother is his soulmate!

Cue cracky hijinks of Harry flirting with Mrs Granger while she tries to convince him to target her daughter all while an incredibly offended Hermione huffs in the background. Or maybe Mrs Granger is flattered by the attention, and eventually Harry is trying to convince Hermione to call him "Dad".

** I'd like to see a rewrite of DH with following elements:

- Dumbledore gave his stuffs to Harry through Professor McGonagall.

- Dumbledore warned key Order members about Taboo in case the Ministry fell.

- Dumbledore and key Order members set up contingency plans in case Dumbledore or Harry died.

- Harry, in disguise, transferred all his vaults to multiple secure foreign locations, and withdrew significant amount of Galleons and Pounds.

- Bill/Fleur wedding was held in France at bride's mansion, according to tradition. Due to rapidly deteriorating security situations in Britain, it would make even more sense.

- After Dumbledore's Death, Harry did not waste an entire month holed up in Number 4 Privet Drive, but in a safe house outside Britain, protected by a Fidelius Charm. He spent his time training, reading, and occasionally procuring supplies, under disguise.

- Delacours were an influential and wealthy French wizarding family. The wedding was held at Delacour Estate under heavy security precaution. The British Ministry still fell on the wedding night, and Voldemort launched a major attack on the wedding, in order to eliminate a large number of his enemies.

- The attack caused large casualties on both sides. The French were ticked off, and the Weasleys were stranded in France. Ginny would go to Beauxbaton as a result. Remaining Order members in Britain went into hiding.

- The Trio needed to infiltrate back into Britain. To provide diversions, polyjuiced 'Harry' would occasionally pop up at important magical sites in Europe. Voldemort would deploy a significant number of Death Eaters in pursuit, and Voldemort himself would seek the Elderwand. Much of the new regime's attention was diverted away from Britain.

- The Trio successfully returned to Britain through Muggle means. They began searching Number 12 Grimmauld Place and returned to canon track here. During the Ministry Op, they liberated dozens of Muggleborns, took the Locket, and killed Umbridge and Yaxley. With Sword of Gryffindor in hand, they quickly dispatched the Locket.

- At Hogwarts, Neville, Susan, and Luna reformed the DA. At Beauxbatons, Ginny became popular quickly and together with Gabrielle, tried to enlist volunteers for their cause.

- In France, pursuing Death Eaters went skirmishing with exiled Order members and French local authorities. As retaliation for the killing of Umbridge and Yaxley, the British Ministry demanded extradition from French, but was promptly rejected. Weasleys tried to seek more support from the French, but only achieved limited success.

I will stop here. I'd like to read what you think.

*** On the one hand, a lot of this makes logical sense.

On the other hand, none of this really contributes towards the development of a single, clear plotline resulting in the death of Voldemort.

The way this appears now is that it would lead to a kind of war-variant of "endless summer" syndrome of training and fighting relatively meaningless battles (in the strategic sense) without ever really progressing any kind of mystery/adventure plotline which will result in a way to defeat Voldemort.

The problem with writing a gritty, realistic war fic is that Voldemort cannot be defeated by martial means. He's too great a wizard as an individual - a century of training isn't going to raise Harry, or any Order member, to Voldemort's level.

On top of that, Voldemort's Death Eaters both outnumber and outclass the Order.

And on top of that, Voldemort controls the Ministry and all its authority and powers.

Even if the entire Order managed to get Voldemort on his own, it's not clear that they would be able to defeat him in a duel, and even less clear that they would be able to prevent him from escaping. Voldemort vs. Slughorn, McGonagall and Kingsley in DH couldn't have lasted more than a minute, but within that short time Voldemort landed multiple lethal spells on each of them - only Harry's sacrificial protection prevented them from dying many times over.

Simply put: deus ex machina is the only realistic way to defeat Voldemort. Any alternate DH has to develop an alternate deus ex machina.

The changes you've made above lend themselves best, really, to a story about how the Order does everything better than in canon... but ends up losing because they've put all their eggs in the basket of trying to defeat Voldemort on his own terms - conventional magical strength.

***** It has a thing called "old magic" which is sort of based on folkish types of magic and is only used in certain places and situations. There is a sequel which has less of it iirc.

If I'm remembering it right the story is set in a world where Neville is the BWL and Harry turned out to be very skilled at magic so Dumbledore takes him as a student, the fic is set some years into their "apprenticeship" so they are quite close and good friends by then.

That said, canon magic kind of does: how well magic works for people and what kind of magic works for whom does seem to depend on personality. Lockhart --- the character most obsessed with how others perceive him --- can do effective and precise Memory Charms, but the rest of the magic doesn't work well for him; and for Harry, "wearing his emotions on his sleeve" gives him a powerful Patronus, while crippling his Occlumency.

SLYTHERIN\\
What are the Slytherins like post-war? I sort of picture the first year sitting down and an older student leaning over to apologize to them. Is there disappointment involved for the first year? How do the Slytherins feel about Snape? The Malfoys? How are the older students handling the loss of their parents/jailing of their parents/death of friends? How do they handle grieving their loss? Do other students torment them about their family members? How does the shifting power from dark to light change the Slytherins? They're power hungry, but many of them backed the loser, do they now back the winners? Is Slughorn the head of Slytherin still? What's he doing to bolster his students?

HOGWARTS\\
How do the other students treat the Slytherins? Are they bullied for being the children of Death Eaters? What about the first years? Are they dragged into it without having anything to do with the war? What kind of damage has been done to Hogwarts itself? Is the cleanup still ongoing?

The only person she trusts enough is Sirius, and she names him guardian if her and Ted die. The worse case scenario happens, and Sirirus starts raising Tonks. When voldemort kills James and Lily, sirius somehow can prove his innocence, and gets custody of Harry.

Sirius then goes on to raise Tonks and Harry.

The gambit pileup: Voldemort sends some expendable Death Eaters to keep the Ministry of Magic busy defending their building for a while, while he goes out on a romp slaughtering muggles and kidnapping muggleborns for his rituals.

BUT, at the same time the attack is scheduled, a werewolf (or alternatively, goblin) angered at wizarding prejudice plants a bomb in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, aiming to kill a lot of people with the act of terrorism/sabotage and pressure the Wizengamot into releasing some of its grip on his kind.

AND, while the attack is going off, Percy Weasley, secretly a spy for the Order, is investigating each Department in turn in search of damning evidence, having exploited his position as Junior Assistant to the Undersecretary blah blah to learn the workings of certain wards and temporarily disable them so he isn't detected and apprehended.

   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
When all three of these events collide, the impact is catastrophic; the combination of weakened defences and a well-timed bomb let the Death Eaters get far further than they should have, preventing the Aurors from mobilising effectively, and ultimately doing enough damage to completely destroy the Ministry.

Which means that, forget about being too late to stop Voldemort taking muggleborns, the Obliviators never make it to the crime scenes at all. With the unexpected fatal blow to the British Ministry and the ICW not having enough warning to intervene, the Statute of Secrecy comes crashing down in Britain as police and rescue services country wide report a teleporting madman setting fires, killing people with strange green lasers and kidnapping seemingly random children.

** Hunger Games crossover in which England/Great Britain/whatever is separated from the rest of the world by magic and ruled by Voldemort, Grindelwald, or some other dark wix of the past, along with an elite ruling class of purebloods and Dark wix. The Statute of Secrecy is broken, of course. The purebloods live in the Capitol (near Hogwarts, probably), and blood traitors, half-bloods, and known squib descendants live in the upper districts. Muggles form the resistance of District 13, salvaging and documenting old tech from before the takeover, hoping to rise up against the government. Resistance members give their children strange, old names to remember their ancestors' cultures before the takeover. Notable examples include names like Telephone, Automobile, Electricity, and Computer, which are shortened to Telly, Auto, Ellie, and /something else I don't even know/, respectively.

Muggleborns, when discovered, are sent to the Capitol- to Hogwarts- to learn to fight and do magic, before they are forced to join the Hunger Games. The victor or victors (there may be many because of the sheer number of muggleborns, and the purebloods' wish to expand the population of magical people) get jobs in the Capitol, and are 'encouraged' (read coerced) to interbreed with other magicals. They are also Peacekeepers. There isn't as much of a stigma against victors, since the Games are a sort of twisted culling to find the best, most powerful muggleborns, who are 'less mudblooded' and 'more pure' than the rest.

A big difference would be that the people in the Games would be known ahead of time because of their accidental magic. They would be pulled from their districts at age eleven, and would compete in their first Hunger Games at the end of a year of learning at Hogwarts to use their magic to fight and survive. But they can't have just the one game, and when they're eleven, no less; that would be boring. Instead, each year for their 'final exams' they take part in the Games. Purebloods in the Capitol follow their favorites through their 'careers', rooting for them and getting invested in their stories, like with sports. The kids have to balance learning enough to survive and fight other kids, and learning enough to have successful careers in the Capitol after they pass the maximum age for competition (if they don't have family money and aren't popular enough to become celebrities).

There are probably all sorts of atrocities commited by the magical ruling class, with the first that come to mind being daily selective Memory Charms, Confundus charms, and Imperius curses that eventually degrade the charmed person into a lifeless sort of automaton. There's also lots of muggle abuse, random hexes sent in the streets that can't be retaliated against, that kind of thing. Just to add to the dystopian vibe that we got from /The Hunger Games/.

I feel like the Harry Potter characters could be stuffed into the roles of the characters in /The Hunger Games/, but it would be better if their roles were original and made sense in this kind of universe. An OC cast would be fine, too. I just love the idea of these two worlds combining and the class dynamics and the more widespread, non-secretive use of magic.

Edit: Wow, I just realized that the most recent reply other than my own was four months ago. I'm really late to the game, huh.

** A "Harry gets turned into a girl" fic that deal with the following:

- How does a non-trans, straight dude deal with the fact he has been turned into a woman with no (known) way of turning back?

- It happened publicly. No "I'm Dorea Black, the new exchange student" stuff. How does the public, the adults, the students, his friends react and adapt?

Then I'd want a Founders Era fic. Maybe a Helga Hufflepuff who grew up in the Danelaw? A Salazar Slytherin who is sceptic of the christian King who endeavors to rule all of England. A Godric Gryffindor who is a honor bound knight and Rowena who comes back from her travels, educated and guided in her magic by more civilized societies of the time.

As someone else already stated: A Harry/bellatrix that doesn't suck major cliche ass.

A Sirius / Bellatrix with the same requirement. Maybe a timetravel thingie? Sirius is sent back in time when he's thrown into the veil and when he tries to correct his wrongs, he ends up being married to Bellatrix. I don't know...

A fic in which James and Lily join Voldemort. Harry grows up in a Death-Eater Regime. I even had a few ideas for this, but unfortunately never a plot.

- The new regime has a problem: Too little children. Mudbloods can't actually be wifes, but are good enough breeders to keep around. So are Veela and other lesser beings, as long as they breed with a pureblood wizard. James ends up being forced into a marriage with Bellatrix Black (since Rodolphus is blamed for their lack of children), and Apolline Delacour (as her husband is killed when Britain annexed Northern France).

- Harry grows up with a big, rather dysfunctional family. As James has sired enough children in the eyes of the Lord Emperor Voldemort, he is sent to the front to die. Bellatrix as a high ranking Death Eater is officer of a homeland defense force. She ends up getting hurt quite a bit. Knowing that Bella Black is literally the only thing standing between Lily and Appoline being re-married (or whatever dire fate), they eventually form some sort of trust with each other. Lily and Appoline see to it that bella's children are cared for and that she never has to stand before the Lord Emperor wounded or bloody. Bellatrix keeps a protecting hand over them two.

- The Order of the Phoenix has found international support and became an Army. Dumbledore leads it as Supreme Mugwump. Sirius, Remus and Peter are core members of its forces. Peter is a sleeper agent of Voldemort.

- Voldemort has the prophecy. Given his lack of understanding between the concepts of living and surviving, he interprets it in a way that makes Harry a guarantee for his immortality. When Harry is fourteen, he becomes apprentice to the Lord Emperor.

- The prophecy is eventually fulfilled, and Harry kills Voldemort, but not in the role of a Chosen One, but in the role of an Usurper to the throne. He will rule less in the lines of Voldemort and more in the line of Grindelwald (who I imagine freed, and as the mentor behind Harry). As such in the epilogue, Harry opens up his campaign to "Clean the undeserving off the Earth".

** linkffn(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen)

This fic is not good. It's a poorly written angstfest with bashing, power levels, and superabused!Harry. However there are some concepts and ideas within that would make for something really great if someone were to write it.

Voldemort is influenced by Harry instead of the other way around. Harry's blood, and the soul contact makes Voldemort more Harry like.

Voldemort, more sane and less obsessed, succeeds at the Dept of Mysteries. Attempts to subvert prophesy by banishing Harry to a different dimension.

The story takes place in both places, connected by the link Harry and Voldemort share. They develop an antagonistic comradery.

In the new place the Potters still live, etc, etc. We get all the fun character moments from seeing how everyone differs in this world. Harry comes into conflict with the other Voldemort, aided by his mentor Voldemort.

Really there is just so much potential here, things can be differed radially yet the foundation of this story is so intriguing I don't know why people haven't used it to death by now.
