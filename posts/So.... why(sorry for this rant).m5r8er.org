Backstory: I'm a massive Percy Jackson fan. Dope books, sequels don't feel tedious, and are written very well. So, the fandom is kinda starved of good fics. For good content, most recommend a fic that hasn't been updated in YEARS! Although there are fics I like, they aren't immensely popular. There are weird ships for sure. For example, one of the main characters is shipped with a brick that smacked him in the head one time.

I jumped to the HP fandom around October or November. Full disclosure, I am a straight guy. For that reason, male x male fics do nothing for me. But in the HP universe, so many fics are like this. My main issue is Tom Riddle x anyone, or any pairings between student and teacher.

I don't get the reason for this. Why do people ship Tom Riddle with Harry and Hermione, or more disturbingly, Minerva McGonagall? A massive part of his backstory is that he CAN'T feel love. The only fic of Tom x Harry I don't instantly throw away was a Lomonaaeren fic called Genius by the numbers, and I ditched that when Horcrux! Tom gave harry all his horcruxes to convince him to trust and marry him.

Snarry and Drarry are also disturbing. Why does this happen? For some reason, fanfic authors here believe that any characters who don't like each other just have unresolved sexual tension? Can't they just hate each other? Ah yes, of course Lucius Malfoy is in a relationship with Arthur Weasley! Bellatrix tortured Hermione because she loved her and couldn't get her attention! Why not?

Finally, why Ron bash? I loved I'm not a hero, by JustBored21, but I wish they didn't bash Ron. While Dumbledore and Hermione could be considered dicey characters, Ron is literally a super loyal dude with one blemish on his resume. It's not even that I want Hermione or Dumbledore bashed. I just wish the ratio of Ron to Hermione bashing was more even.

Conversely, why do we hold up Hermione as a goddess? Like, Ron's main exposed flaw is.... he eats messily. He's a teenage boy! He's gonna do that! I don't get why Hermione's jealousy and abrasive personality isn't blown out of proportion the same way Ron's smaller flaws are.

​

Thanks for reading this rant! I just wanted to understand how a fandom with much better fics than the PJO fandom has these traits. Please let me know.

​

Sidenote: Can someone rec me a fic like Sekrit Project, where no one is bashed but people like Hermione, who are normally held up as deities, have their flaws exposed?

​

Edit: Super sorry about saying m x m fics do nothing for me. I definitely phrased that wrong. I do read m x m fics, I just tend to prefer fics that are m x f, especially in HP fandom because the M x M fics besides Remus x Sirius don't feel right to me. Not because they are m x m, but more because Harry x Draco, or Harry x Snape doesn't seem plausible unless one of the two had serious character changes, to the point where they aren't the same character. Sorry about this!


** I write almost exclusively Tom Riddle, so I'll take a crack at explaining my why.

He's the character that most interests me in the series. His early life is tragic, his young adulthood is depressing, and his evil villain plan makes no sense without some pretty extreme rationalizations. He dies without accomplishing much, at an age that's probably quite a bit younger than most wizards die at, if they die from old age.

In other words, he's fantastic to explore with alternate universes. I'll bin an assumption (like that he cannot love---I hate JKR's justification of that, so I never use it) and set up an alternate premise, and write from that point on. My Tom isn't an irredeemably evil man, heck, I would say I rarely make him explicitly, distressingly evil. He's a person with a complex life story that I permute in strange ways because I'm so much more interested in exploring the growth of someone who has a lot of room to grow than exploring a character who is already generally a good person. I enjoy romance, so I'll write him in a romantic pairing, but the question for my stories is never “when will these two bang?,” it's always something related to Tom's emotional development. He's fun, for me.

And I totally get that's not what everyone wants to read. He's a villain. It's cool if that totally turns you off. You might find that there's a lot more of the stuff you like in the rare pair world, for example, which tends to focus on giving non-major characters the sort of depth of development that they didn't get in the series. But those of us who like the villains definitely know they're bad, and we either want to revel in that depravity or work with a character who is starting from a much worse place.

** I dunno. People like to explore dynamics and I wouldn't shame anyone for it as long as it isn't like straight up Pedophilia. I myself don't read Snarry, Drarry, Hermione/Bellatrix and so on simply because it's not my jam and I don't enjoy reading about unhealthy relationships or Dark!Harry because it gives me anxiety. (Don't flame me plenty shippers have said unhealthy dynamics are the reason why they like certain ships) And also it isn't that hard to avoid those fics if you don't feel like reading them. Everytime I go looking for something on ao3 I purge the tags I don't want to read about.

** The Harry Potter fandom is real vulnerable to memetic influences. When an idea gets liked for whatever reason, it tends to spread throughout the fandom very thoroughly. Someone read Robst, liked it, and wrote another. Then another person did the same, and then another, and then another. This happens a lot. Then, suddenly, we have a couple thousand fics on that idea and I have enough of them bookmarked to have a folder in my archives labelled 'Robst-likes'. :D

Take that pattern and apply it to about a dozen different sites and a few dozen little social-media-ey forum-type pockets of the internet over the last thirty years and you end up with this fandom. A lot of those pockets have disappeared through various bits of drama over the years, so a lot of times the origin of these cliches have disappeared too.

The idea about enemies-to-lovers is a Draco-in-Leather pants trope where the good guys are secretly evil and the evil guys are secretly misunderstood. Tends to be with pretty villains, and tends to mostly be because the writer wants to write romance where a good character 'fixes a villain with their love'.

**** Hi! Like I was saying to the other user, I still read M x M pairings. In fact, it might just be that I don't see the compatibility between characters I see in HP M x M fics that make them less enjoyable for me. I read several fics in the PJO universe with M x M pairings, because I see how a romantic relationship there might work. I didn't mean to offend anyone, and I'm immensely sorry if what I said was offensive at all. Sorry about that!

Edit: I have read All the Young Dudes, and I do tend to enjoy Remus x Sirius, because I think that pairing works.

***** Regarding your point about compatibility: maximum yes! I find a lot of the main pairings in HP fic to be really gross because so many of them are like Harry or Hermione paired with someone who was a Death Eater in canon, with creepy age differences being highly likely. Hermione/Voldemort is basically magical Anne Frank/Hitler (if Hitler was an expert in mind-altering magic), and Harry/Voldemort is even worse, yet somehow those are popular pairings? What the entire, actual, literal and complete goddamn /fuck/?! It doesn't help that I strongly dislike the two youngest Weasleys, which kinda turns me off Hinny and Romione ships as well.

Even the tolerable pairings have a tendency to start out too young - the whole "11y/o romance" thing heebies my jeebies. Pretty much the only decent 'Harry x dude' pairing I've read was GoF-era Harry/Cedric, and that's still pretty fucking dodgy in pairing a 14y/o and a 17y/o.

Also, agree 100% that Wolfstar is adorbs (I say, as a straight guy who doesn't enjoy reading about romance).

  Finally, why Ron bash?
#+end_quote

This is quite frankly something that's easy to explain: his actions. He's super loyal yes, but also extremely jealous. Book 4 gives us a perfect insight into it after Harry is chosen as a Champion. He's always the one left at the side for Percy, Bill, Charlie, and even the twins to a certain point. So, when faced with that, the bashing comes easy to people.

It's easier to focus on jealousy than loyalty, and your post actually identifies the reason why:

#+begin_quote
  While Dumbledore and Hermione could be considered dicey characters, Ron is literally a super loyal dude with one blemish on his resume.
#+end_quote

That second quote is why. "One blemish on his resume" is a false statement, as book 3 has him not only not help Hagrid with the Buckbeak case until the last possible moment(if I remember the books correctly), but also ignores that he was upset at Hermione for going to someone she trusted when Harry received a Firebolt with no card.
