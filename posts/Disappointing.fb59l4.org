I've been reading A Cadmean Victory, seen this fic being rec everywhere in this sub and I'm sorry to say this but it's trash. The plot might be good, idk, I can't keep going, so I'll never find out. Everyone is annoying, the writing is pedantic, nobody talks like that and if I have to read one more chapter of Fleur Mary-Sue Delacour's superior breeding and awesomeness, I will gauge my own eyes out of their sockets and eat it. Why do people keep recommending this fic?


** When I read fanfic a lot I had a really high tolerance for reallt trope-y stories. I read just about every trope you could possibly think of and usually enjoyed it.

Cadmean Victory was one of the very few stories I couldn't finish. It's just too much.

**** IME, soulbond/soulmate is a trope that needs to be the focus for the fic to be any good. This does not mean it will be good, just that it becomes any other trope. Casual/off-hand use of it is basically “I can't write romance, but I need an excuse to write my terrible smut/live out my fantasies” Same as Lord Potter, really. It's either a dedicated Political!Harry story or “I don't want my OC wearing a Harry suit to face consequences, so he needs money and a Malfoy-like level of power”.

** Love Harry/fleur, I actually like her characterization in that fic. I couldn't finish it either though. Like, the whole premise is “Harry is pissed that wormtail got away, and vows to get wormtail back and prove serious innocent next time” and then he runs into wormtail, and JUST FUCKING KILLS HIM!

**** Here's the ffn description “The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.”

And the first chapter or so is him being angry about wormtail. It seems like the author quite literally “lost the plot”. I wanted to like it because it's a novel length slow-burn Harry/fleur, which is my favorite fan fiction thing ever. But nope. It was just too shit. The reason people like it I think is because it's long and finished. Do yourself a favor, read linkffn(when a Veela cries) instead. It's not finished but it's ducking amazing.

Strangely, very often (but not always) better the story, less popularity it has. Good writing is slow, takes time to build up the plot, flesh out characters, avoids the usual popular tropes / cliches. And therefore tend to be more boring at the start.

**** Canon is a mix of good and bad, and you can't look at specific actions/performances to judge the capabilities of the characters. For instance, Dumbledore in canon can easily be seen as a complete idiot and incompetent, whereas the character is clearly meant to be much better than that - because the plot (particularly the early ones) needs to deliberately end up with Harry & his friends solving everything.

Fleur and the other champions are a victim of that - we see very little of them, and they can't be any better than Harry, because then he wouldn't have a chance and it'd be boring.

What we /do/ know from Fleur is that she's smart & competent, good with charms (enough to put a dragon to sleep), and a bit full of herself. The most common fanon perspective of her that I've seen, far more than anything else, is to turn her into a complete meme that just throws her allure around and is incompetent at everything else, which is just boring and shit.

Fleur's a character I've always wanted to read good characterizations of (and not just because she's the only french character around Harry's age :P ), but it's hard to find.

**** She was the worst performing because of two understandable reasons. Firstly, while this isn't confirmed, I suspect she has a natural disadvantage at the very least and huge impairment in the second task as it is water task due to her Veela heritage. I wouldn't be surprised if this means she has a worse time then most people in water easily. That and the emotional response to a loved one being taking. This all causes her to lose faith in herself and believe she doesn't deserve to win. Victor, Cedric, and Fleur see that Harry is indeed in mortal peril, in which they seem to make a pact to protect Harry as much as possible. Didn't see get out of the last task because she was being tortured by Victor? In which case probably is out of her control. I'd like to add in canon the first task performance was easily hers.

***** The Veela heritage thing is fanon and the other champions have done nothing to suggest they made a pact to protect Harry. I think you're confused between the books and fan fiction. Both Cedric and Viktor left Harry at the bottom of the lake without looking back after getting their hostages, while Harry was the only one concerned about them. Cedric left Harry to go his own way even after being held under the Crucio curse and speculating Viktor got to Fleur too. Neither one of those actions screams "hey, we should look out for this kid!" to me. They didn't make a pact.

** Yeah, that was a super disappointing fic. I got through a handful of chapters before dropping it - Harry's change of character was far too sudden for me, and the way he was raging at Hermione and Ron just seemed incredibly childish (whereas the fic seemed to want us to think of it as something super serious).

The few Fleur interludes just made me heavily dislike the author's characterization of her - as smug, arrogant, and hated by everyone, IIRC. Which I imagine some people like, but it was coming across to me as just building up for her to be harry's armcandy.

** How f'ing dare you. That fic will always hold a special place in my heart since it's the first serious and completed HP fanfic I've eve read.

The quality of the writing gets a lot better the farther you get in. I guess you can actually see the author's skills improving the longer you read.

Are there some clichés? Yes. But take a look at the age of the fic and that won't surprise you.

What's so awesome about this fic to me is Harry's character progression. His maturity, magic, feelings, ... I love how you can read about him becoming more powerful every chapter through study and experience untill that final duel with Voldemort. Not to say the other fights aren't good because they are, they're incredible.

This fic has a lot of pro's imo: believable romance, character progression, exciting action, ...

The author also dared to take these ballsy decisions that I haven't seen in any other fic and go his complete seperate direction.

But it's one of those fics that you either love or hate. Personally I can't read methods of rationality or emperor.

*** Don't start with 'how f'ing dare you' if you want to have a reasonable discussion, I'd suggest.

Anyways, I really struggle to see Harry's 'maturity' as a pro of that story. Because at the start? He's far less mature than canon. I remember this one had Ron do some soul searching, go up to Harry to honestly apologize for being an ass, and then Harry freaking out.

Like, "'You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget.'" is /not/ something mature to say to a friend lol. It's a super immature way of handling things.

**** You're right. When I mentioned his maturity I was speaking about the 'progression' of his maturity. I failed to clarify that. From the angsty kid that said things like you quoted to someone who sacrificed himself for someone he loved the most. Or sacrificing the consciousness of his mentor for the school he loves and protect those inside it. Even if he feels the majority of its inhabitants have slighted him at some point.

Not sure if you expect a 14-year old to act mature though? When I was 14 I didn't speak to my parents for 3 days and I can't even remember why. Probably something stupidly trivial.

But since Harry has been through abuse maybe he should be mature before his time?

Then again if you haven't bothered reading past the beginning phases of the story you won't have read those parts. I feel like this story is a good example of an author getting better the more he/she writes.

Also the reason I started like that was to open with a 'lighthearted joke'. Next time I'll add an 'xD' or 'lol' for all you sour lots. I didn't anticipate the amount of toxicity there'd be though. Seems like when someone starts a thread for the sole reason of bashing a fic they can't handle a different opinion.

Whatever though. Let's drop the subject.

It's an almost copy of a cadmean victory, not that that's a bad thing.
