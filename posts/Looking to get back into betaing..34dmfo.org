I used to beta HP fanfiction but stopped years ago. Just wondering whether there's any sites or communities for betas and authors to find each other? I used to deal with most stuff through livejournal or fictionalley - yeah, that shows how long ago it was! - and have no idea where to start now.


** Well. You can always ask on this subreddit - for starters. There are a lot of authors, me included, who lurk around here and are in dire need of a beta.

On fanfiction.net theres a pretty huge community for betas offering their services.

*** Yeah, but on fanfiction.net there are /too/ many. Looking through to find someone who appears active is hard enough, let alone someone that you might work well with.

I'd definitely second your suggestion of just offering up your services here. After all, I wouldn't have a beta if I hadn't asked if anyone on this sub was willing to give it a go.
