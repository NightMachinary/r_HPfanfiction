**** Honestly there might be but Snape wouldn't/shouldn't be invited. Just to clarify I will only stop reading a fic if a Snape romance is heavily focused on but if it's just a mentioned thing and goes on in the background then my opinion of the fic lowers a bit but I might still read the fic.

Didn't Rownling mention something about a very "physical" relation before their fall out? Not that is matter in the end (death of an author and all that).

  "It was passionate and it was a love relationship," Rowling says in a bonus commentary feature on the Blu-ray version of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.

  "I'm less interested in the sexual side -- though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship -- than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other, which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationships."

The film's director, David Yates, then adds: "This is a story about two men who loved each other and ultimately have to fight each other. It's a story for the 21st century."

I couldn't remember the precise word so I looked for it, and she did confirme they slept together. But there are a lot of debate on this sub about what is canon and what is not, and I believe that an interview in the bonus of the Blu-Ray version of Fantastic Beast is the kind of fic that can be ignored in favour of headcanon.
