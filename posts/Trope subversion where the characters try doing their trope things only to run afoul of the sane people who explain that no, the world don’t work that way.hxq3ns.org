Basically while some characters are acting like real people living their lives others are acting like they are the cartoonish cardboard cut two-dimensional characters we see so often.

F ex.: We have a Dumbledore going deep in the supposed-to-be-a-villain-but-coming-up-as-just-an-idiot, complete with trying to steal Harry's money (only to be stopped not by helpful goblins, but by the sheer amount of paperwork, red-tapes and laws created to stop such a thing from happening); attempting manipulations so convoluted, contradictory, needless and obvious that even a small child would see through and then proceed to give the obviously senile elderly directions to the closest retirement-house; him preaching to the order about not using lethal force only to be shutdown by everyone else explaining that they are at war and thus lethal force is kind of necessary.

Or the Weasley's try their usual love potion plot only to find out that love potions are either so obvious that they can be safely used in a prank without anyone letting it go too far or not strong enough to make much beyond briefly catching the target's attention; Ron tries to get closer to Harry while being a Ron!bashing type of person and Harry, plus everyone else, promptly stays away and ignores him; the Weasleys try stealing Harry's money using the key he lend Molly but are stopped because any significant movement of money needs the Vault holders written permission authenticated (you know, like actual banks do).

Or a WBWL scenario where either Harry or the Twin is a normal kid doing kid's things while the sibling is the usual edge lord/arrogant, power seeker/lazy, asshole trying to drag the other in some ridiculous and convoluted relationships based in mutual hate and jealous. Or just one member of the family, either parents or children, is acting in the usual behavior we see while the rest of the family is going “Dude, really? WTF?”.

Or Harry discovers he has a truly ridiculous, reality-bending amount of money and promptly hires every mercenary in the world to deal with Voldemort and the DE (maybe the Dursley's too?); or Harry figures out how to use his magic while a kid and accidentally casts Fiendfyre to results like when Goyle did it; or Indy!Harry finds out about his gignormous list of nobility titles, assumes then thinking it gives political power only to run afoul of reality in the form of finding out that not only being a Lord doesn't give anyone a say in the government as it isn't a feudalistic society but also that the reason those titles remained unclaimed is that they are a monumental money-sap that gives petty much no benefit; or even Harry finds out he has a house, abandons the Dursley's to live there but discovers that it either is a big fix-up or that doing chores around a house kept by two adults does not by itself make a teen capable of keeping a house/manor/castle by himself.

Any case in which this or similar scenarios happens would be welcome. Really love when a character tries to behave as if they are in a child made version of the world just to run afoul of reality.


** I'd pay good money to read a fic where independant!Harry tries doing his usual shit, but none of it works that way. Where he just doesn't get that seeing Molly on the train station /does not imply she's got a plot to steal from him/. Where he keeps accusing everyone, and it's all false. He alienates himself from everyone, attacks a worried Dumbledore. He goes to claim the title of Lord Black, only to be told that Sirius was disowned, and Draco is Lord Black.

And in the end, Voldemort actually steps in and ends the ridiculousness... by pointing out that Harry is acting retarded because he's being given the patented Evil Molly(tm) cocktail of potions....... by Daphne Greengrass.

  You know those stories where Harry discovers he's super rich, super powerful, and all the good guys are evil and the bad guys are good and he's related Merlin? This story is nothing like that.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully]]) in which the bad guys win and then (not so) immediately regret it.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12278255/1/Prophecy-Averted]]) in which Voldie jumps ship as soon as he learns the whole prophecy.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11831304/1/A-Father-First-Damn-It]]) in which James and Lily Potter are actually good parents.

  Single point of divergence, one-shot. The Death Eaters succeed in getting the Prophecy to Voldemort, and this rather changes matters. Lord Voldemort wants to kill Harry Potter, yes, but he won't be the toy of Fate.

  An hour after Dumbledore told them about the prophecy, James had his entire family- including the dog- bundled up on a Muggle ferry to France. Because there's valiantly dying for the greater good, and then there's good parenting.
