So correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't it be possible to fly by using two easy spells?

Arresto Momentum, which cancels velocity

Ascendio, which causes upward movement

Based on the wording, Ascendio moves you upwards, but if a spell exists that moves you upwards, a spell also exists to move you downwards and sideways. We also know objects can be enchanted to trigger spells (vanishing cabinets), so what if you enchanted a pendant to cast Arresto Momentum on your body, causing you to cancel all motion relative to the Earth, and then enchanted a ring to cast Ascendio and its other variations, activated based on gestures?

You'd fly, that's what.

The only problem I can see is that Arresto Momentum may cancel your flying movement as well. So this method depends on if you can alter the spell to only cancel out gravity, or ignore the motion imparted by the ring.


** i imagine the difficulty comes in not from the initial casting/enchanting but from controlling the fine details while midflight

** I don't want to be that guy, but first, if you're using an enchanted object to fly, then really you'd not be flying unaided. In addition, a Broom essentially does exactly what you described anyway.

Even so, the last thing I'd do is apply flight enchantments to a pendant, as that seems to me a good way to strangle myself. After all, spelled objects are very often portrayed as having an effect only on themselves, or otherwise, they don't transfer their effects to whatever is touching them. Invisibility cloaks don't make a person invisible unless you cover yourself with one. Portkey's don't turn a person into a portkey they more accurately pull anyone touching them along when they're activated.

To that end, if I were to not want to use a Broom, but I didn't want to figure out how to fly manually, I'd probably enchant/spell a harness of some kind.

Of course, what enchanted object can do (and even what get's classified as an enchanted object in the first place) really depends on you, but at least in canon anyway, most enchanted object (that I recall anyway) generally don't apply their enchanted properties onto others, and those that do or seem to are special, like horcruxes.

** There's a lot more to flight than deceleration and ascent.

Consider an aeroplane: it has to generate lift, accelerate, slow down, turn directions (not on a 3d plane, but in 3d space). All of these components have to work together seamlessly for flight to be possible.

** The answer to unaided flight is very simple: just throw yourself at the ground and miss.

** I always assumed that since Voldemort gets compared to smoke when flying, his technique was to partially transfigure himself into smoke... sort of like the Death Eaters in the movies. So something like an animagus but not into an animal.
