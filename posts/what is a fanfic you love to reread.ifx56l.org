** Seventh Horcrux. It's the crack fic that never gets old.

Browncoat, Green Eyes if you like crossovers.

*** Love me some Brown Coat Green Eyes.

Jaynes mother thinking Harry's the second coming of Christ is hilarious.

That kiss Harry apparently laid on River when she was screaming at the beginning baffles my mind though. How are you supposed to kiss someone on the lips while their mouth is wide open? Picturing it is just awkward.

But I have a couple of other projects to finish first, proofreading The Peace Not Promised and then making myself read Harry Crow so I can properly evaluate it (I'm thinking of doing a compare and contrast with Methods of Rationality).

***** Several reasons.

- It's in the FFN top ten. I figure I should try to understand why. "Don't knock it till you've tried it," and all that.
- It has several similarities, at least superficially, to Methods of Rationality, which I actually liked, but my initial impression of Harry Crow was far less favorable. I'd like to dig into how deep those parallels actually go and why they made such different impressions.
- I'm kind of hoping that it improves from the first few chapters.
- If all else fails, I will at least be in a position to state definitively why it's bad.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
