** Argh. I know just the fic but I can't find it anywhere. Voldemort summons like 6 different versions of himself with a crystal, 5 are competent and one is a muggle motorcycle stunt guy called "The flight of death" who provides comic relief. If anyone can find that I'd appreciate it, as would op probably. It was a bit cracky I think.

**** Great work finding that one. I thought it was a lens of sanity one for some reason. It doesn't read quite like I remember though, turns out Flying Death was a wrestler not a motorcycle stunt guy. Lol.

** I like the idea of subverting the trope in this way, but Voldemort is a megalomaniac and wouldn't submit to anyone, even another version of himself.

It'd end up as a 3 way war. Which could be a ton of fun.

** I can't see this happening, simply because the Voldemorts would eventually fight each other, probably kill each other, and likely blow up a good portion of Europe.
