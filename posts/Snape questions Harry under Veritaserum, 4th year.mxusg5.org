:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Snape accuses Harry of being a glory hound, like always, due to his name coming out of the goblet (I think that's the setup at least). He then wishes out loud that he could use Verita, to prove Harry's lying and privilege. Harry to everyone's surprise accepts. The questioning takes place in the great hall, with journalists as well as students watching.

Harry states some ground rules, for example both write down 20 questions that will be asked to Harry in questioning. I think they can refuse them but am not sure. Amelia Bones is called in as a supervisor of sort.

It basically ends up with Snape everyone finding out how awful Harry's home life is and that he told the truth about the tournament. I think Sirius being innocent get mentioned as well.

I'm not sure if it was a short story ending after the questioning or the start of a longer fic. Anything similar is okay as well, I liked the concept.

I felt deeply troubled by the Dumbledore implications.

**** Was it? I usually complain about the nonsensical length of most fanfiction stories (let's not mention “Breakfast In New York” linkffn(5141159), [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/overall-post-on-breakfast-in-new-york.html][shall we?]]), but this one seemed to me going from the beginning to the end reasonably straight.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.

***** Maybe that was unfair. I suppose I was just expecting a one-shot, short and to the point. It kind of felt like there were too many unnecessary plot points. Still good though

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
