:END:
So yeah if read that fic partially ages ago and it goes like in the description. Other things that I remember are that he might have a sister, is quite introvert and that he doesn't fly but when he tells his Father James is more than overjoyed


** There are... a lot of these kinds of fics, probably need a bit more to go on.

** Is there else anything unique your remember about the story? A quote, a character? Something unusual?

Because what you just mentioned is in 90% of all HP dimension travel fics.
