Could you recommend me some new fics that involve Harry being a girl, and with romance.

Ive been more than depresed waiting for updates of The Never Ending road sequel for around a year and nothing, and already read most gender bender fics previously mentioned in older posts of this subreddit.

​

Wanted to know if there were some new fics published this or past year.

​

I suposse than gender swap is fine too, but mainly prefer fics where harry is born a girl in the first place.

​

PD: (Aditionally, someone knows if is there something like a fic with female versions of the Weasley twins? It sounds like it could be really interesting.)


** The author of TNR said they were abandoning the fic a few months ago as I recall. Sorry.

You might try linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise). Not exactly a romance, but it does have some elements of that (if you are into F/F that is...)

  The Girl Who Lived is young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. A story of her mischief and troubles in her fourth year of Hogwarts. New tasks, humor, fem!Harry/Fleur. Not related to my other story, Tales of Three.
