I was searching for some longer time travel fics I haven't read yet. Also, I have a long flight today, so wanted to download something and fanfiction bot here is the best thing ever:) have any more suggestions for less well known fics? Time/dimension travel or just some slightly darker or Slytherin Harry(also something that is not too well known). No slash, please(maybe slash, but that doesn't revolve around sex)

Edit: I'm wondering, why do people downvote so much? I'm just asking for recommendations

Edit2: ok, my trip is over and I must admit the ones I originally asked about are pretty shitty, thanks everyone for recommendations;)


** Many people here hate Drarry, Dramione, HGSS, and pureblood!Hermione with a passion.

Unlike the gender composition of fanfic writers, which is dominated by teenage girls, both this and the [[/r/harrypotter]] subs are populated by 18+ adults. The gender composition is also more toward 50-50, and male readers generally HATE Draco Malfoy. Snape is also more disliked by adult men.

I think that's the main reason people downvoted your post.

--------------

I personally would recommend time travels in which main characters acted competently and efficiently:

#+end_quote

I wanted to point out, this isn't always the case. I know quite a few writers on Tumblr (my main pairing is Tomione or TMR/HG) who write for my pairing, but also write DM/HG and SS/HG. They're well into their 20's, and are definitely 18+ as well. (Normally, a lot of their fics for the pairings tend to be extremely dark, however.)

However, it is also true that every one of them (to my knowledge) is a woman. That is, compared to the DLP ("Dark Lord Potter") Forum-type, who, in my experience, tends to be a something-20's male.

This is very true. A lot of the profiles I stumble across are in their 20s and 30s. Many are mothers who like more "adult" themed Hermione centric fics.

I've noticed a big gender divide in fanfic interests. Unless a story is exceptionally written, it's pretty easy to guess the gender of the author based on content and pairings.

Early in the fandom, there were many shipping manifestos explaining the rationale behind supporting particular ships. [[http://ship-manifesto.livejournal.com/27376.html][This]] is the one for SSHG. The reasoning indicates that more women are likely to enjoy shipping it.

****** Yeah same I'll never understand why you would limit yourself like that. The 'premise' (specific characters/pairings) of a fic are the least relevant aspect for me.

I will read anything from filthy Dobby/Hagrid smut to Harry vigorously licking Dumbledore's Sherbert Lemons as long as the plot is engaging and it's written by someone who seems more intelligent than the average toddler.

And then there's the people who drag their eyeballs through garbage just to read that one scene where Hagrid uses Basilisk Venom to lube up before splitting Minerva in half while she's transformed (fuck where did my mind take me). Anyway I just don't understand how the pairing alone can make a bad fic worth reading.

I think it's more people wanting a good fic + the pairing they want. Personally, I can't stand any Death Eater-related slash, so those are always no-goes for me unless it's something like Delenda Est, which pretty much just uses Bellatrix as an OC anyway.

Don't worry. It's likely your mind is far less dirty than mine.

Back on topic. I wholeheartedly agree. I'm usually more for the plot, though there have been times where I go specifically for pairings. Even then, I looked for a good plot.

** Other than Best Served Cold which is a crack fic, I don't think other stories worth your time.

Many stories already have been linked. Here's few popular time/dimension travel which have been updated recently​:

I'm Still Here - linkffn(9704180)

On a Pale Horse - linkffn(10685852)

Again and Again - linkffn(8149841)

Stepping Back - linkffn(12317784)

Here's few Time/Dimension travel started recently:

You're A Wizard, Little Us - linkffn(12482339) - probably a crack fic. Only one long chapter is posted. 4 different Harry(male or female) came to canon world just before native Harry turns to 11.

Intersecting Realities - linkffn(12446118) - dimension travel during the summer after 4th year, completed.

All The Stars In The Sky - linkffn(12423601) - Harry reborn as a Black, very early stages and interesting so far.

My Name is Draco Malfoy! - linkffn(12319276) - dimension travel goes wrong and Harry possessed Draco Malfoy.

Along the silent field of Asphodel - linkffn(12232671) - only one chapter is posted. It probably be classified as one shot unless the author decided to write more. The writing is top notch.

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!

  After dying at the hands of Voldemort, Harry receives two tempting offers from a surprising source, offers which will change everything about his own life and the lives of those around him. He readily agrees, but the ramifications of the decision he made rear their heads in multiple unexpected ways as time goes on. Time travel, Good Dumbledore, RW/MW bashing. Fully edited

  Voldemort won. The last of the war criminals Hermione Granger is about to be publicly executed. Except - it doesn't quite work out that way. Hermione is thrown back 20 years in time. She enters Slytherin as pureblood Hermione Druella Black - with one thing on her mind: Revenge. The more brutal and vicious the better. \\/ My attempt at the tired old time-travel trope. SS/HG.
