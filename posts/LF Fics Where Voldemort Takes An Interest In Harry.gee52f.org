Y'know, those ones where Voldemort/Tom Riddle visits Hogwarts sometimes or is a professor at Hogwarts and takes an interest in Harry. (Or maybe Harry changes his name to hide from him and Voldemort finds out.)

I find these types of fanfiction interesting. Also, please no three or four chapter fics.


** I am not sure if this one counts since Harry bumped into Voldemort outside of school. Its [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2032067/1/Abandon][Abandon]] by Batsutousai (there is a sequel). You also didn't specify if you are okay with them being in a relationship so slash warning.
