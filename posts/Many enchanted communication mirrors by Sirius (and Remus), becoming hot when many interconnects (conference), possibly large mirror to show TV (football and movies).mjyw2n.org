:END:
I've been reading "Double Back" where Hermione's parents gets an enchanted communications mirror so Hermione can contact them with her mirror - Harry and his other friends also got mirrors, and all can connect to eachother. (I'm not quite finished yet, but I don't think this story is the one or two below.)

This made me think of an /other/ fic, where Sirius (and Remus and possibly others) enchants several other mirrors to be used by Harry &c (and possibly DA, OotP and/or some auror team-leaders). I don't really remember much of the fic, but I think they were working out of Grimmauld Place and was organizing quite the resistance/rebellion.

It's quite a challenge to make the mirrors able to connect to all the other mirrors and not just as pairs. I also think they made it possible to make conference calls, where a group/everybody could talk. This however caused the mirrors to heat up quickly, so the call had to be short.

Obviously the story is more about the fight against Voldemort than the mirrors, but they play a part.

Anybody know which story this may be?

Not sure if this is the same story as above or another (probably another), but... Using a big communication mirror infront of a TV, someone in the muggle-world (Hermione's parents?) are able to "stream" football and movies to Hogwarts to another large mirror in the boy's dorm. Later a larger mirror is put in the Great Hall to show movies and Quidditch recorded (at first) by several of Harry's friends with Omnioculars. There is a spat, and the mirror's owner (Harry?) breaks it or takes it down.

Anybody remember this story?
