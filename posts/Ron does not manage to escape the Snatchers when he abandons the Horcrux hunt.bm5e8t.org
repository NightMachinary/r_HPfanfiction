So we know that Ron left the tent and disapparated, only to immediately run into a gang of Snatchers.

Now, what if he couldn't get away and is handed over to Death Eaters like the Malfoys? After torture, Veritaserum, Legilimency or coercion and threats against his family, Ron eventually spills everything.

The full text of the prophecy if Harry had ever divulged it, which is likely, everything the trio knew about horcruxes - which ones had been destroyed, which ones they had and which they suspected, the trio's security enchantments, Hermione's parents' alternate identities and tentative location, Harry's relationships - the ones he's most close to etc.

While Ron can possibly hold out long enough that Harry and Hermione will have moved to a different location, Voldemort would eventually know all of the trio's plans and security measures. He's a virtual treasure trove of unprotected information since he doesn't know Occlumency and Voldemort can easily read his mind and it will lead him to more people who he can then question.

So do any such stories already exist? What do you think?

Edit: I've always considered the Deluminator to be incredibly creepy. It can track Harry's or Hermione's location and listen to what they're saying even though they're under security enchantments. Now consider such a tool in Voldemort's hands.

  A magical infection has Ron critically ill, but after the devastation of the war he decides his family and friends don't need to know. How long can he hide it though? And how will the consequences of his actions change the course of the future?

But the Deluminator supposedly works by harnessing The Power Of Love, doesn't it? You can only listen in on people you care about. It could possibly be used by Voldemort to monitor the state of his Horcruxes, but I can see nothing else it could do in his hands. (Before you propose it: no, I do not believe that even if it can pinpoint his other Horcruxes, it could read Harry. His hatred for Harry easily counterbalances whatever interest he would have in Harry's Horcruxness.)

I must have missed this, where on Earth did you get this tidbit?

And what fucked up mind created a device to stalk and invade the privacy of their "loved" ones?

**** So I just looked it up, and you're right, the love bit isn't in the book. It's on the wiki, which is presumably where [[/u/hrmdurr][u/hrmdurr]] got it from.

HOWEVER, when Ron describes how it works, he says it activates when Hermione says his name on Christmas, which Harry notes was the first time they said his name out loud since he left.

So... does the Deluminator work on the same principle as Voldemort's Name Taboo?

***** I doubt it. Ron uses it multiple times and tracks them across the countryside. They weren't saying his name at those times; the device just worked.

Right there in the book. Ron states that it allows him to home in on Harry and Hermione because they're his best friend and loved interest, respectively. It's implied that Dumbledore's epitaph (/Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also/) is a convoluted clue as to the Deluminator's true function.

No it doesn't. I just checked the book. Ron just describes how he used the Deluminator and he later says that Dumbledore must have known he'd walk out on them while Harry counters that he knew Ron would've wanted to come back.

Nowhere does it state that the device can track loved ones or exactly how it works. It could've easily been a device that tracked and spied on Harry.

And either way, Voldemort is brilliant enough to reverse engineer it to serve his purpose. After all, as per this prompt, he has full access to Ron.
