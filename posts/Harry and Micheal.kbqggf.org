I have been searching for this for a while and have found nothing; It was a fairly long fix in which Harry and Micheal Corner met on the train and became friends and I think pranksters as well. Later Micheal pairs with a half Veela and Harry I think with daphne. Sorry it's not much, but it has been ages. If anyone can find it that would be great.


** ...Micheal Corner?

I literally cannot think of a second Micheal unless its an OC.

** You might have better luck with a search if you spelled Michael correctly. (I am not trying to sound snide, but computers are very fussy about that.)
