** Oh they are not bad or evil. They are good. Truly good. The kind of good you don't meet often. It is rare and scary really.

#+begin_quote
  If you /have/ to look along the shaft of an arrow from the wrong end, if a man has you entirely at his mercy, then hope like hell that man is an evil man. Because the evil like power, power over people, and they want to see you in fear. They want you to /know/ you're going to die. So they'll talk. They'll gloat.

  They'll watch you /squirm/. They'll put off the moment of murder like another man will put off a good cigar.

  So hope like hell your captor is an evil man. A good man will kill you with hardly a word.

*** An Old and New World has Helga Hufflepuff become Voldemort's most terrifying death eater. Why? Because she doesn't act like a proper dark lord. She'll just kill you instead of monologuing.

** If you looked through the great history books f Hogwarts You would see every few generations A dark wizard pop up in every house. They were like kudzu You could never get rid of them. Slytherin Had a tendency to Produce Ambitious megalomaniacs with a minor taste for genocide, Ravenclaw usually popped out a mad Librarian every few centuries They had a habit of stealing every magical book in Existence and then trying to burn any copies . Ravenclaw Dark Lords has a taste for Centralized knowledge. That was so concentrated they didn't want anyone else to have it. If knowledge is power a Ravenclaw dark lord Always studied hard to be evil. They were quite fond of deciding who is worthy to learn magic. The Library of Alexandria burned when a Dark Lady of Ravenclaw house Became its chief librarian and the patrons to the library Revolted over the restriction of magical knowledge. Gryffindor dark lords were The righteous monsters of history. The Reign of terror that followed the French revolution was said to have been led by a Gryffindor graduate. The path to hell was really paved with good intentions when it came to the great evil Produced in Godric's house. But the Evil Hufflepuffs Were special They had only produced two in the last five centuries. They were the beloved dark angels The benevolent dictators of magical history. If a Hufflepuff turned evil it was with the backing of a nation and the people Screaming their approval as they marched Merrily down the highway towards their own damnation. Claudia The Joyous was the most evil witch in magical history. She committed mass murder with a smile and offered children candy as their parent Toiled in the mandrake root fields until They fell over dead. Claudia the joist went to the grave beloved by her people until Her magic died with her and the potion she put in the water supply Evaporated, Freeing the citizens from their Monstrous mass hallucination.

A Hufflepuff Dark Lord will kill millions with a smile and No one will ask a single question.

Unless a good Hufflepuff stops them in their tracks a well timed hug and A few gingersnaps tend to put a stop the Evil plans of any Hufflepuff dark Lord in the making. Hufflepuffs were loyal after all and Helga's Portrait only gave the ginger snap recipe to graduates that kept the mass murder to a minimum Along with being hard-working loving people
