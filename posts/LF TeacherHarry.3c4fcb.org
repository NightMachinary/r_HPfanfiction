** Well, if you haven't read it already, then linkffn(Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery) is worth a shot. Harry Potter is a teacher in linkffn(The Untitled Cheekquel Project) but somehow, I don't think that's quite what you're looking for. There is also linkffn(Harry Potter, Fifth Year Headmaster) although the writing quality isn't the best, the plot idea is still somewhat interesting. I know I've read more teacher Harry, but I just can't seem to find the links at the moment. I'll update in the unlikely occurrence that I can pummel my masses of disorganized bookmarks into submission. Don't hold your breath; sorry.
