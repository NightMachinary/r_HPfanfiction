** Damn this is infuriating. There is this one fic that I remember have an interesting depiction of wizarding America with the wizarding west still being mainly lived on by the magical native tribes. I can bot remember the story or anything else from the story but I just remember either Harry or someone else being amazed by the difference of their culture.. or something like that.

*** I think you are thinking of Alexandra Quick, with much of the fourth book taking place in the Navajo Nation.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12402654][Men of War]]

I really liked how it was described in this fic. It is set just before Grindleward War.

** I imagine Wizarding America to be like America under the Articles of Confederation but less organized and unified.

I imagine that the wizards who were in the american colonies were moving for similar reasons and wanted to get out from under the thrall of the Ministry of Magic. So imagine a bunch of pioneers who can teleport. If I ever write a story that is compliant to Fantastic Beasts, New York and the MCUSA would be the butt of a joke for most American Wizards with their obsessive govt overreach and wand licenses.
