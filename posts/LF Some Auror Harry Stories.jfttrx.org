In another post, I asked jobs outside of being an Auror, but that made me curious, what are ones, that you like, with him, being an Auror?

It can be Auror, or other type of Ministry Job, in general.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes, doesn't have to focus on a pairing

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed, or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

NO Weasley bashing, love the Weasley's. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune. No author hating on the Weasley's. Ron being jealous and the like, as in canon, is fine, but nothing extreme.

Am fine with male pregnancy, as long as it's not detailed.


** I always recommend Forgive Those Who Trespass ...with the warning that it's quite dark. Please heed the tags lol

I also quite enjoyed For the Greater Good

  Harry Potter was convinced he had an ordinary, if inconvenient, life. Then Ron and Hermione vanished in the Department of Mysteries. And the only person who may know where they are is a mute Draco Malfoy.

  When Harry and Draco discover they've been bonded to one another, neither one of them is prepared for the secrets they slowly begin to uncover.   Together, they learn that they can't escape their past, or the things that have been left hidden there, and that sometimes the only way to move forward is to look back.
