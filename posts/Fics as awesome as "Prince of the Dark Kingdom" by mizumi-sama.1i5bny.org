I recently finished this story and I just... wow. It's probably one of the most amazing stories I've read.... and I'd love to find some more hp fic that captures part of that feeling of awesomeness.

For those who haven't read "Prince of the Dark Kingdom," I HIGHLY recommend it.

To put together a random list of aspects about it I liked and would like to see in other fanfics:

- Length and scope - I like longer stories, ones that I can get lost in for days at a time. multi-year stories are fantastic. I prefer they be recently updated, if they're not already finished. :)\\
- Alternate universe - I LOVE a good AU/What if Story! :) What if Voldemort won? What if Dudley got a hogwarts letter too? what if Harry was raised by the malfoys? What if Snape adopted Harry right after James and Lily were killed? what if?
- World building - I like when people go above and beyond canon, in detailing the world, theschool, magic, and why things are why they are. Details are delicious. Is all magic based on pagan magic? how did the ministry form? What happens if Voldemort gets into the middle of the government and rules? What is werewolf society life? What abour fae? :)
- solid friendships - I love a wellwritten friendship. I don't care about shipping, just as long as the romance is believable.
- I dislike character bashing. Not every character is nice and friendly, but I hate it when someone is an evil jerk just because the author needed and evil jerk.

Things about POTDK that I especially love (may have mild POTDK spoilers):

- Harry/Voldemort friendship
- The pagan magics
- The Harry/Snape friendship
- The WORLD
- The bonds between all of the characters, actually. Harry and Hermoine, Harry and Ron, Hermione and Draco, Snape and lucius, Harry and Lucius, Harry and Sirius, etc etc etc.

anyway, not that any fanfic must meet all of those requirements, but I would dearly love a list of fanfics that I might like, loving POTDK as much as I do. Anyway, feel free to recomend your faves <3 I just want GOOD reading!


** Hmm. I can recommend some long stories with solid worldbuilding and many of the desiderata you request. For variety, I'll avoid some of the ones I've recommended recently to this subreddit (jbern's stories, joe6991's stories, nonjon's Browncoat, Green Eyes, Shezza's Denarian Renegade/Knight/Lord series, etc.):

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]] by Arsinoe de Blassenville is a solidly written, novel-length, complete story with quite a lot of worldbuilding, believable friendships/relationships, and avoids character bashing. This story has one of the most haunting endings I've encountered in fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  Post DH. In the wake of victory, Harry struggles with life, love, and the reform of the British wizarding world. He learns that life is complex, and that happy endings are fleeting. Chapter 24- Dreams: The Unicorn in Kensington Gardens
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] by Master Slytherin is quite solidly written and has a darker tone, much like PotDK.

#+begin_quote
  The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] by Kwan Li. Novel-length, very AU, a bit of a fusion with Ender's Game; updates are frequent when they happen (the next portion of the story is being workshopped over in the Work By Author section of DLP - membership required to read). This is one of my favorite stories still updating.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
#+end_quote

Also, by the same author, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]], a very dark AU that's really a couple of novels juxtaposed. One of the best "wrong boy who lived" stories you're likely to find.

#+begin_quote
  On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] by Myst Shadow - AU, plot divergence after Ginny dies in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry, Ron and Hermione get serious about magic early on. An intriguing plot, though the story updates relatively slowly.

#+begin_quote
  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.
#+end_quote

If you don't mind dabbling in another fandom (Star Wars), I can't recommend highly enough blank101's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302076/1/Into-the-Storm][Son of Suns]] trilogy, which is nearly a million words and very well written. Luke is captured at the end of Empire Strikes Back and is turned by Palpatine, becoming a Sith Lord. The story is perhaps the closest parallel to PotDK that I can think of.

#+begin_quote
  Son of Suns Trilogy Part I - AU set at the end of TESB. When Luke and his companions are caught and taken to Coruscant, Palpatine begins to systematically take apart his life to create a new Sith, turning Luke against his allies, father and beliefs with devastating consequences. Action/Drama/Romance Luke Skywalker/Mara Jade, Vader, Han Solo/Leia Organa, Mothma, Madine

** I just wanted to say thank you so much for linking this fic, by far one of the best I have read, finally got to the end of book 6 and am debating going on or waiting for updates to come along :)

Two stories (series actually) that share some common elements with PotDK that I greatly enjoyed are [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] by Shezza. It's a 3 part series that comes to about 600k words, some x-over with the Dresden Files books. Semi-Dark/Ruthless Harry, demons etc, very well written in my opinion.

Another that I read quite a while back and loved, though it was never quite completed to my knowledge is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] and its sequels Revolution and Resolution by GreenGecko. The entire series comes to something like 1.4m words, Troubled/Powerful Harry, raised by S. Snape, dealings with the Fae and other 'underworld' elements, again a very well written story and a great read.

*** I missed this responce before, sorry! Thank YOU also for your recomendations!

I'm glad you're enjoying POTDK! :D I, personal, read ALL of it, then ignore it for a few months at a time until there are 2-3 updates, and then read them all :) WHat'd you end up deciding on?

The Denarian renegade seems like a FACINATING idea! My only hesitation is that I havn't read the last few Dresden Files novels yet and am terrified of spoilering myself. Am I in any danger of that? :)

Resonance sounds fantastic also. I think I just found my next story to read! Thank you!

(oh, as another note.. regarding Resonance never quite being finished, I just looked at the author's blog.. they said... uh.. on Aug. 8th, 2013 at 10:06 PM (so, like, 2 hours ago) "Back to Resolution... I had a really hard time picking this story back up after putting it down. I've been taking a pile of writing classes and juggling three other stories was at my max. But, classes are out right now and its just me and two cats for a few days. So I'm catching back up with the hopes of wrapping it up this weekend. " :)

**** Yah, so i know it's late, but I just checked up on this thread to get a new recc and saw this post (which must've been added later, 'cause I so totally would have commented on GreenGecko being amazing!).

The Denarian Renegade does not require any knowledge of the Dresden books to be good. How do I know this? Took me about a week to get through them 'cause I couldn't put them down and I haven't touched a Dresden book before (prolly should seeing how much I enjoyed this one).

I can definitely see shout out characters and some greater world things that would prolly make more sense to someone who has, but this story was very self explanatory.

***** Regarding Green Gecko, I rolled around on the floor in joy for like a WEEK as I read though aaaaaaall of it. That book inspired my kindle purchase :D Then I read [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/authors.php?no=781][A Year like None Other]] that also made me spasm around happily, if you haven't read that one either.

Thanks for hte feedback on the Denarian Renegade.. I''ll totally put that on my 'to read' list now :3 That's awesome, though, it sounds like great writing... I read another Harry Potter+Another Series fanfic a few days ago despite it being my favorite non-HP Franchise (stargate) it was... really pretty horrible. Kinda soured my palate for the idea of crossovers with Harry Potter. Sad further because I read the author's other stories too and they were AWESOME, even the one that was written at the same time as the crossover. But with this reinforcement, I'll definetly read the Denarian Renegade now :D Thank you!!

***** Wow! You read through really quickly :D I had some trouble in real life and had some issues getting past, uh... 15 or 20 chapters in, I think. He'd recently had his centurion ceremony. I had trouble with it because there seemed to be so much... character extremism. Maybe I should go back and try to push through that part I got hung up on :)

*** Nope.

Harry's relationship with Voldemort defies explanation, but best single word would be to say that Voldemort ends up as harry's mentor. (and harry isn't evil, either.) Likewise, Harry's relationship with snape is... more teacher/student, with an EVENTUAL shift to something more like father/son-ish.

That said, there IS one or two homosexual couples in the story--but not featuring any canon characters. Harry himself has one or twoish girlfriends, but he's not really much of a boyfriend--too much else going on--and the relationships tend to be a part of the story, rather then the reason for the story..

Also, I realized I didn't link the story: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]

** I can't believe no one has put out [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Conner]] series by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Lightning on the Wave]]. Might just be because it does end up getting recc'd quite a bit. When I read PotDK it made me have tinglies because I reminded me so much of this series.

It's a complete seven year series with a completely AU world. It has over 3 million words and when I first read it I couldn't put it down until I was done (which meant lots of things didn't get done that August... hmmm more proof how good it was, I can actually remember exactly when I read it...).

Things I think you'll like:

- length of the story
- breadth of world building
- very thorough view on the cultures of light and dark magics and the rituals that go with it
- Harry/Snape mentor
- Harry's allying with the Malfoys and those relationships

Looks like enough of the fine details have finally faded enough that I can properly reread it (if I don't wait long enough I end up just skim the stories) so now I know what I'll be reading for the next month.

*** eee, I cna't wait to get started on this one. This looks like a FANTASTIC series to read, eeee :D

Thank you for the rec -- This one will be one of the next on my read list :)

Right now i'm reading [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/BM.html][Blood Magic]] by [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/gatewaygirl/][GatewayGirl]] and it's making me roll around and enjoy the feels. So I'll probably try to read some 'short stories' first, before I dive back into another one that will give me those tinglies again :)

I think PotDK is still my FAVORITE ever, but there have been some good--REALLY good--seconds out there <3 Hoping this one will definitely be a contender :D
