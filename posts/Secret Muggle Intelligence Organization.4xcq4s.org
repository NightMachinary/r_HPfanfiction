I've always found it a bit absurd that the only muggle to officially know about wizardry is the Prime Minister. My head-canon is that there's likely to be some kind of counterpart to the Department of Muffle Relations, charged with keeping an eye on the wizards.

I have visions of the thing being run by a Mycroft/Varys type who has his or her "little birds" inside the Ministry of Magic and elsewhere (wizards are socially conservative; those who have "unconventional" interests might look to satisfy them discretely in Muggle London, making blackmail a fairly easy undertaking). The condescension and naivety wizards generally show towards Muggles will make their job quite a lot easier.

Anyway, I'm currently writing something along those lines (my main character is unhappy with the wizarding world and they try to recruit her. At this point I'm unsure if they succeed).

Does anybody have any thoughts on this? Clearly it's an uncommon theme, as I don't recall ever seeing it. But with hundreds of thousands of fics out there, it's certain somebody else has had a bash at this at some point. Are there any fics where it's been done with some competence?

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

** I have built such a organisation for a fic project of mine. "Codename: Morgana" is the only intelligence organisation legally operating worldwide, made up from the G7 nations plus Russia and Israel and led by the german ex-Stasi Dr. Theodor Kant (a muggleborn himself) who has experience in the fight against wizards due to the excessive work he did to prevent east-german wizards to help muggles flee the DDR. The organisation is also supported by the catholic church, especially the /Sacra Congregatio Romanae et universalis Inquisitionis/ or for short, the Inquisition.

They were founded as a way to prepare for war against wizards and did so by recruiting discriminated muggleborns, squibs, half-breeds such as centaurs, Undead like vampires or "godkin" like Oni, and training them to become a shadow army of agents throughout the world.

Their research department developed "anti-magic" weaponry from a combination of experiments with the help of muggleborns and knowledge gained from the sealed libraries of the Vatican. They build the MaFoDD (Magic Force Disruption Device), which is a small trinket that soon became a mandatory part of mobile devices - hence equipping the worlds population with anti-magic devices.

Morgana has started off as a program supported by the different intelligence organisations. However, when the threat became real with the resurrection of Voldemort, Morgana began to become its own organisation, independent of CIA, Mossad, FSB (KGB), BND and all the others.

In my fic, the war happened soon after Harry sent Lily to Hogwarts. The war itself would be over quickly due to the preparation of the muggles. The rebellion led by Harry would end up going strong for 70 years until Mahoutokoro fell in the Massacre of 2082, when Morgana unleashed their Oni Assault units onto the school, which led to the extinction of japanese wizards. The rebellion then surrendered for the most parts and in order to save their families went into a life of slavery.

*** OK...

I wasn't really thinking about all-out war. More like spying and subtle plots. My assumption would be the Muggles are perfectly happy with the current, secrecy status-quo and would want to maintain it.

**** Yeah, your story would probably fit into the very early stages of "Morgana". The time when Intelligence Agencies compared notes, or jealously protected their findings.

I just wrote a summary of my thing, thinking it may spark some inspiration.

In my particular case the situation escalated into war. But of course, there doesn't have to be. I can also imagine MI5 (for example) doing some "corporate espionage" on the Department of Mysteries or St.Mungos. How much do you think would a pharmaceutical formula of Skele-Gro be worth? Or how much would any nautical organisation pay for the secrets of Gillyweed?

One plot I'd find interesting is the "cleansing of extremists" by agents. Surviving Death Eaters would be eliminated in order to push and move the wizarding society towards greater appreciation, or at least acceptance of muggle culture.

I'm still looking through my bookmarks. Until now the only thing I could find was the muggleborn parents forming some sort of militia to fight the magic society in the Firebird Trilogy.

*** I don't understand the Muggles enslaving Magical people. That makes almost no sense. They're still human, enslaving them isn't something that would happen. Maybe major sanctions or unfair taxes on the magical people, but not slavery. That's just sorta silly.

Someone here didn't pay attention in history class, it seems. Slavery, in whatever form it takes, has always existed and still exists today. For example, the 10$ shirt you bought is a product of modern slavery. The gold in your mobile phone is probably mined by people who can barely pay their food for the day with the money they made. Being human doesn't protect you from being used and exploited like a particularly useful object.

In my worldbuilding, wizards also became dehumanized through propaganda over a hundred years.

In the mind of the public a wizard isn't human. People don't say "I'm a muggle, you're a wizard", they say "I'm a human, you're a wizard". With this level of dehumanization, wizards are seen as useful when controlled, much like dogs or cattle. I even wrote my protagonist thinking about how "useful livestock doesn't rebel" when he thinks about surviving.

If you don't believe me research the propaganda of slavers, or the propaganda of the Third Reich. You can get your people to hate something so much, they'll gladly see it die or at least fully controlled.

*** If anti-magic weapons could be created, wouldn't the Ministry of Magic stop them from doing so? In canon, Kingsley Shacklebolt infiltrates the muggle ministry and I'm guessing there are a few others. It's hard to keep things secret when wizards can so easily slip veritaserum to any suspicious muggles or obliviate them. Not to mention they have a vested interest in continuing to keep their world secret. Also having to convincing cellphone companies to put a strange add on to millions of their products... It doesn't seem like a believable premise on that standpoint alone.

**** My explanation for that was mainly the work of Dr. Theodor Kant. The ex-Stasi agent and muggleborn wizard has built a system of question and answer, of a no-name department, drop-cache communications, as well as voluntary legilimency and weekly veritaserum dosages.

Morgana, or rather its predecessor departments, soon figured out that to effectively counter magical espionage, you need to use magic combined with what they've learned during the second world war and the cold war. Muggleborn agents tied together in a peer-to-peer, no-name, check-in system made up the very first departments of anti-magic Intelligence.

The MaFoDD wasn't sold to the producers of cellphones or other mobile device producers. Rather they were integrated in various parts that were sold to mobile device producers. There wasn't a 100% coverage of MaFoDD, but they were so many that the small percentage of mobile devices not having them in it didn't matter.

  Its the year 2113. Muggles have discovered magic and a fierce war has lead to enslavement of the magicals. In all this Charlus Potter, great-grandchild of Harry Potter finds himself on the removal list of the United Nations and gets sent on a mission that rips him from his home, and his planet, maybe forever.

** I did vaguely think about a Torchwood/HP crossover involving Death Eaters smuggling a Vietnamese five-toed Imperial Dragon into Cardiff in order to breed it with a Common Welsh Red somewhere in the Brecon Beacons. But I never did anything about it. It does seem to me that UNIT would probably know about wizards though.
