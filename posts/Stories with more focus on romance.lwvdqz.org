I normally don't read stories where Harry isn't the BWL but I've been reading linkffn(13648145) and really liked it. I liked that it focused on figuring them self out and how they work as a couple (trouple?). The focus on the romance between Harry/Luna/Astoria is something I really liked and have missed in other stories I've read. Usually stories I've read have focused more on voldsomt and the war. I'd like to read more stories focused on love and figuring out a relationship.

I don't mind that it focuses on voldemort and the war too but most stories I've read feels like it's thrown in a romance just to throw it in.

I would like stories where they explore themselves and their relationship. Stories from the end of 4th year and up please. Don't mind stories that start earlier but no heavy romance then. Harry must be a part of the relationship. No Ginny pairing. Other than that I have no preference, but no slash. Poly is fine if it's Harry and two girls. Or Harry/Hermione and Ron.

I don't mind Weasley bashing and/or manipulate Dumbledore as long as it's not too severe. Don't mind Harry being Lord Potter and/or others. Must be 80k wording.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Luna are childhood friends. Follow how they grow and fall in love, with each other and a certain other witch. Harry is a year younger and not the Boy-Who-Lived. Neville is. That does not mean Harry can't become a Hero almost as great as the Great Neville Longbottom. M for violence and later years. Strong Harry later. Pairing: Harry/Luna/Astoria, Neville/Hermione
