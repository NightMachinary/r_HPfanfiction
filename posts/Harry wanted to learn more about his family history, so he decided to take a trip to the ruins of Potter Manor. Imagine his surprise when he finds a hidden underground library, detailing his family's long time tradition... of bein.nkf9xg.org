They had been doing it since the times of Merlin, the style of each Potter differed. Some preferred being the puppet master behind the scenes, while others went full on world domination. Overtime they began holding their power through business and money after the medieval times had ended, forgetting the more... /barbaric/ practices.

In a diary from /James Potter/ (sweet jesus even his father), he and Lily had apparently been trying to let Voldemort cut down the opposition. Then they would've struck, apparently trying to bring back the more... out there style.

What could have sparked this long lasting generational feud?! Their namesake was Potter! What pissed off a bloody /potter/ so much?!

And Harry found his answer, on a tapestry that detailed the reason for their ambition.

Harry personally found it agreeable, it probably wasn't too late to change sides, was it?

(Whether is something idiotic like being called Potty relentlessly, or serious like every Potter has at some point been persecuted by society because of jealousy is completely up to you.)

(Ps, I guess you could say that the Potters do not forgive, and they do not forget lmaoooo)


** Bonus points if you can work in the Potters practice actually pottery that has the ashes or blood of their vanquished enemies mixed in with the clay.

And getting Harry to go into battle rocking a shield, hand and a half sword, and some form of plate/scale armor.

To build on this, maybe they used this clay in the formation of golems, with the blood or ashes causing said golems to take on the form of the one who's biological essence they were created from, and then said Potter used this to taunt the loved ones of the fallen by having a simulacrum of their friend/family member attack them.

**** You just gave me /Rick and Morty/ flashbacks of when Car kept Summer safe with the ‘melting ghost baby'.

Just imagine- You are the ardent foe of Dark Lord Potter, preparing for the most decisive battle yet. Your young daughter who disappeared without a trace the week before stumbles into your camp looking bedraggled and grimy but mostly unharmed.

As you embrace her, overcome with joy and relief at her safe return, she gives you an odd, distracted look. “Why did you not submit daddy? All you had to do was submit.”

After speaking your daughter suddenly collapses and melts into a pile of reddish brown clay.

*** Having the old potter family actually creating (or experimenting with) magical pottery is on its own a great prompt. A fan fiction which is just Harry rediscovering an old magical craft and utilising it in his adventures is pretty fascinating, especially since it would be very much opposite to his usual active and offence oriented style.

** Blackadder the Seventh was /livid/.

‘You had /one job/!' he shrieked. ‘/One. Job!/'

Baldrick wrung his hands. ‘I know! I am /sorry/, Master!'

Blackadder sighed. ‘It's ‘My Lord' Baldrick. You're not a House-elf.'

‘Perhaps I can think of a cunning plan, m'lord!'

‘No, I'll leave that to Pogo. Pogo?'

The monkey shrieked. At that moment the prince entered. ‘Pottery? Yes, you're right, I should take it up some time,' he said absentmindedly to the monkey. ‘Ah, Blackadder, there you are. There are some lovely men in the kitchen who want to admire our house. Naturally, I let them.'

‘And let me guess,' Blackadder said through gritted teeth. ‘They want to admire /every corner/ of it?'

‘Yes, how did you know?'

‘Because it's typical Darling, that's why!'

‘While I /am/ flattered, as a prince I really can't accept such nicknames.'

Blackadder blinked. ‘Oh, I didn't mean /you/,' he spat out. ‘Me and Auror Darling go back a /long/ way.'

Baldrick pulled on his sleeve and Blackadder sighed dramatically. ‘Yes, Baldrick?'

‘M'Lord, I've gotten a most cunning plan,' the chubby man said.

‘Baldrick, remember your last ‘cunning plan'?'

‘Yes, m'Lord. To infiltrate the palace disguised as potatoes.' Blackadder nodded. ‘And that, Baldrick, is why you're servant/cheerleader and I'm the brains.'

‘But this is a /good/ plan,' Baldrick said earnestly.

‘Alright, /fine/, what's the plan?'

‘We disguise ourselves - Blackadder groaned inwardly - as potters!'

‘You mean potterers?'

Baldrick nodded. Far away, Blackadder heard the low voices of approached Aurors. ‘Alright,' he bit out. ‘Grab your stuff. Now!'

They all scrambled to the hidden cupboard to grab a disguise. Over the noise, Blackadder said: ‘Oh, and Baldrick?'

‘Yes, m'Lord?'

‘You're never gonna get our money from Gringots again!'

Hm... potterers, potter... there was a idea in that...

--------------

Several thousand of years later, in a castle far away from here, Harry Potter had History of Magic. ‘... so the 50th Goblin Rebellion started because a S. Pettigrew tried to rob Gringots. This also marks the beginning of the Potter family,' Binns droned. Harry perked up, wondering if his ancestors had fought the goblins. No such luck. ‘The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, ‘the Potterer', became corrupted in time to ‘Potter'. Linfred was a vague and absent-minded fellow whose Muggle neighbours often called upon his medicinal services. None of them realised that Linfred's wonderful cures for pox and ague were magical; they all thought him a harmless and lovable old chap, pottering about in his garden with all his funny plants.*'

Harry slumped down again. Figured. Still... perhaps family, even if it was such a boring family as his, with no centuries of experience fighting Dark Lords, /would/ be interesting to learn about... he raised his hand.

‘Yes, Peters?'

‘Are there any books about the early Potters, sir?'

Binns stared at him and blinked slowly, as if waking up from a deep sleep. ‘Ye-es,' he said. ‘They're all in the Potter Manor, of course. The Potters were /very/ interested in archiving their lives.'

‘When can we expect /your/ biography, Potter?' Malfoy called out, lifting his head from where it had been lying on his elbow.

‘Thank you, sir,' Harry said, ignoring Malfoy. ‘Where is Potter Manor?'

‘Nobody really knows, only that it's somewhere in the mountains of Wales,' Binns said, with something that would be almost curiosity if it was anyone else. ‘Now Ragnok the Brave...'

As if on cue, everyone dozed off.

Harry had never been in the library so much as in the days after that lesson, and he resolved never to do so again. The table creaked under the amount of books that Hermione brought him, and by now he was flipping page after page looking for the words ‘mountains', ‘Wales' and ‘Manor'.

‘Harry! I've got it!'

Harry navigated the labyrinth until he found Ron, pointing excitedly to a footnote.

/1. Potter Manor was last seen in the North of Wales/, it read, but as Harry watched all the numbers and letters rearranged themselves to form... something. Harry rubbed his head against the headache and read again.

*** Pt 2

Harry looked up at the hill. On top of it stood several crumbling walls. He reminded himself how unlikely it was that there was anything left, but ploughed onwards regardless, in the direction of two rocks with a electric-blue field between them, crackling like lighting.In front of it was a plaque. /Enter, blood of my blood./ Harry examined the rocks. Several knifes with what he hoped was just spots of rust stuck out of them. The meaning was obvious. Slowly, carefully, he scraped his hand past the cleanest knife.

The field fell away, with a rumbling sound.

Behind it, a divot had fallen away to reveal a dark and imposing stone staircase.

/'Lumos,'/ Harry muttered, as he stepped on the first stairstep. The white walls glittered, reflecting the light back at him. The stairs seemed to descend slowly, it's bannisters carved with a spirally S. Harry imitated the gesture with his wand and suddenly the walls came alive with stories; a tall man with black hair berating someone who looked suspiciously like Peter Pettigrew, accompied by someone looking like a Malfoy and a monkey. Then later, the same people in disguise as potterers, fleeing London, chased by goblins. The same prince from earlier, now a harmless gardener, with the darkhaired man watching from the window.

I would imagine they would also follow the Sith/Dark Lord tradition of using a fake name (I doubt Voldemort was the first to ever do such a thing). It would certainly explain why people aren't more wary of Harry and his family, if the Light/Neutral families don't associate all those Dark Lords with the Potter family (the Dark families would either know better, or a select few would be better informed and the uninformed follow their examples) and that would be further supported by the more recent generations preferring puppet master/monopoly methods over doom and gloom and curses.

Plus, compared to a family/clan of Vikings, I can see why Tom would more consider a family of Dark Lords to produce his Equal. Obviously it but him on the ass, but it would be good logic.

** Pottery really is a fascinating subject. For thousands of years it was the height of technology, so much that archaeologists track ancient migrations by the style of pottery people used. There's evidence that the potter's wheel was invented before the wheel was used for transportation. Potters dedicated their lives to their craft, with secrets being held by exclusive masters, and some of their masterpieces are priceless treasures even today. It really makes sense that there would be a magical discipline in ceramics.

There are many myths and legends about containers that provide endless amounts of food, confer immortality or other blessings when drunk from, or contain some kind of spirit entity (like a genie). Pandora's "box" was really a jar, and another name for a Horcrux is a soul jar. Someone had to make all those things!

Maybe turning the wheel a certain number of times in each direction has some significance, like stirring potions, along with the measurements of the pot, mixing things into the clay or glaze, symbolic decorations, fuel, and temperature of the firing. When it comes to the classical elements, pottery would be considered earth magic, with some water and fire mixed in.

** I'd find it more amusing, I think, if you went with the route that James's father had decided to reform the family name (for whatever reason, maybe he was just a good person^{tm}) so when Harry visits Potter manor he's exploring when he finds a locked room. Eventually he gets inside to find literally hundreds of portraits of Potter ancestors, one of whom explains that Harry's grandfather dumped them all there when he inherited the manor and decided to clean up the families act.

Harry's father never knew, except for some vague historical stories about things his ancestors in the middle ages got up to, because as you said - the family went subtle, for hundreds of years they've wielded power for their own benefit from the background so they've never made the history books.

And now Harry is presented with an opportunity to pick up the crown that his grandfather cast aside.

** Have a minor "Legend of Zelda" crossover idea.

In the distant past, the land was known as Hyrule. In it, the Potter family did their life's work of making pots. One day, a stranger in green entered their shop shouting "HYAH!" and smashed every pot they had for sale. Later, they learn this "Link" person was sent by the king on a mission to locate the Triforce (Deathly Hallows). Their shop being destroyed incidentally by someone sent by the king drives the Potters mad and turns them Dark. Ever since, they've been attempting to gain control of the Triforce.

Starring:

- Merlin as the Hyrule King
- King Arthur as Link (the pot-breaker)
- The Dealthy Hallows as the Triforce
- Salazar Slytherin as the Gerudo chief
- Helga Hufflepuff as the Zora queen
- Godric Gryffindor as the Goron chief
- Rowena Ravenclaw as the Rito chief
- The Potter family as Ganondorf

** What does a Dark Lord Potter, who is a literal potter, make?

Soul Jars.

That is both not a pun and totally a pun. But in all seriousness, pottery is about containers. I would argue therefor that the Potter family magics revolve around binding and containing.

**** It could still be owned by potters with goblins as facadé of their business. Supposedly Gringotts was found around 14th century with Potters as their backer in wizard council and gringotts goblins they are all bound to Potter Bloodline.

** You see magical pottery is made stronger with the ashes of your enemy mixed in for some reason it helps it hold magic alot better. A fact only known by the potter family. The world's most famous pottery experts.

** Everyone in the know assumed the Cloak was harmless. The Elder Wand was called the Death Stick for good reason, and while no one knew exactly why, the Resurrection Stone had similarly developed an eerie reputation. Certainly, if anyone could have traced its history, they would have blamed the stone for the decline of the Gaunts.

But the Cloak--oh, that was harmless. A good protection, as it truly hid (and thus protected) the wearer from death. And Potters were known to be sensible folk, generally accepting death when it came, not trying to avoid it or cling to life through...questionable...methods.

(Dumbledore, not liking the thought of a student in his school being able to hide so absolutely--he had had enough of /that/ with James--had added charmed threads to the cloak that allowed him to track it before giving it to Harry. Coincidentally, that also permitted Mad-Eye Moody to do so as well, letting the retired Auror believe it was a regular invisibility cloak and not the one of legend.)

But like the rest of Death's gifts, it came with a sting in the tail. More subtle, as befit the subtlest of the brothers.

It worked on the mind.

Nothing obvious, no insanity, no early dementia, not even a disorder like OCD.

No, it stoked the flames of ambition and self-worth. Not for nothing had Snape called James Potter "arrogant."

Potters always rose to the top of their chosen field and then invariably would work to change and improve it, to make it fit their own ideas of how it should be. To rework it in their own image, as it were.

And now, Harry Potter, the Boy who Lived, the Man who Conquered, the Savior, the one poised to change the world, owns the Cloak...

[This went in directions I wasn't expecting, but I was thinking about the whys rather than the whats.]
