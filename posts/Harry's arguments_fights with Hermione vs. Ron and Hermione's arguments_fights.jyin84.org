Harry and Hermione never had any /real/ “fights”---at least not in the same way she and Ron did.

Sure, sometimes Harry and Hermione got angry with each other, but it was only due to stresses and *arguments about* *real things which were important.*

Harry and Hermione resolved their arguments and generally respected each others' point of view the way that people who truly appreciate each other do. They either reached some sort of compromise, or gave the other the benefit of doubt. They never insulted each other.

Even when Harry didn't always voice it or was angry about something, he nearly always respected Hermione's perspective.

This is just one example of many in regards to the sort of argument in which Harry understood and actually respected Hermione's intent. And this about the only major */fight/* they had in the series (/regarding Occlumency, he wasn't actually angry with Hermione, he tried to avoid her though, because he felt guilty and knew she was right, and in regards to the Half-Blood Prince's book, there was an irritable argument, but no disrespect between them---but a bit more about that later/).

#+begin_quote
  *PoA ch 12:*\\
  *Harry knew that Hermione had meant well,* but that didn't stop him from being angry with her.\\
  [...]\\
  "Yeah... anything," said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a month. "You know what -- we should make up with Hermione.... *She was only trying to help...."*
#+end_quote

Harry was nearly always the one who wanted to cut Hermione a break when they had a disagreement.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.\\
  *"Can't you give her a break?" Harry asked Ron quietly.*\\
  "No," said Ron flatly. "If she just acted like she was sorry -- but she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something."
#+end_quote

The other biggest disagreements: regarding Occlumency, Harry wasn't actually angry with Hermione, he tried to avoid her though, because he felt guilty and knew she was right---and in regards to the Half-Blood Prince's book, there was argumentation, and irritability, but no real disrespect between them.

Hermione's fights with Ron were *actual fights about bulls**\** like jealousy and Ron treating Hermione like rubbish, mocking her interests in academics and hard work and social justice, and Hermione */responding/* with disrespect, disregard or canaries.

It's...er... interesting how many Ron/Romione fans point to this scene as evidence of how great Ron was to Hermione, sticking up for her---and to be fair, he */was/* sticking up for her---but they always tend ignore or dismiss a key part of the scene:

#+begin_quote
  *PoA ch 9:*\\
  "Silence!" snarled Snape. "Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a third-year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are. . . "\\
  "Please, sir," said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, "the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf --"\\
  "That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger," said Snape coolly. "Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all. "\\
  Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and *Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week,* said loudly, "You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be told?"
#+end_quote

So, Ron */is/* sticking for Hermione (Yay Ron) over */something/* */which he himself rudely called her twice a week---evidently since first year./*

It's clear evidence of *Ron's insults and consistent and regular disrespect of Hermione's intellect, her interest in academics, and her diligent work ethic* (/and this is why the director of PoA, the movie, had Ron say, “He's got a bit of a point,” but in a relatively lighthearted manner which was easy to brush off. The director was splitting the difference, because it was the only way to show what Ron generally thought of Hermione/).

And here we have a scene which indicates *Hermione's disregard and disrespect for Ron's concerns about Scabbers.* ... */I wonder if it had something to do with Ron calling her a Know-it-All twice a week since first year?/* :P

#+begin_quote
  *Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied around his neck.*\\
  "Don't bring him in here!" said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.\\
  *But Hermione wasn't listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.*\\
  [...]\\
  But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus's bed, right at Ron's chest.\\
  "GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks's claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking it over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.
#+end_quote

*Honestly, I can't blame Ron for being pissed off about Hermione being so inconsiderate.*

But */maybe/* we should */also/* be concerned about Ron being a jerk to Hermione at least twice a week since first year. I*t's just one example of a fight which amounts to mutual disrespect.*

Fourth year was quite a mess. Do I really need to go over Ron's disregard for Winky as a person right after Crouch sacked her and lack of regard for Hermione's justifiable anger.

#+begin_quote
  *GoF ch 9:*\\
  “The way they were treating her,” said Hermione furiously, “Mr Diggory calling her elf all the time ... and Mr Crouch! He knew she didn't do it and he's still going to sack her! He didn't care how frightened she'd been, or how upset she was---it was like she wasn't even human!”\\
  “Well, she's not,” said Ron.\\
  Hermione rounded on him.\\
  “That doesn't mean she hasn't got feelings Ron...”
#+end_quote

(As an aside, Hermione is angry about Crouch */firing/* Winky---*not* about Winky /working/ for him...I'm just saying...)

And here is Ron */mocking/* her about her interest in */rights/* (/like sick leave and holidays---/*/not/* /trying to stop them from working...I'm just saying.../) for house-elves during the start of term feast.

#+begin_quote
  *GoF ch 12:*\\
  “Treacle tart, Hermione!” said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell towards her. “Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!”\\
  But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of McGonagall that he gave up.
#+end_quote

That continued, and during the Yule Ball, Ron was a jealous asshole about Krum, causing a major fight between him and Hermione.

So, again, we see the sort of rubbish Ron and Hermione fight about---the mutual disrespect.

And here is a scene in OotP which shows exactly what /Hermione thinks of Ron/ *after all of his mocking of her interests in academics, hard work and interest in social justice* (/Hmm...that sort of reminds of some people on the internet these days/),

*Hermione's disrespect of Ron, and her respect for Harry couldn't be more apparent.*

#+begin_quote
  *OotP Ch 9:*\\
  The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.\\
  ‘Did you---did you get---?”\\
  *She spotted the badge in Harry's hand and let out a shriek.*\\
  *“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. “Me too, Harry, me too!”*\\
  “No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron's hand. “It's Ron, not me.”\\
  “It---what?”\\
  “Ron's prefect, not me,” Harry said.\\
  *“Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But . . . are you sure? I mean---”*
#+end_quote

*That is NOT looking good for Hermione and Ron...*

And then Ron was an OUTRAGEOUS asshole to Hermione in sixth year for at least a couple of weeks before she finally snapped from all his emotional abuse.

#+begin_quote
  *HBP ch 14:*\\
  “ ‘Slug Club'...” repeated Ron, *with a sneer worthy of Malfoy.* “It's pathetic. *Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don't you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug...”*\\
  [...]\\
  Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater's bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream *Ron* for the real one, who *was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference.*\\
  What was more, *Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys' dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first-years for looking at him.*\\
  To Harry's dismay, *Ron's new aggression did not wear off over the next few days.*\\
  [...]\\
  Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron's confidence all through dinner, but *Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice.*\\
  [...]\\
  “...See! I can save goals without help, Hermione!”\\
  “I never said you couldn't---Ron, /you/ thought you'd been given it too!”\\
  *But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder.*\\
  “Er,” said Harry in the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this, “shall...shall we go up to the party, then?”\\
  *“You go!” said Hermione, blinking back tears. “I'm* */sick/* *of Ron at the moment. I don't know what I'm supposed to have done. ...”*\\
  [...]\\
  *[Harry] did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offence had occurred so long ago.*

  “Looking for Ron?” she asked, smirking. “He's over there, the filthy hypocrite.”\\
  Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.
#+end_quote

And */that/* was just the cherry on top of the s***cake Ron had been serving Hermione for a couple of weeks---after Hermione had invited him to Slughorn's party. *It was the final straw which made her snap.*

#+begin_quote
  *“Oppugno!” came a shriek from the doorway.*
#+end_quote

Sooooo........That's the kind of bulls*** Ron and Hermione fought about over the years. Ron disrespecting Hermione---then, in return, Hermione disrespected Ron right back.

- Harry and Hermione argued about things like a Firebolt which might kill him---*and he knew she meant well.*
- Hermione tried to impress on him the importance of Occlumency---*he knew she was right and felt guilty about it.*
- Hermione got angry with Harry over the Half-Blood Prince's book---some of it not entirely fair, and some of it perfectly legitimate. Harry actually didn't get too fussed about her irritation with him---*he knew she meant well and was mostly just looking out for him.*

Those are the kinds of things that Harry and Hermione argued about and got angry about---all of which Harry more or less respected her for...

The arguments over Draco being a Death Eater was Hermione and Ron */both/* not really believing Harry---so that doesn't count.

Which was ridiculous. I don't even consider that legit. Hermione and Ron were */both/* totally OoC in that instance.

*So, as I said at the beginning, Harry and Hermione's arguments are qualitatively different than Ron and Hermione's fights.*

- *Harry and Hermione don't insult or disrespect each other.*
- *Ron insults Hermione, and they both disrespect each other.*
