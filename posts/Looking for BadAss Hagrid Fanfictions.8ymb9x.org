I think Hagrid is grossly underrated in a many fanfictions.

I have only read one until today in which he was featured in a somewhat positive way linkffn(7512124)

Are there more fanfictions that show us a good and strong Hagrid?

Thanks in advance


** Holy shit thank you so much for posting that.

Lessons with Hagrid is the funniest thing I've read all year.

Brilliant.

*** Seconded, it's absolute gold lol.

Tbh I think it has the best Hagrid-speech I've ever read. Also this may be the only fic I've ever seen where there are different side effects depending on the type of occlumency defense a person uses. It's a good idea.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

** Linkffn(The Brightest Witch in the Darkest House) mentions this in passing a few times, mainly focusing on how canon Hagrid was able to do charms and human transfiguration silently, with a broken wand. It's not a major part of the story though

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** How about that one about James surviving when Lily dies so the Marauders go on a rampage taking out all the death eaters and he leaves Harry with Hagrid and Hagrid wipes out waves of death eaters? Anyone remember what that's called?

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

** Well, in my AU story "Patron", Hagrid was exonerated as soon as Dumbledore became Headmaster, finished school and became a teacher at Hogwarts - and one of Europe's foremost experts on Magical Creatures. As well as one of the most profilic breeders. He isn't a main character, but he has a few badass moments, like this:

#+begin_quote
  Her spell blew a small crater into the ground, showering the man with clumps of earth and rocks, and hiding him behind a cloud of dust. For a moment, she felt hope, and started to run around the acid pools his spells had left. Then she heard him laugh again.

  He hadn't been fazed by her spell. His dirty robe wasn't even torn, his Shield Charm still up. He stared at her, licking his lips, and waved his wand, almost mockingly.

  Then the murderer disappeared under a half-giant that had dropped from the sky, right on him, driving him into the ground and breaking his body. The bastard wasn't laughing anymore, but screaming - until the fist of Professor Hagrid smashed into his head and shattered his skull.

*** You know, a half-giant trained in magic is one scary motherfucker. I don't know why I never felt that way about Maxime. Maybe because she's not that relevant?

If he gets disarmed, he'll just beat the everliving crap out of his opponents!

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
