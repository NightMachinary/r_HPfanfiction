Hi guys, I just wanted to remind people that some people, myself included, haven't yet seen Cursed Child and aren't planning to read it until after we've seen it. Just pop a little spoiler alert in before you type something please!


** Snape kills Dumbledore.

** Rule 5 does require spoilers to be tagged.

Realistically though, you should avoid this subreddit and fanfiction if you prefer to remain unspoiled. [[/r/hpfanfiction]] isn't very active with spoiler tags and author profiles, notes, reviews, and the fanfic itself may very well contain CC information. The mods of [[/r/harrypotter]] are very diligent about spoilers so that may be a safer sub for you.

** I'm sorry, but this is a fanfiction subreddit. I think courtesy requires a spoiler warning on fanfiction here, but I think it's your problem, not everyone else's, if you choose to come here without having read the source material fully.

** I have to second what [[/u/boomberrybella][u/boomberrybella]] said. Optimally, it would be nice if every single spoiler from a certain point on the release timeline was spoilered, sure, but considering how many people casually reference things in comments without thinking about it that's nothing more than a wish by now. So really, if you want not to get spoilered by that one then the best thing you can do is to stop frequenting this particular place until you read it.
