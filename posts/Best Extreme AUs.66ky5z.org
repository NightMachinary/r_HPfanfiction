I'm looking for your best recommendations for 'extreme AU' fics.

By this I mean things like

Grindelwald was never defeated Harry never goes to Hogwarts Everyone is muggle and Harry works in a coffee shop

You see where I'm going? Excellent!

No slash. No need for romantic pairings but bonus points if present. Extra bonus if complete. (new criteria: please make sure Harry is the MAIN CHARACTER, dunno why, just can't read Fanfiction without him being the lead)


** linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) may meet your criteria. Lucius basically decalred himself Dark Lord when Voldemort disappeared and took over Britain. Harry went to Beauxbatons in France along with a large number of English exiles. Hermione was raised to hate the enemies of the Dark Lord as a jannissary.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]]

Hermione Granger and the Boy who Lived is a very AU story where their is no magic, Harry's dad was 007, and instead of going to a school for magic, everyone learns how to be super spies with insane gadgets and mad science. Still kinda sorta follows the stations of the cannon, if you squint at it right.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*********** Oh no see, I do listen, but the thing you don't seem to get is that your argument doesn't make any sense. If you were talking about an idea for some fanfic your writing then it'd be a different story but your talking about your head canon, I strait up challenged you to point out IN CANON OR ON POTTERMORE OR ON ANYTHING THAT OUR HOLY LADY OF SHITTY WORLD BUILDING JKROWLING HAS SAID that states that Wizards aren't human. When you said that they have the same genetic make up but they aren't human that's the same argument people used when talking about the other raises compared to Whites. I am willing to listen to argument and I love to debate but you need to come at me with facts instead of saying "well theirs something different about them, they can do the magic that means they aren't human" that doesn't make any sense, So from that perspective someone who can out compute a calculator isn't human since they have some strange ability?

The reason it works in X-men is because Mutants ARE a subspecies of Human, they have enough differences in their genetics that make them not human anymore, but a sub species. In Warhammer the Space Marines are arguably not human anymore for that exact same reason. In Percy Jackson Demi-Gods for all intents and purposes AREN'T human either for that same reason, they are half god half human, they have different genetics. Halflings in DND are the same way so are Veela in Harry Potter, they are different genetically, but similar enough to be able to mate with humans, the problem is Wizards AREN'T like that, they are just humans that have the ability to use magic. Star Wars is another example of this, is Luke Skywalker not human since he can tap into the force?

Not all humans can do Magic, it is something they must be born with - because their ancestors where capable of doing magic. There has to be, as I have said very many times already and is likely not furthering my argument, something /different/ with the wizards - or they would *not* be able to do magic; or all humans would have the potential to do magic. As you said earlier, they are most likely a subspecies of humanity. In [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hybrid][Star Wars]] are not the other very alien humanoid species capable of mating with humans to produce offspring? In [[http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Hybrid][Star Trek]] are not the humanoid aliens capable of producing offspring with humans? Being able to have children with someone does not mean you are them, just that you are similar.

Pulling references from /other/ fandoms does not prove much here, I know, just that the concepts are similar. As you stated, humans can have children with Veale, but they can also mate with Giants - Hagrid and Madam Maxine - and Goblins - Professor Flitwick - so why would it be so hard to believe that humans can also mate with /wizards/.

***** The main problem your headcanon is that it basically assumes that Muggles are all squibs and that they should all know about the magical community when they don't, if this was true the statute of secrecy wouldn't need to exist. The second problem comes about with the fact that the magical population should be larger by that logic even though it's not.

****** What? All muggles aren't Squibs - muggles are, err, muggles - they have no magic and they come from no magic. Muggleborns are the descendants of Squibs - people who had the potential to do magic but couldn't and passed that potential on to their offspring who in turn passed it on to theirs. Petunia, as Lily did, most likely - though not with any certainty - also had the potential for magic in her 'blood' and the ability to pass down that potential; so speaking somewhere down the line one of her descendants may be able to use magic. Since she has immediate family that knows magic, she should have been able to enter the magical community to a very limited degree - I was simply spinning a possible AU.

***** The problem with that is your assuming that say petunia and lilys parents knew about the magical world before lily got her letter and that they were squibs in some fashion.

Thats not true Vernon and Petunia arent squibs they are muggles. Normal people. A squib is a muggle born in the magical world. As i said earlier JK has no idea how to properly world build her magic system.

******* I haven't read the books in a while but I am going to say no, mainly because I doubt Severus would have shown her parents magic since he was under age, and Lily and Snape can't really prove what they're saying is true to adults unless an adult is willing to show them and we both know that Snape didn't know any adults that would be willing (his mom wouldn't have gone against his dad and his father was an abusive ass from what I understand) So assuming this they'd wait until she got her letter to hogwarts.

*********** I'm pretty sure that squibs are just muggles that happen to be born from wizzards.

There's no reason magic should work logically, or follow the rules of genetics. For an unknown reason some are born wizards from muggle parents and other are born muggles from wizard parents.

There's no evidence whatsoever that squibs are anything but muggles. It could very well just be a status (as are half-blood, blood traitors and pureblood). I'm almost certain the idea that squibs' magic is dormant is purely fanon.

Although I didn't read the books in a long time.

************ Firstly, you used the words logically and genetics, if we know one thing its that magic doesn't have to be logical nor does it have to follow scientific laws.

Secondly, I remember vaguely in book 2? Maybe a later one something about a 'quickspells course' for squibs. I might be making it up but to me that implies they have potential but extremely limited. Not enough to make it worth teaching them anything but still a hint of magic. Filch works at Hogwarts too, Hogwarts is meant to appear as rumble to muggles.

Exactly, That's what I said.

If it's the case, you're certainly right. I can't confirm though. Would anyone know about that?

Yes, but does it appear this way to the people who are non-magical, or to the people who have the status 'muggle'. Magic in HP works through intent and thus, through language.

Muggle is a social category as well as a 'magical' reality (I was gonna write biological...).

It is also quite possible that you can put exceptions to a muggle repellant charm. It could even be a clause in Filch's contract.

Edit: As noted in another comment (confirmed by the wiki), squibs are indeed different from muggles and do have a few perks of their own. I really don't remember anything of the sort from the books though.
