I've seen a ton of fics that have Harry raised by a person from another fandom, but none of those fics really go anywhere. Looking for those types of fics that actually go somewhere instead of it being just 1 or 2 shots.

  After resigning from the Jedi Order, Ahsoka didn't expect to find herself sent to a new world, especially a world where a young boy needed her help... (Epilogue 1 links to Knave Squadron.)

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14824227/chapters/34306017]]) Disturb the Universe has Harry being adopted by Tony DiNozzo from NCIS, and is fantastic.

linkao3(591278) This fic is in a similar vein but it's Hermione being raised by Hotch from Criminal Minds. One of the most well written fics I've ever read in any fandom.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

** "Itachi, is that a baby?" is a HP/Naruto crossover where Harry gets raised by the Akatsuki. It's 300k words long so not a one shot at all. It's more of a humor/crackfic than anything super serious. I enjoyed it.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** This one updates occasionally, but not super frequently. He's raised by Ruby from RWBY after she accidentally gets transported to the HP world I think during the fall of beacon [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12235811/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Redheaded-Alien-Warrior]]

There's also one I liked where he was raised by Liara from mass effect, but it hasn't updated in several years unfortunately.
