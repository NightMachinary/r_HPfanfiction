Are there any fics that even touch on the fact that the muggle population increased dramatically since Hogwarts was founded, and especially so in the last couple hundred years? The population of Britain had more than doubled in Dumbledore's lifetime (or quadrupled, if you go with 150 years instead of 115).

I don't think I've read anything where it was mentioned, but I was looking at some population numbers and couldn't miss it. Around the time Hogwarts was founded, the population of Britain was about 1.7 million; by 1800 it was 7.75 million, and it went up by double-digit percentages for the next 11 decades, hitting 33 M by 1910 and 46 M when Harry was born. If you assume that magic is genetic (a combination of recessive genes giving rise to magical ability), that would cause a massive increase in the number of muggle-born wizards and witches. That in turn would have to have SOME sort of impact on the Wizard world.


** That is certainly one way to look at it.

Another perspective might be that "Magic" chooses to gift a certain number of muggleborn with magic - a number that is near constant without regard to percentages or genetics or such.

Am not arguing for it, just mentioning it.

*** The 'muggle-borns magic is stolen' explanation would also keep the numbers low.

**** I thought that was mostly nonsense trying to find an explanation for squibs?

How would those who have no magic be able to steal it? Is it even possible for those who have magic?

***** I'm not claiming it's logical, just that it would possibly keep the numbers stable.

** I've read some where it's sort of mentioned in the middle of a ‘muggles will fuck you up' lecture, or a ‘oh no we've inbred so much that purebloods are only having squibs' but not in the context of what you're saying. It's definitely something that would affect things for sure

*** I'm looking at it from the perspective of two anti-muggle/anti-muggle-borns wars between the 40s and the 80s. If there are only a few muggle-borns a year, that's one thing. If they suddenly become a quarter of the new student population, they turn into a (perceived) threat.

** It could also be argued that there has to have been a witch or a wizard somewhere in the family line to introduce those genes/mutations in the first place, which could still lead to an increase of muggleborns, though not quite as much as simply having a certain percent of the population being muggleborn.

*** If you assume it's genetically based, of assume at least a significant percentage would have to be descendants of magic folk. But you're right, as the number of squibs and such filter into the muggle population, the frequency of magical genes will increase, which will also increase the number of muggle-borns.
