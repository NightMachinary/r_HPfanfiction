any fics where the blame for dumbledore not training him is because of harry's own mediocrity not dumbledores unwillingness

like he expected harry to get off his ass and actually train himself after it either second year or during fourth year in the tournament rather than doing the bare minimum to survive


** Not sure something that illogical exists, even in extreme AU fics. I mean, I can't even imagine how you would make that idea logical without inventing a whole new childhood and school timeline for Harry, resulting in the necessary absolute personality change.

I at least have never seen anything like it in my 18 years in this scene.
