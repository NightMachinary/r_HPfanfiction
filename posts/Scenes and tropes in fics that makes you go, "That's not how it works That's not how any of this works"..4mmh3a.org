** What's with Harry giving huge speeches in the middle of the great hall? Calling out Dumbledore, cursing Snape, declaring his love to /[insert character here]/, killing Voldemort, telling everyone and their owl about the Horcruxes.

It's funny because it tries to make Harry look smart and mature, but instead makes him look incredibly stupid and really childish.

** I cringe every time I see 'Pads' or 'Prongsy.' like seriously, they already have dorky nicknames, why are you making them even more unrealistic and childish? It's a sure sign of poor characterisation in the fic. It also makes me think it was written by a 13 year old girl with weird friends because even the teenage girls I grew up with didn't give their friends cutesy pet names.

I also hate Percy-Lily (ie, Lily Evans who is basically a female Percy and occasionally violent). A lot of authors use this (canon contradicting!) chraracterisation, or make Lily into a younger Aunt Petunia (shrill, anal retentive, hate-filled). Or Hermione-Lily (prefect who loves books and hates quidditch, few other defining features). It's lazy writing because 1) you're carbon-copying another character when you have a lot of space to make a semi-OC and 2) none of these character types fit very well with canon Lily

I have more, but these are my two biggest gripes. I like to read canon compliant (or character compliant) fics and it sucks when 90% of Marauders era stuff is tropey garbage, especially when that era has so much leeway and potential for being canon-compliant (loads of OCs, plot could be /anything,/ space for 'growing up' etc).

**** It's not super obvious, and there's loads of room to play with it but these are some traits that can be supported by canon:

- disregard for rules: she doesn't care that her mum told her not to do her flying trick (DH); she doesn't care when Snape tells her the Gryffindor boys sneak out at night (DH); she does magic underage during summers to piss off Petunia (PS, post-book info)

- popular, friendly, and likeable: she's got a gaggle of girlfriends (OotP; DH); /everyone/ except Petunia seems to like her; Slughorn describes her as charming, vivacious (HBP); friendly with older people too: McGonagall, Hagrid, Bathilda Bagshot (PS, DH)

- desire for justice: defends Snape (OotP); is furious about Dark Magic (in general), especially that it was used against a fellow student (Mary MacDonald) (DH); joins the Order

- talkative; sometimes mouthy: goes on big rants, and lectures people (Snape in DH; James in OotP); described as cheeky by Slughorn (HBP); when she's angry she bites back with insults that'll hit you where it hurts (to Petunia in DH, James and Snape in OotP); letter to Sirius (DH) sounds like something a chatty person would write, but it may have been because she hadn't written him in a while

- emotional (may be biased bc we tend to see her only in emotional scenes): laughing/giggling with Petunia; worried about Dementors; crying on the Hogwarts Express; angry at the new boys; angry/upset about Snape's friends; furious about the SWM scene; crying after SWM scene; crying after meeting Vernon (Pottermore info); laughing at her wedding; laughing at Harry's antics; crying because she's dying; crying in the Mirror of Erised.

- smart (though nothing to suggest she's a bookworm): Slughorn says she's one of the brightest he ever taught (HBP); Hagrid says she was Head Girl (PS); James and Sirius are wary of her dueling abilities (apprehensive when she pulls out her wand in SWM, OotP); Voldemort tried to recruit her (I can't recall which book this was in, or if I've just made it up)

Smaller traits and quirks:

- probably likes flying, Quidditch: Snape is worried that Lily'll like James because everyone thinks he's 'a big Quidditch hero' (DH) - Snape usually overreacts to things, so it may not mean anything, but I interpreted it as him worrying because Lily /is/ a Quidditch fan. Even if she doesn't follow the game, she probably likes flying based on her early childhood magic trick (DH). She certainly hasn't got anything against semi-dangerous magic activities, since she puts a 12-month old on a toy broomstick and let's him break half their decorations.

- gossipy: her letter to Sirius in DH is a chatty, gossip filled thing; she mentions an acquaintance's family's recent death wedged between 'the baby smashed a horrible vase!' and 'Bagshot tells me outlandish things about Dumbledore.' Personally, I also like to believe that she has /something/ in common with her sister (genetics and all that) too.

- likes nicknames: you can't argue this one. She calls Petunia 'Tuney' (until they're on bad terms); Snape 'Sev'; Sirius 'Padfoot' (even though they're grown adults by now!); Peter's 'Wormy.' The only person who's allowed to say 'Pads' in a fic is Lily, because it actually sounds like something she might do IMO. Also, she basically gave her son a nickname (Harry, short for Henry; Pottermore) for his actual name. And Petunia likes to call Dudley stupid pet names so it's another thing that I imagine they both picked up as children.

Obviously there's some really good fics that don't use any of these things, but since most have devolved into tropey crap, I'd like to see more of /this/ Lily.

******* Thanks, haven't read that actually, will check it out. I didn't read too many Marauder era fics for the exact reason that you don't: sadly most of them are not very good at all (read: they completely butcher the characters and are made up of useless fluff.) I think the only two that I've enjoyed were Timely Errors and Hold Me While I'm Here, but neither pay a lot of attention to Lily, compared to the other four and Harry. Still, I think Lily's portrayal in Timely Errors was pretty decent, iirc. So thanks for the suggestion :)

I've recently tried to read "Harry Crow" (I know, I know, it's by robst, shouldn't have expected any better), but these two problems are completely beyond ridiculous in that fic.

Done well, and for the sake of exploring the topic, I'm sure it can potentially make for a good story.

Like, they'll understand that hitting and screaming obscenities is gross and wrong, but they'll often be like "oh, what do you mean it's not normal to lock me in the closet for using the wrong tone of voice?" I would argue that it's one reason why Harry ends up being so good at sneaking around and trying to do things on his own that he really ought to have gone to McGonnagall about.

Also, Harry doesn't exactly have the level of abuse that we tend to think of when we think "abuse." It's like the sort of abuse that my parents used on me to "improve" me- undermining my self esteem to control me, spankings for relatively minor infractions, shouting and being overly obsessed with perfection from a little kid, etc. It's abuse, sure, but it's not burning the kid with a cigarette or beating them until they can't move or starving them until they basically die. When I grew up, my mom would actually read articles from the paper about horrific abuse (like kids being forced to eat dog food or locked in cages in a basement) and then say "see, that's what real abuse is like!" She was very careful to frame what "real" abuse was, so even when I felt like what she was doing was wrong, I was unable to truly believe that it was actually "abuse."

Truer words have never been spoken. And I say that as someone who was diagnosed with a conduct disorder twice during their teenage years. You don't act out around people who can legit fuck up your life for good. I did sometimes, but that was because I was freaking mentally ill.

And as someone who has a current ASPD diagnosis, literally every fic I've read that tried to portray someone with a cluster-B personality disorder, especially a young child. The worst offender in my opinion is canon. Every time I read the Dumbledore-meets-Tom-Riddle chapter I just want to pick Rowling up and shake the stereotypes out of her.

I personally think the most interesting enchanted object in the books is the Ford Anglia. Somehow, Arthur Weasley when giving it the ability to fly, turn invisible and some space expansion gave the car animal-level life.

EDIT: I do think runes have a place in enchantment, but not actively. My headcanon would be that runes would be used to help plan out enchantments, essentially working as magical notation to help the enchanter decide in what order to use the spells, where on the object to place them (if necessary), see where the symbolism and concepts of different spells would interact, etc.

*** Because red hair is a recessive gene? I was under the impression that as long as James was a carrier, then it was still possible for them to have a red-headed child. If the combination of sperm+egg changed enough to end up with a female child instead of male, surely it can change enough for that child to be red haired instead of dark.

**** Yeah I was curious about that part so I looked up the Potter ancestors and as far as I can tell none of them had red hair. Doesn't mean that James couldn't be a carrier but the chances seem pretty low. I don't know maybe I've just been over thinking it.

***** The books also imply that messy hair and skill on a broomstick are heritable features in the HP universe. The recessive nature of Lily's red hair should be the least of your concerns if you're analyzing the genetics of the magical world.

****** To be fair, messy hair can definitely be heritable if it is the texture of the hair causing it to be messy. Also, the magical world is not the only one to think that athletic abilities are heritable. Think of all of the proud parents who claim their kids got such and such talent from them. Not saying that's accurate, just that it isn't just something in fanfiction.
