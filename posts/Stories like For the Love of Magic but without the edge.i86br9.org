I mean stories focused on a character figuring out more about magic, especially from various parts of the world, and developing their own kinds of magic. I couldn't finish For the Love of Magic, Harry's descent into becoming a racist playboy monarch just made it feel too much like the author was entertaining some kind of European hyper-nationalist power-fantasy. I also thought the sex stuff was fine at first but quickly became more cringe.

Basically, I want to read a story that uses a curious character to expand on Rowling's worldbuilding, primarily with respect to the kinds of magic practiced in the world, that does not have tons of the author's weird prejudices bleeding in. Ideally a complete story, or if incomplete at least fairly long.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/01/The-Imposter-Complex][Imposter Complex]] has some cool globetrotting stuff going on where the MC is trying to track down what Voldemort was doing before he was Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][Harry Dursely and the Chronicles of the King]] is a little weird and might not be quite what you're looking for. It's kinda hard to describe without spoiling it but it definitely explores some of the potential consequnces of immortality existing. There's a ton of what were background characters that come into the story and definitely the most interesting interpretation of Peeves I've seen.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] is the first of a three part (but mostly standalone) series that has a ton of weird magical stuff going for it. The first is a buddy cop thing set decades post-war where Harry and Voldemort are forced by the English government to solve a series of disappearances in France.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][Magicks of the Arcane]] had some cool stuff going on but I might be confusing some parts of it with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/][By the Divinging Light]] which I know has stuff like casting magic via knots and stuff.

You've probably already read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian Renegade]] but on the off chance you haven't, it's a three part series (the fourth is unfinished) that combines a lot of the Dresden Files with Harry Potter and goes much more smoothly than I expected.

Same thing goes for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]] since it used to get suggeted a lot here. As the name suggests it explores legilemancy and a fair bit of international stuff.

It's not Harry Potter but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10043079/1/Son-of-the-Western-Sea][Son of the Western Sea]] is entirely exploring the world, exploring new mythologies and is the only Percy Jackson fic I've read that's been any good.

** Miranda Flairgold's Akren series, maybe? it's pretty much abandoned at this point, but it is pretty long. it's also largely AU, i'll warn you. with only Harry, who goes by a different name, really being in it. explores a lot of other magic, though Blood Magic is the most developed one.

also has no explicit sex scenes in it.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) does this really well with Potions, Runes, and other intersections of different fields of magic. Also has high quality writing and an entertaining plot. In progress, but it's over a million words total at this point. Probably the most power-fantasy of the four I've recommended, but it's done right.

linkffn(Alexandra Quick) works too, there are no canon characters, but Alex is a much more curious character than Harry. It's fully set within America and various American cultures are treated in a very respectful and holistic way. Also in progress, with 5/7 books complete, also over a million words.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) is all about this; although authorial tone comes in a little more than in the first two fics, there's no ideology involved. Lots of exciting new magic. Incomplete at around 225,000 words, but worth reading.

The series I think does the /most/ in terms of expanding the magic system of the world is linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation). The premise of this series is that a more serious Dark uprising happened only eight years after Voldemort's defeat, causing a technological and social revolution and acceleration of development in the Wizarding World. The writing is a step below the first three fics I've recommended and the characters and worldbuilding are a bit over the top, but the ingenuity of expansion in this series is incredible. It's also complete, again at over a million words.

** Unfortunately incomplete but it involves a ton of world building where there are vampires, fae, werewolves, demons and many other magical creatures. It's also really really long. There's stuff like blood rituals, multiple animagi (but not the OP stuff you get where having more than one is legendary) and it's genuinely interesting. Linkffn(A second chance at life) It has sequels as well, the third one being incomplete. Many people might disagree because it deviates from canon completely and it literally disregards Voldemort but unless you dislike world building in insane amounts, READ IT!

** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Runestone Path) Harry's a rune savant, and the first savant of any path in a few centuries.

linkffn(Core Threads) is iirc the story that inspired FtLM, but takes things a bit differently.

linkao3(Harry Potter and the International Tri-Wizard Tournament) he's learning from Slythering. Really detailed and well thought out ritual stuff from what I saw.

linkffn(FILFy Teacher) After moving to Japan, Harry spends a lot of time learning Japanese wizardry and warding styles. Then branches out to learning some of the other schools of magic. Oddly this expands both the DxD magic schema and HP.

** Remindme! 1 month

If there's only one tragic thing about the HP books, it's that J.K. Rowling is an incredible storyteller, but also an incredibly poor world builder. For someone like me, who lives and dies for those little teeny tiny details on the intricacies of life in the world of whatever I'm reading or watching, this is a calamity and I can't get enough of those fics.

Taure is the best writer in fanfiction at capturing a character's voice/tone etc. His or her Dumbledores (this story and one of his others) is the best by FAR. He or she is a better writer than alot of the HP fanfiction writers who have gone professional - including the two who have become world famous

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was.

** Linkffn(More Equals than You Know) has some of it, though it seems to be abandoned, Linkffn(Lords of Magic by Taure) also got this and has an excellent worldbuilding in it's few chapters, but again it is abandoned. Mischief Heir series linkao3(Say a prayer by Mad_Fairie) and Linkffn(Invincible) and linkffn(Harry gets motivated) all have some pretty interesting concepts about how magic could be used. Linkffn(Albus and Harry's world trip) also got a quite unique take on magic, linkffn (Wind Shear) is a time travel that though not focusing too much also got a unique perspective on the kind of magic Harry uses, linkffn(Harry Potter and The International Triwizard Tournament) is surprisingly low on tropes despite it's first impressions (I promise it really is much better than it seems in the first 3-4 chapters), linkffn(Using the gifts you were given) is a one-shot nor towards the old voodu doll myth while linkffn (The DOOM day) is the only complete time loop story, and thus explores relatively well plenty of magic, it is somewhat of lower quality but linkffn(Elementary Calculations) and linkffn(there is no try) are abandoned takes on the wandless magic trope that don't dissolve into an immediate power-wank. I may be mistaken since I haven't read this one in a while, but I think linkao3(Time doesn't fit in my bottle (but maybe a piece of you will)) has some decent world building though it was quite short and abandoned to boot.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry Potter gets interested in Star Wars and after a small piece of accidental magic starts to believe he is force sensitive and his magic powers develop accordingly. Deviates from canon quickly and without apology. Multi-year story. First year is posted. Second year, and Luna's first appearance, will follow when it's finished. Currently only Star Wars fiction influenced.

******* Then use an alternative that has the same meaning rather than using another word incorrectly. ‘Enhancing' or perhaps ‘building out' might work instead of fleshing out. Flushing makes no sense whatsoever and it's use can't be justified.
