*** Ah, yes, mpreg, my old nemesis. I hate it with a burning passion that I cannot fully articulate. Nay, "hate" is too light a term; this /enrages/ me, and for so many reasons.

I could yammer on for days about the inherent creepiness and misogyny involved, but there also is much to hate about it in terms of world-building, logic, and the limits of physical reality.

Even with magic, pregnancy would put a lot of strain on a man's body. The male body is simply not equipped to naturally handle a pregnancy. There would have to be a lot of human Transfiguration happening or something very similar, like, say, major surgery to alter the pelvis. Then there is the creation of the uterus. And the likely alteration of his outie into an innie since the butt isn't the cleanest route for a newborn to traverse.

Essentially, the mechanics involved would end up looking a lot like a MtF surgery but without turning the "carrier" into a (heaven forfend) /chick/.

Simply put, a writer of mpreg has to go out of the way to make this scenario feasible when simpler (and less dangerous) solutions exist or could be created.

Like, say, having a surrogate carry a baby. Or magicking up an artificial womb that can handle the pregnancy instead. Or using some kind of long-term Polyjuice. Or making at least one of the men in the relationship a trans man who already has a uterus. Or having m/m couples adopt. Or genderflipping a male character into a female one since that's more honest and less patently ridiculous.

*** It's magic though. Why wouldn't it be possible for via magic for a male to get pregnant? In my opinion magic doesn't have any rules, it's only the wizards who made up some to make sense of it. There are all manners of ridiculous things in the HP universe, why can't there be something as silly as mpreg?

For some dumb reason, I can deal with centaurs, unicorns, mermaids, and fucking magnets. But mpreg is just one of those things that's like. Ew. It's not just squicky as hell, but it's also like, where the fuck does the parasite grow? And how does it exit? Out the butt? From the penis? All options are horrifying.

**** It might be terribly written, but don't let that tarnish the ideas (Transhumanism and Singularity) behind the fic.

The Singularity isn't entirely unfeasible - the concept is pretty sound. Superintelligent AIs taking over the world? I disagree with Yudowsky and Elon Musk on the possibility of that happening, but I can see where they are coming from.

Hell, I'd say the Singularity is pretty likely, if not within our own lifetime. I'd even hope for it. All it is, is hoping for /actually/ intelligent AI (likely on a synthetic substrate than our own organic one, and possibly a simulation of an organic intelligence) which would be a watershed moment in human history.

Transhumanism is pretty different. It's simply the idea of modifying the human body to become /better/, often in the context of longevity. We're already doing that with medicine and whatnot, but Transhumanism pushes for more even more focus on enhancing humans, whether it be through neuroprosthetics or something else.

We don't know how to get there - not just yet - but we're trying. I'm not sure how up-to-date my AI/ML intro class was, but there was some strong hinting at the desire to develop an actual intelligence (i.e. Singularity).

I might be biased as a computer science/engineering student, but both transhumanism and the Singularity are viewed as possible, even worthy goals by myself and many of my peers (though many of us disagree with Yudowsky's phrasing and his added ideas).

--------------

Heh, I've taken CS188 too. I honestly don't respect Yudowsky much. Neither do I have any interest in his rationality cult. My point was that he shouldn't tarnish the ideas themselves.

Regardless, let's start with Transhumanism, as I support the idea more than the Singularity. The basic definition is

#+begin_quote
  /"an international and intellectual movement that aims to transform the human condition by developing and creating widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities."/ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism][- Wikipedia]]
#+end_quote

You ask me to sell you on it - but I don't have to. You see, we've /already/ been transforming the human condition ever since we've existed. In a sense, we're already transhumanist; we've shaped the world around us with the intent to fundamentally augment and improve our own state. With medicine, we do the same to our own physical body.

The Transhumanist /movement/ (and I italicize to emphasize that "transhumanism" is philosophical, in some senses a call for social change - it is not an /event/, and as such, can not "/happen/") calls for people to be more invested in enhancing the human condition. And to say that there isn't any serious research going on in the field would be blatantly false. Just at Berkeley, people like [[https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/carmena.html][Carmena]] and [[https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/maharbiz.html][Maharbiz]] have done some fascinating research, and are doing extensive work on neural prosthesis; and [[http://www.cnep-uc.org/][CNEP]] is a group with arguably Transhumanist goals.

I should also note that our introductory Electrical Engineering courses (EE16B, in particular) are jump-started with some insight into brain-machine interfaces and a discussion on the potential of neuroprosthetics. Hell, our first two labs involve a very basic overview of brain-machine interfaces, in which we correlate brain activity to physical activity.

And outside of Berkeley, too, there is plenty of research going on in aging and neural prosthesis. Take the [[http://www.buckinstitute.org/][Buck Institute]], for example. There's [[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/04/27/science.aaf2693][real research]] being done on aging. MIT's [[http://biomech.media.mit.edu/technological-programs/][biomechatronics research]] is also rather significant, and [[http://biomech.media.mit.edu/people-hugh-herr/][Hugh Herr]], also from MIT, is a very notable player.

Again, the /movement/ of Transhumanism is simply a call to invest more - both culturally and physically - into the idea of fundamentally improving the human body. It's a call for people to consider the nature of their mortality and physical limits, and try to /do/ something about it.

So, to answer a few questions, bearing in mind what I've covered above:

#+begin_quote
  But dive into the nitty gritty of the details - exactly how that would work, and it does not hold up to any amount of scrutiny at all.
#+end_quote

If we knew /how/ it would work, we would be done already! But I hope I illustrated that there is indeed serious "concrete research" attempting to figure out how it would actually work.

#+begin_quote
  Some of the biggest diseases remain incurable in today's world. Science can't predict next month's weather.
#+end_quote

I realize that you're stating this to give a perspective of where science really is at the moment, but it turns out that science is actually quite varied, and progress in these things don't necessarily reflect the progress of science overall.

Transhumanism is very vocal about the idea of longevity, potentially somehow immortalizing the brain, as a method to shortcut all the shortcomings with our current bodies (i.e. inevitability for cancer, deadly incurable diseases, etc). Of course, it's theoretical at best, and there's no serious research to support this idea, but some concepts floating around involve converting our brain's organic substrate to a synthetic one - gradually, maintaining a continuous stream of thought - along the lines of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus?oldformat=true][Theseus paradox]]. Of course, all of this is very handwavy, so there's no point in talking about it much beyond idle musings and curiosity.

#+begin_quote
  You think Transhumanism is possible within your lifetime? Sell it to me. Why?
#+end_quote

Yes, I think it /just might/ be possible within our lifetime. A coordinated effort and extensive research in both aging and neural prosthesis, along with significant cultural investment into both of these ideas, could yield very tangible results. And I feel like we're getting there. Will it be within my lifetime? Who knows. I hope so.

As above, one could argue that we're already transhumanist.

#+begin_quote
  So you don't know how to get there, but you're so confident that you're asserting it is bound to happen, and happen rather soon (relatively speaking)?
#+end_quote

We don't know how to get there, but, as shown above, we're trying.

*Is it /bound/ to happen?* /No doubt/ about it. There will be a point when we've enhanced ourself beyond our basic biology.

*Will it happen soon?* Who knows - I certainly hope so. However, it's impossible to put a timeline on technological progress because, well, it hasn't happened yet.

Still, even if we can't call ourselves transhuman within our own lifetime, I'm quite certain that there will be a point down the road when people /can/.

--------------

Now, moving on to the Singularity. I should note I agree with Transhumanism much more than I do with the Singularity.

Let's start with a thought experiment - let's say we somehow obtained a perfect model of the brain, and the means to simulate this model.

We're done. AGI complete. The Singularity has been achieved, /the end/.

If we ever manage to figure out the mathematical model of our brain, /we're done/. Of course, the hurdles are stated in the preface of the thought experiment, but the idea still holds - if the brain is deterministic, (and therefor can be simulated) it is possible for an AGI to exist on a synthetic substrate.

Again, I really doubt this is in any way possible with today's technology, but the concept is there, and it's a valid one.

Now, the "runaway improvement" aspect of the Singularity - I'm not entirely sure about that. It would /require/ that whatever this intelligence is on is /easily scalable/, and that's a big assumption. Still, provided that it is scalable, given adequate time, I don't think it's so insane that an intelligence would be able to figure out how to improve itself given time.

I can agree with you about Yudowsky and Bostrom, but I don't believe that they should invalidate the ideas of the Singularity altogether. If someone said something stupid about mathematics, you wouldn't invalidate mathematics as a field.

*Do we have anything concrete, though?* Following from this idea of simulation is the [[http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/][Blue Brain Project]] and a couple of related projects run by other universities and laboratories. Again, there /is/ work being done outside of the ramblings of armchair scientists. It's not much, but if it /was/ much, we probably wouldn't be having this discussion anyways. It's a beginning.

#+begin_quote
  Now, provide me a legitimate argument for why this would happen that does not involve an absurd amount of speculation, simplification of current trends, and an amazingly "futuristic" outlook.
#+end_quote

So I hope I've answered this. I think the "simulation" argument approaches this issue quite well. Yes, it involves speculation, as does any discussion of not-yet-possible technology. But it doesn't overly simplify trends (it doesn't spout any BS about Moore's Law, if that's what you mean). And it doesn't seem to require an absurdly futuristic outlook

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    I'd even hope for it.
  #+end_quote

  Why?
#+end_quote

Personally? I think it would be quite poetic, for us to create an essentially immortal intelligence despite being mortal ourselves.

But realistically - if the "runaway" argument /does/ hold - if the intelligence /is/ somehow capable of recursive self-improvement (and scalability) - then you have your "superintelligence".

If it's not capable of recursive self improvement, it's an absolutely /incredible/ feat regardless.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  I didn't indent for this to be a long rant, but the surety and confidence with which you claim these ideas will succeed made me want to do it
#+end_quote

I rather enjoy discussions such as these. It makes me rethink my old perspectives, check for errors, etc etc.

#+begin_quote
  since I consider all this stuff actively harmful to critical and scientific thinking process.
#+end_quote

See, I'm not so sure that's entirely valid. When you start trying to seriously figure out /how/ to simulate an intelligence, /how/ to create advanced neuroprosthetics - and when you start doing /concrete research/, beyond the ramblings of an armchair scientist - you've gone beyond simple dreams.

#+begin_quote
  Singularity etc are good dreams without any concrete evidence or even a roadmap.
#+end_quote

A roadmap implies we would know exactly how to get to the goal. If we knew that, we would all be immortal posthumans and the Singularity would have happened, would it not?

What makes this so hard is that we have to figure out how to get there.

#+begin_quote
  There is no data to suggest that we are anywhere even close to achieving "general intelligence" yet.
#+end_quote

I can agree with this, but I don't think this /negates the possibility/ of an AGI. To me, it seems the simulation argument is a strong and valid one, describing that an AGI /is/ possible.

Actually doing the work, however, will need much more time, research, and computation to be feasible.

#+begin_quote
  No, neural networks don't work like the human brain's neurons.
#+end_quote

I am well aware of this and the basic principles behind perceptrons and deep learning.

#+begin_quote
  People need to get over the AI hype.
#+end_quote

You see, I dunno about this. The feeling when I finally finished programming my PacMan agent to perform Bellman updates and figure out the optimal path; the feeling when I finally programmed it to use particle filtering; the feeling when I finally saw the demonstration of PacMan learning from human datasets with nothing but a neural network... and absolutely nailing the board in all of these cases... it was /awesome/.

/Yes/, I realize that these are all simple, mathematical models. /Yes/, I realize that they are /orders of magnitude/ from anything resembling a "real" intelligence.

But the fact that you have created something that can /learn/ is absolutely phenomenal. Revolutionary, in fact, given how widespread AI/ML has become in the past 3 years.

And then you realize that your brain is a mathematical model. It's entirely deterministic. And it makes you realize what might be possible one day, far down the road.

  So how do you think he became a Death Eater?
#+end_quote

Well he was a Slytherin, and was surrounded by people who also became Death Eaters. Someone (like Lucius or Bellatrix) must've taken notice of him and convinced him to join. After SWM, to onlookers it may have seemed that Snape was just like the others and believed in blood purity.

I'm not saying he didn't curse/torture/kill anyone, I just don't think he targeted muggleborns. When Sirius tells Harry about Snape in the cave, he describes him as being completely immersed into Dark Arts but doesn't mention him thinking that muggleborns were inferior.

******* it's sort of like not every member of the political Nazi party and organization was a participant in the torture camps and burning people in ovens.

Organizations allocate roles to people and rarely does one go "lets just make sure that every member spends some time torturing people because... well imagine if there was a public torture event and only 1 of us was there to represent - and it turned out he was bollocks at it. Would just shame our entire group."

  I'm using a logic.
#+end_quote

You are not really.

You make very prejudiced presumptions based on a few cherry picked parts of the man's life.

The interactions you described between Lily and Snape happened while he was a schoolboy. If we passed judgement on everyone based on how they behaved in high school and what they said to their first girlfriend, most of the human population would be irredeemable.

#+begin_quote
  There is no way in hell that Snape became one of Voldemort's inner circle by delivering part of a prophecy. Even if he had been "trusted" by Voldemort and promoted for that sole reason and not for any other evil death eater deeds, he still mus have been sent on important missions (Killing people) right? Or do you honestly think that Snape was pressured into a becoming a death eater, did not support their beliefs, and became one of the inner circle because he reported part of a prophesy. Really?
#+end_quote

yeah all of this isn't logic - it's just your suspicions

Snape was brilliant. He invented his own Dark Art spells while in high-school. He was a prodigy in one of the most respected arts of magic. Going by direct comparison of achievements at a given age he is more talented than Hermione.

That alone is plenty of reasons for him to have earned high rank in an organization devoted to supremacy of magic.

Frankly even from a logistical standpoint it would be silly to acquire a potion maker of such skill as an asset in one's organization and than use that asset for trivial things that any thug can do.

As for his character - there is no information as to what happened to him after the break up with Lily. The only facts are that he diverted from his original path and devoted his life to fighting against the Death Eaters at a very young age. Focusing on things he did as a teenager and completely discounting the course he charted as an adult is not a fair evaluation.

*** I completely agree about bashing. It's totally cool if you want to pair Hermione with someone else. In fact, my favorite type of story is Hermione time-travel where she is paired with Tom Riddle, Sirius, Remus, etc. But you absolutely don't have to portray Ron as bumbling, crumb-spraying, idiotic, or even an abusive rapist to make her like someone else.

** It's very unlikely to find one person who agrees with you on all issues. For example, I like the following:

- Political fics with lots of intrigues, strategies, and wars
- Ruthless, smart protagonists
- Hermione, Ginny, Ron
- Strong Dumbledore and Voldemort
- Harry and Co doing far more than settling for senior ministry bureaucrats after Voldemort's fall
- Logical development of characters and plot

I dislike the following:

- Hermione, Ron, and Ginny bashing
- Angst
- Time turner travels
- Stupid, passive protagonists
- Canon Dumbledore
- Slavish adherence to canon stations

Most people would agree with me on something, while disagreeing on others.

**** Dumbledore's strategy of defeating Voldemort was more risky than a 'Hail Mary' pass ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass]]). Only his enemy's immense stupidity and his own boy's insane amount of luck saved the day.

I mean he knew from 1957 on that Tom Riddle was up to no good, did nothing until late 70s, and then his Order suffered 40% mortality rate without putting any noteworthy Death Eaters permanently out of business. No wonder Wormtail wanted to defect.

After finally catching a break in 1981, he again did nothing for 10 years, while Lucy bribed and corrupted the Ministry left and right.

This guy was simply pathetic.

** If their favourites list contain any fics that involve frequent amounts of character bashing, Harry banging several different women or summaries that involve some variation of the Harry's had enough trope that is the ultimate dead horse.... then I'd be okay with that, cos everyone needs a guilty pleasure.

**** His main characters have everything too easy and it has too much wish fulfillment. He also likes to do lots of Weasley bashing, and Harry and Hermione fall in love too easily. Harry's basically a Nice Guy, and anything wrong they do is treated as right because they're the main characters, instead of being rightfully called out on it.

** Pretty much anything by Lomonaaeren. I think that the premises are decent on a lot of her fics but that is pretty much it. Her writing is all telling without showing and she writes everyone completely OOC with no explanation for how they got that way. I get that all slash is at least a bit OOC, but in her slash, not only is there the gay thing OOC, but the characters are completely different in every way from canon other than looks. Anyway, as someone who reads a lot of slash, if someone recommends Lomonaaeren in a list of other fics, for better or worse I generally discount a lot of their other recommendations too.

*** I actually have a story of Lomonaaeren's on my recs list because I think it's quite good and I re-read it at intervals. On the other hand, I haven't been able to finish any of their other fics, which surprised me when I sought out their stories after reading and enjoying [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/752763][Kestrel]].

They were well-written on a sentence level, not shit at all, but they were curiously "off" in characterization and atmosphere. Which, well, most fanfiction subtly or not so subtly changes the characters, but for some reason I couldn't connect with the narrative voice in these. So after a few tries, I stopped.

**** I will give Kestrel a shot - maybe there will be one I like. But yeah the writing is definitely decent, but the characterization is so weird. All of the characters say weird things and do weird things without addressing it - we are just supposed to accept them as true. You're right that it is the narrative voice that is the issue. Also, more than any other author I have read, Lomonaaeren always has characters saying everything with their eyes. Eyes are just not expressive enough for a whole conversation - it is just lazy writing to have eyes (or "orbs"-blerg) doing all the dialogue for you.

***** Kestrel focuses on older Snape and middle-aged Harry, in case that's not your thing. It's also relatively short, which might help cut down on some of Lomonaaeren's mannerisms.

Yeah, I can't quite put my finger on the characterization issue. A disagreeable, weird, or unlikable version of Snape fits well within plausible characterization, but a disagreeable, weird, or unlikable Harry misses the mark for me, and I ran into that in Lomonaaeren's work. If I remember correctly, there's also something claustrophobic about the writing in that handful of fics I tried and didn't finish. I don't know if that's typical of Lomonaaeren's style, though.

Oh dear, the fixation on eyes! I can relate - it's one of my bad habits, too, but I try to curb my excesses and not get ridiculous about it. I just have a weakness for describing faces. But fic writers in general depend too much on eyes to express emotion. Sometimes five different contradictory emotions at the same time.

And 'orbs' should be banished from most writers' vocabularies. I have no idea why it became so popular, but it's a back-button issue for me.
