I am aware that the fandom generally enjoys the idea that Voldemort is impaired by the creation of numerous Horcruxes. /They do/ make him more unstable, but that only increases his strength. I like to envisage the Dark Lord as having "Hulk-like" power, whereby his anger magnifies his strength beyond what seems possible for even Dumbledore to defend against.

Here are some bits from the movies nicely dramatising what I mean:

- Article 1: During the Battle of Hogwarts, the diadem is destroyed. Voldemort feels /something/ and, in his rage, he single-handedly [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV7jTYTK6Us][OBLITERATES]] the protective enchantments erected around the school that hundreds of Death Eaters had been unable to bring down. Stupid-levels of power. If that happened in fanfiction, we'd say the character was overpowered. We've already seen hundreds of Death Eaters being unable to take down those enchantments from the Outside, but when he got angry. He just effin annihilated them. - This is the single most powerful application of magic we ever see in the movies. Cue: "It was at this point, the students knew they fucked up." - One thing I'd forgotten from this scene, which is QUITE SIGNIFICANT - /His power CRACKS the Elder Wand.../

- Article 2: During the Battle of the seven Potters, Harry somehow (?) overpowers Voldemort when the Dark Lord is using Lucius Malfoy's wand and Harry escapes. Voldemort [[https://youtu.be/Dkxx0pKgkN4?t=186][bellows in rage]] and destroys a bunch of stuff for like a half-a-mile around him. Neat little thing to notice - he /isn't holding a wand/ (due to him using Malfoy Sr's and Harry just having broken that). That's just his straight-up hilarious amount of power.

- Article 3: During the Voldemort/Dumbledore duel in the Ministry Atrium, Voldemort [[https://youtu.be/ZMeFnwsxh6s?t=257][screams in rage...again]] and blasts *Dumbledore* off his feet.

Thoughts? I admittedly am quite a fan of "sane" Voldemort stories, where he uses his power and intelligence. But even when Voldemort is... impaired, I would like to see authors truly reflect how absurdly powerful the man is.


** I always thought the cracking of the elder wand was more for dramatic effect on the movie than something that happened in the book. It's probably also due to the incompatibility. I mean he has screamed in rage before and I assume while holding a wand why didn't his power crack the inferior wands (compared to the elder wand) then? He can't have been pleased when he found out what Lucius did to the diary.

*** That's a fair point - and of course the movies do take it far for theatric purposes.

One thing I did notice, when he blasts the magic out against Dumbledore, he doesn't appear to be directly forcing the magic /through/ the wand. He just brings his hands to his chest and explodes them out, the magic follows. This would suggest that when he truly unleashes his power, it is /wandless/.

Likewise, when he is enraged after Harry escapes in the Battle of the seven Potters - it is a wandless explosion of magic.

When he shatters the Hogwarts protections, that's the only time we see him directing his power through the wand. And it cracked.

You could still be correct (i.e. incompatibility being the cause) - but I do like my interpretation haha.

** I don't think many people here consider the HP movies canon (I certainly don't). None of these 3 events happened in the books.

But as it happens, yes, in the books we are explicitly told that splitting the soul in 7 is the most powerful configuration.

**** Dumbledore said it made his soul unstable, but left his mind and magic intact and as powerful as ever. So any /mental/ instability we see in Voldemort's character is just part of who he is, not a product of the horcruxes. The instability caused by the horcruxes is /spiritual/, not mental or magical.

Dumbledore is:

#+begin_quote
  Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?”

  “Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.”
#+end_quote

On top of that, you have stuff like Lockhart continuing to be very egocentric and enjoy signing stuff even after his memory was completely wiped.

All the evidence indicates that a person's soul is immutable in HP - it is their essential character, their "base" personality, and is not altered by experiences or memories. The sole exception seems to be a person who acts out of love, who is capable of making decisions contrary to their own nature and thus undergo real change.

******* He says they "remain intact," not unaffected. And this was in contrast to something "damaged beyond repair." His mind is not broken, nor is his magical power. There's a lot of changes that can happen, both to his advantage and disadvantage, without reaching that state of damage. Dumbledore is mostly just impressing on Harry that Voldemort is still an extremely dangerous enemy.

*** Splitting the soul in 7, or splitting it 7 times? I feel like Voldemort wouldn't be dumb enough to split it in 8 if that put him at a comparative disadvantage.

**** He split it into 8 /accidentally./ He wasn't aware that he turned Harry into a Horcrux. So Voldemort thought that when he turned Nagini into a Horcrux in book 4, that that was splitting his soul into 7 pieces, because he wasn't aware that his soul was /already/ in seven pieces---himself, the diary (destroyed, by that point, but he didn't know that), the ring, the locket, the cup, the diadem, and Harry. That's seven. Nagini makes 8.

** I thought the wand cracking was a signal it was rejecting him? He looked pretty put out about it and it was then he started questioning who actually had the Wand's loyalty.

Movies took a LOT of liberty on some stuff. To make it more dramatic or because it's hard to show some things on the screen compared to in print.

For example in the Duel in the Ministry IIRC Dumbledore was kicking Tom's(AND Bellatrix) ass, and Tom was on the backfoot until he decided to try and possess Harry.

Tom used a powerful shield breaker charm in the books to drop's Hogwart's already battered shields. The DEs spent quite some time hitting them.

Battle of the Seven Potter's had something to do with Harry's wand doing some obscure wandlore stuff(read plot device) and attacking Voldermort on it's on, and overpowering Lucius wand(because the wand wasn't Riddle's). And his AOE blast wasn't in the books IIRC.

IMHO JKR never really thought about consistency in power levels and such, but from what we gathered the Horcruxes didn't do anything to his magical power, it "merely" left his soul(mind?) unstable. Oh, and protected him from the Elder Wand killing him every time he used it.

** You shouldn't take everything shown in the movies to be literal. Movies are meant to be flashy, so they took certain liberties with the source material. In the books, we aren't shown Riddle's powers much, outside of his battle with Dumbledore in OotP. The movies had to correct that somehow, for the casual fan.
