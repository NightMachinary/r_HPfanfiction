I feel like i've read most of the fanfiction for harry potter that are not badly written or a wip, but is there any good and long fanfiction still out there that isn't super well known? Edit: I realized it was super broad, I'm looking for fanfiction that's well written, complete, and over 100k words.


** I mean, that's a super hard question to answer since people's idea of quality differs and fanfic has been around for for probably close to 20 years at this point. But I will recommend the Dangerverse that begins with linkffn(Living with Danger by Whydoyouneedtoknow). It's a little tropey but avoids major pitfalls in my opinion.

**** Harry is rescued from the Dursleys at 2ish and raised by Sirius and Remus and their wives. As the author puts it somewhere else, the bad guys' aims are mostly the same but how Harry, who grew up in a loving family and who has a major support system, reacts is different. Minor bad guys such as Umbridge and Malfoy have longer arcs because the stories begin earlier than in canon. The OC's get fleshed out and have their own arcs interwoven into the larger story. There is a major expansion of the magical world in this universe in the way that was often done before Pottermore and all the interviews JKR gave. Magic is still magical but does have some limits and consequences.

** Okay, so the problem with your request is its so /broad/, I cannot really get narrow that down so easily. Moreover, good fanfiction is really subjective, and will depend on your tastes. So I will limit this by these conditions: over 100k words, older than five years since publication, less commonly recommended, decent or better writing, and nothing obscene or strange. I will also give a wide range of fics with different foci/interests in hopes something sparks your interest:

- linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): ahh nostalgia. This was a pre-OOTP fic that truly tells its own story. I love so much of this fic because its very original and while the writing isn't especially memorable, its written well enough that its unnoticeable. Highly recommend, even incomplete it actually ends with the majority of the major story arcs tied up.
- linkffn(Feathers, Fangs and Flames by Nauro): a bit of a canon-retread, but it honestly is the most balanced depiction of Harry becoming a werewolf that I have encountered in the fandom (for an unbalanced one, look up Were's Harry?). Also, not many fics have a decent Harry/Cho pairing, but this one handles it fairly adroitly.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): and its sequels. These started as a pre-HBP series, but quickly spiraled out into a Harry becomes OP extravaganza that as gripping as it is epic. As a teaser, at one point Harry charbroils a pair of Nundu's to death after fighting them in his animagus form.
- linkffn(Dagger and Rose): one of the few (not to mention good), post-PoA fics out there, basically has Harry being mentored by Dumbledore. Also throws in a Harry/Fleur pairing if thats your thing.

There are more, I am just giving a few examples. You might want to specify though what you're looking for in fanfiction.

** Here are some long fics that Imo are well written. Hopefully there are some in here you haven't read before and will enjoy. :)

My first two recs won't work with the bot, so I'll put them first. They are also old fics and were written before the series was finished! Despite that they hold up really well, and I highly recommend them! [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1]] and [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2681&chapno=1]]

*Shifts* and *Shades* by Fernwithy are Remus/Tonks fics from their POVs and are about what the Order was up to during OotP and HBP. Their summaries are-

#+begin_quote
  During the year of "Order of the Phoenix," Remus Lupin is assigned to protect Dudley Dursley by posing as a teacher at Smeltings.

  With the wizarding world at war, Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin find themselves separated and facing a world with no masks left to hide behind. Alternative point of view of Half-Blood Prince; sequel to Shifts.
#+end_quote

linkao3(1038392) *Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard* is essentially a sequel to Shifts and Shades. It's the first in a four part series about Teddy's time at Hogwarts and the growing pains of the Wizarding World post war. Imo this an excellent series, though heads up its old enough that it doesn't match up with info from Pottermore, so Teddy is in Gryffindor, not Hufflepuff.

linkao3(11083359) *Vera Verto* is about Professor McGonagall post the Battle of Hogwarts as she tries to fix damage to the castle, with romance thrown into the mix.

linkao3(14074770) *In the language of flowers* is an AU where Petunia is a witch and Lily is a muggle. Petunia/Sirius pairing, which works far better than you'd think.

linkao3(7331278) *Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run* is an AU where Harry doesn't find out about magic until he's 17. Harry/Draco

linkao3(20097676) *My Sun Sets to Rise* where Sirius has a preview of other realities after he falls through the Veil. Sirius/Remus

linkao3(373224) *Raindrops on Roses* is a NextGen fic about Albus', Rose's, and Scorpius' time at Hogwarts. Rose/Scorpius.

linkao3(7549384) *Sunshine in My Eyes* is an AU where Minerva raises Petunia and Lily. James/Lily

linkao3(12424344) *Grey Space* is an AU where Hogwarts doesn't start until students are 14.

linkao3(15687453) *proof* is a fic about Harry recovering from the war and baking bread.

linkao3(13912332) *sleeper* is a fic where Harry dreams of a different reality and it starts bleeding into his.

linkao3(6623293) *Realignment* is an AU set while Tom Riddle is at Hogwarts, and a strange man is trying to kill him.

linkffn(12181042) *Order of Mercy* is about the group Fleur, Bill, Percy, and Audrey run during DH to help muggleborns and their families escape from the Ministry.

  It's been eleven years since Harry Potter brought an end to Voldemort; eleven years of peace, eleven years of recovery.But not every wound can be healed. Teddy Lupin is loved and wanted by his family, adored by his grandfather, welcomed in the extended Weasley clan, and happy that he's about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he still feels the loss of his parents and the last lingering traces of the war.As he begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well!

Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  "Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked."Less than a year has passed since the final battle, and the Ministry is already up to its old tricks. Harry would very much like them to stop ignoring due process, tossing people in Azkaban, controlling the press, and menacing the populace with dementors.He would also like, if at all possible, to bake a passable loaf of bread.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
