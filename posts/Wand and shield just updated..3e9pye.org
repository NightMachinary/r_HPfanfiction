*** Morta's Priest here - Fun to see that people care about my fic enough to keep up with it. Hopefully I can get back to a somewhat more stable update schedule going forward. Cheers!

**** I'd like to compliment you on the spirit in the castle twist. The slow realisation of "Oh, shit, is it /him/" was one of my favourite reveals in ff I can recall.

** The description makes it sound a little like a super harry, so before i read this I need to know if my pet peeve is in this story or not.

So, how many Animagus forms does harry have in this story?

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

*** I would call it a Super!Harry story. But it's complicated by the fact that he is the only wizard around, so there's no other wizards in the story to make direct comparisons against. Also, being in the Avenger world, Super!Harry has plenty of opponents that are equal/greater than him.

**** I mean, it is a superhero universe, so I figure that a little 'super' is fairly mandatory. Especially since Harry's basically stepping in for Doctor Strange, and those are spacious boots to fill.

  The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. The soldier and the scientist are not the only lights that push back against the darkness, however; magic will encompass the world again as the last wizard makes himself known.

*** In my defense, I think it would have gone over better had I updated more quickly, since it's a kind of wind-down chapter from the last two - but with the amount of time that passed, its usage was somewhat diminished. It serves as a sort of bridge between Harry's personal little adventure and the one featuring Thor which follows from it, without just jumping from one to the other blindly.

Next one should be back to the neat stuff. ;)

** I just read most of it. It's solid as a crossover, but I find myself not quite so interested in the plot. I don't know, maybe the Marvel movies don't work very well when you're only reading them. The character interactions are nice though (which I find is really important for fanfics) and I enjoyed the start in particular. I found myself burning out slightly last night so I'll probably finish up the last bit of it later today.
