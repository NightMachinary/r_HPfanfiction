:END:
I can't remember if it was time travel or dimension travel (maybe both) but anyways, Hermione gets mad at Ron over something and she lashes out and she somehow enters a door portal in the Ministry and no one knows where she went and everybody thinks she dies but her kneazle somehow got into Draco's house, and from then on, Draco looks for her as he realizes she's not dead but in another world.


** Is it perhaps /Two Things Are Infinite?/ If I'm not mistaken, what you described happens in chapter 34.

#+begin_quote
  AU Time travel fic. Rated M for language and sexual content in later chapters. "That could not be James Potter. It simply could not. And that, that man, pointing his wand at Hermione, with grey eyes and black hair, could not be Sirius Black. Oh, no. This was a hallucination." HG/SB pairing.
