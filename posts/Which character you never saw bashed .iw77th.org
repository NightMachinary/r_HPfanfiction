You don't need to have read the fic, but when you think about it, what was the character that you never saw being bashed, even briefly or in the summary ?

For my part, I'd say Luna. Not even once.

The supply list is like when they used to copy and paste the sorting hat song, unless it's not the same as canon I really dont think they need to paste the complete list and letter. The bank statement one, egh I mean the Overpower harry fics that list the 30 accounts he inheirts the full monetary amount of each vault in each account, the list of artifacts and so on. Even if its plot related its a tsunami of details. And the shopping list, a full wardrobe is a full wardrobe I dont care if they bought 7 robes, four nightshirt 6 pairs of socks, and a dragon shirt and a unicorn shirt etc etc. Telling me the quality of supplies is important, and to be honest some fics are just so well written that it doesn't feel drawn out even if they spend 4 chapters in diagon alley.

Bashing her is often undone, though, because the poor dear is being potioned by one or more Weasleys and/or Dumbledore/Snape to keep her away from Harry or some other reason.

Harry immediately rushes to her and forgives all the things she said because she was potioned and absolutely none of the horrible things she said or did to him weren't really her fault.

- Sprout uses her position to secretly grow some of the most illegal magical plants in the Wizarding World, which she then sells to international crime syndicates.

Sometimes bashed in WBWL!Harry or Slytherin!Harry fics, on the premise that he is "Dumbledore's backup Chosen One". Generally takes two forms: either he is completely inept (even moreso than in canon), or he is somewhat capable, but also prejudiced against Slytherin and/or hostile towards Harry.

tl;dr Anyone can be bashed if you try hard enough.

** I was about to say "Voldemort"... but no, there are fanfics in which he literally destroys the world. Not sure if "bashing" applies in this case, but this *is* worse than what he intended to do in canon.

Never seen Luna bashed as well. She does participate in some despicable acts in Partially Kissed Hero... then again, PKH being what it is, it's not presented as something actually bad (yay for protagonist-centered morality, I guess).

Also rarely seen lesser known Hogwarts professors bashed (Vector, Hooch, Sinistra etc.) At worst, they are presented as evil!Dumbledore's unwitting pawns, sometimes under mind compulsions.

Basically, to avoid bashing, a character has to be either extremely evil already or so minor that there simply isn't any canon material for bashing. Or be Luna.

*** I wouldn't be so sure. "Theodore Nott" for example, is just a name and a few mentions in the canon, but I have seen many fics that use he as a Draco 2.0 (Generally those in which Draco magically is not as spoiled child and bully as in canon).

**** noooo I love Theo! When he's down well he's very different to draco!

I've definitely also seen him portrayed as an evil, rapey death eater though, but I don't know if that would be bashing. I agree that you can't really bash a character that isn't very full in canon

edit to acknowledge that I think I totally misread your comment: You're talking about the rapey death eater ones, aren't you?

anyway I'm gonna log off now because sleep is good lmao
