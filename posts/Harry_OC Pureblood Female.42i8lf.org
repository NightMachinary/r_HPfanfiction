Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi pairs Harry with one of my favorite OCs in fanfiction, Calypso Rosier. Also my personal all-time favorite HP fanfiction.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** As [[/u/Hobbitcraftlol]] said, you can consider Daphne Greengrass an OC so here's linkffn(10649604) a pretty good fic.

Don't be repelled by the title, it is one of the best romance I've ever read in fanfiction.

Besides that, Harry Potter and the BWL is pretty much one of the best writings around, published or not.

I get a bit ragey when umbridge does her thing in any story, and drugging/obliviation are huge rage inducers as well. So I had a real urge to go vigilante on a fictional character every time she appeared, and it wasn't a nice relaxing pastime at that point.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

*** I love this author. Big Harry/Daphne fan actually, and I think it was his stories that did it. The lion tamer trilogy is a little old and he's improved as a writer since then but I loved it when I read it. He used to go by munkeymaniac and he's gotten rid of a few of his older stories, but I'm always following what he's writing, in fact he just started a new story I haven't looked at yet.

And I'll go check his new story to file it for later, I have more than a few story waiting to be read.

P.S.: Did you know that if you mistype "lion" it can become "loin"? I will now view this story in another light.
