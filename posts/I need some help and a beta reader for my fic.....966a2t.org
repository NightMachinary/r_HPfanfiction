** It sounds as if you think you are the one doing the favour here!

Seriously you need to be at least some way into the process and have several fairly polished chapters to share. It's not really fair to ask someone to commit to a project that you might not even finish, especially if it looks like being a long term commitment. You also need to let us know some basic things about your fic. Who are the main characters and premise, what period is it set in, what is the genre, how long is it and so on.

I know not everyone agrees, but personally I think the time to look for a beta is when you have a complete draft ready to go.

*** Im only asking for a email because this project is special to me, and I really wanna know that whoever is going to help me is committed. I can't put this to word- so I'll just say this, I need a Samwise to my Frodo.

About the premise of the fic- its a 4th year AU with an Independent Harry. He is a big time loner. Only one friend in three years at Hogwarts.

Sorted into Ravenclaw. I will write new tasks, and Im doing away with the age line, instead I have something else in my mind. PM me for anymore info that you may want....provided they are not my mother' maiden name, my first pet, the name of my favorite teacher in elementary school, etc. ðŸ˜‰

**** Yep - I freelance on the side and recently dumped a client. The amount of time he spent arguing with me about his 250 word "blog" he could have just written it himself.

** As others have already said, you need to think about the way you're advertising this.

I've been a beta for a couple of very popular authors and offered my help because I already enjoyed their work and thought I could help out.

Things worked very differently too - for one I was looking over one finished chapter per week, polishing grammar, making a few suggestions here and there and generally being a proofreader. For another, it's a totally different process as I tend to receive a few hundred words at a time and then we bounce thoughts and ideas. For two others, I was acting pretty much as a mentor to people without a firm grip on the language or writing in general.

So instead of listing requirements for a beta, you should be telling people what you're trying to do, how you're going about doing it, and how they'll fit in.

Alternatively, publish some chapters, say you're looking for a beta or two, and see who bites.

*** I edited the post.

I have a firm grip on the language but not the writing. I have a basic plot line in my mind. I need someone to throw ideas around with and for proofreading purposes.

Also I'm working on publishing some chapters and waiting to see who will bite as u suggested. Thanks for help. ðŸ˜Š

** Sorry, but this post is just plain rude. Personally, I think the relationship between an author and a beta is pretty important. There needs to be trust and respect. Your post looks like you are doing someone a favour. And what's up with "must be a native speaker"? My beta has a degree in English lit. There is no one better. And she isn't a native speaker.

** One thing you neglected to include in your reddit post would be the type of story you are writing.

What is the pairing? M/F? Hermione/Draco? Harry/GiantSquid?

What is the genre? Angst? Romance? Adventure?

Is it an AU or Canon Compliant?

Do you have a vision (outline) already in place? What sorts of fics do you envision your story being similar to?

In short: What sort of story are you writing? That way potential beta's know whether its something they would be interested in helping with.

** Shayalonnie maintains a list of available beta readers for HP stories. You might have luck there.
