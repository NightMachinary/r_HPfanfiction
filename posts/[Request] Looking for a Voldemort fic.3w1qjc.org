For the last few days, I've been wanting to read a timetravel fic, where Harry goes back in time, probably after the final battle, de-ages a bit, and finds himself in the body of Tom Riddle, and despite himself follows along the same road as good old Tom. Maybe that's more than a 'bit' of de-aging.

Essentially, I am looking for a Harry Potter == Tom Riddle in the literal sense.

*** Thanks, it wasn't quite what I was after, but it was still a good read.
