I think there's this weird effect of the real-life popularity of Pottermore/Buzzfeed-style sorting quizzes. As fans, we place a lot of importance on the sorting hat's descriptions (or stereotypes?) of each of the houses, because the houses are special to us. This can often lead to clunky writing in fan fiction. Writers have easy go-to characterizations for whole swaths of characters; Slytherin kids are devious, cunning, ambitious politicians with Victorian manners and sensibilities. Hufflepuffs are hard-working, loyal underdogs. Ravenclaws are super smart and bookish to the point of being always right. Gryffindors are loud, focused on black-and-white morals, risk-taking, pranksters. However, in canon, while there ARE slimy Slytherins and underdog Hufflepuffs, the kids are primarily just kids, and anyone from any house can have any trait.

​

In writing, "show, not tell" is one of the primary rules to help readers feel like they are immersed in the story and understand your characters. By bringing up house characteristics over and over, fanfic writers often break this immersion.

​

An example of "showing" is in PS where you have Hermione waving her hand in the air every class, at the edge of her seat.

​

An example of "telling" would be saying "Hermione is very eager and smart."

​

An even WORSE example of "telling" that I see all too often is something like "In class, Hermione acted like a Ravenclaw. Why didn't the Sorting Hat put her in Ravenclaw?" This type of remark is... okay... every once in awhile, but it gets old fast and breaks the flow of your story.

​

In canon, adults never discuss which house they were in at school, except in reference to their hopes for their kids or if it's relevant to a specific story (e.g. Molly and Arthur sneaking back through the portrait hole after making out on the grounds). In fanon, they are often all but obsessed with houses. In canon, it is extremely rare for someone to evaluate someone's traits (e.g. in CoS, Harry is a parselmouth, he starts to worry he should be in Slytherin) and conclude that they are in the right/wrong house. For example, no one is ever like, "Percy, you are so ambitious you should be a Slytherin." Nope. They're like "Percy, you're a prat." MUCH more realistic writing.

​

In canon, the houses mainly serve as a sports rivalry and a place for characters to socialize (you have the main character house, the side character houses, and the antagonist house). Inter-house friendships are never penalized. No one is ever like "OMG Cho, I can't believe you'd go out with a Gryffindor!" they tease her about Harry specifically.

​

Anyway, my point is that you don't need to point out that your characters are acting "so Gryffindor" or "so Slytherin" all the time. It's not enjoyable to read.


** I completely feel the same way. In canon, the only real characteristic that people repeatedly felt was either enforced or engendered by the House you were Sorted into was that Dark wizards came from Slytherin. That's what's driven home, over and over. Harry questioning his placement in Gryffindor is purely because he heard Parselmouth is connected with Voldemort and Salazar Slytherin himself.

Plus, it seems like half the characters defy their House's stereotype in some way. Crabbe and Goyle aren't very ambitious (until the Fiendfyre thing), Cedric is the perfect student, Hermione's the smartest, Justin spreads rumors, Pettigrew is a coward, etc.

*** Yeah, I guess my point is that people are complicated and if we write fanfic where the characters are basically defined by their house traits it gets boring pretty fast. And if you point out every time a character exemplifies another house's traits, that gets annoying pretty fast too.

** I always wish people portrayed BOTH extremes of each house and everything in between instead of just hammering the obvious.

Gryffindors ranging from Selflessly Brave to Foolishly Brash. Hufflepuffs from Unwaveringly Loyal to Obnoxiously Naive/Fanatic Ravenclaws from Curiously Intelligent to Selfishly Nosy Slytherins from Endlessly Cunning to Treacherously Greedy.

And not just that, but a combination of traits with one of them being dominant.

Instead we usually get 11 year old "politicians" in Slyherin, know-it-all Ravenclaws and so on. People make the houses needlessly one dimensional, J.K Rowling is guilty of it too.

** I don't enjoy traits being used as an identifier for the House right from the start. Because (if am not mistaken) you are sorted according to your values and preferences more than anything else. Hermione WANTED to be in Gryffindor. Neville VALUED courage. Neither was necessarily a representation of the House traits in the beginning. The House just provides an environment where those traits have a higher likelihood of being cultured.

So I think Houses are important. The sorting prophecizes the future character of a person with high reliability: you either posses already, want to poses or unwilling and unknowingly develop under the influence of peers certain qualities. Are there exceptions? Sure. Is House affiliation predicative of the kind of person you are? Yes, to a certain degree (allowing for changes that people undergo during lifetimes).

This is true, but to say that Houses are irrelevant is also wrong.

I think that the rivalry with the Slytherins and the overall dislike for them is not because they are Slytherins in a vacuum, but because with the exception of Pettigrew, all Death Eaters we know were Slytherins. You have people like Malfoy pulling shit without other Slytherins stepping in, Snape is an atrocious, bigoted teacher who abuses his power and later on half of Harry's year in Slytherin is at least sympathetic towards Voldemort. Most Slytherins are horrible people, with Andromeda as the only exception that we know of.

And since most people don't bother with fine distinctions, they'd say that Slytherin is evil and avoid them. The relationship between the other houses might be more akin to sports rivalries (there would still be gossip, banter and some jabs), but due to the War(s), Slytherin will be isolated and avoided by most students.

*** You're right, I should have clarified that houses aren't important--except Slytherin has a bad rap (kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy if nice people are all "not Slytherin!" to the hat, based on the reputation they hear).

There are other "good" Slytherins--Regulus and Snape both sacrificed their life to defeat Voldemort. And Slughorn is such an interesting character who has his follies but could not be called "evil" by most definitions.

Kids, realistically, are gonna be loyal to their friend group and not want to be outcasts. Dumbledore rewards Neville for standing up to his friends because it's so unusual and brave. Nobody in Gryffindor stopped the Weasley twins from giving Montague a brain injury, and that's worse than anything Malfoy managed to pull off. The Hufflepuffs all groupthink their way into hating Harry during CoS and GoF. Not like being cliquish is an exclusively Slytherin thing.

**** I prefer not to begin these kinds of debates, but I just can't walk by.

We know next to nothing about Regulus. Saying that he is "good" is completely unjustified. From the little we know, we can deduce that he wasn't standing up for or supporting his brother since leaving him alone with their family wasn't a problem for Sirius, and Regulus was well liked by his parents. We do know that he didn't have much trouble fitting into a house where most people (at that time) supported or at least didn't mind a cultured but half-insane even then maniac planning to massacre and/or reduce to sub-human half the magical population. He also willingly served that maniac (for a time at least). And we know little about his actual motivations for trying to destroy the "very valuable thing to Voldemort" aka Horcrux. For all we know, he could have done out of spite or because he cared about his house elf. There's nothing in his final letter to Voldemort that would indicate disapproval of his goals or motives, only that "I [Regulus] face death in the hope that when you [Voldi] meet your match, you will be mortal again". No motive, only desire to see his opponent dead. No motive, no character judgement.

​

Same with Snape: there's no indication whatsoever that he did any of the "brave" or "good" things he did for anything other than selfish reasons such as to relieve guilt, self-preservation and keeping his word (aka stroking his pride as much as acting according to honor, depending on how you look at it).

​

I am not saying they were "bad". I am just saying that we can hardly discern they were "good". On a larger scale, I can't remember any Slytherin who is not acting according to selfish reasons (which is not a bad thing!). And as I view it, characteristics such as cunning, ruthlessness, or some such associated with the house stem from that (in varying degrees in different people, of course). And since historically people connotate "selfish" with "evil" Slytherin reputation is justified if unfair.

Also, my canon knowledge is rusty so I am probably wrong somewhere in this comment. Please, feel free to correct me.

***** AFAIK, your canon statements are correct, I really like the thorough summary. I'd actually never considered Regulus's possible motives before.

I guess you could have moral philosophy debates all day about what "good" and "bad" here. The split between the consequences of your actions and the intentions behind them is one of the oldest debates in philosophy and I'm not about to solve it here. In my naming of Snape, Slughorn, and Regulus, I basically meant people who had taken action against Voldemort, regardless of intention. Other "good" actions by Slytherins are unknown because they weren't germane to the plot of the books. That's something fanfic has been great at delving into, expanding characters like Millicent Bulstrode, Adrian Pucey, Daphne and Astoria Greengrass, etc.

I totally agree with you about Snape as a teacher, but honestly I blame Dumbledore more. Why didn't he do anything to stop Snape from abusing his power again? Also, choosing Snape as a Head of Slytherin was a terrible idea since he was obviously a bad role model.

The radicalization of Slytherin was at least partially Dumbledore's fault tbh.

Just think about it, even if one Slytherin was not sympathetic to Voldemort, they would still be stuck in a House full of aspiring Death Eaters and a Head of House that was supposedly a Death Eater too. The Slytherins essentially had 0 positive role models inside the House.

***** Hmmm, let's see.

Maybe, just maybe you're getting down voted because you're suggesting it's okay to cause long-term damage to a classmate for no reason.

Montague once fouled Katie Bell, maybe this makes him a bit of an asshole but it's not a good justification.

He recruited Crabbe and Goyle as Beaters. Probably a questionable move but still, no justification.

He joined the Inquisitorial Squad. Okay, I can see where you're going here but keep in mind that he was shoved into the cabinet just after joining the Squad. He effectively did nothing to "aid a tyrannical rule". Whatever the Squad may or may not have done later has nothing to do with him. It certainly does not justify Fred and George scrambling his brain so badly that he was still in hospital 2 months later.

The only reason you think this is okay is because "hurr durr Slytherin evil". You quite effectively demonstrated what's wrong with the Hogwarts House system.

****** No, my justification is not Slytherin is evil. His House Status is irrelevant, and in my eyes, Marietta would be an equally valid target after she betrayed the DA.

The argument is that Montague joined the woman who was torturing children for no apparent reason. A woman who sent Dementors after what can be considered a whistleblower in an assassination attempt in a small town. That's the kind of shit Russia gets its economy fucked over. It was very clear what kind of values Umbridge stood for. It was clear that she was sabotating the education of all students (other than maybe sacking Trelawney) and that she was helping Voldemort.

He was helping a woman who helped to get innocents killed through her "academic reforms", and that's not even mentioning the Muggleborn registration shit she would end up doing two years later.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEvyEM0JdSc][Here is what collaborators got in France after the war]]. And Umbridge was basically using the Third Reich as a masterplan for most of her acts, so the comparison is valid.

And if you think that Montagues injuries were bad and Fred&George were out of line, what do you say about Malfoy's attack on Katie, who had similar consequences (but was actually more than one war crime)?

He effectively joined some sort of super-charged prefect group. I'm sure he knew this group was being given unfair privileges, and he might have just not cared that he was being a dickhead by abusing the system.

This does not provide a justification for his classmates to attack him, with the consequences being potentially permanent brain damage. You can disagree with me all you want, but this right here is why people are down voting you.

No, I explicitly said that "and that's not even mentioning the Muggleborn registration shit she would end up doing two years later."

Montague knew Voldemort was back. Malfoy was bragging about it, Diggory was dead and the press was suddenly running a character assassination on Harry and Dumbledore after they proclaimed Voldemort's return. Harry had given his interview. The information was there.

People would have known about the torturous detentions. That's a rumour you cannot keep quiet. The whole DA would have seen the scars during their meetings. And I doubt that Harry and Lee were the only victims.

And the sabotage of an entire generation through substandard education is another matter which he would have known of. Which is a direct collaboration with Voldemort's goals.

** Hogwarts doesn't have majors or clubs or frats, so the houses seem to take on the importance of those other social structures.

I always assumed they were based on the collegic residential college system, and not anything seriously used in a primary boarding school setting. Part of the whimsey of having more 'adult' structures in a wizarding school.

My experience with the California flavor of residential colleges is they mattered for naught but where you rested your head for the first year. Major and Department/School (major groupings, usually correlated to buildings) were much more important. As we're social clubs/sports. (Frats were banned, but I would imagine they would have been much the same). I would assume it is the same at the Universities the system was based on.

In fact, I would say having residential colleges that group by scholarly interest intensified those other scholarly (major/department) social ties more than being a thing themselves

** In the long run? Yeah, I agree!

But in the short term (at school and immediately after school!)?

Yes, they are!

Why?

Simple:

You have the closest ties to your housemates! You might have some acquaintances in the other houses, but real friendships seem rare! (People were astonished about Lily and Snape for example!)

So for a Slytherin it would be great to call up some of his former housemates once he/she leaves school to help them find a job and the same goes for the other houses!

Still, after a few years that is probably where the usefullness of your house-ties becomes questionable, you probably will ask others regularly what house they were in (to learn if you knew them at school) but you will probably stop discriminating very very soon!

ps: Slytherins might get the most use out of their house-ties, because a lot of rich and well connected people seem to end up there and they probably help their own (especially since Slytherin really is discriminated against in Hogwarts, they aren't treated fairly - look at how Dumbledore ended first year, with the house cup!)! The other houses will probably end up falling back on house-ties far less than Slytherins!
