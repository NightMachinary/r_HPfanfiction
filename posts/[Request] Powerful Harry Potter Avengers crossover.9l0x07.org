Is there a powerful Harry Potter/Avengers crossover that starts similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/7/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] (Fury notices someone powerful and attempts to force him to join shield.) Except when they finally meet after Fury watching/following Harry Harry doesn't join SHIELD?


** Um, the closest I can remember is one where Harry is a bar tender and Cap is his friend. But eventually he and Fury make a deal or something.

** Have you read linkffn(Heroes Assemble)? It doesn't quite tick all of your boxes (Fury's not antagonistic to Harry, who in turn is pretty happy to help out the Avengers) but it's the only other big-name "adult Harry meets the Avengers" fic I can think of right now.

*** I'll give it a read but the main "box" I want is Harry doesn't immediately join or agree to help. I've read a few like that and a lot of the time it's Fury watching him just cause he's an "unknown" and as soon as they meet everything Fury has done is more or less frogetton.

**** Heroes Assembled starts off well (I like Harry and Hermione's interactions, reminded me of my best friend and I) but once the invasion happened in kinda got bored and didn't continue (the way the Avengers figure out who helped them in the battle was pretty dumb, and the trial Harry is is equally dumb). Definitely not bad from what I recall, but definitely could have been made more believable from the parts I did read.

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

**** I don't remember quite well but it'll be quite some time. If you like the Marvel Universe (not only MCU) it's perfect as there isn't just only the Avengers. If you're still with the F4 know that you'll see the X-Men and Strange before even getting to the Avengers. It's not really a focus on the Avengers btw but they'll be there.

And clearly Harry and Fury won't trust each other that easily for all the known reasons.

I remember of an other story where Harry joins the Avengers but not immediately and yet another where he isn't really part of it but more like a consultant maybe. I'll try to find it back and I'll put it here.

** Linkffn(12893852) Self-promoting here. It's a Fem Harry story though, and idk if you're into that. But otherwise, Fury and Jessamine (Fem Harry) are fairly antagonistic towards each other though they haven't technically met yet. They know of each other, and they're currently playing a sort of cat and mouse game and are constantly trying to one-up each other.

EDIT: Fury sees Jessamine as a threat more than a potential ally, so he is somewhat more hostile towards her, rather than trying to sway her to joining the Avengers.

**** With life picking up, I'm currently going to update maybe once a month tops; I'm hoping to update a bit more frequently once everything calms down. But I do have a pretty inconsistent update schedule in general, as I'm writing this fic as I go. The next chapter should be up soon as it's 2/3 done.

Very feminine. With her characterisation, she's almost like a femme fatale, except she's obviously the protagonist of the story.

****** Um... I feel awkward doing this especially since you don't tend to read female Harry but I have a female!Harry/Avengers crossover as well. In the story Harriet is Loki's daughter and the Goddess of Fate. As goddess of fate she gets seer abilities and her Jotunn heritage is explored as well though Harriet spends most of her life believing she human and not knowing of her true parentage.

The Fates arranged for Loki to meet Lilly so that this would happen so it isn't just an arbitrary thing that he fathered her. The Fates are actively meddling to get the results and future they want. I went with Female Harry because it seemed like a good way of showcasing the contrasts from canon that the fates would produce. All changes from Harry to Harriet are done with consideration and purpose so it isn't just a fic that gets rid of Harry to insert a new character.

Part One will focus on the consequences after Voldemort uses a Harriet's blood to bring himself back (GoF) with Voldemort turning from an enemy to an ally while providing world building and background. Currently part one is looking to be about 15 chapters long. After that there will be a time skip to 2012 and the events of the first Avengers movie. Harriet is not going to be a fan of Fury but I won't say more unless I'm asked to spoil. I have plot mostly worked out till Thor 2 and some idea of where I want it to go after.

At the moment I am posting whenever I have a new chapter ready on AO3 because it's the site I'm more comfortable with and I enjoy using the comment section there to ask for feedback and to get opinions when I'm planning out things in the next couple chapters. On [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] I am posting my backlog of chapters with a Tuesday and Friday schedule planned. My hope is that with my writing new chapters while that is happening the [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] crowd will get a more regular updating schedule. For those who can't wait, there is AO3 where there are 7 chapters posted now and 8 is looking like it will by coming tomorrow. I have 13 chapters written, but I decided to expand one section so I'm adding new chapters in. Once I am past the new chapters I'll be able to move on more quickly for a bit.

If you have questions about the fic that you would like answered before investing your time I'm happy to answer them.

******** Alright then so Spoilers ahead for my fic.

The Fates know Thanos and Hela are out there and even if they weren't earth will be drawing attention soon from threats they can't handle. While Earth is a small part of a vast whole Harriet is still young, not yet grown into her full potential, and will be living on earth. So once she is born they start messing with earth as best they can to get it strong and to have Harriet in a place of power when the trouble comes. By the time 2012 comes around Harriet is 31 about to turn 32. She is a member of the world security council representing the IWCs interests. When Loki comes to earth and the magical world isn't immediately alerted its the opportunity she's been waiting for to step in and give Fury a bit of a telling off as well as a reminder that protecting the world isn't his job. His job is much more specific with guidelines and restrictions the same as hers. If they all work as they should things would be fine but when someone takes on a burden they can't handle they get gods killing people and running loose while trying to invade earth. Turns out that Harriet has spies in shield and has known they had the tesseract for months. She didn't do anything though as she was testing to see if Fury ever intended to let the IWC know as it was their jurisdiction under agreement with the muggle governments who are meant to police fury. When things are done she basically tells fury "You have your own jungle gym so stay out of my sandbox or at least learn to share."

I have no idea if I've said too much or not enough but I felt you needed the extra information to understand the relationship. While Fury does know about magic he hasn't seen much first hand. Once he sees them in action he wants them on his team. After all this was a man who recruited the hulk which was believed to be a basically uncontrollable monster at the time. So taking on plan old humans who have magic and can wave wands. That doesn't seem so insane to him. So he'll want witches and wizards and because she's the best he's seen he'll want Harriet but Harriet isn't for sale or to be manipulated.

Your writing is good. Not many grammar issues, interesting and easy to follow, and you don't seem to fall into common traps of fanfiction authors. Really, the only thing I noticed was the occasional spelling mistake, and that's pretty minor.

I'm not usually a fan of "good" Voldemort, but I think you've done his characterisation well. The obsession is a bit hand-wavy but makes some sense in this AU context (hey, fates/magic!).

It's also quite the cliffhanger you've left!

** Alright. I admit I like a powerful Harry just as much as everyone else, but I always found it disturbingly stupid of him to "join" the Avengers. A powerful Harry, especially those that often are portrayed as the "I have suffered so much, and yet I still remain human"-Antihero wannabe, - I just don't get why he would join the Avengers, no matter how reluctantly. I always thought such a Harry would flick them the finger. - And if they decided he was a threat because they could not control him - which is an often used excuse for a plot in Avenger Fics - they would annoy him until he joins. -

Are there no fics in which Harry tells Fury to fuck off and makes an example of what would happen if they don't leave him well enough alone?

​

I mean yeah, there was this one Oneshot where Fury abducts Teddy (who still is a child at that time? lol.) and Harry goes all Master of Death-Badass and crucios Fury until he has Teddy back. But that's it.
