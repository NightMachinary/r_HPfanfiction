Looking for a fanfic to read

Was wondering if anyone had any good Harry/Ginny romance fanfics that stay relatively close to canon and are a decent length. Most of the ones I find are either really short, completely ignore the canon, or are horribly written. If u do pls link below. Thanks


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half-blood Prince]] should be exactly what you're looking for, as it's totally canon compliant.
