im not alone in this right?......right?

just clarifying things. this isnt about hating slash fics or things like that. more of improving the filter/search system that FFN has. .......though mpreg still creeps me out............


** It's not possible. The majority of fics were written before the pairing option was introduced and even for the ones that do mark pairing, it's not a guarantee. fem!Harry and other genderbending can cause the orientation to change from what the pairing would suggest.

*** It's not about that. When I'm reading a story and I get immersed, it's usually by identifying with the character. When that character breaks too far with what I would do (even in a fantasy), it breaks immersion, making me frustrated. So I abandon the story in anger.

The main thing that causes this for me is when a story goes into BDSM lifestyle without a warning. I can handle a lot of things happening in the (metaphorical) bedroom, but the protagonist suddenly becoming submissive in everything breaks all immersion for me.

I don't have issues with other characters than the protagonist engaging in things I don't like in general, I don't even mind it being described in detail. Main character slash and BDSM-lifestyle are two of the main things that really bug me though, Unless the main character isn't the one I identify with, but that's a bit rare. (although in canon it was the case, I identified with Hermione there)

**** Well, I guess that's cool. But my point is kinda that... non-straight people generally are able to get along with and identify okay with straight characters due to the nature of most media featuring them.

Now, I personally believe, given that, the main reason people find depcitions of slash or same-sex characters or relationships difficult to deal with is from a lack of experience reading about them - they're 'weird' or uncomfortable because they're unfamiliar.

I think if people had more exposure /to/ these kinds of relationships, they wouldn't find them so weird - which is why I'd be against people sticking in their 'comfort zone' and staying away from slash or femslash on principle.

I don't think it should be the case that straight people feel they can only identify with straight characters because of something 'innate' - for me, that's dangerously close to the idea that persists in a lot of children's fiction, that a book or tv show starring a girl should be aimed at girls, but one starring a boy can be aimed at 'everyone'.

I'd like to see more straight people reading fiction featuring gay characters who aren't suspiciously celibate or not interested in romance, really.

***** Excuse me, what? The gay parade called, they want their card back. No one needs to have to read about shit they don't want to. It's kind of a basic human right, which is one of the basic tenants of the "gay movement."

And don't even start shit with me, I been marching in parades since 1996.

No one should be forced to read something they are uncomfortable with, period. Extra "exposure" does not make someone more comfortable with it...my grandmother's father was in SS and a POW of the Russians the entirety of WW2. She was RAISED to believe anything other than The German People was below her. When I brought my lesbian wife home she was just...'so you have cats together? ok....let me teach her to bake.' Anecdotal and irrelevant but you're claiming people NEED to be exposed to slash and I'm telling you right now, they don't. No one needs to read slash unless they are INTO slash.

****** I'm not claiming people need to read slash, I'm suggesting that straight people avidly distancing themselves from representations of same-sex relationships just because they feature two characters of the same sex, without even trying to just read past that, perhaps isn't ideal.

It's hard to tell at this point whether exposure to different things makes people react differently to them because frankly, the majority of media lets people stay in their comfort zones. What I would say though is that the current younger generations and people in general nowadays are the most open-minded towards LGBT issues of any people ever, which is why we see things like same-sex marriage being passed.

Now I don't know about you, but I'd say increased visibility of gay people in media and in real life over the last 20 or 30 years has been a big factor in people becoming more accepting and seeing that we aren't so different.

And with such things I tended to identify with someone more like me, instead of the main character. The problem isn't in the orientation of the character, it's in the mis-match that's only revealed /after/ I've started identifying with the character.

For example the House of Night series, I loved the first book, but in the second book the character did something so utterly stupid that it completely broke with my view of the character, and I stopped reading. I have plans to try and finish at least the second book, since the series came well recommended, but I can't see it happening anytime soon.

Or if you want something romantic that isn't about orientation: I didn't finish reading book 6 of Harry Potter until after book 7 had come out because the character I identified with (Hermione) had a crush that I still consider completely unrealistic. When I did finally read both books (and I've only read them once to this day, unlike the rest of the series) I did it because I wanted the story concluded, and I made up my own side character to make it tolerable. That break of immersion also was the sole reason I got into reading fanfiction.

The only reason slash gets singled-out like in this thread is because it's one of the more common things that completely break immersion that aren't always clear up front.
