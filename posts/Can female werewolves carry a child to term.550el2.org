Do you think a mother of father would be more likely to pass on the curse?


** Yes. No. Doesn't happen, UNLESS both are in werewolf form and they bang and she's fertile and is impregnated then she'll birth wolves that are very intelligent but not werewolves. This is canon.

But you can write whatever you want for fanon.

#+begin_quote
  Werewolves generally reproduce by attacking non-werewolves. The stigma surrounding werewolves has been so extreme for centuries that very few have married and had children. However, where werewolves have married human partners, there has been no sign of their lycanthropy being passed to their offspring.

  One curious feature of the condition is that if two werewolves meet and mate at the full moon (a highly unlikely contingency which is known to have occurred only twice) the result of the mating will be wolf cubs which resemble true wolves in everything except their abnormally high intelligence. They are not more aggressive than normal wolves and do not single out humans for attack. Such a litter was once set free, under conditions of extreme secrecy, in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts, with the kind permission of Albus Dumbledore. The cubs grew into beautiful and unusually intelligent wolves and some of them live there still, which has given rise to the stories about â€˜werewolves' in the Forest -- stories none of the teachers, or the gamekeeper, has done much to dispel because keeping students out of the Forest is, in their view, highly desirable.

** I think a female werewolves would be very likely to miscarriage on the full moon when her body shifts into wolf form.

but if the baby comes to term by surviving 7-8 full moons well I haven't thought about it because the odd of the baby making it to term are astronomical

I definitely think female werewolves have it worse Then male ones, especially if they are turned as children like Lupin was.
