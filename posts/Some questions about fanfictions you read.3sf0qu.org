1. What was your first fanfiction you thought was good and what is yout opinion of it now?
2. What was your first fanfiction archive/forum/etc. you used?
3. What was the first fandom whose fanfictions you read? And do you still visit it regularily?


** 1. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] - some of it is still fun, but upon re-reading it I realized that the Sue was strong in that one. Still enjoyable though, which proves that an overpowered main character doesn't automatically make for a bad story.

2. Literotica - I hadn't realized people wrote fanfiction until I saw and read through a Jayne/River smutfic. The author had a note about not being able to post the story to fanfiction.net due to rating.

3. Firefly (should be obvious at this point). There weren't many stories for it, less that were readable and even fewer that had a meaningful plot. Since falling into the Potterverse abyss I haven't really ventured back out.

** For me it was a german fanfic whose name I forgot and messed up it's commas so badly it's unreadable. Back then I thought it was good.

My first one was animexx.de/fanfiction but I don't visit it anymore.

It was the digimon fandom. I, however, don't read them anymore (except for crossovers)

** 1)First was some Remus/Tonks piece that won some sort of award over at HPFF. 2009ish, so it probably wouldn't be too hard to find it again. I don't think I even finished the fic, since the pairing didn't really attract me. I'm pretty sure I just typed in "Harry Potter Fan Fiction" into google and that was the site I picked, and I just read the first story I saw on the front page.\\
2) I used HPFF and FFN in equal doses at first. Probably more of HPFF if I'm honest, but I quickly ran out of interesting stories on HPFF and was frustrated by the awful search engine (which still sucks, 6-7 years later).\\
3) only HP. Occassionally read pure fics from other fandoms (DF, SVM, GoT) but bad writing and plotting plagues every fandom.

The Seventh Horcrux. Orgasmic then, as a huge fan who hated Deathly Hallows, decent now.

The first one I read that I found on my own was 30 Seconds That Changed Everything. Couldn't get enough back then (read everything by the author) Awfullllll now

** 1. CC's Draco Trilogy. It was the first fic I ever read and I thought it was /~totally amazing!~/ I reread it for the first time a couple of years ago and while I didn't hate it, it bored me and I had to force myself to finish it.

2. Fictionalley Park.

3. Harry Potter, and my presence here is answer enough to the rest of that question.

** 1. My first intro to internet fandom was Lord of the Rings, on the pervy hobbit-fancier side of things. There were several good writers posting at the time, and I still remember CaraLoup's and Semyaza's fic. Very accomplished, atmospheric writers of beautiful and sometimes droll stories.

But HP is the fandom which persuaded me to stop lurking and get involved. I converted to Snape/Harry in a flash of light. Or Dark. Or a combination thereof. The earliest fics I can remember reading are Atrata's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/13439][In Between Days]], Mairead Triste and Aristide's [[http://inkstain.inkquill.net/isf/archive/21/achoriambic.html][A Choriambic Progression]], and Caligryphy's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2712814/1/So-Lonely-Without-Me][So Lonely Without Me]]. They remain among my favorite fics for my OTP. I suspect I still unconsciously measure most current Snape/Harry stories against In Between Days (and find them wanting, alas).

1. I don't remember, but it's probably a tie among The Snarry Reader, Walking the Plank (a Snarry archive), and [[http://notquiteroyal.net/switchknife/index2.htm][switchknife's recs]].

2. That would be Lord of the Rings, and I rarely visit anymore unless someone has asked for recs and I'm tracking down a link. I read in a handful of other fandoms, but HP is my One True Fandom, although my community is slowly evaporating because the energy dispersed after canon closed and many people left.

** 1. I remember liking [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/288212/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Psychic-Serpent][HP and The Psychic Serpent]]. I haven't read it in years but the sequel ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/699701/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Time-of-Good-Intentions][HP and the Time of Good Intentions]]) blew my mind at the time, an AU inside another AU!
2. ff.net
3. Card Captor Sakura. It was my connection to the nerdy world of fanfiction. That fandom is more than dead though.

** linkffn(The Dead, the Broken, and the Living by Kitsune Heart), haven't read it in years so can't really give a proper account of how it's held up. I really loved it at the time, and it was a really interesting premise.

FanFiction.net

Artemis Fowl. I didn't have one of the books, but I found a odd version online. After that I found ff.net and that's how this addiction began. Haven't visited in years, might have to check it out though.

** 1. My first fanfiction that I really enjoyed was probably the series of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Bet/30722/99/0/1/][The Bet]] fics by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5209/metroanime][Gregg Sharp]] and it was also something I thought was good. I still occasionally re-read some of my favorites, so it stands the test of time, but there is also some admitted nostalgia that makes up for a time when quality of fanfiction writing was much more obviously amateur-ish.

2. I used the [[http://webpages.csus.edu/%7Eseifertv/ffml/ffml-faq.txt][FFML]] after discovering fanfiction, and then used the assorted archives that occasionally spawned from or linked from there, such as RAAC and assorted fandom/universe-specific pages.

3. My first fandom (only by a matter of days) that I read in was Ranma 1/2, but my discovery of fanfiction also rapidly led me into the Buffy and Stargate fandoms (unfortunately the latter of the two was a huge disappointment). I still read Buffy fics pretty regularly (rather glad the fandom is still alive over a decade after the show ended) and read the occasional updated (or more rarely, new one that is actually good) Ranma fic, though that fandom has died down a lot, and never really consolidated very strongly on FFN or the other large archives as others have, remaining a loosely-connected network of many sites and hosts.

** 1) Some unfinished Code Geass fanfiction with a bunch of favorites, it's a timetravel fanfiction and since there's SO many of them I can't remember which one it was now. Like 15% to 30% it timetravel fanfictions.

2) fanfiction.net

2) Detective Conan, I came by it literally by accident (Like the way i came upon that series) when i read the DC wiki and saw the read more page and randomly clicked the link to ffn. I don't read it anymore because all DC fanfiction sucks SO bad unless you like cheesy arguably pedophile male on male Detective/Thief relationships. (Only exception is this oneshot linkffn(6402346/1/It-s-Raining-Men-Hallelujah))

I remember Quizilla

Up until about a year ago, I never read fic. The Naruto one was a one-off; I just got engrossed in that story. I really only started thinking of myself as reading fic. for HP, and that's the major fandom I read for. Mostly/entirely Severus-centric.

** 1) linkffn The Hogshead by MyGinevra

- A good fic, H/G post Hogwarts, I wanted more of a relationship between the two and I got it. My penname is taken partly from the author of that fic.
- I think it is still a good fic and recommend to anyone who asks, especially people who have read my own fanfiction.

B. Sink Into Your Eyes (was where I found the above), followed by Portkey (where I realized Hermione was much better for Harry, but I was still in love with Ginny too..) then Ficwad (my first threesome fics) and then I found LiraSnape's List of Lists and read the entire thing regardless of where it was posted (a lot of Live Journal) and my home now is FFN even though I like the less restricted mature fanfics elsewhere.

▲. Harry Potter, followed by Buffy The Vampire Slayer, which led me to Twisting The Hellmouth, which has crossovers with everything.. mostly Stargate, Marvel, DC, HP, Buffy... oh and Naruto! One Piece is really only.. one or two stories that are good. Mostly HP and Naruto with Buffy thrown in when I'm bored, and crossovers for everything.

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/804710/1/Terrifi%C3%A9][Terrifie]] - I thought it was edgy and romantic, but I was 12 or 13. Reread recently and it's pretty OOC, with an odd plot and lots of misspellings.

2. FFN - can't really remember how I originally found it though!

3. Pirates of the Caribbean! I specifically read a very long fic that seemed to consist mostly of Will and Elizabeth having sex in a cabin on a ship. Haven't visited it in probably 10 years.

** Oh god, I have no idea what I read first. I started reading every day over two years ago and I've never stopped.

No, wait. I can't believe I remember, but looking at the HP top favorites on ffn jogged my mind. It was linkffn(Pet Project by Caeria). I think it was linked on a site I was visiting, and I said what the hell.

Now I'm addicted to fanfiction. That's what the hell.

It was certainly a well written fic, but I do wonder at my past self for reading and liking a HrSS fic. He's a good character, but please don't romanticise him. In canon he's a petty, vindictive bastard with a two decade long grudge. His obsession for Lily does not redeem him as much as JKR might wish. My opinion, at least.

FFN was the first place I've been and my favorite to this day, and HP was clearly my first fandom, but I've been all over the board, especially with crossovers.

** 1. "Pax Americana" A German Stargate FF which nicely wraps up the universe in a spectacular way after the end of SG1 and SGA. There might be a English translation. If you speak German and like Stargate, I strongly suggest reading it! It's available at the stargate-project.de forum, I believe.

2. fanfiction.de, basically a German ff.net rip-off. At some point I had read all worthwhile FFs in my at-the-time fandoms and checked out ff.net, which was about a dozen orders of magnitude better in quality and quantity!

3. Stargate, and seldom. I feel like I have read all the good ones, and only Sam/Jack John/Rodney smut fics are what remain.
