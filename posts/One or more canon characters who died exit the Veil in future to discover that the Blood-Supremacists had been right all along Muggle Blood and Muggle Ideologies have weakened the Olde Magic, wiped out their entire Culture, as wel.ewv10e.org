*** Not at all, friend.

There is a /fine line/ between Pureblood Supremacy and Extremist Isolationism. One might firmly believe and laud to the rafters that the blood of Olde families is inherently stronger than the blood of Muggleborns; BUT that one does not necessarily HAVE to also be either actively participating in, overtly encouraging, or covertly condoning the spilling of the blood of innocent people. Even racial bigots have no obligation to be both. There is a difference between shoring up one's defenses in an invasion, and screaming "KILL THEM ALL" and purging the entire world of Muggles and Muggleborns. I am nowhere /near/ 'condoning' Genocide.

The idea here is that the Supremacists' ultimate fear of being overcome by Muggleborns and their Muggle ideas has turned out to be a legitimate one. The Hermione Grangers of the world looked on at magical culture, neither liked it nor tried to understand it, and decided to change it... which turned out to be a horrible mistake with horrible consequences. The Muggleborns swarmed in and took over a society they did not truly understand the purposes for. They overran the Olde families and filtered out the Olde blood /entirely/. The idea is that while Muggleborns have immense magical potential and can possess incredible raw strength, it is not truly as strong, in the long run, as the blood of magic that has been finely honed for generations. Thus, the more Muggleborns who married in, the stronger their children /looked/, but the more diluted that blood and magic became down the line.

The underlying ideas that I had but did not include up top (so that people are not bogged down by all of MY ideas) is that the Olde families had the magical strength to sustain the natural world. Their traditions and celebrations and even their outdated mannerisms pleased and sated the spirits and creatures of the world and kept the natural order in balance. With all of these aspects getting punted to the trash bin by people who enter in and think that they know better - (because, hey: they're not bigots and are, therefore, inherently better and should be listened to because they know, according to their own outsider standards, what is ultimately /best/ for /everyone/ =P ) - the balance has been undone and nature itself (along with all dwelling within it) is completely out of control.

My idea is that the Muggleborns' 'modernization movement' of magical societies purged a necessary factor from the world. That their less-than sober (that is, their blase) undertaking of modernising and Muggle-izing magical families and communities actually /endangered/ magical society because of people deciding to 'hide in plain sight'. They lowered their guards among Muggles and amid Muggle civilizations because "We're all human, aren't we?" and "There's no need to be so darn paranoid" and "It's not like anything will actually happen. This is the XXth century, for goodness' sake!". The idea is that they did not take this matter of adhering to certain rules for their own safety as seriously as they ought to have, and routinely broke the Statute of Secrecy, because "Honestly; what could happen in this day and age? What could they /really/ do to harm us?"

My idea is that, on the one hand, Pureblood incest (-any incest-) increases the potential for insanity, maladies, deformaties, and magical deficiencies in future children. On the other hand: marrying out, and out, and out even further away from Pure Blood really /does/ weaken the magic. Each generation loses more and more control over their magic and becomes more and more volatile and more difficult to cover up. And with the 'Respectables' of high magical society all gone, there's no-one left to teach them how to harness it 'rightly'; to contribute themselves to the world in a proper and productive manner; and to, therefore, contribute toward calming nature's upset. My idea is that by introducing a controlled amount of New Blood at specific intervals, the Olde families would have better sustained and greatly strengthened their magical blood; but swearing off intermingling with other, distant, Pure Blood for good /weakened/ the blood; and the Purebloods who maintained their stance of "No New Blood Ever" pretty much went the way of the Gaunts.

If one goes far enough to include the Bonus set-up, it would stand to reason that such an outcome was inevitable. Purebloods - naturally and justifiably - did not want their society to fall. It was, in fact, foretold that magic would definitely survive up to and through Emrys' and King Arthur's second coming in the age of Albion - so of course they rejected change. Partly because they believed that they were supposed to; they believed that their society, as they knew it, was just about as sacred as the magic itself. Because of an outdated, superstitious 'Fairy Tale'. Then, the more they rejected change, the more they oppressed. The more they oppressed, the more fiercely those oppressed people retaliated. And, of course, quite naturally: the more fierce a retaliation, the faster changes are bound to occur. It was truly out of mortal hands to control. With the Statute destroyed, people are now newly and globally aware of magic. Now that its existence is no longer a secret, balance can be restored, peace attained, and Albion united.

I see countless authors treating Pureblood struggles as very black-and-white: if they're open-minded Purebloods, they are good people. If they stand by their 'bigoted' principles, that makes them evil, and evil needs to 'lose'.

People - Real People - can be kind, well-intentioned, and /wrong/. They can be close-minded, despicable, and /wrong/. They can also be bigoted, even /evil/, but */Not/*, ultimately, */'Wrong'/*.

**** Ok, do I understand this correctly? Here:

A - muggles, B - magical community (B1 are purebloods, B2 are half-bloods and muggleborns aware of importance of pureblood magical culture, B3 are those that are ignorant), E's Earth, X is magic, Z is those rituals that appease nature that you mentioned.

You have two groups, A and B in world E. There can be no A or B without E.

Group A is 100 000 times bigger than group B.

Group B is made of subgroups B1, B2 and B3.

Group A does not know about existence of group B, but group B knows about existence of group A.

Group B has weapon X. This weapon can subdue group A very quickly in many different ways, but for a limited amount of time.

Group A damages E continuously.

Only subgroup B1 does action Z, which is crucial to world E's continued survival.

Group A, if left as is, will erase group B.

Group A will not give up their lives or freedom.

Subgroup B3 will speed up group A in erasure of group B.

Group A will start getting more and more difficult to subdue after discovery of group B.

What do you do? Because from this, muggle genocide actually becomes a valid thing to do. The alternative is to restrict, control and farm muggles after reducing majorly muggle population.

^{Also too many repetitions of "my idea", "idea" and "olde", but that's just me nitpicking and a personal preference. :P}

***** Complete genocide would still result in an all-consuming rash of incest, because it would eradicate the potential for future fresh magical blood, period. The alternative (i.e. farming) would serve the magical community as a whole much better.

(BTW: in case you're like the other guy in thinking that this line of thinking makes me /condone/ things such as breeding and culling and all-out slavery of fellow human beings, it doesn't! #AdHominem)

As for GA continuously harming E: not really. GB1 inherently possesses Weapon X which backs up Action Z to actually make a difference to the magical attributes of E. Without X, GA is pretty inconsequential in this matter. E is best likened to a neglected animal which grows wilder and more rabid by the (insert unit of time here) and lashes out at both itself and those around it with no-one around with the know-how to tame it.

****** Well, I tried to avoid considering whether you like it or not altogether to be honest. xD

It's probably my personal bias but I can't comprehend someone reading a story that would take the idea of "superior Aryan race" to a whole nother level solely for enjoyment.

You /seem/ to just be a curious, inquisitive person, but /I just don't get it/.\\
It's out of my comfort zone I guess.

To give a comparison - a book about a deranged rapist - from his perspective. And not only his thoughts come down to "What I'm doing is okay and perfectly normal and just my preference and nobody's business. They just don't understand." But *the narration* indicates so as well.

Or a book with narration that women are inferior. Not describing what some people think, not "delving into psycho of...", but as a legit idea.

It'd just make me uncomfortable and I just /don't get/ why would someone want to read/write it in an unsarcastic way.

******* The point is to explore the politics of a future where 'the good guys' screwed up, and to touch on the notion that this direction of opinion - that "The Pureblooded bigots are evil; therefore /everything/ that they think and believe in is /wrong on principle/" - is /not/ a sound argument for dismissing one or more points of concern which, as it turns out, stand on legitimate grounds to be concerned about. It's ad hominem: "I disagree with you because your belief system makes you inhumane. Your disagreeing with me on matters of morality makes you evil. Therefore all your worries are stupid and I don't have to listen."

Mine is the idea that I came up with as a background context for this prompt. It seems that people love the 'not-so black-and-white world' only to the extent where /"the good guys occasionally do bad things, or good things for selfish reasons, or they're outright bad"/ - and /"the bad guys have a heart and occasionally do bad things which they are uncomfortable with, or they are outright good."/ No-one else seems interested in exploring a world that is 'not-so black-and-white' wherein the 'good guys' are badly biased and the bigoted Purebloods are not *all* horrifically and immorally misaligned in their views, and that they actually have a contetious but reasonably logical point of basis /for/ those views. Because political parties do not maintain self-existence for long without representing an argument of something stemming from a truthful happenstance: an encounter; or a conversation or interview with a political rival with whom the party leaders do not see eye-to-eye on certain progressive movements; or a piece of disagreeable legislation; etc.. The point is, there has to be something real and tangible to back up The Purebloods' extreme discomfort - and if that 'something' is deemed outdated (as in the case of the witch trials) or deemed as a mere case of superstition and paranoia (the destruction of a united Albion before it can even form) or deemed simply as 'the xenophobia talking'... does that /automatically/ give naysayers a ground on which to apathetically but validly and officially dismiss their opponents' concerns in a political debate? The answer is: no. To don rose-tinted glasses and decide that your governing is 'good' because you take your society in the opposite direction that the 'evil' members whom you strongly dislike would have you run it, *despite* politically and environementally sound objections from that side of the floor... is the height of arrogance and idiocy.

Specific points of my own for a fic such as this to represent are that there is a place for 'outdated' traditions in the modern world; that manners matter; that the wisdom of our elders and the practices they teach us may yet, believe it or not, be of use to us; respect for the world we live in and granting (at least intial) courtesies to the people in it whom we meet might actually make our lives /nicer/ and /simpler/; knowledge of one's history is important; and leaders do not need to be comfortable with their decisions in order to have their orders enacted. That is why they are leaders: because they make the hard and cold decisions for the presumed betterment of their society... even if those decisions are morally reprehensible. And, hey: I kinda want to see a sort of "My Fair Lady" scenario - wherein the clueless (perhaps, at this point in time, slightly barbaric) Muggleborns get schooled in how to talk and behave in a 'right' manner. I also want to see a Hogwarts that serves as more of a "so you have magic? This is how you survive" type of school than a merely academic one.

You are correct that I am curious and inquisitive. But consider this: are people who look for "Harry is abused by the Dursleys" fics people who condone abuse? Or are they people who want to see how Harry overcomes his struggles - perhaps struggles which those readers have shared? Are people who ask for "Evil!Dumbledore" fics people who condone child manipulation? Or are they people who want to see how the environment consisting of an evil mastermind headmaster at a school of magic would alter the plot and character dynamics? What does it say about a person who asks for fanfic recs for "Harry!Whump" and "Ginny dies" and "Weasley bashing" and "Genderbender"? Who are you, or the person who commented before you, to say? Some people just love to read, and explore, for the sake of fueling their imaginations, indulging in an area of study (such as: politics) through a storytelling format, gleaning some entertainment... or even for the sake of practicing philosophy: to see and try to understand and then argue different, foreign, or even /alien/ points of view. Neither of you know me. I understand that you do not understand. That does not make it permissible to accuse my person of being 'okay' with something so horrific as */Genocide/* (this @ [[/u/dancortens][u/dancortens]]). I take censure to this flash-assumption, and ask that neither of you leap to such accusations in future. Having an opinion and forming a negative discernment off of first impressions is okay. Your thoughts and judgements and opinions are your own. But accusations right off the bat are not acceptable to me - /especially/ not when that is one's idea of a /conversation opener/ from yourself to a complete stranger whose tastes and personality you cannot /possibly/ claim a familiarity with.

That's fair and I agree.

A short explanation of why your idea makes me personally uncomfortable - it sounds as if muggle-borns should not have a space to express their dual nature because it is a danger to society.\\
By making purebloods into this Earth-saving group it also moves the weight off of the acts of terrorism because if there is a reason, it's easier to understand and forgive. Like - it can be developed into any direction really, but what you gave us states that purebloods didn't only have some or a lot of concerns that turned out perfectly valid, but that they were right about everything. Muggleborns are a danger to society. Muggles are a danger to society and Earth. Purebloods were misunderstood and tried to secure themselves.

It omits the other arguments made through books, that are intertwined with their views on blood purity, on why their intentions are not as pure. The way they treat wizard of mixed (in more ways than purity of blood) inheritance, squibs, creatures, creatures who cannot protect themselves, how instead of "let's let them in on our customs" it was "let's isolate them or better yet, let's ban them from learning entirely".

All the implications that follow or would follow if their hatred was valid are making me uncomfortable.

Like, it's a difference between "Blood supremacists were right to hate them - they are dangerous after all" and "Some of pureblood's concerns were extremely valid and that's where their hatred for this particular group stemmed from".

Honestly, I'm struggling to explain here. XD Let's take "Harry's abused by Dursleys" tag prompt. You prompt in my eyes turns it something like "Dursleys abused Harry because they were afraid - and they were right - Harry is an antichrist, he just did not know." This is a valid concern because magic can be lethal. Can they feel it? No. But if they could... their actions would make abuse lose some weight - perhaps it was not right but they were simply misled in their efforts to protect themselves and Harry.\\
There was a movie - Omen. Everything is as is in the movie, except Harry's the same as in the books.

I don't know how else to explain it. The idea is worth exploring, but additions from your prompt in particular painted blood supremacists solely in a good light and this good light cast over their shady deeds lightened them.
