Hey there, i just found and binged on the harry potter and the boy who lived fanfiction and I honestly have to say that it is by far one of the best if not the best fanfiction of hp I have read and like all the good ones out there it was dropped and now I feel like I'm going into withdrawal, so please if any one out there knows of something just as good, please pass it along.

Some of the things that I really like about it(the pros) include: a smart/intelligent harry that is growing into his power and is not afraid to try new things, like labelling magic as dark and deciding shouldn't be used, aside from the unforgivable which from what I have read tend to carry some negative effects when used I always believed that the whole dark magic stuff is hogwash, i have always had the mind set that magic is about power, intent and what its used for, so I would like harry to have some common sense and not act like a goody two shoes when lives are on the line.so a cool, sensible, smart harry.

a feisty, sensible, smart, curse first ask questions later love interest. honestly love calypso rosier best original character I have seen so far. that being said a l.i is not a must but would be welcome, must not even be a witch, could be a muggle for all I care but please NO SLASH. thank you all for your help.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
