Anything that highlights the fact Ron left mid quest (I know he came back and I don't dislike his character) But we hardly get to see how this changes Hermione and Harry's relationship whether it's set in the moment or like after the war is done and Harry trusts her that little bit differently/ more because of it. I'd prefer no romance between in either ship but still happy to try. Thank you x
