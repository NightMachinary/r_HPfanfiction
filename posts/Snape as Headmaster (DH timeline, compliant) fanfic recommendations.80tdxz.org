Looking for: some good recommendations for stories of Hogwarts & Snape as headmaster during the 7th book/DH? Like what was going on at the school, rather than just following the trio around. I'm currently reading a Ginny-centric story (Not from Others by FloreatCastellum) and it's made me want to look into that same timeline but more from Snape's pov, working under cover as headmaster.

Penultimate Acts is excellent, Headmaster Snape is decent.

** linkffn(7937888) A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles is Snape's whole life (canon compliant), so it might be a bit too big for your requirements. I think it would be fine to skip to Chapter 60 with Dumbledore's death but you'd miss a lot of back story.

  He thinks of the way her hair moves in gentle waves as she walks, and it reminds him of the sand lying beneath shallower water. I'm putting M because I'm paranoid, even though in the end the rating is probably going to be, like, T at worst .

** linkao3(Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart by Squibstress) is very dark and disturbing Snape/McGonagall set during DH.

linkao3(Things Left Unsaid by DelphiPsmith) is pretty good and features the castle as a character.
