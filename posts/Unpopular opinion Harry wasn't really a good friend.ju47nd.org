You know, a lot of people consider Ron a shitty friend for a few arguments he had with Harry. But if you really think about it, Harry was a much shittier friend himself.

He never really cared about his friends, not really:

- In second year he forced Ron to go with him to find the damn giant spiders despite knowing his friend was deathly afraid of spiders. And that was on the word of Hagrid, a guy who had shown his unreliability again and again. And after getting them almost eaten he had no apologies to give.

- When he got Ron and Hermione hurt by his stupidity in fifth year he again never apologized.

- In his sixth year he dated Ginny despite the fact that he must have known that it would put a giant target on her back. True, he broke up with her later, but it was really too late by then, and if it wasn't for his stupid plot armor Voldemort would've use her to easily take him. And she probably wouldn't come out of it alive or healthy.

- In book seven, after the Godric's Hollow fiasco, when Hermione accidentally broke his wand he was a real jerk about it. No "Hermione, thanks for saving my miserable life." Just being all angry and moody. Especially that going to Godric's Hollow was his idea.

- After he said Voldemort's name and they were captured Hermione was tortured badly, but again there wasn't even a small apology. (Honestly if I had been Harry's friend I'd give him a punch in his big gob for that whole fiasco.)

There are probably more instances of this, but I think the few above are enough to get my point across.


** In defense of Harry,

- In second year, Harry in no way forced Ron to go with him. Ron could have at any time said he wanted to leave, and Harry would have let him. Harry didn't know that there were giant killer spiders in the forest either. He was just following the spiders, he didn't know that Aragog would want to eat him. Harry had nothing to apologize for, as he didn't know about the spiders, and he didn't force Ron to come.

- I assume you are talking about the Department of Mysteries fiasco. The reason Harry didn't apologise here was because he had nothing to say sorry for. Harry didn't mislead or lie to his friends, and he didn't force them to come with him. In fact, Harry tried to get them stay back. Harry was scared for the safety of Sirius, and wanted to save him. Hermione was worried that it was a trick, and she wanted him to check Grimmauld Place first. So Harry did. Harry Fire called Sirius and saw that he wasn't there, so he went to the DoM. Should he apologize that Voldemort tricked him? Harry was also grieving the death of a loved one after this incident so an apology was probably the last thing on his mind.

- I'm confused. Should Harry stop living his life, because of Voldemort? Should he not be happy? Ginny isn't stupid; I'm sure she knew the risks of dating Harry Potter, but she did it anyways. And at this point in time, Dumbledore was still alive and the Order could protect her from harm. After Dumbledore died, Harry broke it off with her for her own safety. By your logic, should Harry not have any friends or any relationships with anyone because of Voldemort? He was a 16 year old boy, trying to enjoy his life despite the war.

- This isn't true. Harry was not a 'real jerk' to Hermione after she broke his wand. Harry was angry, but he in no way was mean to Hermione because of it. Here's proof:

"'You're still really angry at me, aren't you?' said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. 'No,' he said quietly. 'No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible. I'd be dead if you hadn't been there to help me."'

- He did apologise for this. After the snatchers caught him, he said, "This is all my fault. I said the name. I'm sorry-"

In conclusion, of course Harry cared about his friends.

*** I don't deny that Harry cared about his friends. We are in his head, and we know for a fact that he loves them to pieces. He's pretty bad at showing it though. Which I get because abuse and constant traumatization does not make for good emotional or relational awareness. Having reasons for not being available doesn't make him any less unavailable though, it just means he's got some really great friends.

I'm trying to think about times he was there for Hermione specifically because I already have a list for Ron. Aside from the /attempt/ after Ron and Lavender kissed though, I really don't have much anything. If you've got any ideas please point me to them because as of now, the stuff I know is making their relationship look really one-sided.

*** 1. He may not have forced Ron to come, but it's obvious Ron would never say "no", since he thought the spiders had a clue about the monster.Harry should have been more sympathetic to Ron when he was obviously extremely uncomfortable about going
2. Whether or not it was his fault, most people would apologize if their friends were injured because of their actions.
3. Well, as Harry in DH said, being Harry Potter's girlfrind puts a target on Ginny's back. The Order protects /Harry/ first and foremost, not his girlfriend, so it was extremely selfish for him to get a girlfriend
4. He was a real jerk to Hermione after she saved his life. Instead of comforting her that it wasn't her fault, he just left her. If that isn't jerkish, I don't know what is. *Her* *face* *glazed* *with* *tears*, *Hermione* *handed* *over* *her* *wand*, *and* *he* *left* *her* *sitting* *beside* *his* *bed*, *desiring* *nothing* *more* *than* *to* *get* *away* *from* *her*.
5. That was before she was tortured. After she was tortured, he just congratulated her on not spilling their secrets He was also still resentful of her breaking his wand, and had unkind thoughts about her when she complained she was having trouble using the wand that tortured her.

**** 1. Why are we expecting a 12 year to be sympathetic to a fear? And didn't Hermione laugh at Ron earlier in the book?

2. They were injured for their own actions. He told them to stay behind. All 5 of them insisted they come.

3. Ginny's entire family was in the Order. She went to Hogwarts in the very next book and was a-okay until the sword incident.

4. Hermione saved his life after insisting they go to Godric's Hollow. Much like he saved her life after saying Voldemort's name. Context matters.

5.

  Harry could not help but remember how Hermione had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him to simply practise. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however; the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonise her.

***** 1. She may have laughed at his fear, but she didn't force him to follow spiders into the Forbidden Forest.
2. I am not saying Harry is at fault for it. It's just that most people would apologize for causing it to happen.
3. Fair enough
4. No, Hermione did not insist they go to Godric's Hollow. She merely caved in after Harry had been wanting to go there the whole time. Also, Hermione saved him before he got tortured while Harry did it afterwards. As you said, context matters.
5. If the wand he was using was the wand used to torture him, and the torture was Hermione's fault, I'd say Hermione was wrong. Sadly, Hermione was the one who /saved/ him, while he got her tortured. Those are two very different situations. Also, the passage you quoted literally said that he would have antagonized her if they weren't going to break into Gringotts right after, so that actually paints Harry in a much worse light. Being resentful towards your friend for breaking your wand while they were saving you is one thing but getting your friend tortured and wanting to mock them for being uncomfortable using the wand that tortured them but choosing not to just because it's the day of their big mission and not because its the right thing to do is just despicable.

****** - Harry didn't force Ron to do anything.

- Harry didn't cause it to happen as they were told to stay behind and argued with him over it.

- fine.

- you're laying it on thick and Hermione was the reason his wand was broken. Instead of sympathizing, she tries to ignore it to keep guilt at bay. That made her wrong. And it's like you're ignoring the part where Hermione says 'it's not working for me.'

******* 1. Okay, forcing is a bit of a strong word. But he definitely ignored Ron's discomfort and excuses to leave, and led Ron to the spiders despite his protests.
2. He technically did cause it since he was the one who got vision and wanted to go save Sirius, but I see what you mean. I'm not arguing that he was at fault, I'm just saying that it's like if you accidentally dropped a few pins and a guest steps on it. It's not your fault, but most people would still apologize.
3. It is true though. Hermione may have gotten his wand broken, but that was because she was too busy saving him. Harry got her tortured and made her lose her wand. Those are two very different situations. I think you're also ignoring intentions. Hermione was saying that stuff because she wanted to be helpful (even Harry knew that that was the reason), but she comes off as unsympathetic. There are many canon examples of this. Harry, on the other hand, wanted to mock her and make her hurt on multiple occasion, but the only thing stopping him at first was that Ron came back and he wanted them to get along, and later, it was because they were doing their mission right after. So he's basically worse than her on all counts in this situation. While Hermione saved him and tried to (even though she failed) help him, Harry got her tortured and wanted to make her feel even worse (only extenuating circumstances stopped him from doing so) multiple times. Also, I don't understand what you mean by saying I'm ignoring that part. She has difficulty using Bellatrix's wand because it tortured her. She also has a very different definition of "not working" than since she was transfiguring Ron's face (human transfiguration is the most difficult transfiguration field) while Harry had trouble enlarging a spider (which is supposed to be easy since a little boy was doing it in GoF).

Not working is not working and canon tells us a wand you're not master of wouldn't work the same as your own. The definition is the same regardless of the spell. She was being unhelpful out loud. Harry kept his thoughts to himself.

********* It's known that Hermione's way of helping comes off as nagging and unsympathetic. We see this in PS, GoF, and OotP most clearly. I was wrong about Harry knowing that though. I guess it's another reason to hate him.

I'm honestly confused why whether the wand was working for her or not. Still, there is a range of not working. While Harry was having trouble with basic charms like Wingardium Leviosa and Engorgio, she was transfiguring Ron to disguise him. There's a reason Harry had a much easier time with Hermione's wand than with the blackthorn wand. I think you're ignoring that the only reasons Harry kept his thoughts to himself were that he wanted them to get along after Ron came back and he didn't want to antagonize her before the break-in. If not for extenuating circumstances, he would have ripped into her. Also, whether or not she was being unhelpful, it's the intent that matters. She was trying to help since she felt bad for breaking his wand while saving him and he wanted to hurt her since he still felt resentful for her breaking his wand while saving his life.

**** 1. I mean...maybe? Still, Harry was scared too, and he's never been exactly good with comforting people.

2. His friends knew what they were getting into, and they insisted they would come. Harry was also absolutely devastated by the loss of Sirius, and an apology was the last thing on his mind.

3. But... he broke it off with her. Not to mention the fact that Ginny could have broke it off with him, if she was worried. Life doesn't just stop during war.

4. He left to take watch outside the tent, which was something that would have to happen either way. Again, Harry isn't good at comforting people. He told her that it was an accident, and he would just have to borrow her wand for now. He wasn't being rude to her. He was upset, and he left so that he wouldn't take it out on her. And he made her feel better after, as I've already said.

5. What's wrong with that? Do you really think that Hermione wanted everyone's pity? If she was just tortured, I think it is better to congratulate her on being strong and not breaking, rather than pitying her. And of course he was upset his wand was broken. And he was having unkind thoughts about her because she was having trouble using a different wand, after she made a remark when he couldn't use a different wand. And it's not like he actually said anything mean to her about this; He kept his mouth shut. He just thought something.

4. I can't put all the quotes, but there are many parts in the book where he was angry at her because of the wand, and let it show. Heck, the only reason he wasn't constantly snapping at her about the wand was because Ron was back and he wanted them all to get along.

** Harry's wand was his one advantage over Voldemort. It saved his life in the graveyard and then later when being moving to a safe house. Voldemort had decades of experience and the entire Ministry behind him and Harry lost his only advantage. Not to mention the sentimental value of having that wand for as long as he had been a wizard. It was the last of his innocent, Hogwarts days dying, it was his only advantage dying, it showed the lowest point of the war (Don't forget that Ron was gone). The fact he didn't snap and yell at her is impressive.

** I agree and disagree to some point, and not for the same reasons. Harry wasn't that shitty of a friend compared to Ron, but he wasn't better either. He was just a friend, and, as friends, everyone had their bright and shitty moments. That's what being friends is all about.

Ron was shitty for things Fanon never forgets. Yet he was great as well. Defending him, risking stuff for him. Let him into his family.

Harry was shitty too, but not that much because he didn't apologize. After all, he might have done so of page, and they were all in that war together. Plenty of that is Voldemort fault, not Harry.

The shittiness in friendship side was more on neglect at times. Ron and Hermione needed to understand Harry's angst moments. His "I'm mad and deal with it. How can anyone understand what I am going through! As if you knew what's like."

Besides, Harry actively and openly showing he cares about his friends outside of dying for them is about as canon as Ron and Hermione becoming better at communicating.

** Honestly I agree with you. I hate how he never apologizes when his friends face the brunt of his actions. Heck, he even screamed at Hermione for saving him from being tortured by Umbridge.

*They had wasted so much time --- they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision. Not only had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.*

*“Smart plan,” he spat at Hermione, keen to release some of his fury. “Really smart plan. Where do we go from here?”*

*“We need to get back up to the castle,” said Hermione faintly.*

*“By the time we've done that, Sirius will probably be dead!” said Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper; there was a high-pitched chattering overhead and he looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him.*

Imagine being that rude to a friend when they just saved you! Especially since it was in the heat of the moment (Umbridge was in the middle of saying "Crucio" before Hermione interrupted), so how did he expect Hermione to have a perfect plan?

In DH, he treats Hermione horribly that whole book.

When she breaks his wand while saving him, he blames her for it. He is still resentful towards her when she's uncomfortable using the wand that tortured her.

*“I hate this thing,” she said in a low voice. “I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn't work properly for me. ... It's like a bit of her.”*

*Harry could not help but remember how Hermione had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however; the eve of their attempted assault onGringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her.*

When Ron came back and Hermione didn't want to speak to him because abandoned her, Harry painted Hermione as moody and unreasonable.

*Hermione's sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery ofGryffindor's sword, and above all, Ron's return, made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.*

When he got Hermione tortured, he never even apologized to her! He just said that she was thankful she didn't spill their secrets.

Harry is one of my least favorite characters in the series, because of how he has no sympathy for anyone but he expects other people to coddle him.

*** Your first example is quite clearly Harry being frustrated at the situation and taking some of his anger out on Hermione. A completely ordinary thing to do for a 15 year old who thinks the last part of his family is about to die, and something that most adults do on a regular basis.

The second one is Harry not pointing out that Hermione was being a hypocrite. She nagged that there was nothing wrong with the wand and that it was just him. But then she feels it for herself and complains that its the wands fault. How is Harry a jerk for ignoring this?

In the third, Hermione wasn't painted as unreasonable, it was just that Harry was happy things were looking up for the war. Hermione was focused on Ron's action of leaving, Harry was focused on Ron's action of regret and returning. Harry was always more forgiving then Hermione was.

Harry did apologize for the Snatchers. A different comment has the quote.

**** I read your reply, and it seems to me you're excusing Harry for everything but judging Hermione excessively harsh. Why can Harry take out his anger on Hermione for saving his ass? It's not normal for adults to do. The last time I ever took my anger out on somebody when they helped me was so long ago I can't even remember it, and I'm a /teenager/. Whether or not he's frustrated, he should not take it out on Hermione like he always does in canon. He does it constantly in PoA, GoF, OotP, and DH and has some moments like that in DH.

I'm wondering about the mental gymnastics behind that. Hermione got tortured and lost her wand because of him while Harry lost his wand because Hermione saved his life. Two different situations. Also, she was trying to be helpful and came off as unsympathetic and nagging, as she does in other books. On the other hand, the only reason Harry didn't snap at her is because of extenuating circumstances (Ron coming back and the break-in). She wanted to help Harry after saving his life while Harry wanted to hurt her after getting her tortured.

*He knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more.*

I just quoted one part. He definitely did paint her as unreasonable, and that's a fact. Also, where are you getting that Harry was more forgiving than her? The reason Harry forgave him is because Ron saved his life and he was the one that drove Ron off in the first place. Hermione didn't forgive him after a few seconds, because she was defending him and begging and shouting for him to come back. After he left, she cried herself to sleep. Harry, being the unsympathetic person he is, never bothered to comfort her.

Harry never apologized for getting her tortured. He said he was sorry to both of them while they were getting captured.

*** Yes! Thank you so much for this! I'd argue that he is a great friend to /Ron,/ but dear god, he was a /terrible/ friend to Hermione. Their relationship is so terribly lopsided. Harry never takes Hermione's side in argument even when she's right. He takes for granted that she would always be there for him, and never takes the time to even thank her or be there for her in return.

In seven whole books, we have ONE scene where Harry /attempts/ to comfort Hermione. He doesn't even manage it fully. I get that harry is extremely burdened and traumatized, but minus him saving their lives, he never actually puts in the effort to be there for them. In terms of daily life things, Harry is just a fucking shit friend.

I'm going to give him kudos for trying because it isn't easy when you're emotionally stunted. At the end of the day though, he spends a lot of time avoiding his friends when they start having problems, and he is too preoccupied with his own troubles to have much energy left for when Hermione's or Ron's lives go to shit. Don't get me wrong - */it's absolutely understandable/*. The reasons don't make his hurtful actions and lack of consideration and less hurtful or inconsiderate though.

He eventually pulls his head out of his ass with Ron. (I hate the Locket scene for a lot of reasons, but I love what it did for Ron and Harry's friendship). He never manages the same with Hermione though. Hermione is his constant - the one who stayed when not even Ron did. And he just doesn't reciprocate her loyalty or devotion.

Don't get me wrong. Harry is a great character and a good person. He is kind and brave and forgiving. But he is not a good friend. At least not to Hermione.

**** Yeah, I feel like Harry should have definitely gotten some character growth in regards to how he treats his friends. Even with Ron, who he understands most, he can be pretty terrible and unsympathetic. With Hermione, he never appreciates her and never comforts her. Even when Ron abandoned them and she stayed, when Ron came back, he immediately prioritized him over Hermione, which, to me, is extremely horrible to do to someone who is always there for you. The double standards he has in regard to Ron and Hermione (he told Hermione it was her own fault that McLaggen was chasing her since she invited him, but felt sorry for Ron when Lavender was chasing him even though he was the one who was using her for months) is honestly horrible. He should have treated Hermione much better.

***** It's so obvious that Ron is his favorite friend. And you won't believe how often I wanted Hermione to just get up and find other people who'd appreciate and treat her better. Or at least demand that she be treated better by Harry and Ron. Just ugh. I want so badly for someone to reciprocate the care amd regard she gives to the people around her.

***** He did get character growth, he went from an abused child starved of affection to a survivor adult that never learnt core lessons about human interaction at the critical ages and so had to rely on rote knowledge of how to deal with interpersonal situations.\\
He appreciates her enough to drop a date in order to help as soon as she even hints that she may need it. If you look at the story keeping his abuse in mind, the way he latches onto Ron and keeps going back makes sense as he was the first friend he ever had even though it's a highly toxic friendship.

If Hermione ever phrased things as a request for something she needed he was right there helping her with it.

****** I don't think it was a highly toxic friendship. Having arguments is a normal thing for a friendship especially when they're kids. I always felt like the fourth year argument was overrated, not being friends for less than 2 months out of 48 does not destroy a friendship, especially after Ron saying that he would die before letting Sirius Black touch Harry the year before. And the argument in the tent and Ron leaving was because of the Horcrux. Don't forget that there were literal months that went by when they were best friends just enjoying life that we didn't see. The relationship wasn't toxic.

****** I need more examples please.

I maintain still that Harry is emotionally unavailable for most of his friendships. He tries, but like you said, relationships are hard when you've been abused and your frame of reference for people are ones that hurt you. I do feel that Hermione was the one doing the legwork for most of their relationship.

That said, I'm getting more responses on other posts about the ways he showed his love. I was just wondering if you can think of more examples where Hermione is actually awake or lucid enough to appreciate his efforts. WE know Harry loves her. Does Hermione?
