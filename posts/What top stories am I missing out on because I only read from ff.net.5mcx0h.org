** Well, there's Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived, a completed non-magic spy school AU from Hermione's POV. Voldemort is a mad scientist and Dumbledore was ostracized from the British spy community for correctly saying that Kim Philby was working for the Soviets. It's really interesting. [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/]]

/dirgewithoutmusic/ only posts on AO3; her 'boy with a scar' series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]] (various AUs with different or no Harrys) are very popular, as is her series about side female characters. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/136245]]

/Esama/ is an AO3 writer; her 'island of fire AU' (crossover with Temeraire) is popular and an intriguing wizarding-town creation story- with dragons! [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]]

/Copperbadge/ posts mostly MCU fic, but her humor fic Registration is a hilarious slice of life fic centered around the idea that parents have to stand in line at Hogwarts to register their newborn children. James sends Remus and Sirius to register Harry. They have a series of interactions with other parents in the line. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/830080]]

The great Marauders-era fic centering around Lily and her OC girl friends that I rec a lot is [[http://unknowableroom.org/39/1/]]

** linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/109558/chapters/151674]]) is very intriguing, issues-heavy story. There is slash in the background, but you can just skip through it. What makes this story compelling is that it deals with social issues involving feminism, Muggles and Muggleborns in a way that wasn't deal with in canon.

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

** Honestly? Not too many in the Harry Potter fandom. There are a few who refuse to crosspost, and a few who have abandoned ff.net (like cywscross), but most authors that post on AO3 also post on ff.net unless it's very explicit smut (and even then many do).

The only noteworthy things that I know of that you miss by not reading AO3 are Esama's and Cywscross' stories.

Put less politely, they're a horde of draconian rule nazis who have bullied authors to take down stories they believe are non-compliant with the rules of ffnet.\\
Bullying, in this case, includes everything from leaving multiple negative reviews on a story with the message that the author should take it down lest they report it, a loooong comment that reeks of [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] and RuleNazi (which I wish was a subreddit) wherein they declare the fanfic non-compliant with ffnet rules and demand it taken down lest reported (declare really is the right word to use here), up to and including outright death threats in PMs (as experienced by yours truly.

** Try going on FictionAlley/Schnoogle. They have so many great fics there (posted primarily during the 2000s). An example being the last three books from Hermione's perspective (by Ann Margaret):

- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ann_margaret/HGATOOTP.html][Hermione Granger and the Order of the Phoenix]]
- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ann_margaret/HGATHBP.html][Hermione Granger and the Half Blood Prince]]
- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ann_margaret/HGATDH.html][Hermione Granger and the Deathly Hallows]]

And of course, because I'm an H/G shipper, I will suggest a couple of SIYE-exclusive fics:

- [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=128876][Win A Date With Ginny Weasley by cwarbeck]]
- [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=361][The List series by Brennus]]

There's so much great content there, because the stories are all moderated before they can be posted (usually takes a few days I believe). Not so on FF.net or AO3 where you have to wade through pages of crap (Sturgeon's Law).

The little ones [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=16094&chapter=1&font=&size=]] Not all is well at Platform Nine and Three Quarters This story could be a companion piece to Deathly hallows. No one thought about the incoming muggle borns.

The ASP of Hogwarts [[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=110679]] Its one of the few epilogue generation fics that i have absolutly loved. The origional characters are fantastic, its funny and it doesn't feel like a rewrite of Harry's hogwarts years.

**** Thanks for this--I remember reading The Prefect's Portrait when it was still in progress (at least a decade ago now?) and I was so happy to read it again.

** Someone else mentioned fanficauthors, though only towards bobmin(ugh) and Jeconais(yuck).

My all-time favorite authors from that site are draco664 and Full_Pensieve.

Draco664 essentially cemented the indy!Harry trope. His works are always well thought out, decently paced and plotted and extremely entertaining.

[[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/]]

Full_Pensieve is among the best in the drama/angst category. His stories (especially Years of Rebellion) are masterfully woven, with horrible shit constantly happening (that actually has consequences), with awesome scenes of bravery and sacrifice, with dramatic interactions that are actually meaningful.

  In the aftermath of the war, Harry still has plenty of demons left to fight.Post-DH, not compliant with the epilogue.

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....WIP

** The livejournal/personal site part of the fandom (so like nearly 2 decades ago) has some good read, but they're not canon compatible, and most are shipping. They occasionally post their stuffs in the Skyhawke archive, you can take a look over there for something you might like

*** So many fics were lost with the live journal purge. A lot of them are locked too, it makes me sad because so many writers only posted to LJ. There are a lot of great fics on skyehawke but their search is terrible, its pretty difficult to stumble across a story there. I wish more would cross post, but I see how it could be annoying to keep up with too many accounts.
