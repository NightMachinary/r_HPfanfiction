I just had an epiphany: Voldemort and Harry are like Tom and Jerry (Hanna-Barbara Cartoon).

Voldemort is talented, usually patient, and cunning. He creates elaborate long term plans for numerous situations, and seem to work almost unbelievably well. He plans meticulously how to try and deal with Harry while managing his other goals. Contrast this with Harry, who has a limited set of skills useful in certain situations. He does not think in the long term, and takes things as they come.

By all rights, Voldemort should win every time. And yet Harry constantly succeeds, partly because of a certain emotional resilience and partly due to coincidence and his unique skillset.

I get the overall message, the triumph of good over evil. But like Tom and Jerry, the hidden message here seems to be: don't waste your time thinking and planning things out, because you will always be beaten by someone who is more naturally talented and/or lucky. What kind of message is that to send in a kids book, that planning and studying is a waste of time?

(Same thing applies for Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner parallel, and yes this post is partly comedic)


** I think you're reading too deep into the shallow end of the pool, and WILLIE Coyote, really!? It's Wile E. Coyote, and J.K.'s subtlety isn't that good.

Edit: Also before anything else HP is a children's/YA series. There's no way futility of effort is the message. “See Jimmy, you should just give up on your Olympic dreams. You won't be faster than Usain Bolt, so why try?” Really?

** I find the other comments calling Harry Potter a YA series rather amusing, as the genre didn't exist back then :') I guess I'm also biased against reclassifying it as that now, because I've been very disappointed by the vast majority of YA fiction I've tried reading.

Back to OP: I laughed pretty hard imagining Tom and Jerry in the various Harry vs Voldemort situations in the series. Also, /Tom/ Riddle? Coincidence, I think not!

That's nothing! The real message of /Harry Potter/ is that a tiny minority of people can be born with a certain innate talent that makes them better in virtually every way than the great mass of people, who they treat with barely-disguised contempt while fighting a conflict behind the scenes that this unimportant lumpenproletariat can barely understand!

And these are the protagonists!

*** Harry Potter is like the X-Men series in this regard.

You have been mistreated your whole life, seemingly for no reason. Life sucks, no one gets you. One day though, you discover your a wizard/mutant, and it all makes sense. You ARE different from those other people. And you know what else? You are better. You were born special, and they treated you poorly or misunderstood you because their JEALOUS. When you think about it like that, I can totally see Harry joining up with someone like Magneto to reap vengeance on the "lesser" peoples.

Kinda makes me see where some of the me-first attitude in alot of kids now comes from...

** Inconsistent world building, glaring plot-holes and irrational tropes are clear sign of how deep, or shallow, JKR can write. Don't look too deep. JKR doesn't have subtlety and skill to pull that off.

She wrote a simple story about good vs evil for kids. Her pain thing is 'Good wins because fate'. Let's keep it at that.

** But the fact that Voldermort makes elaborate long term plans is one of his character flaws, because the more complex a plan, the more points of failure it has. And in war, no plan survives contact with the enemy.

In book 1, Voldemort hardly has a plan, and fails because he didn't do his research as to why was Harry able to survive his attack back in 1981

Book 2 starts with Voldemort's plan for keeping one of his horcruxes safe failing. Then Horcrux Tom releases the basilik just for fun, even though he doesn't need that at all in order to kill Ginny. If anything, it's counterproductive because Ginny begins to distrust the diary.

Book 4's plan is so extremely complex that it should have failed many times before the wands' deux ex machina saves Harry.

By Book 5, he refuses to kidnap Harry while Harry is happily going about his neighborhood so he can later imperious, polyjuice into him or threaten him to retrieve the prophecy. Heck, kidnap Hermione's parents and threaten Harry with that. Instead, he engages some bizarre standoff with the OotP and a door in the Department of Mysteries.

By Book 7 he conquers Britain, so he quickly proceeds to go on a merry chase across Europe because he never wanted to rule in the first place (yay! Make long plans and wars for an objective you don't care about anyway!) and finally unleashes a set piece battle against Magical Britain's most beloved institution which should have resulted in his quick defeat if the OotP and the DA would have turned into a real military during the last few years. Just a few mandrakes turned into magical mines by the gates of Hogwarts would have won the battle for the defenders, let alone a few heavy machine guns.

First of all, the Harry Potter books are classified as YA fiction, not 'kids books' as you so quaintly put it.

Second of all, 'planning and studying is a waste of time'? Have you heard of one bookworm and redhead snogging extraordinaire, Hermione Granger? Half of her whole plotline for the first 3 years is how important studying is.

Thirdly, this whole series is not as complex as you say. "The heathens are spreading witchcraft to our children! Fellow Christians, we must band together and exterminate this foul English wench who dares go against the teachings of God!" That's you. That's how dumb you sound. You're twisting the imaginations of J K Rowling to your own desires without regard to what she meant, and that in and of itself is a crime against fanfiction.

Fourth, I really should get more sleep. Late night rants are killing me.

Edit: In retrospect this came out bitchier than I thought it would be. I'll see what happens after I get some sleep.

*** Its okay. Like I said, part of this is meant to be comedic.

While the series was YA, the first 3 or 4 books seem to have leaned more towards children. I'm not criticizing them, just the perception I had and still have all these years later.

I am not sure what I said that was so hostile with regard to your third part. I just thought it was funny that Rowling ended up with a story where the bad guy worked hard to accomplish his goals (narcissism and sociopathy aside), and he got beaten by a kid who jumps feet first into alot of situations and comes out far better than anyone would have expected. Almost like saying, nerds will always fail to beat the talented and gifted.

But don't take any of this too seriously.

**** I ate the post.

Seriously though I'm sorry for being a bitch. Lack of sleep and finals are getting to me. Not an excuse, but still.
