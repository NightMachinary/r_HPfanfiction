Most fanfiction stories have Tobias Snape as an abusive drunk so I always wondered how the timeline would change if snape was an obscurial.(Also Credence Barebone is his maternal grandfather just to make it even more interesting)


** You probably mean he is the unique type of stable and controlled obscurial that Credence is. If I remember correctly every other obscurial is much more volatile and less human than Credence. Like the obscurial that Newt has in his suitcase in the first Fantastic Beast movie.

That changes so much though... Snape probably wouldn't even be allowed to go to Hogwarts due to the possibility of him turning into this obscurial form and killing the entire class.

It also depends on how this affects his magic. I think the last movie just went the direction of "these special obscurials can just generate crazy, powerful magic that others can't." But there wasn't really much more explanation. The whole phoenix scene also felt kind of stupid. But that's just my opinion.

*** You have to remember that this is Dumbledore we are talking about if he can let a werewolf,a dark lord possessed professor and so many other dangerous things into a school full of children an obscurial doesn't sound so impossible.Plus I would to think that he might let snape in on the basis that they are family if credence is his grandfather(if you remember in the last movie credence was revealed to be a dumbledore)

**** Generally those things can be controlled pretty easily. The werewolf for example only turns once a month and there's a potion for it. He probably didn't know Quirrel was possessed....

And you saw how dangerous the Obscurial was. Grindelwald himself had trouble with it so Dumbledore would as well. Even more so when he has to protect children from it too. And the transformation can happen immediately as a result of anger.

Of course, as an author you can just handwave that stuff and say he still allows it. But I personally would probably stop reading because it would feel a bit unbelievable.
