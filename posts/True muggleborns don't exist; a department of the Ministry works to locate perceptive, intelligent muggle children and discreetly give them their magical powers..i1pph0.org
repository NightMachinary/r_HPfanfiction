Why? A perceptive, intelligent child will frequently grow up to be a perceptive, intelligent muggle...and perceptive, intelligent muggles aren't as likely to dismiss an unusual or illogical happening as 'just my imagination', and will typically have the curiosity to investigate.\\
Identifying them at a young age and giving them magic achieves a couple of things; one, it gives the 'muggleborn' and their family a bond to magic, making them less inclined to spill the beans, and two, it recruits a smart and naturally talented witch or wizard to the magical community.\\
In a sense, it's a bit like picking and choosing immigrants from the muggle community. A little teeny bit.\\

(Incidentally, do we have a Story Ideas Thread yet? This does feel a bit more along the lines of 'a neat idea I had' than a prompt.)

** Think about it though: who do we know who are muggle-born? Hermione, obviously, comes to mind first. Highly intelligent, but also incredibly brave: likely to notice something's off and investigate it. Lily (the first one) was also like Hermione in her smarts and courage, but different in her imagination and temper; she stands up for people and is willing to believe there is something different. Justin Finch-Fletchly, double-barrelled surname and down for Eton? Definitely rich. Also likely to jump to conclusions (although thinking Harry was the heir wasn't completely unfounded), nice and sweet otherwise; a valuable asset in wizard-muggle relations. The Creevey brother's, Colin and Dennis. Curiosity killed the cat, they say (unfortunately true in Colin's case), and these two are the living embodiment of that. They get in many dangerous situations on their own through Hogwarts, getting petrified, falling in the lake, not to mention most exploits would be caught on film. Better to let them be a part of the world so they can at least prepare themselves. These are just off the top of my head, but there are many more, and most have compelling reasons for bringing them into the magical world (and I didn't include Dean because of the half-blood thing that JK confirmed).

Imagine though, if it were possible in the HP verse to give all of humanity magic, or at least make all of the next generation magic - there would be no more need for for the Statue of Secrecy.

****** I've always attributed squibs to inbreeding. Genetics doesn't really work - the gene sequences for magic would need to be both dominant and recessive and be strangely recombined to create the facts we have. (if magic is dominant, then squibs can't exist, if it is recessive then halfbloods and muggleborn can hardly exist)

If they're created by inbreeding, then they are basically wizards, but all their magic is tied up in keeping them alive and preventing them from falling into genetic chaos. Being thrown out of their family and into the wider world and having children with muggles then fixes up these issues, with the children and grandchildren having more and more magic at their disposal as their genes are righted again, until they meet the hogwarts threshold and "become" wizards. In essence though, they were squibs all all all along.

In this situation, they aren't without magic - that's stupid, and not at all logical. I'm generally opposed to the common fandom thing of "binding magic" and the whole "swear on magic" thing. Those both go against what magic should be like.

(not to mention that no wizard anywhere would willingly take any sort of oath, not in a world where some dark wizard can say "imperio. kill this dude. obliviate" and you're none the wiser - imagine Hadrian Lordy Lord doing the whole 'I'm not the x of x! So mote it be!" and then he just turns into a squib lmao)
