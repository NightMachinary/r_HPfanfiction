   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: introduction
   :END:
Welcome to the *March Miniprompt Challenge!* In this challenge, brave writers can take on one of the three prompts below and write a short response (a few paragraphs or so).

The motivation behind this new event is threefold:

1. Increase community activity, given reduced Book Club and Debate activity
2. Allow people to scratch their writing itch with fun, short prompts
3. Allow people who have never really written to take a stab at writing!

There are three types of prompts:

1. *Directed* - directed prompts describe a specific starting scenario. You're free to take the prompt in any direction from here.

2. *Freeform* - freeform prompts will describe a vague setting, and you're free to write about literally anything from any point of view in this setting.

3. *Unique* - unique prompts are not, well, conventional. They might be a bit meta.

** Rules/Suggestions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rulessuggestions
   :END:

- All top-level comments must be responses to one of the prompts!
- Keep your responses short, on the order of a few paragraphs at most.

*** Ooh, I have another idea for a prompt:

The Dursleys are targeted...by telemarketers. Several ring a day and they just won't go away.

A Harry Potter who's frustrated with not being able to talk about what happens during the school year (save via Hedwig), ends up telling those telemarketers all about what happens at Hogwarts and the wizarding world...disguised as the usual anti-telemarketer satire.

"A new vacuum cleaner? That would have helped at school a few months ago, one of the students was possessed by a ghost and started writing messages in blood on the walls."

"Golf clubs? Maybe, all I do for sport right now is fly around on a broom."

"Life insurance? Oh hell yes, you wouldn't believe how many...listen, when /exactly/ does it pay out? People have tried to kill me on...4...5...um...that doesn't count...I think that does though...at least 12 times. No, wait, 13. 14! My first year at school was the worst, though."

** *Short version:* Briar patching: The students team up with the teachers to give Pomona Sprout a horrifying reputation during Snape's year as headmaster; this leads to the Confounded Carrows delegating detentions to her, during which the students mind harmless plants and put on makeup to look horribly disfigured.

--------------

/When Severus Snape was Headmaster of Hogwarts.../

/More importantly, when the Carrows were in charge of discipline.../

Amycus Carrow liked to think that he was observant. He knew who exactly could be trusted amongst the students (sons and daughters of Death Eaters), and who'd rebel if they could get away with it (mostly Gryffindors). For him, if some of the former accused the latter of breaking rules, that was enough evidence for him to start doling out curses.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
So, when Amycus saw Pomona Sprout walking around in the halls, and the nearby students /shying away/ from her, the same problem students who only threw dagger eyes at him, he knew /something/ was up.

That night, at dinner in the Great Hall, he placed himself down next to the dumpy witch.

"Alright, Sprout, what did you do?" he curtly questioned.

The Herbology professor blinked innocently at him, "Whatever could you mean, Professor Carrow?"

"You know what I mean. Did you not, perhaps, notice how the problem students were avoiding you earlier today?"

Amycus Carrow waved his hand at the Gryffindor table; when Pomona Sprout looked over, several of the students who were looking at them hurriedly turned their heads to stare at the food in front of them.

Professor Sprout was quiet for a few seconds, before she admitted, "Well...I caught a few of them in the act of vandalizing my greenhouse, and I took matters into my own hands..." She smiled wickedly, causing the still-watching students to shudder, "They weren't so eager to misbehave after a few minutes of getting to know my new Demon Vine collection."

Amycus frowned, "If you'll recall, Professor Sprout, I am technically supposed to be in charge of all discipline, and-"

Suddenly, Amycus felt a strange wave of dizziness pass over him, the rest of his sentence disappearing, forgotten.

Professor Sprout looked at him, "Is everything alright, Professor Carrow?"

"Yes, yes, I'm fine..." he muttered, before turning his attention back to his steak dinner.

On the other side of him, Flitwick quietly hid his wand again.

   :END:
/The next day../

"Detention, Mr. Finnigan." Amycus Carrow growled at the trouble-making Gryffindor who had once again, 'accidentally' blown up his desk.

"Better you than Sprout." Seamus Finnigan muttered, not quite under his breath.

Unfortunately, Amycus heard him, "...To be served with Professor Sprout."

The Death Eater turned 'teacher' internally grinned at the looks of sheer horror that swept the entire class.

   :CUSTOM_ID: section-3
   :END:
/That evening.../

"Ah, Seamus, Seamus, come in," Pomona Sprout greeted the Gryffindor cheerfully as he wandered into the greenhouse, "Is it going to plan?"

"Yup. I've got detentions with you every night this week." Seamus nodded, no trace of the apparent fear he was showing yesterday and that morning.

"Right, right...plenty of time to plot and plan..." Professor Sprout drew herself up dramatically, "For your detention, Mr. Finnigan, you will be babysitting the vilest and most terrible of my plants...the Flitterbloom!"

A flick of her wand had dramatic thunder play as Seamus's attention was drawn to the harmless vined plant in the corner.

"Here's a comb, dear, just sit next to it and give it a gentle brush whenever its vines get tangled," Sprout said fondly, "Oh, and before you go, I have a selection from Messers Weasleys 'Bloody Murder Makeup' collection, so do make sure you look appropriately cut, bruised and shellshocked when you leave, would you?"

** Directed Prompt: Little Girl Lost

Megan Taylor was lost. Last year she'd been so embarrassed to have her muggle parents accompany her to Diagon Alley that she'd thrown a fit this year after her Hogwarts letter showed up.

God, Mom, I'm fifteen! That had been her foolproof argument. It wasn't like I'm never in London alone. And you've seen Diagon Alley! It's harmless, I'll be home by five.

And they'd let her go, easily enough. giving her money to exchange for gold to buy her school supplies. She'd stopped at the bank, met some friends for some ice cream, bought her books, some new robes, a new cauldron, and refilled her potions supplies.

It had been a great day, blissfully free of her parents and their insane reactions to the Wizards in the alley. At least until her friends had dared her to walk through Knockturn Alley. Just down the street and back, how hard could it be? Well, Megan sure wasn't going to give up.

Except that once she'd turned around at the end of the Alley, the entire street had changed. Still, she'd walked to the other end again, hoping to see something familiar. She didn't. The streets kept doing their best impression of the Hogwarts staircases. And every time she looked around there seemed to be fewer and fewer people. All in all, Megan Taylor was lost.

The further she went, the fewer shops there were, too. Megan thought this portion of the alley seemed long forgotten. Dust lined the signs of obviously closed stores. Quills and Sofa's seemed long abandoned, as did Hitchpodge's Hodgepodge, and Bangborg's Blood Samples. Although an advertisement for Dragon's blood in the dusty window showed her that at one point, it was a mere two sickes a vial.

At the end of the road, though, she saw another shop. The faded sign read Olive's Oblivatorium in purple lettering. It, too, was dusty and abandoned. But the door was at least ajar. Someone had to be inside, Megan thought.

She stepped into the shop, feeling immensely relieved when an old woman stood near a counter, packaging gassy filled vials into small case. Great, Megan Taylor thought, someone I can get directions from.

Moments later Megan Taylor stepped back into the street, smiling happily and gazing around. She walked down the street, feeling quite content that her determination would overcome the silly challenge her friends had given her. At the end of the street she turned, frowning as nothing seemed familiar.

Megan Taylor realized she was lost. She frowned and turned down the street, walking slowly until she found a shop with a door slightly ajar. She stepped inside, intending to ask for directions out of the alley.

Megan Taylor stepped out of the shop a few minutes later, content with the knowledge of exactly where she needed to go. Except nothing looked familiar. She thought she was in London but it looked wrong. It looked more like the London of those Christmas specials, the ones with the ghosts, than the London she remembered.

She walked more quickly up the street, looking for the familiar shape of a black cab. She reached into her pocket and took out some coins, frowning at the unfamiliar shape of them as she looked around for a cab. She paused for a moment, though. Where would she even tell the cab to go?

She needed directions. She looked through the abandoned storefronts until she saw one with an ajar door. Someone had to be inside, she thought. She ran to it and stepped in.

A girl stepped out into the street. She looked confused, as if she wasn't quite aware of where she was? She looked to the sky, as if wondering when the sun set behind the buildings? She looked around, frowning. She was due somewhere well before that, but she couldn't remember where.

She had to be close, though. She felt like she'd been walking all day. She couldn't have been doing that and not be close to wherever she needed to be. She walked down the street, knowing she'd recognize her destination when she saw it.

Still, nothing seemed familiar. She turned and walked down the street. At the end of it she saw a shop with the door ajar. Oh, at least something was still open, she though, at worst, I can ask for directions.

** Challenge prompt. Rewrote the first page of the first book.

Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. Normal, that is, for intelligence agents in deep cover. They went to quite a lot of trouble to have their neighbors believe that they were the last people anyone would expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious. They were frighteningly good at their spycraft.

When he wasn't tailing suspicious characters in his heavily modified sedan, Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings. An MI-6 front operation, they made drills as a means of dodging well-meaning but potentially vexing tax inquiries. He was a big, beefy man who could easily break your neck. He also had a very large mustache, an essential part of his disguise. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde, with a long neck and a penchant for firearms. When she wasn't at the firing range, honing her considerable skills, she spent her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors, and generally seeking information on any nefarious actors operating out of this nondescript suburb. The Dursleys completed their cover with a small son called Dudley, trained from birth to notice things and report to his handlers. Having guided his training, in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.

They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about /the Potters/.

** Rebecca ran. She ran with the terror of a child transported to wonderland, a child who's just realised that if the stories of fairies and wizards and magic are real, then so too are the stories of monsters, all clawed hands and bent noses, and that the monsters like little girls more than anything else, and that meant her.

She darted around the brick-chipped corner and her heart froze. A wall blocked her flight. It was a dead end. She was trapped.

The footsteps around the corner were getting louder.

Desperate, she whipped her head around, looking for a way out. There! She flung herself against the door she'd spotted, yanked it open, pulled herself inside, and slammed it behind her, snatching a brief glimpse of abandoned shop floor before plunging into darkness and silence.

Rebecca held her breath.

Nothing.

Nothing barged in through the door.

Rebecca dared to take another breath.

Still nothing.

She released a relieved sigh, and, suddenly, as thought the world was waiting for exactly that cue, the shop flooded with bright light, causing Rebecca to yelp and spin around.

Where before the walls had been empty, they were now filled with enough weaponry to outfit a medieval battalion --- spears, shields, maces and longbows aplenty. On the wall directly beside her, a breathtaking silvery sword shimmered with green light all the way up the blade.

“Welcome!”

Rebecca had to stop herself from swallowing her own tongue. A man had appeared from nowhere in the middle of the shop floor. He was tall with messy black hair, green eyes, and an obvious lightning bolt scar on his forehead.

“Welcome,” the man said again, smiling widely, “to the shop of requirement.”

** Thrivaldi was smart. Very smart, even for a troll.

Thrivaldi knew most wizards thought trolls were dumb beasts, but Thrivaldi knew better. Trolls were eleventy times smarter than wizards.

Still, Thrivaldi thought breaking into a castle full of wizards just for some treasure wasn't a very good idea.

The wizard in purple named Squirrel was very convincing, though. Squirrel needed a big, powerful troll to help him search for the greedy wizards treasure. Squirrel knew Thrivaldi was strong and smart.

Thrivaldi still thought taking on an entire castle of wizards was dumb, but Squirrel had a clever idea, for a wizard. Squirrel cast magic on Thrivaldi. Squirrel made Thrivaldi smaller, to fit through the corridors, but much stronger, and Squirrel put a shield on Thrivaldi to protect the troll from the other wizards spells.

Squirrel also put magic on Thrivaldi's club, to let it break anything, through the walls of the castle or the shields the other wizards could use.

With all the magical power Thrivaldi was given by Squirrel, he thought he stood a much better chance of entering the castle and taking the wizards treasure.

--------------

This was frustrating, Thrivaldi thought.

Thrivaldi and Squirrel had split up, Thrivaldi to check the dungeons while Squirrel would check the upper floors.

But Thrivaldi hadn't found any treasure yet. And these little wizards were annoying Thrivaldi with their noisy howling.

...Wait. Where was Thrivaldi's magic wall-breaking, shield-breaking club?

*WHONG!*

...Oh. There was Thrivaldi's club. But Thrivaldi couldn't pick it up, because he suddenly needed to lie down.

(Just playing with a random thought; what if the troll in first year, had been buffed by Quirrel to distract the professors for longer, and the /only/ way to easily beat it was by using its own enchanted weapon to hit it?)

  'What about her? Dobby--she hasn't found out about this--about us--about the DA?'

  He read the answer in the elf's stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor.

  'Is she coming?' Harry asked quietly.

  Dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor.

  'Yes, Harry Potter, yes!'

  Harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf.

"Alright! Umbridge is coming," he announced, "Everyone, concentrate on changing the room, the way we practiced."

As Harry spoke, the gathered students calmed again; nearest to Harry, Neville had his eyes shut, and was slowly breathing in and out.

The room fell quiet without anyone shouting or casting spells.

For a few seconds, nothing seemed to happen, but then the mirrors and training dummies sank into the ground, disappearing under a soft red carpet that seemed to grow out from the floor like grass.

The Dark Detectors lining the walls vanished, being replaced by dozing portraits, and wooden bookshelves filled with novels, toys, and board games.

Another couple of seconds, and the room seemed to expand, filling itself with comfy chairs, inviting sofas, and antique wooden tables arranged in circles.

A crackling fireplace sprung up on the far wall, chandeliers descended from the ceiling, and lamps popped into existence on every table, bathing the entire room in gentle golden light.

While all that was happening, Hermione had opened her eyes and quietly walked over to the list titled 'Dumbledore's Army'; peeling it off the wall, she unfolded a second piece of paper, a sign simply labelled 'Quiet Please', and stuck it in the same place.

At this point, the Room of Requirement had completely changed; where before it was a hall for practicing Defense Against the Dark Arts, now it looked like a particularly cosy and dignified reading room.

"Alright, good." Harry said quietly, "Now, everyone grab a book or a game and make yourself comfortable. Parchment is over there if you want to do some homework."

The milling students made a beeline for the shelves.

"How long do you think we have, Harry?" Ron quietly whispered.

BANG BANG BANG!

There was a loud pounding on the door; those students who hadn't yet picked a book or a game hurriedly grabbed one and rushed to a chair in silence.

The door to the Room of Requirement burst open, revealing Dolores Umbridge, "Well, well! Caught in the-"

"Shush, not so loud!" Dean shushed her, without looking up from his book.

Umbridge paused, nonplussed. Then she tried again, "Where is Mr. Potter?"

Harry looked up from the game of Wizard Monopoly he was just setting up, "Here."

Umbridge smiled widely, "You're coming with me to the Headmaster's Office, Potter."

Harry tilted his head, aiming for a convincing look of confusion, "Whatever for?"

Umbridge puffed up, "Whatever for? You've been caught in the act of running an illegal student organization!"

Harry tilted his head the other way, "When?"

Umbridge blinked, "...Just now!"

Harry slowly twisted his head around to look at the various students in the room, who were either pretending to pay no attention whatsoever, or pulling faces at Umbridge while her back was turned.

"I don't have any idea what you're talking about, professor," he said innocently, "This is a reading room, not a..." he trailed off, waiting for input.

Umbridge just sighed. This was going to take a while.

--------------

(Et-cetera et-cetera, the plan for being discovered is basically turn the RoR into a reading room and deny, deny, deny everything.

Possibly including, in the meeting at Dumbledore's office, Harry claims that he had nothing to do with Marietta's jinxing, that he never went through with his plans for a defense organization after the Ministry Degree was imposed, that he was unaware of any planned meeting happening in the rec room, maybe Marietta witnessed a drug deal of some sort, he hopes not.)

*I think I shouldn't post this, considering how drunk I am right now, but fuck it.*

Randy was the randiest eleven year old you'd ever see. So randy, that his parents had once even changed his name to Candy, just to make sure that their poor choice of a name wasn't what turned Randy into such an abrasive mannered boy. Alas, it didn't do anything other than give Randy a sudden sweet tooth, so they changed his name right back.

On 31st June 1996 Randy had turned eleven, and a rather strange dwarf-looking man had popped up in their living room wildly waving his stick around and spouting some gibberish about magic and wizards. While his father and mother had stuck to gentlepeople-like manners and proceeded to threaten siccing an attorney on the dwarf man, Randy had snuck around the man and slammed a rather large shovel onto the back of his head with full force.

Where had he gotten the shovel from? No one knew.

Randy had dismissed that as one of the many continuity errors in the universe and searched through the man's pocket, coming across some brochures and a letter written on crisp parchment, detailing the wonderful land of magic and wonders with schools named after genital diseases and games with rules that made as much sense as the existence of the brooms they were played on.

It had taken some convincing to make his parents allow him to go to this 'Diagon Alley' alone.

"Absolutely not Randolph! I will not allow it!" His father had put down his tea cup and resolutely told him after the constables had taken the dwarfman and left. His mother had obediently nodded along, sipping on her own cup of jasmine tea.

The tea that Randy had put sleeping pills in.

The two adults had slumped onto the table soon afterwards while Randy watched on victoriously. Once they were out completely, he nicked his father's wallet and walked out of the house, ready to let the magic happen.

5 hours later, Randy decided that Diagon Alley wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. The wonder of the 200 year old clothes and magic wands everywhere was soon washed away by the smell of owl-poop and perpetual condescension at him being a muggleborn and not having any 'galleons', which was the wannabe pirate gold coin that these high and mighty dickheads used.

So off the Knockturn he went.

Knockturn was a side alley that branched off from Diagon, and seemed to be much more lively and bearable than Diagon. Cool new species like vampires roamed the streets, baring their fangs at him once in a while, only to be taken aback when Randy would rush in and ask what lotion they used when they were out in the sun. Tom Clancy's SPF 70,000 Moisturising and Whitening Cream seemed to be the most popular product. One vampire was even kind enough to give Randy one, but Randy gave it to a passing hag whose face looked like someone had stuck a nose and two ears on a frog drenched in horse shit. With his kind deed of the day done, Randy continued roaming around the Alley, until the sparsely populated streets gave way into completely abandoned ones, and shops started looking more run down than ever.

It was in that part of the alley that Randy stumbled across a door that unlike the others, seemed unlocked and ever so slightly ajar. Curiousity overwhelming his sense of self-preservation, Randy walked closer and closer, keeping his ears open for even the slightest sound that could indicate that someone was there.

Hearing none, he pushed open the door and stepped inside.

The moment the light from outside lit up the interior of the shop, Randy knew that he wasn't there alone. A wrinkly faced man, looking more than a hundred years old with matted grey hair and bony arms, sat on an armchair right in the middle of the shop surrounded by tables that proudly displayed all his wares. His mouth slowly opened, and a weak, spidery voice filled Randy's ears.

"Are . . . you . . . a customer?"

"Er . . . no. I stumbled in here . . . by accident. I'll be on my way now."

But just as he started backing out of the shop, the old man's arm darted up, wand in hand. A bright yellow light shot out at him, and before he could even think of dodging it, it struck him right on the chest. Randy started shrinking, his body sprouting feathers as his mouth elongated into a beak and his feet turned into tiny claws.

"No . . . trespassers . . . allowed . . ." he heard the old man say before he blacked out.

That day, Randy the Muggleborn died, but Randy the Mildly Intelligent Sparrow was born. Randy would go on to do the sex with 35 separate sparrows to have 182 chicks and revitalize the world sparrow population.

"I'm a what?" Harry said, not because he hadn't heard it the first time, but because he really couldn't believe what he /had/ heard.

"A blizzard, o' course," Hagrid told him in a tone that had surely meant to be comforting, but only filled Harry with a premonition of icy dread, "and a thumpin' big'un too, I'd say, once yeh've been taught how to draw warm and cold fronts. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read your forecast."

Harry at last stretched out his hand to take the large, crumpled envelope, with an overly-precise address scrawled on the front. He pulled from it several sheets of paper with too many staples, and read --

/HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF STORMS AND SYSTEMS/

-- then just as promptly stopped reading. This had to be the most elaborate prank in the history of pranks. His cousin could have only dreamt of pulling a prank like this one. There had to be a camera somewhere, recording such a prank -- or perhaps Uncle Vernon had done all this because Dudley had demanded it to be done for his entertainment. Regardless of the particulars, Harry did not believe what he had heard, not a single bit. He looked up at Hagrid, looked back at the paper, and then, finally, to Hagrid again. "I'm sorry, but I'm a boy, not a blizzard."

"Yeh can be both at once, Harry! That's why Runners are always givin' storms and such names. Deep down, they sense wha' we are."

"Runners?" said Harry, feeling as if he shouldn't have done.

Hagrid hooked a thumb back, pointing at the Dursleys. "Like them. It's what we call flesh-and-blood folk, on account of the way they run when we head their way. An' it's your bad luck that you grew up in a family of the biggest Runners I ever laid eyes on."

"Right." If Harry could just wake up now, he'd be done with this nonsense and back in a world where everything made perfect, if slightly miserable, sense.

Of course, that couldn't happen, or else it would've made for a very short story indeed.

Hermione suddenly stopped and looked around, before shaking her head, "No, no, it's not this way, I think."

"Not what way, Miss Granger?" Umbridge raised an eyebrow.

Hermione Granger just looked at her, "The weapon isn't this way, professor. We'll have to go back and try again."

Umbridge grumbled before motioning with her wand for them to turn around. Harry just blinked, before going along with it.

--------------

Hermione scrunched up her face and looked like she was trying very hard not to swear, "We missed it again."

Umbridge glared at her, "Miss Granger, just /what/ are you searching for?" she questioned sharply.

Hermione sighed, "I'm looking for the markers that show the path. They're well-hidden, normally I'd shine a light on them to make them appear, but..." she looked meaningfully at Umbridge's wand.

Umbridge noticed, and jerked her wand hand back, "Oh, no, I'm not silly enough to give you my wand. /Lumos!/"

The clearing lit up with bright light, causing Harry to wince and incidentally making the group of three highly visible through the trees.

Hermione rolled her eyes while her face was turned away from Umbridge, before making a show of peering around, "Nope, we've missed them. We'll have to go back again, look for something that glows a weird purple-blue."

--------------

"Miss Granger, you are leading me around in circles!" Umbridge accused her as they wandered back and forth under wandlight, with no mysterious markers to be found.

Hermione shook her head, "We're just having a lot of bad luck! Are you sure you lit your wand correctly?"

Umbridge quietly seethed and opened her mouth to respond...before a red beam of light from nowhere collided with her head and she toppled over into the grass.

Harry & Hermione whirled around; Ron was coming through the trees towards them, shortly followed by Neville, Luna, and Ginny. They all looked a bit worse-for-wear, but rather pleased with themselves.

"Just as planned." Hermione snickered.

--------------

(Explanation; rather than making lots of noise and waiting for centaurs to find them, Hermione led Umbridge and Harry around in circles near the border of the Forbidden Forest by claiming to be looking for invisible markers showing the path to the weapon. Umbridge's wand light, when she finally lit it, made her an easy-to-spot target for Ron and the others (though Hermione actually expected backup from the Order of the Phoenix).)

** A response to the Direct Prompt. Warning: I mostly used this an opportunity to play around with a new style so there are probably going to be more than a few errors. :)

The wind is so powerful it looks alive, she thinks, little shards of white ice rearing and rushing, torrenting past shuddering shops and clanging into their silver bells. Lily yanks the hood of her robe further down her face and continues walking. Mundungus said he will be in a pub called /The Fair Mermaid/ but she has been ambling around the Knockturn for quite some time now and has not seen it.

Her eardrums ache. She can't feel her face nor her feet, and if she casts any magic at all in this ghost-quiet place some unsavory person will take notice of her.

After a few minutes, Lily cannot take it. If someone sees her, so be it, it's not like she can't take care of herself. In this bitter, grey cold, the shops are sealed shut and plastered with Closed signs. All but one. Lily forces it open and sticks her body through. Heat. Feeling pricks back into her pink hands, back into her rosy face.

She stops short.

“Remus?”

The terse conversation cuts off. Her dear werewolf friend sits as part of group around a table; other werewolves, she knew, some she recognizes from Remus's pictures of the packs he has been visiting, and others... others from the wanted posters that plaster Diagon's walls. At the head lounges Fenrir Greyback whose blue eyes bore into her. He stands.

“No! She has no part in this. She's pregnant for God's sake,” Remus says, standing as well. “I'll take her home.”

Greyback turns to him. “Do what you want with her, Lupin. But you will give me the location of the Prewett brothers. I need to give the Dark Lord something.”

Lily is not quick enough.

“She'll never truly forget,” another werewolf pipes up, just as her vision succumbs to a whirlwind of bright colors. “She may never like you again.”

“But she's alive.”

This "one-shot" could be considered canon-compliant but I'm not 100% sure. It hints at messier werewolf politics during the first war and is the inciting event towards the Potters not trusting Remus (Lily's gut feeling).

** Freeform Prompt:

The Dark Lord had become increasingly agitated; the destruction of the first few Horcruxes had no dramatic effect, but now his rage intensified, mounting with the elimination of every additional one, even though he remained unaware of the last vestiges of his soul as they were methodically snuffed out, one by one, along with the last remnants of his humanity. Anger, uncertainty, and fear combined to exacerbate the Dark Lord's preexisting paranoia---already bordering on insanity---accompanied by nagging assumptions and a never-ending stream of questions and accusations directed toward Severus regarding the presumed singularity of his loyalty.

The subject of the “Elder Wand” and its inherent concept of ownership had dominated their conversations from the moment the Dark Lord had pried it from Dumbledore's rigor mortis-ridden hands. Severus understood the conclusion that the machinations of the Dark Lord's mind was turning towards, as well as its implications, before the Dark Lord had fully come to realize and understand it himself. The realization failed to faze Severus, who had extensively prepared and, at times, even longed for the day Voldermort would finally decide that he found him no longer useful and put an end to his miserable life.

At times, he'd placed himself in dangerous situations or territory to taunt death and its serpentine harbinger into finally taking him, usually pulling back at the last moment, just seconds before baring a traitorous memory to him or purposefully pushing a tenuous relationship with an Order member far enough to provoke them to do the deed. The utterance of the word “coward” caused him visceral anguish, cutting him worse than the Sectumsempra curse; at times, he even longed to turn his wand on himself, yet the cowardice he'd so often been accused of prevailed and stopped him. Although he had no desire to be seen as a martyr, Severus's final days were spent with his mind consumed by thoughts of Lily and the Halcyon days of the childhood he had spent with her as his friend---reliving his only happy memories, really---interspersed with memories of the bullying he faced at the hands of the Marauders, headed by their ringleader, the man that would later become her husband; the pain somehow remained still palpable and the happy memories still painfully poignant after all those years.

** Directed prompt: "You're a muggleborn that's lost her way in Knockturn Alley, and happen across an abandoned shop with barely-open doors."

A/N: Slightly modded from the prompt, but otherwise fine. Have fun reading!

So, do you want to hear a story about how did I get into this mess?

Okay, so it's October '98 in Wizarding Britain.

Graduation day had come and gone.

Nobody was celebrating.

Not that surprising, really. What was there left to celebrate, exactly?

I took my exams in the Great Hall of Hogwarts, as per tradition. The enchantments showing the open sky above us had been destroyed a month ago, but that was fine.

The ceiling and a chunk of the outer wall had partially caved in anyway, so there was still a nice view of the outside to enjoy.

I passed my tests with flying colors. They were quite a bit easier than the lessons that had taken place in Hogwarts over the last year.

Being /crucio/ed for making mistakes was a brilliant motivator, even if I spent the first month of school with trembling hands.

Nevertheless, here I was. Freshly graduated, top marks across the board, with a history of overcoming impossible odds and all the other good things me and my class had going for ourselves.

Pity that there were wastelands that had more inhabitants in them than Wizarding Britain currently does. More's the pity that those who had fled were invariably those who had the means to do so as well-which meant the rich and the business owners mostly.

Which left the poor, the imprisoned, the unfortunate and the mad to inhabit an area that accommodated ten times its number of residents not three years ago.

Inmates abandoned alongside the asylum. The Ministry was in shambles, Hogwarts was closed for renovations now, the muggle authorities had gone on red alert, tipped off by someone at some stage no doubt and the Goblins were nursing their own wounds.

In short, if you happened to be a wizard or a witch living here, you were alone. The Aurors were more interested in catching Death Eaters, what few survivors many of the various home defence militias that had risen up to defend their little patch of land had basically gone home and locked the wards behind them and the few law enforcers left amongst the Hitwizard squads were too busy chasing down former colleagues and, according to rumours, executing them for collaborating with the enemy.

Not exactly the kind of environment to look for a job in. Or a place to live, come to think of it.

It's as I am returning to Tom's Inn after a long, long day of picking up groceries to sell to the insanely paranoid and slightly better off purebloods camping out in the Alley's various hostels and B&Bs that I get an idea.

A girl needs to eat, which my 'job' of confunding muggle supermarket stores into giving me groceries for free in the name of charity takes care of pretty nicely.

A girl needs money too, which is why I call the above activity a job rather than just the petty theft I knew it to be. Selling the rest off has netted me more galleons than I thought would have remained in the Alley after everything went down.

But a girl also needs somewhere to sleep and changing galleons to pounds is an exercise for suckers.

I had a place up until yesterday. A nice little appartment a kind old lady had rented out to me. Then the kind old lady got done for collaboration and the Ministry kicked me out.

I spent the night in a tent, half-wishing I'd taken them up on their threat to arrest me. A holding cell came with a warm bed and food after all.

Still, as I finish my delivery run to Tom's and go back down to the little public park where me and a few of the others have ended up camping in, I notice something that hasn't really been touched by the war at all:

Knockturn Alley.

*** The small-time criminals were gone. Between the Ministry waving its authority around like a hammer, the Death Eaters killing pretty much anybody they disagreed with (and they disagreed with petty crime of all things, go figure) and the post-war economy not being the most stellar thing to ever grace our shores, the crime families, gangs, organisations and individuals were all gone.

But nobody went there anyway. Guess that reputation had to be good for something, right?

Oh what the hell, not like there wasn't anything in there likely to get the drop on me. Live with the Carrows long enough and nothing's going to surprise you more than once either.

The cobblestones and mouldy alleyways were eerily silent.

And when I say eery, I mean 'doing its best to make me run in terror', the sort of feeling you cannot help but have when being in the middle of a crowded area only to find no-one around you.

And the farther I went in, the more terrifying the whole thing became.

Knockturn had been home to several hundred, maybe even more than a thousand, people from all walks of magical life not that long ago. Low-lives lived next door to rich yuppies, criminals mingled with the well-heeled, the outcasts and the insiders all jumbled in together down a small side road that was larger and went on for longer than the rest of Diagon Alley and its offshoots combined.

Seeing nobody here, hearing nothing, smelling nothing... It was like watching one of those funny movies my aunt used to like-or the odd scary Dr Who episode, come to think of it.

I passed under the archway that formally separated Knockturn Alley from Diagon Alley. Past this point was where hitwizards would have patrolled rather than Aurors, for example. Any shop that set up after this was both looking to pay less taxes and avoid more scrutiny, which was a winning combination if you were invested in the less legal aspects of magical life.

It also marked the end of the so-called 'touristy bits' where being mugged did not automatically equate to waking up with all your clothes and half your internal organs missing. This was the kind of place Dark Wizards would prowl about in when looking for another subject to experiment with.

On that note, my wand came out. Sure, it had seen better days. Sure, polishing it was a bit hard on the budget too. But it still worked and, unfashionably generic though my younger self may have found it, older me was happy that getting it touched up by Ollivander cost less than one of those super-rare fancy wands with their intricate carvings and ridiculously expensive components.

Point was, ugly though it may be, it worked better than a charm, which is all a girl a bit down on her luck could reasonably ask for these days.

Still, wand or not, I didn't cast anything. There was no telling who could still be watching and getting into a fight with a local for using magic all willy-nilly and stuff did not sound like a good plan at all.

So I ventured on, past the tenements and the mansions and the boarded-up shopfronts. Down the alley I went, carefully ignoring the scorched stones and puddles of glass where one faction or another had a little party with their foes. Down I went, noting just how surprisingly /clean/ everything seemed to be and wondering what that meant.

Down I went until I hit the Industrial Area. Even months after business had run dry, the noxious fumes and odd smells of mass produced potions still hung thickly in the air. Odd-looking little shopfronts were full of rotten goods and collapsed mannequins that poked through the gaps in the boards, leering at me from their little island of decay.

I felt myself relaxing at the sight. The smell and the rot around me meant one thing-that whoever had cleaned the area farther up the top hadn't ventured this far down. By choice or not, that meant that regardless of who'd bothered to clean the place before, nobody had come out to touch all... this.

And nobody who lived here could actually leave their window open unless they were absolutely sure the bubblehead charm would stay on all night, what with the likely nature of the fumes still lingering around.

...

Oh yeah, knew I'd forgotten something. A wave of the wand and a bit of latinese later and I'm all ready to go on in my quest to... see things...

It's at times like these that I manage to understand Harry 'I had no idea this would happen' Potter just a little bit more.

I also don't want to, since I actually like my sanity where it is, thank you very much.

Still, the Industrial section is /all kinds of/ interesting. The old warehouses and the tenement factories hadn't been cleared out. The odd residential building wasn't nearly as tightly locked as it was elsewhere. All signs that whoever had left had done so in a hurry and probably didn't expect to come back.

Which probably meant that, for now at least, my troubles in finding a place to stay would likely be over far earlier than I'd anticipated. Just find out who's the landlord (which, even with half the archives still being on fire months later, still meant that the Ministry would know), offer them a few galleons rent and bam, Marvin's me Muggle uncle.

Still, this was a unique opportunity for me. It's not every day that you get this deep into knockturn without fending off at least one enterprising little bastard with a cosh where his brain should be, so to get this far without being threatened with physical violence definitely qualified as new and exciting.

And so I ventured on, hitting the end of the industrial area... and finding a cul-de-sac where more houses should have been as far as I was concerned.

**** I had hit the mythical end of Knockturn Alley... somehow. Don't Alleys imply that they start in one street and end by opening up on another? Did I get that wrong? Proper school was ages ago now.

But really, that was just an aside to something that I found much more interesting-at the very end of the Alley stood a shop.

What set this shop aside from all the others was that this one had lights on. There was sound coming from within. All the wares displayed in its front windows were in tip-top condition. There was a tiny plaque that said 'We're Open!' in what had probably once passed for cheery cursive back when Gothic fonts had their hey-day.

There was also, far more importantly, a string of bangs and muffled cursing coming from within.

Someone was in there. Said someone was presumably alive (Vampires and lucid Inferi are a thing, you know) and, by the sounds of the swearing, doing something they found rather agitating.

It was even possible that said someone was actually the owner of the business.

Which meant a job. Money, food I didn't have to go muggle-skimming for, a legitimate roof over my head and legitimate standing in society could be mine!

For the measly, measly price of getting my feet to obey me.

Forcing my apprehension and rising survival instincts down (I would never get anything done with magic if I pay too much attention to the voice that says 'this may kill you!' since magic is, you know, almost universally lethal if you don't know what you're doing and all that jazz), I pulled open the door and strode inside.

Behind the counter was a silvery-haired old man who was busily beating some kind of amorphous... creature... unconscious with a cricket bat. "Hello!" He shouted in my direction. "Welcome to Knockturn's Knick-knacks! Give me a minute and don't close the door, whatever you do!"

Wait, door? I turned around, looking back at the door I'd just entered and found myself staring at the slowly, slowly closing gap between the shop and the outside world. "Umm, the door is closing... very slowly?"

The creature shrieked in a piercing whistle as the shop owner nailed it with a vicious swipe. "Slowly, you say?" he asked in genuine interest before a tentacle swiped his feet out from under him and sent him sprawling. "No matter, try keeping it open-mph!"

Thus told, I jumped to the door, pushing it open slightly. "Um, it's resisting. Is that normal?"

"No! Oh wait, yes, but not THIS early!" The man shouted as he threw the tentacled blob into the back room and slammed the door shut, panting. "Alright, now that's finished... no, normally it takes around five business days for the door to close."

I stare at him, using the opportunity to put my back into keeping the door open. "Are you sure it hasn't been, you know, a week? And... why is the door closing a bad thing exactly?" I asked.

"Well, see, if the door closes, then it's because it's decided to, uh, relocate again." The man admitted sheepishly.

"Define 'relocate' in this instance. Like the Dark Lady Baba Yaga's chickenleg house or like somebody miscasting an unplottable charm?" I asked a bit more forcefully.

"Well, uh, relocated to a random point in time and space? One whose only rule is that there have to be humans living nearby?" The man said, poking both his index fingers together.

I blinked. "You what?"

"Look, it's complicated and I doubt you really want to have the longer explanation, so if I were you, I'd probably want to leave now." The man said pointedly.

"Yeah... yeah that sounds like an idea." I admitted, inching closer to the edge of the door to make it out.

Of course, that's when things decided to go wrong.

First, my foot slipped in a pool of ichor left behind by the creature, causing me to lose my balance.

Two, because I lost my balance, there was no leverage to be had in stopping the door from closing.

Three, I was using my whole weight to keep the door open at that stage.

Result: Me, go flying into shelf, door closes, shopkeeper flinches.

"Oh dear." The shopkeeper said.

"Fuck." I concurred, though that was more me acknowledging the pain than figuring out the consequences right then.

/That/ revelation only came when I heard that most final of clicks.

"Well, at least I'm not alone this time." The shopkeeper said in a cheery voice. "Gets a bit dull without company, being unstuck in time, space and dimensions."

"Oh bug-" Which is when the world went wonky.

And that's how I became a shop clerk working for the craziest shop in the universe.

And also a hero... sometimes.

But that's another story.

** Okay, so, you're a muggleborn, wandering down Knockturn Alley.

...The place is really different since the war, isn't it? Half of the shops here are closed down and boarded up. Either they used to belong to muggleborns who never came back, or they belonged to dark artifact peddlers and were shut down after the Death Eaters were beaten for good.

The Alley is like one big museum now, if you think about it. Relics of the past on display everywhere, if you can call faded shopfronts relics.

Oh, right, where was I? You were wandering down Knockturn Alley. What were you looking for, anyway? Write your answer in:

Huh, sounds cool. Actually, I think I know where one is! See that cyclops statue? It's just a bit down to the right from there...or...was it to the left? What angle are you coming at it from?

...Eh, don't worry about it. We'll try both directions, just look for a minotaur. Another sculpture, I mean, not a live one. And yeah, there's a lot of Greek art on this part of the street, isn't there?

...Did you feel that?

...Oh, for eff's sake, it's a /raindrop/. Did you want to Apparate home?

Alright, it'd be a hassle to find your way back here anyway. But I know from your adventures in the bedroom that you never got the hang of applying /Impervius/ to your robe and wizard hat. You should probably find some cover or other.

...Oh, well, that's convenient. Look over there, just behind you.

Yup, that storefront there. The...wow, it's pretty beat up. The windows are smashed, there's graffiti all over the walls (I'm NOT translating it for you, it's pretty vulgar), one of the doors is nearly off its hinges. Maybe it used to belong to another muggleborn...you know, before the Death Eater occupation.

...Just another monument to their barbarism, I guess. But it looks dry in there, you can slip on in and wait out the raincloud in there. Come on, hurry up, before you get wet!

...Oh. /Wow./ This is...well, I'm starting to rethink my assumption that a muggleborn owned this shop. I mean...wow.

I can't describe it, really. Here, put it in your own words for me. Describe the remains inside this ex-shop:
