A world where hp wizards got their heriditary power from deals with the devil/devil worship. Old pureblood families are the most worshipful and hate muggleborns because they were accidental/it was only their parent who made a deal with the devil/etc and are influenced by God/christianity.


** Not exactly what you're looking for but there is a crossover with 'Lucifer' in which Lucifer is the creator of all magic. I've just read the first few chapters and there is a scene where a wizard confirms it. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13401887/1/The-Devil-as-a-Father]] linkffn(13401887)

  Inspired by Brilliant Lady's Story. What would happen if Lucifer Morningstar found an abandoned Harry Potter in L.A. and adopted him?
