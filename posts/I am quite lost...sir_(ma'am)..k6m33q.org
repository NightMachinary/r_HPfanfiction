:END:
So the one of the best fan fictions that I have read is C'est La Vie by cywscross. And the reason why I am so amazed by it is because on how the writer makes that character their own, which made the reading experience very enjoyable. And to those who read this fic before, you know that it has been under hiatus for 5 years. I am actively searching for fan fics in that caliber and I haven't really seen one. Can you please give me recommendations?

I really ain't too picky but I really hate when harem is included, even if people said the writing is good. I rather have no romance at all. But if it is a romance fic, I quite prefer bxb. I find the writing more of my liking but I'll try gxb.

Harry must be the central character.

Finally, an important point, is that the actions of each character must be very reasonable and refreshing. If you ever read Trash of the Count's family, the main character is so refreshing that it excites me and makes me want to continue reading and that's also what I felt while reading C'est La Vie. Thank you if you read this!!

(And if the last phrases are centered, I really don't know what happened sorryðŸ˜…)


** Start going through the request/what's that fic posts as well as the prompt posts with more than 10 or so replies. People link stories on here all the time and I think you'll find something fun even if it isn't your perfect unicorn story.

I don't think I've read C'est La Vie, but I will attempt a recommendation so I don't sound like some asshole who just said to read the reddit.

linkao3(621543) - A Promise From Her Boy

It's a little too canon personally and probably not really some kind of masterwork, but it's one of my personal favorites. The length is not overbearing for an evening story, 20k words, and made me very emotional the first time.

  Harry Potter did not have any reason to suspect his snowy Hedwig was different from any other owl. That's why she waited to tell him.

** I am in exactly the same boat, one of the first fan fictions I ever fell in love with I'm still infatuated to this day!!!! If you liked C'est La Vie you might like Second String.

** This is my favourite dimension travel fic:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/552828/chapters/985108][Stunning Shifts]]:

  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger.

From what I remember, cest la vi'e was dimension travel as well, so you may like this.
