I am honestly tired of all fics where Harry is the dominant partner in a relationship and the woman just sits there and basks in his awesomeness. So are there any fics where he is paired with a girl who is the driving person in a relationship? Who asks him out, woos him and so on?

Any pairing for Harry, pls no creature fics or Hermione paired with Ron or Death Eaters in the background.

*** I guess it depends entirely on the execution. What annoys me about that brand of Hermione fics is that her dominance isn't limited to the relationship but she restructures Harry's entire life and significantly changes him. And that's the kind of fic which gets the beta complaints.

However, if you have a woman ask a guy out because she's interested and then decides to move things along, the common reaction to the guy would be something along the lines of "what a lucky bastard". And honestly, I can't think of a single fic where Harry is the pursued throughout the romance arc.

***** That is... not what a simp is. The word is generally used to refer to men who have a parasocial relationship with a female content creator (YouTube/Twitch/etc). It is typified not by niceness but by entitlement, stalkerish behaviour, obsession, etc. Just watch what happens when simps turn on their favoured content creator because e.g. she won't post nudes - they are definitely /not/ nice people, but much more like a variety of incel.

It may have originally been a nuanced word, but by now it's just a tool to demean guys who aren't as sexist as the guy saying it.

** It always confuses me when in fanfiction, Harry is the confident and dominant person in the relationship. The boy was mentally, emotionally and (possibly) physically abused his whole childhood, told repeatedly that he was worthless and that nobody would love him, and had someone try to kill him once a year every year while at Hogwarts.

Where the fuck did all this confidence come from? Realistically, Harry would be so clueless about anything even close to love and affection, that those who didn't understand his childhood would probably assume he was emotionally cold or just purposefully ignoring what they believe to be obvious signals.

He wouldn't have a clue about affection and stuff, but he certainly wouldn't be submissive.

**** I never said that Harry would be submissive, merely that he would have trouble with showing affection and expressing himself romantically. He does show affection in his own way, but I've read many fics (yes, not a great argument, but stick with me for a second) where people outside of his friend group believe Harry to be distant, cold and not very outgoing towards his other housemates and classmates.

eternal_boredoom below stated that they believed that Harry would be very cautious to love and relationships, due to a fear of rejection and abandonment. That is probably very possible.

However, I don't believe that Harry would be the domineering sort in the relationship, at least not at first. My annoyance comes from the fact that in the fanfictions where Harry is the dominant partner in the relationship, he's usually depicted as the dom from the very beginning. In my mind, he would be a cautious and nervous partner at the beginning, but slowly grow into a dominant partner if that is what their core personality is like.

Imagine the cautiousness to be like a series of walls around the very center of his personalities. He has to work his way through those walls before he can be his true self with someone he trusts, like a romantic partner. Having Harry be a dominant, confident partner from the very beginning is absurd and honestly is pretty much the author hand-waving the psychological effects of being mistreated as a child whenever it suits them.

Please feel free to bring up any points you think are prudent. I'm actually enjoying this discussion.

*** While I agree I think that can be different from his sexual motivations and displays of affection.

I'd think he would be more cautious showing affection since he'd always have the fear of people leaving though.

But sexually I think he'd be more sure and dominant since it's something you have a layout to follow, even when you are inexperienced. I do think it would be the only moment where he could be domineering without guilt, sure and steady BC he could act out and ignore all those inner forcer for a bit.

It's just my op though.

** In my Haphne stories, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7037925/1/Living-Dangerously][Living Dangerously]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13341726/1/Living-in-Secret][Living in Secret]] , Harry ends up accidentially filling a more submissive role than usual. Daphne is simply more dominant than him, and he gets a shameful amount of satisfaction from her unexpectedly putting him in his place. And then likewise, there's a similar dynamic when he finally puts his foot down and takes charge of her instead. I write their relationship with an underlying competition of who is the rightful dominant one, which (I feel, anyway) gives a much higher feeling of justification in their feelings for each other than I typically read in other fics.

Behind every King is a Queen who has him wrapped around her little finger - there arent many guys out there, even the domonant ones, who won't do anything their woman asks of them. Admitting this and portraying it in fictional relationships gives adds a more realistic aspect than what we typically see in fantasy relationships.

***** By saying that a guy not being "in charge" makes him into a wimp. While yes, you may not have said that the other way is natural, it still came across as such, which is why you were downvoted and I made my comment. Let me explain.

Yes, both parties should be equal in power. However, "in power" refers to agency, not mindset. A relationship can have a dominant and a submissive member and yet still both sides can be equal in power. They both still have agency over their lives.

What you did in your original comment was assume that "in charge" meant agency (which is deductible from your response to my comment) and then specified that a guy not being "in charge" meant that he was a wimp. In so doing and neglecting to take into account the non-agency based power structure that is always 100% voluntary (as agency enables exit), you implicitly said that a guy who doesn't want to be dominant is a wimp, thereby enabling the facet of toxic masculinity that says the man always has to be on top, or he is weak and pathetic.
