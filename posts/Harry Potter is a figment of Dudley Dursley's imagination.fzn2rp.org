Harry Potter is a alternate personality / coping mechanism so Dudley doesn't have to think about his dad abusing him.

** So in this scenario Hogwarts would be Dudley going to boarding school and being free of Vernon for 9 months?

Oh God, and what if the Dementor attack was a failed suicide attempt? Would tie into how JK created them as a personification of the depression she went through.

*** So the dementor attack in little whinging had Harry defend him, then there was Figg (what does her presence mean? Perhaps she's a concerned neighbor who found him out there?) and afterwards, his father punished him for it.

You could pull an amazingly fucked-up scene with that - Dudley goes out into the field to do something final, argues with himself a bit, all the while a tiny part of his mind (Harry) tells him to hold on and stop. Then, Figg walks by, sees it and pulls him out of it. She brings him home, where Vernon is angry at him for it.

***** The zoo represents feeling trapped. The snake is trapped in it's enclosure, just like Dudley is trapped in unhealthy home situation. Harry, a fragment of Dudley's personality, can literally talk to snakes, which means Dudley can empathise with their situation (and also project on captive animals, because this Dudley really likes projection). The ability to talk to snakes also sets Harry apart from his peers, representing Dudley's fear of being different, of being a freak his parents would hate. Dudley falling into snake's enclosure could be metaphorical, or it could be an actual accident with Dudley breaking the glass/pushing it into the enclosure (he was tapping and leaning on it in canon) and later being punished for it by being locked in his room. Possibly both.

***** The Ton-Tongue toffee could be that he was caught stealing food because he wasn't getting enough, so it was tampered with, to teach him a lesson the next time he took something. Maybe with something that made his mouth and tongue completely numb. This would have served as a quiet warning, rather than outright punishment.

***** Great! now we can end with Dudley fantasizing about the Battle of Howgarts and the apotheosic moment of Harry defeating Voldermort (Vernon's evil personification) only to leave a happily and fulfilling life (Married to a teen crush, having good children, a succesful career, good friends and long-lasting fame).....while in reality he's now an older man, fat, still depress, lonely, no wife, no kids, working on a depressive job...........

****** A better twist on that is that Harry defeating Voldemort is him finally moving away and making a new life as he finally finds love like Harry did at the final moments of the movie/book even if Voldemort/Vernon still haunt him.

** Some additional information :

- It was a one short / had a relatively short chapter count
- It *might* be on an older site as I read going down a rabbit hole of looking for Dudley fics
- Harry Potter technically exists but there certainly was never more than one boy living in that house
- You know you've found it if its got a twist (mind fuck) at the end
