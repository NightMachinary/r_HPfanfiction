Any stories, where Sirius is sorted in Slytherin, his relationship with his family and the other Slytherin kids. Please no Wolfstar. I can't stand that ship.


** Its kind of what you're looking for, but Im writing fic on AO3 linkao3(Eternal Kingdom: A Black Family Memoir; Written By Sirius Orion Black III)

Its about Sirius being the last of the Black family and reminissing on his relationship with each one as he writes the black family memoir. He wasnt sorted into slytherin, but no matter how much he disliked their views he loved every one of them and this is his chance to show the world his family and that they werent all bad.

I used the black family tree as reference and im goint through each Black he would have net in chronological order. I havent gotten to the characters we meet yet but im getting there

Sorry if this wast what your looking for but ive been looking for the type of story youre looking for and havent had luck yet

  The Holy War, they called it. The war where the Crusaders, blessed by the divine gods of old, wielding weapons of holy might, battled the dark god, Loptyr, and destroyed his empire to save all of Jugdral. The heroes that changes Jugdral's destiny, forever, and let it bask in the light for the first time in centuries. This is their story.(FE4 Backstory)

  It's the start of Second year for Lily and the Boys and Lily knows Remus secret. Should she tell? With the way the Gryffindor boys are acting do they deserve to know? Lily Evans and the Marauders comes first but there are only a few references so it's not necessary to read first.
