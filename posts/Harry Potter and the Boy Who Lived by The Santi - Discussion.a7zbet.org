Disclaimer: the fic is still abandoned :(

Additional Disclaimer: I have created a gigantic wall of text, but the gist of it is: I loved Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, and wanted to discuss certain things about the fanfic. See below for discussion points.

As I'm sure many of us here have done, I made the fortunate mistake of reading linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi). I believe that this story is what brought me into the HP fanfiction community.

I really loved this fanfic the first three times I read it, and I just finished rereading it again. To my dismay, the story is still abandoned, and it seems that the author has moved on to bigger and better things. Also to my dismay, I didn't begin reading fanfiction until about 2016, so I missed the opportunity to discuss the story as it was updating with other active readers. In searching through this subreddit, all of the recent threads which pop up in a search for the title are threads asking for recommendations of fics that are similar to Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. As such, I wanted to start a thread and see if others are interested in discussing the story.

For those who may not be aware, additional chapters beyond what is available on fanfiction.net can be found on Dark Lord Potter (which requires an account there), or through googling (I am pretty sure they've been reposted somewhere).

By the end of my most recent reread, I found myself wishing that some sort of plot outline could be posted for the story so that I could have some peace of mind about how the story turns out. However, as I was reading through the comments posted by the The Santi about the story on DLP (I think I read through all of them.. I may be slightly obsessed) I realized that many of the plot events we do have confirmation of were foreshadowed relatively well. I found several points in the story that I don't think have been revealed yet, so without further ado:

#+begin_example
  1. How did Nathan become the BWL in this story?
#+end_example

In canon, Harry becomes the BWL because Lily is given the option to live but refuses, choosing to sacrifice herself for Harry instead. Her sacrifice invokes ancient magic which protects Harry from the one that killed Lily. Thus, Voldemort's killing curse rebounds upon himself.

In HP & TBWL Lily and James are still alive. Nathan and Harry are at Lily's parents' when Voldemort strikes. He kills grandfather, and then uses the Imperius curse so that grandmother will take him to the twins. Nathan was born after Harry, so Voldemort tries to kill him first. The spell pools at Nahan's forehead before rebounding and killing Voldemort. (If you are interested in reading the actual scene, it is chapter 1)

If no one invoked sacrificial magic in order to protect Nathan (presumably Lily's muggle parents cannot do so), how did he survive? Some theories I have come up with, in no particular order:

- Accidental Magic - the whole premise of this story, as stated by the author's description on FFN.net is that Harry is going to become a Dark Wizard. Additionally, he has shown himself to be on par with, or even surpassing, Grindelwald and Dumbledore's skill levels. Could he have performed some sort of accidental magic to save his brother? It is not indicated in the scene at all.

- Prophecy - as far as I am aware, the reader does not know the actual prophecy for this story yet. Voldemort was told part of the prophecy by Snape, and it seems to be simiar to canon in that the last magical child born in July will be Voldemort's downfall. However, the unheard half could be different. Is Nathan simply bound to destroy Voldemort, and therefore cannot die at his hand (yet)? Does some part of the prophecy require that he has part of Tom Riddle's soul in him?

- Different Dark Lords - I think that the canon prophecy never refers to Voldemort by name, only by the title Dark Lord. Could the Dark Lord referred to actually be Nathan's brother, Harry? And therefore, Nathan cannot be killed by another.

#+begin_example
  2. What are Romulus' motivations?
#+end_example

Romulus seems to be the driving force behind much of Harry's extraordinary progress at Durmstrang. It is possible (and likely, in my opinion) that he engineered literally everything that happened to Harry in his first Spring term there. Why is he pushing Harry to excel to unforeseen heights, and what are his end goals? The one thing that is stated in the story is that Romulus will always act for the family. This is stated in several of the meetings between him and Calypso. My theories:

- Revenge - Romulus was probably one of the first Death Eaters recruited by Tom Riddle straight out of his Hogwarts days. Romulus supported him for years, providing Voldemort with both his political power and dueling prowess. In the first war, however, Evan Rosier, Romulus' son was killed and Romulus himself was grievously injured. Romulus' wife then died in childbirth, and he fled Western Europe to try and preserve his family. Could he be looking to take up Voldemort's mantle and punish those who caused him such pain, this time on the shoulders of a Dark Lord he personally groomed?

- Alliance - Romulus could be one of the few who is aware of Voldemort's immortality. He is well versed in the Dark Arts, and may well be aware of horcruxes, the toll they extract upon any creators, and how to detect one. It is known that the Malfoys are aware of Romulus' existence, so they have presumably come into contact with each other after Lucius was given the Diary, and he may have recognized it for what it was. Additionally, Romulus' whereabouts during the summer of the Quidditch World Cup, which is also when Voldemort was plotting in Albania, are unknown. Romulus may very well be preparing for Voldemort's return, and he wants to gift his own personal Dark Lord.

- Power - Romulus is a figure in Roman Mythology who is thought to have founded the city of Rome. I wouldn't normally put too much stock into this, but it seems that The Santi chose the Rosiers and the name Calypso for a reason. Rosier is the patron demon of tainted love and seduction, which could very well be Calypso's role in Harry's life. This is especially likely when you consider that Calypso was a nymph in Greek Mythology who detained Odysseus on the island of Ogygia for precisely seven years (hmm). Additionally, Calypso in mythology has a connotation of deception and seduction (Calypso has so many secrets from Harry, and her original friendship with him was the result of her father's orders), and she also has a connotation of being an obstacle in the way of one's goals. Because of this other evidence, I think it is possible that Romulus' aspirations involve, perhaps not founding a powerful city in his name, but some visions of power and grandeur beyond his current station as an exiled Englishman living in Eastern Europe. To this end, he would essentially just be a big bad villain for the story. This seems rather unlikely, given his aptitude for little tests and hidden plots that he enjoys creating for Harry and Calypso at Durmstrang.

#+begin_example
  3. How is Harry involved in Voldemort's resurrection?
#+end_example

Given that the author went through the effort of getting Harry to Hogwarts and then didn't even put him in the tournament (I was so pissed), it stands to reason that Harry has some role to play in Voldemort and Nathan's confrontation at some point in the year. Given that Nathan doesn't have the blood protection which prompted Voldemort to use Harry's blood in the resurrection ritual in canon, will Voldemort even try kidnapping Nathan? Or will he simply try to kill him? I am assuming that Voldemort and Harry's meeting will involve a lot of emotional pain for Harry, considering that he is unaware Quirrell was possessed by him. Could this be the catalyst for Harry's loss of trust in his family, and his eventual Darkness?

I have my theories, but I want to leave your own uninfluenced by mine.

#+begin_example
  4. How will Harry turn Dark?
#+end_example

At the point where The Santi left off, it seems that Harry is mostly just a happy teenager, albeit a precocious one. What do you think will be the thing that pushes Harry over the edge? There are some obvious ones like Calypso betraying him or dying, Harry discovering all of Calypso's secrets, the Potters turning their backs on Harry for one reason or another. What do you think?

Feel free to discuss any other aspect of the story I haven't mentioned if you'd like to.

Anyways, now that I've spent the first hour and a half of my day writing this, I figure I should get around to actually doing some work. I'll be impressed if anyone makes it this far! Sorry for the wall of text, and thanks for reading!

  1. How will Harry turn Dark?
#+end_quote

That's assuming that the author wanted him to actually go dark as opposed to just being considered dark (which he already is two third of the way there as far as "light" characters are concerned) due to studying dark magic and befriending dark families.

*** That is true. Although I think that one of Romulus' primary goal is to make Harry turn his back on his family, and Voldemort was definitely talking about the Potters abandoning Harry as he delved into the Dark Arts at Durmstrang.

**** I don't know about Romulus, actually. What would the point even be? The vibe I always got from him was just using Harry to get at Nathan, and failing that just hitch his daughter to an overly powerful and well connected wizard for political convenience and general light side espionage.

Regardless, as far as I've read the story (I actually didn't know there were other chapters outside ffnet until this thread) Calypso seems far closer to turning against her father than Harry is. Even Fawkes gave his (tentative) approval to her character.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** My understanding that harry would be dark but not evil. One thing that is unfailing thoughout the fic is the love the Potter family has for each other and I can't really see a situation that isn't completely contrived breaking that apart. I always saw harry using his power to protect his family and brother even at the expense of his reputation among wizarding Britain.

** This story is a mess. I feel like the author wrote themselves into a corner with all the knowledge escalation, not to mention literally wasting everyone's time with all the age line nonsense. Lets add in the poorly written character interactions with everyone who isn't Victor and Calypso, and lets not forget that the fan-favorite Calypso Rosier herself is essentially stolen from the fic "The Black Heir," since, yep, you've guess it, it's a Durmstrang!Harry fic as well.

*** I haven't had a chance to read The Black Heir, I'll make sure to go check it out.

I actually think one of the author's main problems is that they didn't flesh anything out that much. Some fics spend 100k words just on the first year, and this one is at 190k or so, and already at the Yule Ball. With some more scenes and character interactions, like you said, with people who aren't Calypso and Viktor, it would be a lot more cohesive.

The age line was stupid because if the cup actually does judge champions how Dumbledore said it does, then Harry should be the top pick (between being underage, his thirst to prove himself, and the ordeal he went through to actually get to Hogwarts). And either way, Harry should have had Viktor put his name in, and then figure out another way to put in his name himself.

*** Sorry about the random necro here, but which exact fic are you referring to? A search for The black heir gives me about 7-8 different fics.

Is it this one? [[https://fanfiction.net/s/3762636/1/]] ?

** I too just finished my first fanfic read, which was the boy who lived and also feel some sort of dissatisfaction where the story left off. What I feel made me love this story was something the original story didn't dive into details about. With the addition of "end of year projects" and the focus on power at drumstrang, we finally get a wizard school story that is focused more or less on learning magic. Exploring wand movements, advanced charms and spells, dueling stances and habits, and even the use of occulomency vastly opens this world up to be so damn enjoyable in a way the original story lacked.

​

Either way just my 2 cents, I really wish someone that was in cahoots with the author that knew the direction of the story would take over or give an outline so osmeone else can take over. The abandoning of this story right when it should have picked up (revival of voldy at the end of the TWT) is such a disservice. But the person that picks it up needs to do the research into advanced magic to be able to write and keep Harry's progression believable and interesting.

​

As for your two main questions: Nathan becoming the BWL, I highly doubt it will be due to chance. I may be wrong, but didn't they mention voldy killed the grandparents that were taking care of the boys? Maybe they can instill the sacrificial love.

​

Secondly, I believe something happens to Calypso to turn Harry dark. The whole point of Voldy sending harry to drumstrang was so he can be educated to become a strong Death Eater later on in life. What I believe happens is Calypso will be used in someway to turn Harry against the people he loves. Wether he does it by choice in regret, or by losing it through her death at the hands of a weasley (whom his brother will defend as Ron has been used over and over as someone who comes between nathan and harry) and the turning will start at that point. My only issue with it is Harry is looked down on as being a half-blood by all the pure blood Death Eaters.
