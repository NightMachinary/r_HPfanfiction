Be as in-depth as you want.

Here are three questions you can have a crack at:

*1.* Magic as it pertains to the individual; Why are Dumbledore and Voldemort so much more capable than others? /What is their secret?/

*2.* How does innate magical ability turn into spells (incantation/wand movement/focus)?

*3.* How does a "Muggle-born" come to exist?

*4.* Lay out your question and answer it! Go crazy telling us about your theories on magical creatures, mind-magic, Dark & Light magic, horcruxes, non-verbal casting, /souls/ - */Anything!/*


** My theories of magic stem from a single ideal; that the magic itself is not reason enough for the good/bad guy to win. The person behind the magic is the /only/ thing that matters. Therefore:

1. Magic is binary. Yes/No, Magical/Muggle

2. Magic is non-variable; You have the same amount of magic at birth as you do at death.

Let us see how these two concepts affect my worldbuilding:

- Blood purity has no bearing on magical power
- There is no such thing as being overpowered, there is only magical /talent/
- Increasing or decreasing your magical capacity is *impossible*
- Higher-echelon character proficiency (Dumbledore, Voldemort etc) are not unnattainable

DO NOTE, HOWEVER

- Magical control is learned; it takes as much effort to learn finesse as it takes to learn how to cast powerfully. Dumbledore/Voldemort are at the pinnacle of magical control. That is why neither can truly best the other.

- Blood purity is still in politics and creates conflict and drama

- Others character aspects can skew magical ability (hand-eye coordination, information retention, preference to learning styles i.e. do-er vs book-smarts)

- Ways to increase your magical capability do exist (i.e. Occlumency for focus)

Therefore the most magically powerful people are just the same as the intellectually gifted in our own world. There are, of course, people who break the mold: Geniuses. This is what Tom Riddle is. Dumbledore was extremely gifted too, though Tom is half his age and extraordinarily capable.

Because of the above mentioned theories, magically talented people attract followers and fame/infamy because it is really, really /hard/ to get to that level. Not to say you couldn't be a recluse and still be staggeringly competent.

/"There is only power, and those too weak to seek it."/

Too true. The above quote applies to what I have presented.

--------------

But how does one become a Dumbledore?

1. Be intellectually gifted. Be curious; experiment.
2. Allow this curiosity to become your manifest focus in life as you grow and develop.
3. Learn the theory, learn the applications of it. Learn the wand-movements and incantations that bridge the gap between the caster and the magic.
4. Entrench yourself in magic to depths no one else will - it takes too much focus - too much prolonged /hard work/ - to do this.
5. You're now immensely travelled through differing branches of magic. On a subconscious level you understand connections between them that simply can't be taught.
6. You still love magic. You're still curious.

Minus the political experience - you are now Dumbledore.

*** This is pretty much my own model as well.

It also nicely fits in with the "wizards have no common sense" thing: the kind of thought processes that you need to do magic (might be based on expectations, visualization, etc.) are very different to the ones you want for rational decision-making. This is why enchanters and artificers are so rare, because they require two very different specializations.

**** In my headcanon, which is in may ways similar to the above, anything described as 'enchanted' is very likely related to the goblins, who seem to dabble in the business of making high quality magic swords and the like in canon. It may be that their magic is more naturally suited to the marriage of engineering and magic. Perhaps, in the absence of the availability of wands (which they are not allowed to use, legally speaking), they've moved into painstakingly modifying the natural properties of objects without a wand. This would, of course, require immense and detailed knowledge of the materials used in the construction of devices, and precisely how to modify them with magic, leading to a slower, more scientific approach to magic. A structural engineer's take on magic, if you will.

** My theory of magic?

Magic can do anything.

Including preventing others from using magic.

We see the 'laws of magic', and to a one (bar no resurrection) they seem as if they were created by humans. No transfiguring food or money, certain words match certain effects, etc.

So, what's to say they /weren't/ created by humans.

In my headcanon, it was Merlin who imposed the Law of Death's Dominion, a magical law that prevented people who had died from returning to the mortal realm. His reasons were twofold; firstly, he was at war with a dark witch and her son, each of which were willing to sacrifice others in order to hold onto the mortal coil. Secondly, there was a rash of wizards trying to imitate a story that had come out of the Middle East, of a wizard who was crucified and came back to life three days later. Wizards and witches were unable to be ended, protected from mental harm and now mortal wounds too? It was too much. Thus he spent near a century creating the Law. It was a ward of immense power that covered the globe, anchored to a piece of granite weighing several tons, covered in mixed Latin script and Ancient Egyption glyphs, buried in a spot that he then hid from the minds and memories of all who lived. And so it was that as long as the anchor remained, death was an end, even to the greatest of spellcasters. And yet. And yet. The first wizard that is recorded to have found a loophole is commonly known as Herpo the Foul. Through experimentation, he found that the wording of the wards, and the way they functioned, prevented a person from returning to life if their /entire/ soul had passed through the Veil. As long as even a small piece remained, they could pass freely across the Styx.

It was several centuries later that we come across a further set of established Laws. Gamps Laws, rules that prevent one from transfiguring food or coinage. Gamp was an expert at transfiguration, but a true master at divination and fate magics. Using his skill at scrying he found the location of the Lost Tower, and spent the next twenty years learning Ancient Assyrian, or Babble, or Allspeak. It was in this language he intended to protect his greatest possessions, his farmland. For the Gamp family owned thousands of acres of quality farmland, folded into non-space, farmed by golems that had been worked on by his family for generations. The reason for this protection? A new development in Goblin magics, allowing for the food of one species to be transfigured into another, allowing the Goblin foods, rocks, to be transfigured and sold into the human markets, severely undercutting Gamp's profits. And so it was that Gamp prevented further food based transfiguration, with a ward that extended from one side of the world to the other. It wasn't long before Gamp's boasting to reach Goblin ears, however, and after failing to demand that Gamp release his Law, they gave him a choice, an equivalent ward to the Goblin's benefit or war on the Gamp line. And so it was that the Goblin's received their own Law, preventing the forgery of coinage.

What was interesting about Gamp's laws is that they circumvented a lot of the loopholes in Merlin's work via two factors. Firstly, they were simpler and more broadly written. This allowed for more powerful spellcasters to overpower the wards, but left them much more resilient to everyday spellcasting. Secondly, and more importantly, Gamp used Fate magic to enforce the laws, rather than simple opposition. Instead of overpowering every attempt to perform an action, Gamp's Laws were instead designed to make it so that every attempt to break the Laws was met with crippling and dangerous misfortune in proportion to the intent of the person breaking the Law. For instance, should a man attempt to change a Galleon into a Sickle, just as a parlour trick, he might find he slips as he tries to cast, or is distracted by a conversation partner or lost acquaintance. However, someone who was deliberately trying to turn a mound of refuse into newly minted Galleons might find themselves breaking their wand when they lay out their calculations, find a meteor landing on their head, or spontaneously combust should they attempt the spell. This allowed the ward to expend little amounts of power for small infractions, but use a great deal more to discourage overt and deliberate attempts.

This is my theory of magical wards.

Secondly, on the innate power of certain spellcasters, species and languages.

It has been noted that several mages are considered to be vastly more powerful than their peers. This is an idea that has been propagated by stories of Merlin, Mab and more recently the likes of Grindelwald, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and Albus Dumbledore. These wizards and witches are held as paragons of power, and make the individual on the street feel shortchanged in their allotment of power. This is, however, a misconception of many layers, spawned by assigning a single cause where multiple explanations are needed.

It is well known to the common man, thanks to the wonderful Theory of Magic, that each magical being generally functions in one of two ways. Either they have a limited pool of magic to draw from, which is commonly referred to as a Magical Core, but is more accurately analogous to a Well or Reservoir, and is generally found among certain Hedge Wizards, purely active spellcasters, and those who have had synthetic bounds placed upon their magic. The second form, which is found in most witches and wizards and almost all magical creatures, is that of a Magical Channel, a 'waterway of the soul', allowing one to draw upon ambient and freely available magic to cast their spells. This is best seen in the great ward arrays, such as at the Third Temple of Jerusalem, or Hogwarts, or, as referred to further up this document, the myriad of Magical Laws imposed by spellcasters in the past four millennia.

So, what is it that separates the power of various Channel based mages?

The simplest explanation, that widely applies to a good number of the tales of the greats, is simply skill. Men such as Grindelwald, and Women such as Mab, each of which were known for their potency in battle, are well recorded as being academics in their formative years. They spent decades working on battle magic, dark magic and spells lost to the dusty corners of libraries. Dangerous magics became attuned to them, and as such they cast them with greater finesse and greater speed. This is the first of several factors. The second, is the 'width' of their channel. It is well known that of the channel casters, there are those who can cause greater effects in a short amount of time, even from the first time they hold a focus. Generally these individuals, of which Albus Dumbledore is the greatest known example in the modern age, are witches and wizards who can simply access /more/ in a short amount of time, at the cost of lack of finesse. It is to be noted that Dumbledore suffered from accidental magic all the way into the first decade of his second century, and is quoted as recommending regular practice at fine and delicate magics for those who are similarly powerful, lest they never develop control over the torrent of magic they have access to.

Another factor is will. Each of the individuals I have mentioned in this work, including Merlin and Gamp, were known to be exceptionally focused and headstrong individuals, a trait that is oft put forth as the greatest factor for one's magical power.

Similarly, these traits can also be found among the greats of other species, such as Ragnok II of the Goblins, or Icarus the Unchained of the Phoenixes.

This leads onto language and species based magics, another common misconception in the current political climate of the wizarding world. It is commonly accepted among the common man in wizarding Europe that Latin is the go to language for standardized spells, and yet, despite that, every language used commonly across the world has spells formed in that language. Rune specialists will tell you that all language has power, names doubly so. Different languages hold certain /bents/, which a cunning spellcaster can use to their advantage. For example, it was well known in the seventh century that Norse battle spells, particularly for fervor or resilience were second to none, which was why several centuries previous the Nordic nations crushed the remnants of the previously superior Roman Empire. Similarly, healing spells have been found to work distinctly better in Gaelic or Parseltongue than in other, more common languages. It is only due to the abbreviation and standardization of current Latin-based spellcasting first taught at Hogwarts, that the common man in Europe uses one or two word latin spells everyday.

It is this social perception that the standardized spells, such as /lumos/, is more civilized and efficient than the various chant based spells found in other languages that has reduced variation in European spells. This idea was originally ushered in by the 13th century staff of Hogwarts, attempting to overcome language barriers from across the British Isles, but was more fervently put forward by the French Government in an effort to allow their much greater variety of attendees to learn the same spells.

It is with the variation in magical languages that I now speak further.

It has been noted over the centuries that the magical languages spoken by sapient non-humans have their own inherent specialties and weaknesses. For instance, Parseltongue, originating with the Nagas of India, is especially good for death magic, healing and detection spells, but is very poor for accounting charms and kitchen charms. Theorists have suggested that this is because the language specialized to what its creators needed their magic to do on a regular basis. It is to be noted, that despite the weaknesses, the /SsssksSsSss/ charm is a perfectly acceptable counting charm, that all right minded Parselmounths should

*** know.

Similarly, the skinning and navigation charms commonly known to Mermish spellcasters are found to all work better beneath water, but are still capable of functioning above ground.

It was in the late 17th century, during the upturn of the pureblood movement, that a mistruth about magical languages was spread to discredit Martin Patrick during the 17th meeting of the International Confederation of Wizards. It was suggested that only those born with a talent for a language, or a member of the language's respective magical race could learn the spells and words. In this particular campaign, it was the suggestion that M. Patrick was a decedent of Salazaar Slytherin due to his talent with Parseltongue, rather than that he had learnt the language through hardwork and study. Investigation has shown that any species and any status of magical being /can/ learn any magical language, but that certain bloodlines, and certain species have a strong predilection towards certain magical languages, with several recorded instances of instinctive speakers of magical languages e.g. Parselmouths of the Slytherin line being able to speak Parseltongue from birth, or members of the Hooch line being Featherthroats, able to speak to birds from their seventh birthday.

During the investigations of the learning of a magical language one has no particular magical talent for, it was also found that regular use of a language often caused physical or mental changes in the user. It has, for instance, been noted that Parselmouths literally have a Parcel (split) tongue, that forms whenever a practiced user speaks the language. Similarly, records from the Firebird tribe in Nepal indicates that those who learn the Songs of the Phoenix (the equivalent of a language for Phoenixes), find themselves unable to appreciate melodies or non-rhythm based music, finding such sound grating and a mishmash of words that fail to resolve themselves. It is this side-effect of the Songs that Albus Dumbledore is quoted as the reason he did not learn the language himself, despite his vast library of known magical languages.

On inborn talents and family magics.

The Metamorphmagus is the greatest single example of an inborn family magic. Oft found among the Black family of Britain, as well as several tribes of the Far East, Metamorphmagic is commonly found in the descendants of specialized transfiguration masters, or in the children of those who have learned the talent through sheer hard work. The talent is more obvious in certain lines than others, and is only well documented in Britain, due to the Black family. As with all magical talents, a dedicated spellcaster or magical being can certainly imitate the innate ability through focusless wordless magic, but at the cost of egregious time and effort. Benedict 'The Manyface' Lucker, is the most recently recorded learned Metamorph, and in his autobiography and textbook 'Surpassing Ones Form' the skill took him twelve years of focused study to emulate, and nineteen years to have down to the same level as a natural born Metamorphmagus. Magical language talents are commonly easier to learn, with the record for the learning of Featherbeak being two weeks under wit-sharpening and memory-enhancing potions.

It has also been noted by various scholars that family magics can contaminate non-relatives in close proximity. In the 15th century, a 'muggleborn' ward of the Abbot family inherited the family magics of both a propensity for healing and an 'animagus' form similar to a conscious cloud of Nundu breath, the latter of which has never been recorded as being seen outside the Abbot family and those they adopt. Similar 'theft' of family magics has been recorded across the world in various families to adoptees and godchildren.

I won't go into my theories on Muggleborns. For anyone who's read this far, congratulations!

TL;DR Magic is free to do whatever the fuck it wants, and anyone can probably achieve anything given sufficient time, skill and motivation.

***** On the phenomena of the Muggleborn

Throughout the centuries, various movements ascribing power to blood purity of various kinds have attempted to discredit those born to mundane-folk, the Muggleborn. Missives found under stasis charms in Athens show that even three thousand years ago, there were attempts to mitigate and undermine new blood in the predominantly family based political system of the Athinian Conclave. The only magical civilization where such evidence /is not/ available is in Ancient Assyria, under Nimrod's rule, which achieved what appears to be a true meritocracy, for all of a century. However, such a lack of evidence does not in fact prove that there was no prejudice, and given other attempts to unify magicals, it seems unlikely that they succeeded. So, throughout history, there has been a group continuously slandered and diminished, labelled as weak magic, or weak tradition. But who are they?

It was the Bangladeshi equivalent of the British Department of Mysteries that has the earliest recorded study on the origins of Muggleborns. The department took the blood of Muggleborn criminals in exchange for a reduced sentence, and performed a mixture of scrying and blood magic that traced the powerful Names in the samples. What was found was a varied group of results. Some had powerful wizards in their pasts, and the department suggested that they were likely sired either as bastard lines, or from disowned squib lines, as far back as six generations. There were some, however, that had no such lineage.

Thus, we have to look at a more recent study performed by Perenelle Flamel, renowned licensed blood mage and consulting interior decorator. In this experiment, in a deviation from standard blood testing, rather than attempting to trace a lineage, she traced the line of magical succession back. In this experiment, she found that a disturbingly high number of Muggleborns had /no/ magical succession. They had no family magic, no conditioned and practiced specializations. All they had was a free talent, a capability for adapting to whatever magic they chose. Another disturbing factor was that the majority of the 'Muggleborns' that had this wild, unatuned magic were the ones born from squibs or bastards.

It was the correlation between Muggleborns with innate talents and the /lack/ of magical heritage that confused Mdm Flamel. As she noted in her book, 'The Muggleborn Dilemma', it seems that truly new blood witches and wizards are /more/ likely to have talents, rather than less. Not /very/ likely, but more than those of wizarding get.

So what is the explanation?

It was the newblood Muggleborn John Dee, renowned for his innate talent for Enochian, the language of Angels, that came forth with a working theory; new magicals were being chosen. Dee assisted Mdm Flamel in an extension of her project, analyzing the birth circumstances of these Muggleborn. It was found that a surprising number were seventh children, or born under the new or full moon. These true Muggleborns were found to most often be born on the third, seventh and thirteenth of each month, and if they had talents, they were often arithmantically significant in relation to the child's birth date. Another oddity, that was originally ascribed to poor bookkeeping, but has since been established as fact, is that more prophecies are made about true Muggleborns than any other group per capita, and they more often go on to have a significant effect on their local government, as noted by Septimus Weasley in several editorials.

Thus it is that a conclusion can be made. Firstly, is that most Muggleborns, of any birth, are likely to have no talent, other than a general penchant for everything. Secondly, Muggleborns with no wizarding ancestors are more likely to be 'important'. Thirdly, is that this 'importance' is often an overturning of established tradition, leading to the conclusion that the prejudice against Muggleborns is /warranted/ when coming from the conservative sections of the wizarding world.

CrtMg Dee, in his grimoire, stated that it was likely that Magic, noted as semi-sentient by most, if not all magical scholars, is choosing competent champions born of fresh blood. An alternative theory, posited by Henri Malfoy was that a fate-based Magical Law had been created to preference truly new blood giving them, "an advantage neither earned nor warranted, unfit for the dignified lines, tamed and cultured, created just to spite those whose birthright is magic". Since an anchor for such a ward has not been found (despite the pureblood lobby's best efforts), there appears to be no easy way to distinguish whether Magic herself, or a synthetic Magical Law, is the reason for this phenomenon.

Some scholars say that the two scenarios are one and the same, and that the purebloods should "put up or shut up" on the issue.

Do you want a Dark Magic one as well?

On the Classification and Regulation of 'Dark' Magic

Dark Magic is a term that has been bandied around since the first time a magical being turned on another and hurt them.

Given that the most common form of accidental magic is defensive, that likely means that the very first use of magic /ever/, was shouted down as being dark or demonic.

Throughout the millennia, the definitions for dark magic have changed repeatedly and inconsistently. Britain has at various points in history considered all rituals to be dark magic, formulaic Latin-based magic to be dark magic, and even basic transfiguration to be dark magic. What dark magic actually is, is a topic for a great deal of debate, much of which can be summarized as personal opinion.

If we look at the current definition employed by both the British Ministry of Magic and their French equivalent we can see that several generalizations are made in the definition.

'Dark magic is any magic used to commit a crime that has not been cleared by the Department of Mysteries.'

A simple definition, created in 1897, which shortened a set of legal definitions that required a feather-light charm in order for its 22,000 page bulk to be moved from its pedestal in the Ministry Archives.

What this law encompasses, is the idea that magic can do /anything/. It is a reasonable assumption that if one makes an exclusive set of rules for what defines dark magic, within the month someone would have invented something just different enough not to count. Thus it is, that the British system involves a system of whitelisting. Surprisingly, the Department of Mysteries claims that each year they declare exactly one seventh of the spells or magics brought before them dark magic.

The British Department of Mysteries co-operates with most ICW countries in keeping black lists of magic that is unequivocally dark. These lists are separated into several categories based on potential harm to both the caster and any recipients, and each country is known to have further lists that cover magics that not everyone can agree is dark.

In the most dangerous category that is published by the International Confederation of Wizards are such magics as Fiendfyre pacts, demon summoning, the cruciatus curse (oddly enough on the list for its harm to the /user/, not the subject) and memeticly breeding viruses. These are magics that the ICWs suggest are completely banned in all ICW nations, punishable with life sentences or execution, with all written documentation helpful in replicating the magic destroyed.

Several countries are known to allow certain spells on this list to be legal under extremely well controlled licence or while under extreme duress, but this is against the wishes of the ICWs.

Lower level lists include such things as blood magic, soul magics, magical cross-breeding, and several explicitly named curses that have no purpose but to harm. These lists come with a recommendation that only licensed individuals who are trained or training in their use should be allowed knowledge of their functioning. The British Ministry of Magic allows all the above listed to be practiced under licence commissioned by the Department of Mysteries.

Another notable exemption in Britain is for Family Magics. As long as a Family Magic is not used to commit a crime that is prosecuted with the caster found guilty, said Family Magic cannot come under review with the Department of Mysteries. This is a deviation from the standard law, which only requires that it be brought to trial. This was an amendment put into place by David Rosier only three hours after the base law was passed in Wizengamot.

However, rumor suggests that beyond the lists held by the International Confederation of Wizards, is a blacklist compiled by the peacekeeping force of the International Confederation of Warlocks, unavailable to public eye, not even names. If so, one must consider how much worse than those in the most dangerous public list, these magics must be. When questioned Albus Dumbledore, Grand Sorcerer for the Internation Confederation of Warlocks, was silent on the matter of this secret blacklist. If this list does exist, it can be assumed that knowledge of such magics has been purged, in order to protect the public from aspiring Dark Lords.

But, despite bureaucratic definitions, is there some fundamental property of certain magics that makes them malignant? The answer, surprisingly, is yes.

The example, above, of the cruciatus curse, on the most dangerous public list, was noted as not being due to the damage it caused the target. In order to understand the damaging nature of the curse, some history must be taken into account.

Several times throughout history, wizards and witches have established themselves as patrons to magicals, offering power in exchange for power, or law, or control. An example would be Zeus, a born talented wind elemental, naturally able to freely manipulate storms and lightning. Several millennia ago, he created a form of immortality in conjunction with a mage known as Nyx, allowing for wizards to hide away their bodies, whilst allowing them to trade magical expertise in the world. This lead to Zeus offering his talent for lightning manipulation in exchange for worship, which was a form of intent he could draw power from. Since then, several wizards and witches followed Zeus and Nyx's example, becoming paragons of a concept in order to become immortal and grow in power. Eventually, the practice was put a stop to with the Law of Death's Dominion, which proved that these witches and wizards had hidden themselves away in death. Despite this, some variations on the practice kept on, essence or form placed in space folded in on itself.

One of the wizards who attempted this was Emeric the Evil, a man who tore himself in half. Knowledge of how he simultaneously existed to offer magic, and to hold the Elder Wand is lost, but during the time when he was offering his expertise in harmful magic, he invented the cruciatus curse.

In exchange for the power of the curse (or any other that Emeric offered), one had to give up their innocence and their patience with those who wronged them. Thus it is that all users of the curse have found themselves devolving into beings that hate and hurt, with little care for the consequences.

And thus it is that the cruciatus is not only dark magic, but Dark Magic. Other spells offered by evil patrons, or spells invented by the progeny of Dark magic, or even spells created through divination during a murder, are all considered Dark. Though each can have different effects, they are corrupting and dangerous to the user.

It should be noted that one of the spells that Emeric offered was one to brush the casters teeth. While the spell is successful, due to its origins, casting the spell is damaging to one's psyche. There are far better toothbrushing charms, that don't lead to permanent insanity.

So, I'm going to go to bed, as this is getting silly, and it's past midnight here. However, there's another topic I was thinking of doing, should you want to hear it, which is Grimoires. If you (or someone else) thinks they'd want to hear it, I'll write it in the morning.

********* On the Storage and Recording of Magic

Grimoires

A feature of all magical civilization to date is the necessity to record and quantify magic. From the insides of the Black Pyramids to the Library of Alexandria, wizards, witches and magical creatures have been recording their observations and developments since before the first examples of codified writing. Cave paintings showing how to cast prey finding and skinning charms, written by Mediterranean Sirens before the formation of Babylon are indicative of this desire as the longest single theme to be found anywhere in the study of magic.

It of no surprise, therefore, that considerable time and magic has been expended in the pursuit of greater forms of storage, better organizing of ideas, and the securing of developments. It is said that the greatest focus of magic in a building will always be the library, and such a statement is backed up both by my own anecdotal evidence, and sound logic.

Books (and by extension scrolls, tablets and other such works) have therefore been the greatest focus of magic and magical development in the world. This has come about from several factors, which I will describe below.

Firstly is simple magical mutation. Objects that are left in close proximity to large sources and uses of magic often take on aspects of that magic in left for sufficient duration. Examples of this might be found in the Black library, which has had several of its works develop rude sentience and a taste for the blood of innocents; it is recorded that a significant number of the books in the Black library have developed rudimentary fangs of hardened and sharpened page corners. Similarly, some of the books therein have developed enchantments that encourage blood thirsty behaviour in their readers, reinforcing the already barbaric behaviour typical of the Blacks.

Thus ambient magic has an often reinforcing effect on the information storage.

Another example of magical books is such works as the Monster Book of Monsters, a deliberately enchanted work on dangerous beasts that is of itself a dangerous beast. Similarly, the Invisible Book of Invisibility is a tome deliberately enchanted so that only those who have expertise in detection spells can read it. These works are a separate category of magical texts that test the reader before allowing the acquisition of the knowledge contained, a rudimentary warding system to protect the knowledge from curious eyes.

However, development of magical books has gone significantly further than that, and one of the greatest ongoing attempts has been for a Tome Focus, allowing a spellcaster to use a tome in place of wand or talisman. It is generally known that any sufficiently enchanted object can be used as a focus of some sort, and that the Roman standardization of the wand has become commonplace in most of the western magical world. However, development of tome foci has continued, despite numerable, and amusing, failures.

The first recorded example is of Serra the Foolish, a Phoenix from the Nilgiri tribe, who attempted to embed its song into written form, allowing one to channel magic into it for an effect. Upon each page was recorded a Song, detailed enough and enchanted enough that it would play back the music should one will it to. The following disaster caused the Nilgiri tribe to move mountains and quarantine Serra's home, even two millennia later.

Consultation with the Nilgiri tribe's elder, Vulcan the Godlike, has brought forth the conclusion that the enchanting of so many pages tied together in shared basis, but not intent allowed for the rapid disintegration and Song propagation that caused the formation of the Singing Mountain of Nilgiri.

Similar failures, of multipurpose book based foci, have been found across most magical civilizations. The consensus, up until the 19th century was that books were so complicated, and a tome foci so varied, that there could be myriad intent imbued in such a tome, and little control. This was finally overturned in the mid 1800s after nearly a century of attempted unification of the American schools of magic. Originally sponsored by the professor of enchanting at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a competition to develop a method of transport between the larger schools became a focus for development. Early examples included George Sootstain's Book of Myriad Portals, that caused the Bermuda rift, and Dancia Culemben's Tome of the Swift Wind, which caused the deaths of no less than twenty wizards and witches during its testing phase. Non-book foci were created for the challenge, and were found to have limited success, yet the American community was gripped in a fervor of research into Tome Foci. Eventually, in 1847, a solution was developed at the infamous Miskatonic University, by an assistant researcher in the field of blood and skin magics, who was asked to create a pamphlet to allow for introduction to the university for prospective students from other institutions by The Dean.

So it was, that the assistant created a pamphlet of bound apparition-expert skin, knitted together with diricawl feathers, which allowed for both instant transport between Ilvermorny, Salem and Miskatonic, but also the entrance of Akren and the ICW building in Rome, though the last two are considered to be accidents. Despite the gruesome nature of the construct, it was the first evidence that such a focus could be made, and be stable, despite the... less conventional effects that the pamphlet could have. Reproductions of the pamphlet with less distasteful materials have been found to work, but only when enchanted by someone fully focused on the project.

Further development of book-based foci has been a subject of much interest in recent years, and despite the low success rate, Tome Foci are beginning to be accepted as a possibility for the common man, even if they are still fairly dangerous. The largest currently known Grimoire focus, is a reenchanted version of the Necronomicon, again developed at Miskatonic University in the 1950s. The International Confederation of Warlocks is reported to have immediately destroyed the tome once it was found to function. Research is ongoing.

Another form of magical book is the Grimoire. Separate from book-based foci, Grimoires are enchanted books designed to hold a spellcaster's thoughts and designs. Various Grimoires have been made throughout the centuries, enchanted to speak, bred to think, or created to never end, they have been targets of treasure seekers and researchers alike. An example is the Trelawney Grimoire, a document that is reputed to have been enchanted using Cassandra Trelawney's eyes, imbuing the reader with the ability to See slightly into the future, while also documenting several divination techniques. Reading the book is said to be distinctly unnerving, as a perpetual sense of deja vu follows the reader, as they reads sections that they have already Seen themselves read.

At the other end of the spectrum are Grimoires such as the Potter Grimoire, a book supposedly focused on wards, but is a bred creature, rather than enchanted tome. The Grimoire was at one point supposedly placed in the Dippet library after the Potter family defaulted on a debt to the Dippets. The story goes that the Dippets, after failing to read the Grimoire, placed it within their library and went to sleep. When they awoke in the morning, they found their library in tatters, the Potter Grimoire covered in ink, and significantly thicker, smugly sitting on the main reading lectern. In a fit of anger, Armando Dippet attempted to destroy the Grimoire, only to find that the Grimoire vanished as he cast his spell. It was later found to have returned to the Potters. The loss of the Dippet library is believed to be one of the factors that led to Armando Dippet taking up the role of Headmaster of Hogwarts, in order to have access to the library.

Such tactics as bibliophagic Grimoires, and copying Grimoires are commonplace among family and individual works, especially when espionage and theft have been the author's objective. Such is to be expected when one's most valuable possession is knowledge, and so this author recommends that you protect your library, whether that means vetting all new books, or keeping copies in a vault somewhere.

In a somewhat amusing turn of events, it should be noted that the Potter family is thought to have lost their /own/ library to their Grimoire as well, it having only stored the information on wards contained within, destroying the rest of their works. They then lost the Grimoire. Fate is ever fickle.

I expect I will be writing a fic about the Potter Grimoire at some point, as most of it is already planned out.

** I have a different account every story. In one, you might have a genetic power level. In another, it might be some circumstance of your birth. In a third, it's practice, or skill with subtle wand movements, or pure learning, or rituals. A couple times I've written that mages have souls but muggles don't, which has a few interesting implications. (As an aside, I try to keep the same feel to magic as canon, but I don't care too much to keep the trappings the same.)

As an aside, I'm not sure why people don't tend to talk about power-increasing rituals. For instance, in Temporal Beacon, Harry and Hermione both eschew a power-increasing ritual that requires drinking blood and vomiting into a skull. Kind of gross, but if anyone's blood would work and the person wasn't using the skull at the time, what's the problem?

** Okay, sorry I'm a bit late, but I thought I would add in my thoughts, because they have been knocking about in my head for a while now

I envision individual magic as a two part system. The first part is a reservoir of magical energy, which can be colloquially called a Magical Core in the West, or Ki in the East, which contains within it the energy that Magical beings draw on. This reservoir is replenished by natural power sources, such as ley lines, moonlight, sunlight, and the like. These power sources are ranked differently depending on the 'magnitude' of energy they afford, so something like an intersection of 3 ley lines, offers more power than the intersection of two, which offers more power than just drawing from moonlight, which is more than sunlight etc. This means that what magical beings are in effect doing is they are drawing energy from other sources and storing it in a place they can use it, which is their magical core. The mechanism by which witches and wizards absorb energy is natural, but it can be accelerated through the use of rituals (more on this later), artifacts, or runic/arithmantic arrays. For example, Hogwarts sits on the intersection of several ley lines, which allows for its students to recover their magical energy quickly, whilst also simultaneously providing incredible strength to its wards. All magical beings have a core, from Goblins to Human Witches and Wizards, to Veela, to Merpeople. What sets them apart is ultimately their knowledge, and how they apply themselves. Something interesting to note is that the presence of reservoirs of magical energy for individuals suggest that there can be wild ones, unattached to an individual, and this is absolutely true. Wild magic can pool in areas as ley lines shift and move, or remain locked in a pattern that collects magical energy in certain ways. This natural pooling is what leads to the evolution of magical creatures. As exposure to the magic changes them, they learn to access it, and it imparts some of measure of intelligence on them. Once a magical pool has been created, it can be drawn on, or added to by anyone who knows how to manipulate magical energy, and will replenish so long as there are sufficient sources to supply it.

The second aspect to magical being's ability is their 'channel'. This is what allows them to manifest their magical power. If we think of the magical core as a well, which is constantly being replenished by water, the channel is a path of least resistance through the surrounding area. Most witches and wizards are born with a relatively small channel(s), which are geared towards their magical tendencies. This effectively provides their magic with a 'wavelength' which is matched by certain combinations of wood and wand core, in wands. When a witch or wizard uses a wand the 'chooses' them, they are essentially amplifying their magical output, by a mechanism similar to constructive interference. Through training, such as at Hogwarts, a witch or wizard learns how to expand their channel, allowing for more easy use of magic. A witch or wizard's channel (and therefore wand) provides them with their magical 'preferences' such as a tendency towards charms, or transfiguration, etc. This channel is like a muscle, and grows through use. Difficult spots, areas that a given user are not geared towards can be forced through (like someone not having as naturally strong legs as opposed to arms), and so when someone graduates after their magical education, they are essentially more well rounded than they were going in, despite having found some subjects easier or better suited to them. Its worth noting that the factor that separates human magical beings from other magical creatures is the wand. It doesn't necessarily focus the magic (although it does provide a 'path of least resistance'), it instead amplifies the power output, but constructively adding to the caster's intentions. This makes humans much more versatile and dangerous, because their weaknesses are reduced, and their strengths amplified by their wand-craft. It also means that someone can be born with a very naturally deep magical core (a lot of power), but no means to channel that, in effect making someone a squib. This provided the explanation for muggleborn witches and wizards as well, as it suggests that if two muggles with sufficiently large cores can cause a channel to be created by forcing an opening. It is therefore the channel that provides magical ability, and the core that provides strength

This combination translates magical ability to spells in an interesting way. A lot of the spells we see are Latin-based. I postulate that throughout human history, various religions and cultures have worshiped gods who were in fact very powerful witches and wizards. These beings recognized that if they could get enough beings worshiping them, they could get them to voluntarily sacrifice power into a magical reservoir, which could then be drawn on at their leisure. This suggests that prayer as non magical people might know it, are in fact small spells that sacrifice a small portion of a beings magical core to a communal core. So when witches and wizards are first learning how to shape the energies held within them, they use language to draw on the 'natural tendencies' of the magical energy contained within their chosen pool. Instead of Latin, one might choose Greek, or Assyrian, or Egyptian. Latin was chosen simply because around the time of magical schooling's inception, Latin was the dominant language. So as budding witches and wizards use Latin, the magic they draw from is mostly their own, but it carries with it the 'flavor' of previous magic users, which makes it easier initially. That is why, when people transition to non-verbal, it is so much harder. Because they have to learn to shape their power without the guiding influence of a beneficially communal magical pool.

I also suspect that the ICW is rather keen to maintain Latin as the chosen language for safety/political reasons. We know magic is powered by intent, and the worship of Romans was (comparatively) much more civilized than some more ancient cultures, which used sacrifice and pain in their worship. This would have provided much more power to the reservoir, but would also make the magic more dangerous as a result. We know that ancient spellweavers wielded massive amounts of power, and could construct things that 'seem' to have been lost to wizard-kind today. This is in reality, due to the sheer amount of energy they had to draw on.

A quick note on rituals. I see rituals as any magic requiring a sacrifice that alters the performer. As a result, most Ministries label rituals as dark, but in reality the distinction lies between whether the individual is voluntarily sacrificing something, or whether it is involuntary. Voluntary sacrifice allows for the extremely powerful 'light' rituals, but the sacrifice must genuinely be voluntary and altruistic, which is why they are so hard. To sacrifice in this way (see Jesus Christ, Odin Son of Buri, and Harry Potter), requires a certain level of altruistic intent most people going into a ritual won't have. They might want power, or wealth or prosperity etc. and so they have a selfish intent behind it, which clouds the ritual. So in essence, to avoid this possible confusion and danger, most Ministries outlaw ritual magic for fear of perversion of good witches and wizards towards darkness.

Just an extension of general magical theory I liked as well. I like the idea that magical disciplines taught at school are precursor version of more complicated deeper magic. Transfiguration is the precursor to Alteration, Charms is the precursor to Spellweaving, Runes/Arithmancy is the precursor to Artificing/Enchanting, Potions is the precursor to Alchemy, DADA is the precursor to Destruction Magic (Elemental Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Lightning etc.), stuff like that. Most of these are investigated down in the various Departments of Mysteries around the world, as they require a level of focus, control and caution most do not have time for.

I have much more, but this is already getting long, so ask me if you want me to expand on anything, and I will :)

** I like the idea that there are people who are innately more powerful than everyone else. They may be people who better in one subject (like Neville, or Harry) and there could be people who good in all of them (like Hermione). I would say that intelligence helps you cast the spells more powerfully/easily. Like Hermione is more likely lets say to be able to cast the spells, but Harry (maybe) might have more innate power than her. Like Crabbe(or was it Goyle) cast Fiendfyre, while we aren't told if it is a difficult spell it would make sense that it would be if it's able to destroy horcruxes, so Croyle would I guess have more innate power since he doesn't seem to have much intelligence.

Muggleborns:\\
There is the idea of everyone without Magic is a squib, but just doesn't know it. Then there is the idea of people in the pastline or one of the parents being a squib. Then there is the rape idea of death eaters raping a muggle and them having child, but I would think that they would just kill them instead of obliviation. Of course it could just be a not-deatheater wizard and they might be okay with rape and memory modification but not killing.\\
So one of those ideas.

Luna's Visions:\\
I would say that she has either a disorder, a magical power(and she just doesn't know the actual names of the things for it), or she just decides to believe them. All of those could make sense. I like the Magical Power one the best.

Wands/Spells:\\
I like the idea that spells are mainly Intent, you have to want it to happen, but of course it makes it easier to have the intent if you are saying words and waving your wand in a manner which you believe will do it. Of course you can also have so they just help the spell without having to have as much intent powering the spell.

** 1) In my theory, magic is a skill that only some people (wizards) can learn. Magic requires both artistic talent and technical understanding. It's a skill similar to playing the piano, painting, or architecture. Casting a spell is like writing a poem or singing a song. On one side there are technical aspects you have to pay attention to in order to make a decent song. On the other side songs also have to have a spark of artistry/creativity/meaning to elevate the work to something truly good. By understanding the theory and methodology of spellcasting, and combining that with an innate creativity/"magicalness" , a wizard can create a spell to enact change on the world.\\
Extremely powerful wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort are not amazing wizards because they more "magical energy" or mana or whatever, but because they are extremely skilled. They have incredible mystical insight into the nature of magic paired with a deep technical understanding of spellcasting. Their secret is that they're just that good.

2)How do words on a page turn into a poem or how do notes in a a sequence turn into a song? Incantations and wand movements are symbols that come together to tell a story, to evoke a certain response from the world. These symbols exist objectively in the world and can be discovered and analyzed.

3) I have no idea. My fanon (which is contradicted by JK Rowling) is that magical ability isn't caused by some physical factor such as genetics or biology. My guess is magic has a more spiritual cause, perhaps wizards have slightly different souls then muggles or something.

4)Magic works on deeply conceptual fairy tale like rules. Love and hate aren't just emotions that exist only in your head but are incredibly powerful metaphysical forces that exist in the world. They are just as real as gravity, even more real probably since magic can fuck with gravity but can't really mess with Love. When Dumbledore says that the power of Love saved Harry, he's talking in a very metaphorical way.

** They worked harder to get to where they were. Albus and Voldemort both trained extensively for years, sure they have prodigious skill as well, but in the end, it comes down to how hard you work the magic.

I think that, as long as you have the general idea of what you want to happen, it will. Kinda like how Harry, Tom, etc.. were able to use Magic earlier than others, they had intent, it's all about intent in magic.

no-maj-borns, came into existence by most likely appearing in many generations of squib. The magic most likely cultivated, over the generations, until someone came out who was finally able to use it.

Dark Magic and Light Magic, don't actually affect the person that's using them. While this has been proven many times in the series, I feel like people keep using it as a trope, so that Harry won't use any dark spells to get the upper hand in a battle. I would also like to state that Wands, while seeming to be there for no reason, are very useful, and in 'The Elder Wand's case it can even strengthen your magic.

** 1. I look at magical power the same way that muggles look at intelligence. First, you have your IQ, which is influenced by your genetics. So a person born with a higher IQ is probably going to have an easier time in school than someone born with a low IQ. Than you have natural talent, learned skills, application... For example. I was born with a fairly high IQ (which probably won't show in this post since I'm trying to think at 2am, lol). Math and reading were always insanely easy for me, to the point where I was reading at a college level by age 9, and doing college level math (helping my aunt with her college homework) by age 13. History did /not/ come easy for me. I still have a hard time keeping names and dates straight in my head. When I was in school, I did really well in the classes that I enjoyed, and basically slacked off in the classes I didn't like. I didn't really apply myself. My sister was born with a lower IQ, but she worked her little rear end off and actually did better than me in almost every class. I think of Magic the same way. You are born with a "base" level, a magical IQ, so to speak. You may be more or less talented in certain areas, like Neville and herbology, Lily and charms, Severus and potions. Or maybe you really really work your arse off, like Hermione. Don't get me wrong, she was a powerful witch, but she had to work hard to stay at the top of her class. Of course, then you have geniuses. I don't care how hard I work or how much I study, I've never going to be as smart as, say, Steven Hawking. Dumbledore was like the Hawking of the wizarding world.

2. I think someone already mentioned this, but I view words, wand motions, and even the wands themselves as nothing more than a focus. We know that wandless magic and wordless magic is possible. But it take concentration, will, intent... Words and wands make it much easier.

3. Ah, wizarding genetics. I should really write a paper on this, lol. Ok, so my theory is that there are two separate genes work together to make a wizard, like a lock and a key. The "lock" is basically a magical "core", for lack of a better word. (I don't think of cores as a ball of magic or a mana well, so all you core haters out there, it's not like that. I just can't think of a better word.) The "key" is what allows you to access your magic. A person born with both genes is a wizard. A person born with neither gene is a muggle. A person born with the "lock" but no "key" is a squib, about to see the magic and interact with some of it, but not able to use magic themselves. A person born with a "key" and no "lock" is essentially a muggle, but carries the potential for "muggle-born" children. That's just the basics. I have this whole thing about the "key" being tied to the X chromosome, a reasonable explanation for where blood purity originated and why it was a big deal (dealing with squibs, inheritance, etc), and a genetic mutation that strengthens the "core" by duplicating the "lock" genes (if a child is born with only one lock IAi, but also born a key, the key will cause a mutation to occur at a genetic level, IAIA. On the rare occation where this doesn't occur, the child will have very weak magic, which is where the term "practically a squib" comes from. Stan Shunpike is an example of this, and it was what Neville was worried had happened to him, though I'm sure he didn't understand the genetics of it.)

And I'm sure that's more than you really cared to know lol.

** 1. Personally I see magic as a force of nature that some can control, while some can't. The ability for control is like a conduit in your body/soul; people like Voldemort and Dumbledore have a mass of them and just generally channel magic like a siphon or something, while others can only utilize a small amount, like using a dropper, and muggles have no control (i.e. no available tools, or a teeny-tiny dropper that's impossible to use) over it at all.

Which means, people like Voldemort/Dumbledore are more "hollow", which allows magic to flow through them, while muggles are too "solid" to allow magic to do the same.

I kind of got this theory from the Night Watch books, which provided some very interesting explanations for the presence of magic-wielding people in that world, and is just generally an amazing fantasy series.

I don't really subscribe to the "innate magic" school of thought.

2.I see spells as a set of instructions/shortcuts/pre-designed calculations. It's been tested to show that it works, and the current spells Harry & co. learn in school are probably filtered down through thousands of years of elimination and simplification, and have proven to be the most efficient option to do what they're supposed to. Sure, there might be other variants, but most wizards have no use for a different spell to levitate stuff when it does essentially the same thing as Wingardium Leviosa. It's also possible that some spell could be simplified even more (...like Wingardium Leviosa) but the wizards just can't be arsed to. I wouldn't be surprised.

My other theory is that the more vast the amount of magic a spell requires, the more difficult it is to make it work without the set of shortcuts someone else perfected. The more difficult it is to make it work without the shortcut, period. So people like Voldemort could wave a hand and levitate a chair, or light fires, because that's like 1+1=2. Simple. But to transfigure someone into a canary would be more difficult to accomplish without the wand (which is like an extension of the conduit, with a finer focus) and the equations boiled down to a spell. You'd have to do the calculations yourself without the program. Kind of like you can cup some water with your hand and splash it, but to do something bigger and more controlled, you need something like a spray can or a pump.

3.I've seen a blog post somewhere before, on magical genetics, and though I can't remember the exact terminology right now, I thought it made a lot of sense. So magic is not a simple dominant/recessive gene, but is something a little more complex, that requires you to have a certain amount of a certain component in your DNA for you to exhibit magical traits. Sort of like how some genetic illnesses are passed down; the more present this component is in your genes, the more severe your illness would be, while someone else might carry it, but not enough for it to manifest properly.

So for example if that cut-off point is 50, then a muggle/squib who's at 49 would be more sensitive to the presence of magic than someone with a 20. They might be able to sort of see/feel Dementors, though they can't work a simple levitation spell, while someone with a 20 can't even do the former.

Then, someone like Neville might have a 60; they can make most simple spells work, but anything more complex would be hard for them to handle, while some spells they will never be able to master. People like Dumbledore are something like a 100.

The transcription of genes is also liable to make mistakes; sometimes they forget to make a copy of gene A, while other times the process accidentally creates more copies of gene B than there should exist.

Two parents with a high count of this component is more likely to create a child who also has a high count (i.e. witch+wizard=magical child); but sometimes freak accidents happen in the transcription process and the child doesn't make it to the cut-off point for them to be magic. Which is how squibs are born, which might also explain why squibs are seen in the books to be more sensitive to magic (and can see magical creatures) than muggles. Of course, growing up in the magical world could also play a part.

Then, the offspring of this squib will be more liable to have a higher count of the magical gene than the average muggle, but they don't quite make it to the cut-off point, either...until someone who's at, say, 40, marries someone else who also has something like a 40, and one of their children easily makes it past 50. Viola! A muggleborn is born. (Or, you know, the transcription makes a mistake and copies down a crazy lot from someone who's only a 20. That could work too. Or at least this is the explanation that I remembered...)

It made a lot of sense to me; but then again, I'm not a biology major. And, of course, sometimes magic is just magic and there's no use analyzing why some things happen the way they do. I'm sure the logical processes of wizards are quite different from muggle science on the higher levels.

The more you use magic the more efficient you become with it.

incantation/wand movement/focus are the firing pin that wizards learn to use to limit there magic because it makes it very hard to blend in with muggles if your magic is granting your every need and want as you think it.

** *Why Transfiguration isn't used for all crafted objects:*

Transfigured objects tend to slowly ‘recoil' back towards their initial state, like an overstretched spring. The stronger the transfiguration and the more similar the initial and final states, the less significant the recoil. This affects shape, state and material. The effects or recoil lessen over time, until the object is stable at a state somewhere between the initial and final states.

‘Snapback' is when the recoil curve is truncated by the object ‘snapping back' to its exact original state, which can be caused by topological heteromorphism, exceptionally weak transfigurations, physical or magical stress, or -- of course -- dispelling spells.

Snapback is much more prevalent in inanimate-to-animate and animate-to-inanimate transfigurations.

*Magical Intelligence Feedback Principle:*

/The magic of an object reinforces its intelligence, and the intelligence of an object fortifies its magic./

Magic and intelligence form a feedback loop of reinforcement. The more magical something is, the more personality and intelligence it develops, and the closer to sentient (and smarter) a magical construct is, the stronger it becomes. This is a consequence of the mysterious background handwavium behind magic that also results in most intelligent species being magical and most magical species being somewhat intelligent. It can be exploited to reinforce artifice (The Sorting Hat being a prime example of using personality for this purpose) and to create intelligences (transfigured and conjured creatures can act according to behavioural principles without any finicky neurochemistry). It can result in unexpected intelligences in heavily enchanted objects (the Weasley's flying car, McGonagall's office chairs).

Give something with a decision tree, especially a fuzzy one, additional magic (in the form of wards, repeated charms, a highly magical location etc.) and its intelligence will grow. Give something magical more computational power or decision structures, and its magic will strengthen. In the extreme case, a very complicated structure with large decision trees that is saturated with magic from its vessel and vicinity, time is the only thing needed for both the magic and the intelligence of the construct to grow. This is how masterpieces like the Founder's artefacts and the Goblet of Fire are built.

** It's far too long to post here (6500 words, plus a diagram) so I'll just post the link to the Google Doc:

** 1. A combination of being born with more magic and ambition 2 it just does 3 from generations of Squibs, dna 4 My personal theory is that magic is a metaphor for imagination and intelligence, seeing as magic replaces this where it's needed. I know that there are also Muggles, and I see them as people with intelligence but without imagination. That may also be my lack of imagination/intelligence in coming up with elaborate explanations, but JK Rowling made magic always seem really simple... And I don't really see how anyone could make it more complex, as it's basically wand-waving and repeating latin phrases. Sure, there are fields such as Alchemy, but that would be backwards compared with Muggle science. I can really only see it as a metaphor the way JK Rowling has refused to make it more detailed. I find it very awe inspiring how people could come up with those long explanations though, filling in what JK Rowling never bothered to describe. However for me it's not neccessary to understand magic to enjoy the story, as far as I know no-one tried to explain how it would be possible for example for a wolf to blow down the straw house of three little pigs either, what the biological explanation is for the condition of thumbelina, how the birth of Greek gods is supported by scientific laws etc. Because realism in that sense simply isn't the point.

** Some people are born more powerful, just like some are born stronger, faster, taller, etc.

Muggleborns don't exist. They are the children of a wizard.
