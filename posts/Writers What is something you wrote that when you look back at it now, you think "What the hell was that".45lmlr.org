“Charlie's here and...” Ron paused for dramatic effect “...He's on a dragon!” At this Hermione couldn't help but let her eye brows shot up in surprise. “A tame one?” She questioned “Only when it wants to be” Ron snickered.

** I've fallen back in love with the word 'said' for setting off dialogue. I'm editing my story now and cringe every time I see some of my more 'creative' methods for avoiding simplicity. The most notable of these is "'Dialogue,' Harry /prevaricated/."

Yuck.

Can't dwell on the mistakes, though, or I'd never get any better.

** I'm with [[/u/hippoparty]]: Everything I wrote as a teenager. Actually, I'd say everything from ages 11 - 22. Before 11 was at least kind of adorable in its badness, because I was the kind of kid who wrote stories about puppies. After 22, I actually started reading writing help books, so at least it started sucking in new ways....

The most painful was a LOTR series I wrote. I deleted it long ago in a spasm of shame, but I haven't managed to delete the memory of it from my brain....

** Well, it wasn't a fanfiction, but I was in a role play group where Peter was a Death Eater in school and hanging around with other DE students in secret. They attacked someone as a group, and the whole thing was just weird to be sure, but I remember one girl writing about someone stabbing someone repeatedly in the back and describing tendons severing and blood spraying everywhere. Even then I sat there and shook my head thinking 'what the hell did I get myself into?'

** Oh boy.

Well, my first HP fanfic featured a race of magical talking invisible dinosaurs -- yes, this was a thing -- which were surprisingly decent people & one of which was to be a teacher. Because I guess we ran out of sensible choices.

A good chunk of the early story involved going to Aberforth Dumbledore's enormous cross-dimensional pub, which basically had the Ministry's thousand entrances thing going on. Also Harry would occasionally slip into a sort of twilight world between life and death, modelled variously after Diagon Alley, Hogwarts or King's Cross, where he met trapped spirits including Salazar Slytherin.

I may have sort-of predicted one or two things that would happen in the real books, but mine were invariably way dumber. Hopefully I've learned! :p
