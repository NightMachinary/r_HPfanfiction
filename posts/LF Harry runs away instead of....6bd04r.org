...returning to the Dursleys (at best: After first year, but later years are ok, too!)

Bonus points if Harry is in a different house at school (canon Ron and Hermione are too blinded by Dumbledore to ever suggest that Harry should not be a damned loyal toady and return to the abusers like Dumbledore wants him to!) and better at magic (Ravenclaw would be appreciated most - too few Harry the Ravenclaw fictions out there!)

Again:

- No main-character slash (no Harry/TMR, Voldemort, Lucius, Draco, Snape etc.)
- Not Harry/Ginny (I am still not convinced that he and the fangirl would be a good fit...same for Ron/Hermione...)
- No canon rehash (a Ravenclaw doesn't mindlessly jump into danger and a Slytherin would not duel Ron Weasly (he'd do what Draco did: Set Weasley up!))

So, there you go! Stage is your's and THANKS AGAIN FOR THE HELP :)

*** Thank you - I've read:

- Escape (liked it, except for the fact that Harry becomes a kind of "Yes, dear!" boyfriend of Hermione if I remember this right...she walks all over him and he just accepts it!)

- What if...(don't remember much of it...)

- Accidental Bond...that was before I thought about bonds and shit and decided that I wouldn't want that at all because it kind of is like willing rape (what if you hate the person you are bonded with? Yeah right, you have only one way out: Death! Thanks, but no thanks!)...still, I remember not liking it all that much even back then!

- Finding a Place to Call Home (not bad at first, but further in I remember that I stopped reading it....)

- Mastermind Hunting (liked it, too but that was ages ago, so I don't know if I'd still like it!)

- Behind Blue Eyes (liked that, too...again this was a few years ago...)

Still, the others are new to me, so again: THANK YOU!

*** Ooh. I've not tripped over this community. Thanks!\\
edit: huh. I think I've read 'Cafe'. Wasn't bad overall, but the author got the idea that 'emancipated minor/legal adult' meant that things with hard age limits like drinking, driving (not at the same time) didn't apply to a 13/14 year old and it got annoying at times.\\
The rest of these are new, though. :D
