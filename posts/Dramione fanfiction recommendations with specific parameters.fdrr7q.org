:END:
I've read a lot of dramione over the years and would love some recommendations! The only problem is I'm a little picky. It has to be complete for me, because I love to binge read. It needs to have at least 85k or more words really, because that's what's most satisfying for me. It has to be well written or I literally can not read it. And I really really would prefer it be M, because while I read the stories for the plot, some sex thrown in there is a definite bonus lol. Any thoughts?


** My absolute favourite is Looking Glass by Kyonomiko (or something similar) on FFN

Well written slow burn with plenty of sexy times

  No one knows what happened to Draco Malfoy in the final battle, but, when his portrait shows up at Harry Potter's house, it's readily assumed he didn't make it. Hermione's perspective on the wizard starts to change as she learns more about who he really was. The more she knows, the more tragic his apparent demise seems to be. EWE Dramione
