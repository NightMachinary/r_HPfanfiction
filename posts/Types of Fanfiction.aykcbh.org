It perhaps would be more accurate to say types of stories, but it seems more prominent in fanfiction plus I like talking to people here. For those who care, what typical story types can you identify following the train of thought here? For those who don't, which do you prefer to read - and why if you can explain it.

I'm trying to go through my personal "good shit" folder which I judged to be very well written to see what types of stories I can identify as well as fics I've read recently. Here are a few types I've found. I've named them just to let you commenters more easily communicate which type that I've listed you are talking about. NOTE: These are just the musings of a barely legal teenage girl pondering different stories and why I prefer some more than others to find any trend. Looking for that trend made my identify these */tentative/* types.

1) Wandering: I'm reading *Benefit of Old Laws* now which has a "Change a few things, let's see how the story plays out now." It has a very meandering feel to it. I would say most fanfiction and regular fiction follows this train of thought due to how conducive it is to world building or multi-character development.

2) Unchanging: These stories have the MC develop very little or not at all. The character will probably experience the most change in the first few arcs to cement who they are to the reader. This is a very common style in shonen anime. Goku from *Dragon Ball Z* barely changes if at all. He is who he is. *The Dark Knight* also follows this with Batman and the Joker being fixed. They don't change and the story is about seeing them react rather than them develop. They cause the people around them to change rather than they themselves. I have to mention my favorite book series ever follows this type: *I Shall Seal The Heavens*. This can be broken down into two subtypes: 1) Focused where it is about a very narrow field like The Dark Knight, and 2) Progression where there is always a new wall to climb.

3) Retrospective: *The Downward Spiral Saga* and *Shadows of Konoha*, a different fandom, both very clearly destroys every aspect of the MC to turn him into something else. It's entire story is about challenging the MC over and over again. This is a very heavy style that works well with tragedies in my opinion. Philosophical stories tend to follow this one too in my experience. Both of the stories made me seriously evaluate my own self-built moral system many times which isn't too common. (I made my own moral framework because I realized that I was in danger of acting or thinking immorally if I didn't carefully evaluate everything, but that's off topic. I just thought it was something to clarify what I meant. This parentheses has gone on too long.)

4) Butterfly Effect: To jump to another fandom, *Devil's Advocate* by livezinshadowz is hybrid of *Downward Spiral* and Benefits. It puts forth a changing moment that it then watches. But it differs from Benefits in how it seems to look over significant moments and character indecision. It's looking at the consequences of the worldview than telling the story about the butterfly effect rippling.

There are also stories with a definite purpose. These are most common in one shots given how difficult they are. These stories have an underlying "This is X." thought. These aren't too dissimilar from children's cartoon where there is an underlying message that the creator wants you to get from it or just a goal to accomplish by the end. No examples here, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Anyone else have any "archetypal" story patterns? These are just a few I've been throwing around for the past few hours.
