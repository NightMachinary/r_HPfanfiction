** Doesn't the author even say it's out right based off of Ender's Game?

** ...I thought that was the point?

Also, I haven't read it in a while, but is Dumbledore's portrait his Horcrux?

** The author, [[/u/KwanLi][u/KwanLi]], was very upfront about it being based off of Ender's Game in the promotional post here a few years back. Although to be fair, they didn't mention "Ender's Game" specifically but many will recognize the reference to "THE Battle School" in said post (below). I don't remember Ender's Game being mentioned in the fic itself, but in the author's notes in chapter 5, they mention that they had "read the book that is the prime inspiration for this." I infer that it wasn't Prisoner of Azkaban.

edit: apparently in comments section of the post above, the author /did/ specify explicitly that Hogwarts Battle School was based on Ender's Game

*** Oh, ok. I haven't seen any reference to that in the fic(May be in an author note that I skipped).

** That's honestly why I haven't read it, the title just plain made it sound like the concept of Ender's game with HP characters.

*** Same here, tbh i felt enders game to be quite repetitive, so to have a fanfic based on that i cant see it being better.

***** Unless otherwise noted, the story is not abandoned.

As far as when the next update will come, that's a bit more difficult to specify.

I will say I have had most of the next chapter completed, but I haven't finished Book 2. My commitment is to finish all of Book 2 and release the remaining chapters of that (about 4 or 5) together.

** I've not read Ender's Game, but I really enjoyed Hogwarts Battle School. That may just be my love of AU though.

*** Enders Game is a pretty classic sci fi novel and is very worth a read.

***** I didn't like any of the Ender sequels. The Shadow series that follows Bean has its issues but is much better.
