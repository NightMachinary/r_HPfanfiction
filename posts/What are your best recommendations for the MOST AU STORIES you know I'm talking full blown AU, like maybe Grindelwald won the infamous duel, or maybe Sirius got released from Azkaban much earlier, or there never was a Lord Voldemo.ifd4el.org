** linkffn(8809533; 9783012; 12005755; 6652537) linkao3(15068012)

Two of these are much less AU than the other three, but they're still excellent reads.

*And the Wolves All Cry* - Voldemort doesn't come after the Potters. An excellent dystopian oneshot.

*Reign of the Serpent* - I would literally pay to see this completed. Everything is utterly AU, from society to the way Hogwarts functions. Society has a bit of a 1984 forever-at-war feel to it, and I wish to hell it wasn't abandoned.

*The Daring Win* - Harry is raised by Dolores Umbridge. This is a surprisingly excellent fic.

*Quoth the Raven, Nevermore* - Accidental magic turns a very young Harry into a raven animagus, and he moves into the aviary at the Tower of London.

*The Child of Azkaban* - When the Potter will is executed, Harry is transported to Sirius. In Azkaban. He isn't found until it's time for his letter. The sequel is abandoned, but the first year fic is complete.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** In linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), after preparing the Diary and semi-accidentally killing Myrtle, Tom did some introspection and decided against making Horcruxes; he felt remorse for her death and reintegrated his soul. Instead, he turned around and went into politics, gaining widespread influence and eventually succeeding in having muggle-born and half-blood students banned from Hogwarts. And he's not stopping there, either; restricting halfblood marriages is next on the table.

The Marauders are all alive in this AU; the Potters have a daughter Harriet, and Sirius is widowed with a son, Arcturus, about the same age. And since Harriet is single-mindedly devoted to Potions, she wants to go to Hogwarts and study under Professor Snape, but she's a half-blood; and Arcturus would like to study Healing, but Sirius really wants him to follow family tradition and attend Hogwarts, which doesn't have much of a Healing program. So, Harriet signs up for an international college with an excellent Healing track - and they secretly swap places.

Most of the story is far away from the stations of canon, and even when it comes within waving distance of them (like the Diary still being sent to Hogwarts), they're thoroughly altered. It's equally distant from the crossover; there are elements drawn from that, but most of it breaks new ground. Harriet is more skilled and powerful than canon Harry, but that always comes at a cost, whether it's having to deal with the increased spotlight threatening their masquerade, or struggling to control her high magical reserves, or being targeted by those who want to ruthlessly exploit her. And always, she has to watch herself, because the penalty for "blood identity theft" is Azkaban, and that's even before the risk of treading on powerful toes in the process.

As well as Theorises' answer, I'll note that Arcturus meets Hermione in America and falls for her, which has its own complications; she doesn't know about the pretense, but comes across clues that "Harry" is using different genders at school vs at home, and comes to the conclusion that "Harry" is biologically female but prefers to identify as male. Which she's OK with, but feels torn because she likes "Harry" but she's straight.

** Somehow, both which spring to mind are actually compliant with book-canon!

The *Alexandra Quick* series is set in a wizarding America that's well, /far more American/ than Fantastic Beasts. The author nails the conversion of the world to Americana, with blood mattering less than lifestyle, prejudice being applied in different ways, magic taught differently, the school like an American private school instead of a British finishing school. The magic is somewhat different, too; it's softer, and both the British and Americans have come up with ideas that haven't each crossed the pond.

NoahPhantom's *Albus Potter* series begins when eight years after the Second War, a more formidable Dark wizard than Voldemort leads an unsuccessful rebellion. This effort forces the Wizarding World into a more progressive society (blood status unimportant, extremely powerful magic, acceptance of magical creatures, wizards fighting with two wands) to the point where the question in the first book is whether the Statute of Secrecy should be axed. It's a really wonderfully constructed AU world, and I'd highly recommend the story.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Linkffn(Black Luminary; Prince of the Dark Kingdom)

The first is an AU where the war with Grindelwald had a /huge/ impact on Wizarding Britain and Voldemort never rose to power, the second is a much more fantastical story wherein Voldemort won the war and took over Wizarding Britain.

** linkffn(Anything but Slytherin by IP82). Only a one-shot vignette, but Wizarding Britain is definitely different.

The Dangerverse, which starts with linkffn(Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow). Hermione's older sister marries Remus Lupin, and things take off from there.

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.

  Hermione is unexpectedly swept into a dystopian world of opposites where Dumbledore reigns as Dark Lord and Muggle technology and the Dark Arts have revolutionized Britain. A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM

AU-ception. There's the same slightly less nonsensical AU that you might be familiar with from other Starfox5 fics, and now there's parallel universe travel added into the mix.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
