** *Robst*: "Blah blah, Ragnok, blah blah, friend of goblin nation," Lord Harry James Potter exclaimed, in his confident, quidditch-toned voice, his bemuscled muscles ripping his acromantula silk shirt asunder by the power of their quidditch-toned-muscledom.

*Taure*: somethign something platonic forms, yes Victoria had a nice nose, etc.

*Stanrick*: "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, and therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind," Harry whispered to the stars.

*Marauderlover7*: Sirius smelled something, blah blah, doggie.

*The Imaginizer*: "If you marry, you will regret it," the-part-of-Harry-that-was-Tom whispered, "if you do not marry, you will also regret it," the-part-of-Harry-that-wasn't-Tom-whispered, his mind trailing on in its unstoppable, schizophrenic orchestra, "if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both; laugh at the world's follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that, laugh at the world's follies or weep over them, you will regret both; this is the sum and substance of all hitherto Hegelian philosophy," both parts of his sleep-deprived mind concluded in harmonious nonsensical eureka, talking directly into the twinkling face of Albus Dumbledore, who looked on bedazzled, helpless, & worried that Harry had once again taken too much of his Adderall prescription and stayed up all night on the internet.

***** You may be missing the point for a lot of fics. It's definitely best to ensure they understand proper practice and etiquette, but fiction is very much an escape especially in sexual situations. BDSM isn't always sexual, but there is always that undertone that leads people to look for stories involving it.

I, for one, don't go to hentai comics to learn about the realism of nuns and their lack of a sex life. I also have to shut down a lot of what I know about physics to enjoy a nice wormhole. Many stories aren't realistic for the sole purpose of escaping the boundaries of reality. If you want to have it be realistic then that's great to put out there, but it is just wrong to label a form of fiction as bad for being not realistic.

I'm very much reminded of the Male Lesbian Daydream. Where two lesbians invite you to their... Party. They're lesbians, so they aren't interested males. That doesn't stop the idea of it being enticing. Should the guy have realistic expectations in reality? Certainly, but we shouldn't conflate the media that they consume with the cause of their actions.

****** I think you've missed my actual point here. A lot of what I see under ‘BDSM' is flat out abuse being called BDSM. What I'm trying to provide is actual BDSM, where abuse is not tolerated. It still happens, and I am aware of that and show that, but it is frowned upon at the very least, and more often actively rejected. What I'm trying to provide is escapism without giving people the impression that dangerous, unhealthy relationships are normal, which is, unfortunately, the norm in BDSM fics.

******* A majority of BDSM stories are indeed abusive, but that doesn't make them bad stories. They may be abusive for the same reasons rape +and incest+ stories exist. In reality, it is a bit of a no no, but it makes for exciting reads for some people. Having sex with your stepmother is also likely a bad idea that is meant to be unrealistic and fictional.

I crossed out incest because I used to use the two words together, but I've realized there isn't anything wrong with incestuous relationships as long as both are of age and consenting (Which is the same for all relationships). Birth control is mandatory though. Anyways, that's besides the point. I just didn't want to exclude it entirely to hopefully make others aware of it.

******** I get what you're saying, but when someone goes out and tries this thing they read in a story, I don't want them to be re-enacting something that might/will kill them. That is where I find fault with so many BDSM stories. They're teaching young people, often those who are essentially children, that abusive relationships are okay because “it's BDSM”, and showing them seriously dangerous scenes, often with no warnings to not try this at home.

Also, as someone who has been sexually abused by a family member, I find it a little bit offensive that you're of the opinion that there is nothing wrong with incest. Incest is unhealthy for both participants, whether consenting adults or not. Either one or the other is groomed, or both are.

We blame the guy for being incredibly stupid, deluded, or for trying to blame something that had nothing to do with his actions. We certainly don't say he was taught that it was okay because he saw it in a fictional game.

If the story is indeed abusive, then we likewise should not blame the story. It is actually honorable of you to try to put something realistic into the market though. I just don't agree that these stories are teaching youths how to be abusive or that such things are normal.

********** I disagree. The saturation of internet fiction with normalised abusive relationships will make impressionable young people think that abuse of whatever kind is not necessarily normal, but that it might not be abuse. I don't think you understand the influence of literature, especially on young people. I also don't think you understand, truly, where fetish becomes dangerous. Here's a list:

Consensual non-consent - good

Dubious consent - depending on circumstance

Rape - BAD

Distantly related incest - okay, I guess

Closely related incest - bad

Incest play (fake incest) - go ahead

Consensual bodily ‘harm' (whipping, flogging, choking, cutting) - good, provided it's done responsibly

Agressive, non-consensual bodily harm - Bad, possibly deadly

Big/Little play - good

Paedophilia - BAD

All of the above CAN be erotic. Not all of the above should be portrayed as erotic. Portray it, if you must. But do so in a way that makes clear that these things are neither normal, nor good. Never, ever, should rape, incest, abuse or paedophilia be portrayed as purely erotic. If someone finds it erotic, then that's their problem, but never should a responsible writer make out that these things are okay.

*********** Would you like to take this to discord? This Reddit isn't the best place for such talks given the potentially young audience or those who prefer not to see such things.

Rape, which includes child molestation, is indeed one of the most heinous acts someone can commit. Luckily, this is fiction where nobody is actually being harmed. I agree that no writer should state that rape is permissible in reality, but I see no reason to assume fictional stories are inherent encouragement of any action in the real world.

On a side note, would you like to discuss why you see incest, of any distance, as being negative? It is a tad off topic. I am baffled as to why it would be put in the same category as rape. Incest can indeed involve rape, but the same is true of any relationship. What would be the issue if all individuals involved are consenting without coercion?

************* I am not denying that literature can have an effect on people, but I see no reason to blame said literature for that effect.

I do not believe I have a skewed moral compass. My morality greatly diverges from common consensus on several things, but that is because it seems that common consensus is wrong. For example, whenever I put the issue of incest into question in a moral system, then the outcome is always equivalent to the following. As long as all involved are consenting adults, then it is no different than any other relationship. If we stretch the issue to birth, then the parties must take measures to prevent it just as we would insist that expecting mothers stop drinking alcohol due to the harm it would cause on the child. I see no reason why blood relation is any more relevant than the hair color of the people nor the gender nor the astrology sign.

You can convince me I'm wrong as long as you are capable of showing me I'm wrong.

****** For starters, she is NOT paired with Draco AND Lucius. She's not with Draco at all in any romantic or sexual way. As for how I handle it, you'd really have to read the story to find out. Essentially, the relationship began before she knew who they were or they knew who she was, continued to develop before she found out who they both were, and by the time they all knew each other's identities, they had become attached to each other (I won't call it love because it isn't yet) and discovered that certain behaviours and personality traits are almost solely for the protection of themselves and those they care about. It's very hard to explain without spoiling the story for someone who might come along and want to read it.

Edit: I, as someone who was reading smut at 14, am definitely not naive enough to think that warning won't be ignored. The purpose of it is to communicate that this story will be explicit, and it is not INTENDED for any audience under 18. That covers my ass if someone goes, “Well X kid did y because of your story.” I go, “Well I can't control who reads my story, and it is full of warnings and constant reminders that people like X kid shouldn't be reading it, and that nobody should try this stuff at home.”
