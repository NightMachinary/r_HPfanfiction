Hey,

I just finished to read a fic where Harry has a knack for pranking (he's really really good, too) and had a great laugh. So, what's the best pranks pulled by the twins or Harry (or anyone, really) you've ever read?

I especially like one where Harry makes a SWAMP in the seven corridor haha and Dumbledore couldn't fix it. The thing is, the swamp disappears and appears without any reason...


** Quite a few have Harry or the twins or Ginny (or a combination thereof) slipping Umbridge something that makes her turn into a toad at random intervals.

I read a good one recently, I think it was Harry, did something to one or two flagstones in the Great hall and anyone wearing a certain colour of robe (think it was purple) who stepped on it would fart - so Dumbledore and Quirrell were affected.

As a side note, "pranks" is an Americanised fanfic term that grates on me. In the UK, we call 'em "practical jokes."

** One I read recently had Harry pranking the whole student body to prove himself to the Twins: he managed to conspire with the house elves to spike the drinks with a potion that turned everyone's hair to their house colors for the day.

I thought it was neat because it wasn't malicious and didn't single anyone out.

** The walls of Hogwarts are turned into sand. The school looks like a giant sand castle. Everyone is outside looking up at the castle in wonder and McGonagall nudges Dumbledore,"Whoever did this, I can't teach them anything more."

** My favorite is from Angry Harry and the Seven, where Neville and Harry use polyjuice potion of Fred and George and the four of them twin speak.

The first prank is filling the great hall with water that converts those who go into it into idealised merpeople. It gets better from there.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** In linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary), Luna gets back at girls who had been bullying her by inventing a variant of Polyjuice Potion that only transforms part of your body and turns her bullies' noses into Snape's for a few hours.

I'm not sure if it can count as a prank but Harry lies that he's Draco Malfoy and spreads a rumour that Narcissa cheated on Lucius with Snape and fathered Draco in linkffn(Oh God Not Again).

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I think it was from a marauder era time travel fic. Harry manages to get every chair for one of the houses to dance, with their occupants stuck in the chair until the prank was done. One of the students went along with the prank, and decided to dance along with the chair. Apparently his good-natured response and dance moves netted him a date.

Another amusing one as when Draco Malfoy was forced to perform [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FshU58nI0Ts][/The Lumberjack Song/]]
