Hey there,

I was wondering if there were any fics out there in which Harry (fem!Harry can be included) is just as intelligent as Hermione resulting in a heated rivalry and later on in a relationship..or something like that. Would love to have some recommendations. Fic should be 150k words at least, and either completed or (somewhat) regularly updated. Anything yaoi is a no-go. Thanks a bunch in advance!

** Do fics like that exist? There are some "Harmonian" fics where Harry becomes more scholarly under Hermione's influence, while remaining firm second; and there's a huge number of fics where Harry is a genius who blows Hermione out of the water academically. I can't think of any actual rivalries like what you describe, though.

I vaguely recall a fic that had them be rivals before school, culminating in some kind of a science fair, but it was of the Genius!Harry variety, and I don't recall the name or the author.

*** I really hope so. There really isn't much going on anymore that's not involving a shit ton of tropes. I just want a highly intelligent Harry, that's not completely overdone and bashes characters left and right with the mannerisms and speech of an 80-year-old.
