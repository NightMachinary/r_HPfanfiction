I think would be an interesting premise. Like all of his odd behaviour is just that it is the best way for everyone to leave him be. He has so many other jobs so he has a legitimate excuse to stay away or seem to busy and the reason he really keeps Snape around is that he thinks he shouldn't have to suffer alone.


** Would be cool to see fics where he's also more proactive within the war and helps Harry out more often. We always see that he's considered as one of the most powerful wizards alive but I feel like there aren't too many moments that show his true power. Would be interesting to see him more in battle and stuff .

*** I think there are definitely stories out there that have him show his power, mind arts comes to mind but you are right that it seems that he is always more a back seat player then an actual threat.

Even just moments that show his creativity I think are really rare. I think a lack of character creativity with magic is fairly common though through most stories so they just have everyone acting like a cheap suit politician.
