I've recently completed a typeset edition of the epic fanfic /A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles/ by Rannaro.

linkffn(7937889)

For those of you who haven't heard of this story, it's a truly brilliant account of the entire life of Severus Snape. It is entirely consistent with the canon of Rowling's text (insofar as the canon is self-consistent). The story is long and filled with detail, but every scene has a reason to be included, usually for the purpose of character development, so it's still an engaging read. Having come back to this fic again and again, I decided I wanted physical copies.

Using LaTeX, I've formatted the story in the style of the American editions of canon Harry Potter. There were very few typographical errors to begin with, but I proofread thoroughly, standardized capitalization of magical terms, and ensured that all quotation marks are properly matched. Since 650,000 words is too long for a single volume, I split the work into four volumes at what I judged to be the best break points in the story. The files are standard 6"x9" and thus can be printed easily and cheaply with self-publishing services. I have made my source code and commits public on github, and the final PDFs are here:

I hope that my work helps others to enjoy this beautiful story.


** This PDF edition looks stunning! I see you've also done one for HPMoR. If it's possible, could you make a print edition for /The Life and Times/ next? Imo it's the best Marauders fanfic out there and one of the most popular for sure! linkffn(5200789)

*** Why thank you! Funny you should request, as /The Life and Times/ was the most recent fanfic I read. Unfortunate that it isn't complete, though...

I'll definitely consider it, and let you know if it happens!

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** Is this your own own story? If not, has the author okayed this? Because if someone came along and did this with anything of mine without asking I would be incandescent with rage. Especially the 'proofreading' bit.

*** I have tried to contact the author by various means, but have received no replies. The most recent activity I could find was 2012. And by "proofreading" I mean fixing a couple misspelled words; there are no significant changes.
