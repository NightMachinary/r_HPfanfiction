(or any other for that matter?)

Which site do you use the most and what good and bad points do they have?

Also which search systems do you think give you the best results?

And from a writer view, how does the site change the number of people who read your fic? Is there a story type for each?


** It depends, for new stuff I tend to gravitate more to ao3 because the search tool is just so much better, but for my old favourites I use ff.net

** I find that Ao3 generally has more stories with my less popular ships (and they're easier to find), as i generally read romance stories, but in terms of more general stories, the quality on FFN tends to be higher imo.

** AO3. I really like the tags (hot take) and now that they've added the exclude filters I rarely go on FFN anymore. The download feature is also really nice (epub yay), it makes it easy to save a bunch of fics.

I'm actually surprised people are saying the quality on FFN is better since my experience has been the opposite (although I would assume we're looking for different things since the subreddit skews gender wise).

I feel like (especially in HGDM fics) AO3 is to Pride and Prejudice as FFN is to Romeo and Juliet.

** Ff.net for one reason: I get tired of finding stories that barerly have anything to do with the character I am looking to read stories about on AO3. FF.net only allows a restricted amount of main characters to be searchable for any story , while on AO3 people seem to tag anybody who makes a caneo appearance.

If somebody had a trick to get around this problem, please tell me. AO3 honestly has the better layout for reading.

** Ffn for its lovely app. Mostly because the app updates the fics automatically and i dont have to keep track of anything. Also easier seach system. (Ao3 keeps recommending slash even when excluding m/m, and excluding draco/snape doesn't really help any either.. Ffn is just better :)

** I like the ao3 website itself better, but the stories on ff.net tend to be of a higher quality. For ao3 I appreciate all the tags, which can give a much better impression of the story without having to go through and open it. I also find it easier to navigate. Again, however, I think ff.net simply has better quality stuff (and I really like that it has dark mode). I probably read a fair balance between the two sites, though.

** Ffnet as both a writer and a reader. The interface is less ugly, and I find it easier to use. And it feels like it's got a higher ratio of actually good stories.

I also get significantly higher reader numbers and engagement off ffnet.

** AO3 is better in every way: no ads, it's easier to post and edit stories, it's easier to read and respond to comments, I've never gotten spam through its messaging system (while I have through ffn), there don't seem to be as many trolls...

*** I agree with you!

Personally I read fanfic a lot more than I write, so I prefer ao3, because I found the fanfic I want more easily, but I kinda feel like all the very famous fic are on ff.net.

I was wondering if this was because ff.net was better from a writer perspective, but from what you're saying it's not the case..

**** Ffn is just older, and poorly maintained these days. AO3 is newer, made to fix many of the problems with ffn.

** Neither, all of them. Most of my recommendations come from here, and then I just download the EPub (using FanFicFare) and read locally. There are great stories on both of them, but lately I found some great stuff on Wattpad, [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/]] or [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/]] .

** I read on mobile so reading on ao3 is a chore to be honest, their mobile site leaves much to be desired. I even prefer ffn mobile site to ffn app (it's just more comfortable for me, especially the search part).

Also for me searching new fics is easier on ffnet as well, since ao3 has this over tagging thing going on on most of the fics. It's hard to look for something on there

*** I can see how the slash can be annoying but because the search system in ao3 is better, I feel it's easier to just filter it out.

I never find good fics on ff.net, but that's propably because I never found out how to use the search system. The only way I find good fics on ffn is when people recommend it, so I know it's there but I can't find it on my own it's bothering me..

***** I tried to replicate your results by filtering my search the way you described, and I'm not seeing anything remotely similar. I have a feeling that you might have made a mistake with your exclude filters. Mind posting a link to your search page with the filters applied?

On a side note, unlike on FFN, A/B/O stories on Ao3 are very easy to filter out by just excluding the "Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamics" tag.

***** Sadly it's not so much that ao3 search function doesn't work, it's that people don't know or don't care how to properly tag... I always use the exclude tag function to remove pwp or pairing I don't want but again, I can understand that it's a pain
