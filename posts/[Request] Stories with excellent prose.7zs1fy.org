Looking for any fics you've found where the prose is entertaining and interesting to read in itself; it's not just a means to carry along the story. Perhaps the author has a way with words, or uses words in a unique manner. Perhaps the narrator voice is witty and clever.

Any length, any pairings, any story.


** Disclaimer: I haven't yet found a fanfic with prose that I would consider "great", but I'm going to post some that I think are above average.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5508237/1/Caveat-Inimici]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8693743/1/Senses]])

This topic is probably way too subjective to make useful recommendations.

** I would hesitantly rec the works of potionpen on AO3. Hesitantly not because they're bad, but they tend to be kind of a love-it-or-hate-it type of an author. Their prose is dense and usually has multiple layers of references, humor, and puns. All (or at least most) of their stuff fits into their subjectiverse, which has a very... pro-Snape, neutral towards anyone else kind of slant.

That being said, linkao3(The Boomslang Effect by potionpen) can be read without reading all 700,000+ words of the subjectiverse and has fun humor and lovely prose.

*** I'll second this, both the rec and the caveat. The prose is amazing, but it's very much an acquired taste, and the author's love of compound sentences puts some readers off. The style and the re-invention of Snape are similarly convoluted, baroque, self-indulgent, fascinating, and pretty damn brilliant. And quite amusing, if you enjoy wit, wordplay, and a sardonic attitude toward the universe.

It's not the sort of thing that's usually popular with this sub, though.

Edited to add: since the bot picked up the wrong fic and the wrong fandom, here's a direct link to potionpen's gigantic series: [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/55402][Subjectiverse]]

And here's The Boomslang Effect for those who just want an entertaining gen fic: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1731896][Boomslang link]]

Also, I'm pretty sure I first read the Subjectiverse off one of your recs, so thank you for that :)

** While I don't praise Taure's fics to high heaven, I think that when you consider his /writing/, he comes out as one of the fandom's best.

Newcomb writes well. Sesc (Serious Scribble) too. And Swimdraconian.

But perhaps the best writer I've read in the fandom is joe6991 as he's known on FFN, the author of Wastelands of Time. His later works especially. He's professionally published, and it shows why. Read his latest fanfic, Testimony of Avarice, or recent chapters of Heartlands. Joe's very good.

** linkffn(Still Life With Skull) is shaping out to be great. Snape laughs "like an offended crow, a voice like damp seaweed." Sirius "vanishes into the Black hole of Grimmauld Place" every summer. "Regulus is a slip of a kid at thirteen, curled up on two train seats, almost vanishing under his elaborate travelling cloak. He sleeps like the dead. Sirius's thin hands worry as he threads them through Regulus's hair."

** "Dignity in fear" would be my suggestion for this request. It is certainly not the "best" story from a purely technical point of view but the author manages to convey emotions like no other. It is a Hermione/Tonks story which has the best depiction of "raw" emotions I have read in over 30 million words of fiction. It feels very realistic with the characters acting out their urges instead of wallowing in teenage angst for 200k words. The adult content is superb because it doesn't read like porn but rather an extension of the narrative. There is no phalanx of paragraphs describing how hot they are and how hot the sex is. Instead, those scenes are written from the PoV of the characters, paying more attention to their feelings over the detailed mechanics of sex.
