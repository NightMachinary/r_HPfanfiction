I hope I'm not the only one to ever stray from magical Britain..

I finished linkffn(Dreaming of Sunshine) a few weeks back and it was/is sooo good. And when I googled recommendations for Naruto it was never mentioned. It's all harems and godlike!Narutos.

My point is, apparently I'm missing out as long as I rely on recs from inside the Naruto fandom. I'm assuming that holds true for other universes, too. There have to be good Twilight stories, but no matter what I search, I get whips and chains..

Sooo, awesome (for someone spoiled by the standards of HP) stuff in other fandoms, please.

Thanks!

** Twilight -

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6137139/1/Luminosity][Luminosity]] is a HPMOR inspired fic, but is, from what I remember, much, much better than HPMOR. The inspiration is limited to Bella's personality being less emotion and more rational thinking. It does a pretty good job of exploring the world. It's best read on the author's site, and can be found [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/all.shtml][here]] all on one page. It's sequel is [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/all2.shtml][Radience]] and there is a collection of stories called [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/all3.shtml][Flashes]]. Bella/Edward

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4446127/1/Golden-Slumber][Golden Slumber]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4453118/1/The-Edge][The Edge]] is a Bella/Alice story that picks up at the end of book 1. It's not perfect, but I really liked it.

Bleach -

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4423123/1/Odalisque][Odilisque]] is an AU IchiRuki. Haven't read it in a while, but I remember it being good.

Naruto (First Set) - I think all of these are excellent and you should seriously read them if you haven't already.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550403/1/The-Howling-Wind][The Howling Wind]]. My absolute favorite Naruto fic. AU, with a Naruto that has a chakra dysfunction that forms the base for the story. Unknown pairing. Could end up with Naruto being with Samui, Hinata, Sakura, or someone else. The author isn't sure yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10822184/1/Written-in-Reverse][Written in Reverse]]. By the same author as The Howling Wind and probably my second favorite fic. It's a Naruto/fem!Sasuke in which they are both thrown back in time, but neither knows about the other.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9948266/1/Team-7-s-Ascension-Blood-Wings][Team 7's Ascension: Blood Wings]]. This is an AU with a realistically dark world given it's status as a warrior culture and which does an absolutely excellent job of representing the power difference of the various shinobi levels. It's a Team 7 fic. Probably going to end up a Naruto/Sakura/Sasuke pairing. Along with The Howling Wind and Written in Reverse, it is one of my favorite stories of all time, including all of the published fiction I've read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099/1/People-Lie][People Lie]]. Another dark world. Very AU. Features a very OOC Naruto that was heavily influenced in childhood by Ibiki. It's Naruto/Hinata.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3183054/1/Tempered-in-Water][Tempered in Water]]. This is also a realistically dark story. It's premise is that Naruto was successful in his attack on Haku when she asked that he kill her. She survives, but his eyes are opened to the true realities of the shinobi world. Naruto/Haku.

Naruto (Second Set) - I also recommend all of these, but some have some issues and others I just don't like as much as those in the first set.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3149411/1/Naruto-Altered-History][Naruto: Altered History]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4568723/1/Naruto-Shinobi-Wars][Naruto: Shinobi Wars]]. This one is a very dark story in which Naruto ends up being taught by Anko. If the writing was better in the beginning I'd have included it in my first set. It's one of my favorite stories. It's Naruto/Ino with a twist of Naruto/Yugito.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3430516/1/Lost-soul][Lost Soul]]. Like Altered history, I'd have included this story in the first set if the writing was better early on as it is also one of my favorites. This story's basic premise is that Sarutobi allowed Naruto to be made into a super-soldier. It's old enough that a lot of the Naruto world hadn't yet been created so the author had to build a lot of his own. I think he did a wonderful job of it. It's Naruto/Temari.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3568608/1/The-Book-of-Naruto][Book of Naruto]]. A very funny Naruto story that has Naruto set up as a god after the Wave mission. By the same author as Tempered in Water.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9486691/1/Sage][Sage]]. This one is a very good story in which Naruto awakens the Rinnegan after Teuchi and Ayame are killed because of him in his early life. My main criticism of it is that it includes various filler arcs that sometimes make it drag. I won't include this one's pairing because it would be a spoiler.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3541463/1/Genius-of-Konoha][Genius of Konoha]]. In this story, Naruto is a true genius on a level that is very close, or slightly above, that of Itachi.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012103/1/That-Look][That Look]]. In this story, Anko comes across Naruto, feels bad for him, and befriends him under the guise of being another child. It's Naruto/Anko.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693/1/Scorpion-s-Disciple][Scorpion's Disciple]]. In this story, Sasori leaves the Akatsuki and ends up in hiding in Konoha. He ends up teaching Naruto and Naruto becomes a puppet user.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6076235/1/Unplanned-Paternity][Unplanned Paternity]]. In this story, Kakashi is charged with caring for Naruto. He begins doing so grudgingly, but a real bond develops.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212573/1/Rewritten][Rewritten]]. Naruto is thrown back in time in this story to before his father become Hokage. Naruto/Mikoto.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3883902/1/The-Ghost-and-the-Darkness][The Ghost and the Darkness]]. In this story, Naruto has been driven insane by the Kyuubi and Sasuke also develops his own issue from the massacre. They end up forming a sort of friendship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4860864/1/Who-I-Am][Who I Am]]. A story in which Naruto is blinded early in childhood. Sasuke is his best friend and helps him hide his disability. By the same authors as Unplanned Paternity.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6557238/1/Better-Left-Unsaid][Better Left Unsaid]]. This is a for-want-of-a-nail story, IIRC. It drags on a bit, but I remember liking it a lot. Naruto/Ino.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6051938/1/The-Sealed-Kunai][The Sealed Kunai]]. In this story, Naruto was trained by Danzo as a member of Root. When he was 8 or 9, he was discovered returning to Konoha by Jiraiya and Sarutobi and Jiraiya seal his memories in an attempt to return him to a normal childhood. This is a Naruto/multi, but I don't think it's like most harems. Naruto isn't so much dating multiple girls as he has several fuck buddies. There is no final pairing, but the general assumption in the story seems to be that he'll eventually end up actually dating one of them and be monogamous.

  James Joseph Moriarty was born in Galway, in 1976. His birth certificate no longer exists.

  If it did, it would list his father's name (Dr. Joseph Arthur), his mother's (Mrs. Elizabeth Anne), and his birth weight (2.7kg). It would not tell you that his eyes were blue, or that he entered this world as he will leave it -- howling.

  It would not tell you that five minutes later his mother (Mrs. Elizabeth Anne) gave birth to a daughter, his sister. His twin. The records of her birth burned with his, but if they hadn't, you would know her name.

  Mary Elizabeth Moriarty was born in Galway, in 1976.

  They will call her Molly.

Mass Effect/HP crossover. Harry takes the place of Spectre with Shepard as a sort of second-in-command. Harry, being Master of Death, is hideously overpowered, but it's a crack/humor fic so that's not really much of a downside. Genuinely funny and a blast to read.

Harry Potter and his usual bipolar luck live on into the 22nd century, his saving-people-thing meshing nicely with the galaxy's pressing need for a hero.

** Check out Time Braid by Shaper V: Linkffn(5193644)

It's a Naruto story. A Groundhog Day inspired time loop that goes somewhere, and is really damn good.

Also, the author mentions Perfect Lionheart as an inspiration. I'd honestly avoid the guy's work, so much of it just spins its wheels and accomplishes nothing other than loading a ton of chekhov's guns that never get fired, because almost everything is abandoned.

What else...

Stars Fade: Linkffn(8123345) is a Mass Effect and Dragon Age 2 crossover.

A Demon Among Devils: Linkffn(10225608) is a Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 crossover with Highschool DxD, and is amazing despite slow updates.

Cast in Gold is an Evangelion and Exalted crossover: Linkffn(7057744)

Can you tell I like crossovers?

Also a lot of authors have favorites lists with at least a couple things worth taking a chance on, so dig through them relentlessly.

** linkffn(6555315) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6555315/1/Leaves-of-Grass][Leaves of Grass]] is a Twilight fanfiction, and it's one of the best I've ever read in any fandom. It starts at the end of New Moon. After returning from Volterra, Bella isn't sure if she wants to get back together with Edward. She takes a nap and wakes up in the midst of the Civil War, and encounters Jasper before he was turned. It's Bella/Jasper and very well done.

Twilight Bella/Edward humor/romance story that is a nice long read. It literally had me laughing out loud for most of it. There is also a nice long sequel being written once you finish this one

Anyway here are my recs.

All of these are really good IMO. I have reread all of them and they are great, even after a few rereads. That Colour Silver is especially good.

Have you got recs for any fics? Any other fandom you like is fine. I usually read Star Wars, Harry Potter and Percy Jackson fanfics but I read pretty much any Harry Potter crossover. Just no slash really. Maybe it's time to branch out a little?
