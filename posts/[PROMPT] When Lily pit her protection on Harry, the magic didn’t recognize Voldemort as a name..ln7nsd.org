Now, Harry is protected from “flight from death” or whatever you want to take the improper French as. What exactly does this mean and how does it change things?

Edit: just realized the typo in the title. Yay!


** He's protected from the results of any attempt to escape one's mortality. Harry could be killed in a random death eater raid, but not by Tom himself trying to escape the prophesy. He could be killed by any wand except the Elder Wand, could choke on any piece of cloth other than the Peverell invisibility cloak, and could be beaten to death with any book other than Tom's diary. If a spell researcher is trying to make a new spell to bake cake, botches the spell, and blows up Hogwarts, Harry is as dead as everyone else, but if the researcher was trying to develop immortality, Harry will be standing untouched in the middle of the crater.

*** I like this. I can see a couple uses for it.

Year one: same use as the original protection.

Year two: Diarymort can't attack Harry, directly with Harry's wand or indirectly by ordering the basilisk to attack him.

Year three: Eh, can't see it useful in canon, but it would work if Peter tried something in attempt to escape death by Sirius Black.

Year four: Voldy still resurrected, but can't land so much as a stinging hex in the following duel.

Year five: Battle for the Department of Mysteries goes about the same besides the attempted possession at the end.

Year six: Battle of the Astronomy Tower mostly unaffected.

Year seven: Harry isn't affected by the locket's mind magic and so relations during the Horocrux Hunt are better.

** As supported by [[/u/White_fri2z][u/White_fri2z]] the “vol” in Voldemort is more properly translated to the flight meaning fly through the air. I'm pretty sure that “de” can me ‘of' as well.

So Harry could be protected from “flight (like on a broom) /of/ death” and thus can't be killed while flying.

** If Harry is protected from running from death he could just die? Or Death adopts Harry as he can't get rid of him?

** "Vol" doesn't have anything to do with fleeing whatsoever, it actually either means "fly" or "steal".

"demort" is a really bad way of writing "of death". So really he'd either be protected from killer birds or wouldn't be killed by a thief gone wrong. Useless powerup tbh.

*** Like I said “improper French,” an I can see how that could make the spell suck.
