It doesn't have to be romance, but I'd like something detailing their friendship/relationship/whatever. I'd rather it focused on them, too. I'm up for AUs and I don't really care about the timeline.


** I liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7670834/1/Come-Once-Again-and-Love-Me][Come Once Again and Love Me]]. It's not a romance per se but a good look at what it would look like if Snape and Lily could redo life again with their adult memories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5411384/1/Lily-and-the-HalfBlood-Prince][Lily and the Half Blood Prince]] is an epic (600k+ word) story that tells Snape's and Lily's story from the beginning. I have not finished this fic yet, as it is in my 'currently reading' list, but what I read so far, it is true to canon. The fic description says it does follow canon so this one might end up with a Lily or Snape death in the end, so be aware.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment it Began]] is another redo the past, but this time it is Snape that does life over. He goes back to the day he lost Lily's friendship with the chance to not call her that foul name. This one is also on my 'currently reading' list so I don't know how it ends, but it did receive some good reviews.

*The Potion Master's Girlfriend* series was pretty good. It's been a while since I read them so I can't recall the details but I have the #2 story marked as a favorite. You could check those out as well. #3 in the series is a WIP. Parts [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7299389/1/The-Potion-Master-s-Girlfriend][1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7865520/1/The-Potion-Master-s-Girlfriend-2][2]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9257831/1/The-Potion-Master-s-girlfriend-3][3]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7207644/1/Second-Chance-Encounter][Second Chance Encounter]] was on an author I really like favorites page. It is on my 'want to read' list. It is 200k+ words long but unfinished.

Hopefully others will chime in with some other recs. I do love Snily!

** Yep. the tragically abandoned [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6306296/1/The-Apprentice][The Apprentice]]. Snape goes back to That Day at the Lake at the moment of his death and gets a do-over. Naturally, he chooses to be as unnoticeable as possible. Except to Lily.

Also, Snape works retail!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4400517/1/Ananke][Ananke]] is a good one, although it's incomplete.

Summary: A strange set of events sends the 19-year-old Lily into a terrible future where she and most of her friends are dead and the war is still on. Severus can't believe his luck. Can Lily change her fate? S/L

I'll also second the Come Once Again and Love Me recommendation. I don't think you'll find a better Snape/Lily story. Ananke comes close, but it's unfinished so it loses points.
