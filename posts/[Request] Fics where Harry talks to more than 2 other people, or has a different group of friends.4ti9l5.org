** linkffn(What You Leave Behind by Newcomb)

In this one, Harry is mostly just friends with Cho and Cedric, but other characters are pretty fleshed out too.

It's also one of the best fics around, and really hits the AU sweetspot (I think). It alters enough to really change the mystery and plot so that you're reading a completely new story, but still feels like canon.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
