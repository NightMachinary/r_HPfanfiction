I would like some fics where Ron bashing occurs. I just read Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion on ffn and now I want some recommendations from Reddit.


** Champion's Champion is the crème de la crème of Ron bashing. There's none better.

*** Is Ron an alcoholic fat loser who is also bad in bed there?

**** Ya know, I've read a lot of Ron bashing but idk I've ever seen him fat, alcoholic, or bad in bed. I suppose he had a bit of an alcohol problem in Picnic Panic but it was clearly a one off, not an addiction.

** 85%+ of all Harmony fics will have what you're looking for. Alternatively, [[/r/HPHarmony][r/HPHarmony]] probably has a list.

** I didn't like that one but to each their own. This is if Harry was in Slytherin and befriends Draco [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-Year-1-New-Version]]

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.
