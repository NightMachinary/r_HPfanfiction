  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

** I'm a bit late, and these are all oneshots, but:

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]]:

#+begin_quote
  A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione.
#+end_quote

​

2.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry suffers a few side-effects of dying but not dying.

  “Hey, can someone help me with this? The mirror in the bedroom's stopped working for me."

  “What do you mean ‘the mirror's stopped working'?”
#+end_quote

can be read as platonic or Harry/Hermione/Ron

3.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12391806][where there's a will]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry writes the first draft of his will when he is fourteen.
#+end_quote

This has a great trio friendship portrayal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

4.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106128/1/A-Clean-Shave][A Clean Shave]]:

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry's being an orphan has an unexpected side-effect, and Ron helps him out---learning a lesson in gratitude along the way.
#+end_quote

This is specifically a Harry and Ron friendship oneshot- not trio.
