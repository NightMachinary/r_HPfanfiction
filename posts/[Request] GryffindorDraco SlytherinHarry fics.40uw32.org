Any fics where draco is put in Gryffindor instead of Slytherin and vice versa for harry.


** So far all i can come up with is linkffn(A Slytherin in Gryffindor Clothing). I can tell you that most of the fics I have seen with a gryffindor!draco and a slytherin!harry are dimensional travel. I'm still searching for the few fics that I had read like this.

** It's not exactly the same thing here, but I do know of a story that has Draco living in the Burrow with the Weasleys. It's a post-Hogwarts fic tho, so the house switching doesn't really apply... Does that count as something that is relative for this topic? If so, let me know if you are interested and I will try to find it for you.

*EDIT:* In case you are interested, I just found it!! *[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=259885][Love, Not War]]* by: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=158706][/Yoshi_Kitten/]]
