I always thought there were a lot of wizards or witches who seem to be unmarried or without a family. Or in some mother's cases, all of the children are off to school or work and she's left at home.

So what do they do besides their jobs? I need ideas for my story.

I can list out reading the paper, listening to the radio and... that's it.

They might play games like Exploding Snap or Quidditch when they're all together, but besides that it seems pretty boring.

Are there get-togethers or parties that they go to? What would a day out or a free day mean for wizards and witches?

EDIT: Thank you for all the ideas. Really helpful guys!


** Tend the garden; read periodicals like the Daily Prophet, Witch Weekly, Transfiguration Today and newly-released books. Collect for card games that are a front for vicious gossip trading and opinionating. Try new recipes. Gamble. Shop for new distractions, new fashions, new sports equipment, new spell ideas.

For more interesting hobbies, I imagine some may trawl the antique shops, swap meets, and estate sales, looking for furniture, clothing and gadgetry that may be enchanted, or are good for enchanting.

*** Isn't Transfiguration Today an academic journal? Can't see that being many people's light reading

**** Not necessarily light reading, but: there's no research industry in the magical world. No universities providing grants, etc. Most cutting-edge magic will be done by the idle classes of the wizarding world, working on the stuff that interests them in particular.

If anything, I think Hermoine would be an outlier in these discussions - most people subscribing to /Transfiguration Today/ would be transfiguration specialists, who probably have only a moderate interest in charms or potion-making, but they're really into transfiguring. A polymath like Heroine or Albus Dumbledore might skim the journals, but probably works on bigger, broader stuff (like running the country) most of the time.

***** Idk, I got the impression that most magicals dispense with any meaningful practice of the craft once they leave Hogwarts, save for ravenclaws.

** Crafting hobbies? Knitting, sewing, cross-stitching, painting, drawing, writing, building and charming stuff... whatever else comes under that.

Maybe they have social clubs or gentlemen's clubs or the like. Afternoon tea with the other unwedded folk and stay-at-home mums.

You could look up what people did for fun before the internet was invented and we decided to spend all our free time on computers and mobile phones.

** The same stuff we do? I mean, look at all those sweaters Mrs. Weasley made for her kids. Some magic was probably involved in their creation, but I'd bet she did a fair bit of it by hand as it was something to occupy her time with.

Honestly, they probably have most of the same hobbies we do with some small variations, like instead of going for bike rides, they probably go for broom rides or something. So think about what you do, your friends and family do, and go from there.

** At Hogwarts? Homework, clubs, shoot the shit, and gossip, gossip, gossip.

Outside Hogwarts? Probably normal subsistence behavior. Do your job, come home, eat, listen to the radio, catch up on whatever idiot down the road is growing a second head, etc. Similar to what people's lives were like before television in a lot of cases, unless they live in cities and/or have regular access to muggle activities.

** For the rich ones, you might want to look up "The Season": it's like a string of social events that the upper classes go to in Britain. Heavily referred to in Regency fiction. Also, letter writing is a much bigger thing than you would think. Practising musical instruments, perhaps? Looking after magical animals (maybe there is some kind of show like Crufts but for magical creatures?)

** There's probably all sorts of magical competitions to compete in and spectate. Dueling. Some sort of target range/marksmanship sport. Transfiguration contests critiqued on speed/technique/detail/artfulness. Broom races. Abraxan horse races. Underground magical beast fighting. They likely have some pretty stellar plays to watch. We know Arthur Weasley casually tinkers with muggle things and accidentally granted sentience to a car.

#+end_quote

High class parties are what people like the Malfoys /do/. All the 'right' people basically take turns hosting events where they all dress up, eat nice food and drink expensive alcohol, and politic their asses off.

I can easily see the Weasleys meeting up with others for casual Saturday/Sunday magical barbecues and such.

Honestly though, that's not even getting into anything really creative.

** I've always thought of wizards as more interested in books, and more interested in the outdoors, than muggles are. I imagine most of what we all use to watch movies or TV, witches and wizards are reading books.

I could see flying being a common wizarding hobby. Getting out into the countryside and flying would be a common occurrence. Also, I imagine similar to adult football(soccer) and cricket and rugby leagues, there's a lot of wizards who play Quidditch with their friends.

I think traveling is more common in the wizarding world. Their ability to apparate makes it much easier to escape to the hillsides or even to venture to far-off places with the use of portkeys.

One thing they definitely seem to love is drinking. Wizard or muggle, we all seem to love taverns.

I also imagine a larger population than they like to admit is into Muggle culture. You already have muggleborns who likely still participate in muggle forms of entertainment. Then there are half-bloods who often at least know of the basics in the muggle world, depending on how their parents raised them. And I always picture Purebloods as having a "rebellious" phase after Hogwarts and they oftentimes wander out into the Muggle world and experience movies/muggle nightclubs/television/computers/muggle sports. Perhaps there are even some who decide to attend a Muggle university and get the full college experience.

** Mrs. Weasley is said to be a great fan of Lockhart's books, so I would believe that reading is definitely a favorite past-time for the average wizard.

** I'm just going to flat out disagree with most of what is posted here. We are muggles and we think like muggles, /we just don't know/.

Magic makes so many common pastimes that muggles indulge in completely irrelevant. Furthermore with the extra time saved by not needing to do basic things like cooking or cleaning or other tedious daily activities, magicals have a lot and I mean a lot of free time. This gets even more complicated by the fact the house elves do almost everything for you.

Most wizards would not know what a toothbrush is, but they would know a teeth cleaning spell. Wizards would know how to heat their food, but not know what a microwave is.

Canon really doesn't speak on this, and what it does isn't very helpful. JK sort of struggles with this, as her muggle mentality sort of makes magicals too much like muggles, so much so that it isn't really believable. This is further complicated by the fact that Harry is raised muggle and never really gets to see any real part of Wizarding Society.
