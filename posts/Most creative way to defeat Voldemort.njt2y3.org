****** (Sorry, if there's a bit [[/u/MoralRelativity][u/MoralRelativity]] is doing here, I'm not catching on to it.)

The fanfic in question is the (infamous) /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ (linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality)]]). For all of HPMOR's flaws, the ending /is/ genuinely great though. Less Wrong does a pretty stellar job thematically resolving the remaining plotlines and character arcs.

** There was a pre-HBP one where the author correctly predicted that the locked room had a pit of love potion. Harry pushes him in that pit and Voldemort becomes extremely obsessed with himself. Like to the point he gets depressed that he could never be with himself so he commits suicide. Weird result of the love potion but I suppose it works.

** Seeing someone comment about LL&LL reminded me of the fic it helped inspire, linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches). Harry and company beat Voldemort via a closed time loop with a time-turner. Then instead of killing him they hand him over to the Fae Queen, who calls up the Wild Hunt to play with her new toy.

Does unleashing his violent psycho of a girlfriend on Voldemort count? Because "Adorable Violence" by CloudZen is a fic I tend to recommend at every opportunity.

** It's not in a fic, but I have had a few ideas I don't quite know how to work into a story. One is to encase an immortal Voldemort into an iron sarcophagus/box (to weaken or negate his magical abilities) that is then taken by ship and dumped overboard above the Challenger Deep.

Another idea is to have Harry weaponize portkeys and have one send Voldemort to the wreckage of the Titanic.

*** There was a story a long time ago that did something like that although it was an evil Dumbledore who had invented a spell that allowed the caster to temporarily switch bodies with a target, but if the body of the target died while being inhabited by the caster they would both die. And because Dumbledore was such an unstoppable force, Harry's solution was to cast that spell on him, apparate himself on the moon at the exact time that by the spell would be broken Dumbledore would be about to die.

  Very short one-shot about Harry versus Voldemort at the final battle. Answering the question you never asked which is: How do you kill someone with a disarming charm anyway? It helps to imagine Daniel Radcliffe's comic depiction of Aragog's mandibles to get in the right frame of mind for this.
