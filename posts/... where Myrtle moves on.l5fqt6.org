All I remember is this one scene where Myrtle finally moves on to the afterlife, and all the ghosts are like super surprised she did. I think Hermione or someone got the moment on a wizarding photo too? Is this ringing any bells for anyone?


** Does this happen at the very end? There's one fic I know with this but it's kind of a spoiler.

*** Possibly. I'm pretty sure I read the whole thing, so I don't really mind if it is a spoiler. Maybe use the spoiler option to say which one it is?

**** Can't figure out on mobile but it's linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided).

But it's a super minor part of one of the last chapters.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Hmm, are you sure it was Myrtle?

I remember reading a fic once, can't remember the name, but it has Nearly Headless Nick move on, I think they described him as starting to glow gold before fading away.

It happened at his death day party, if I remember correctly. I think it was prompted by someone convincing him that the headless hunt crashing his party or whatever, was actually a sign of respect, or something like that. I don't remember all the details.

YESSS. This rings all the bells. Whoops lol. I had a feeling it was Say a Prayer, but my searches for Myrtle didn't result in anything obvious. Checked again but for Nick, and I found it. Thank you!! Happens in chapter 12 of linkao3(4629198)
