Being annoyed by the usage of Unbreakable Vows in fanfiction, I'm asking, does anyone know any fanfics in which a Vow or binding magical contract is subverted?

Not as in wriggling around the letter of the law/contract/vow/etc, as in outright breaking the magic so that the terms can be flouted with impunity.

There was a fanfic fairly recently, I don't remember the details but Snape & Harry had a good relationship in it, and when it was revealed that Draco was under an Unbreakable Vow in 6th year (to do what he did in canon, repair the Vanishing Cabinet and let Death Eaters into the castle), Snape used a lengthy ritual to dispel it and free Draco.

Also, the only other thing I remember about that fic was that Harry was learning runes, and in particular he was able to repair the runes on the underside of the Vanishing Cabinet himself.


** I don't know about breaking the vow but I know one fanfic did use the idea of avoiding the death by "technically" completing the vow. When Snape would die if he didn't kill Dumbledore, a more intelligent, creative Harry polyjuiced as Draco Malfoy, took Snape down to the Chamber of Secrets, left him there and completely convinced him by explaining a perfect plan of how to kill Dumbledore. Snape then believed Malfoy was fully successful and was stuck in the Chamber during Draco's "plan" and once the time for the plan elapsed, Snape's vow wore off because he believed Malfoy had finished the job. Can't remember what fanfic this was in but I think it was one where Dumbledore adopted Harry and took him into his home and Harry told his friends that his guardian's name was Skipper. Anybody know which fanfic I'm thinking of?

  AU after HBP:Chap2. After OotP, better choices are made: instead of staying a passive influence, Albus becomes an active part of Harry's life; and Ginny becomes a better friend. And at the end of summer, the hunt for the Horcruxes begins! H/G

**** He didn't do it because of a spell, though; he did it because Tom did something very stupid and basically made his own magic upstage him.

Also, the killing curse /did/ kill on that day, it just did not kill the intended target because of the caster's foolishness and arrogance. But kill it did.

****** Because it got killed. While it's but a technicality, I believe it to be enough not to pull this “failure” of the killing curse to kill the target as a reason enough to rename it.

Edit: changed “god” to “got”; screw you, auto-correct.

*** Well it could just be that was what it was called when it was first made, but after a long time of usage someone figured a way around it, but since everyone called it the unbreakable vow they just continued like that. Then there is also saying that it might be barely known at all ritual. ( I have not read the story in question, but these are some ways you could have the vows like that)
