Title. I've read a ton of different fics, some I liked, some I hated. Now I require /more/


** When I hit that point I just [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=103][sorted by favorites]] and started working my way down. Then I did [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-Crossovers/224/0/?&srt=4&r=103][the same with crossovers]]. Then I started diving into other fandoms.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

**** Yes, technically, but it's set in America with no HP characters so its between 100% to 99% OC.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

** If you've mainly been reading ffn maybe switch to ao3 and sort by bookmarks after you've filtered everything? That is what I did.

** I go to AO3 and build a search based on what I like. Or just plow through HP recs on the site (filter for your language of choice): [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter%20-%20J*d*%20K*d*%20Rowling/bookmarks]]
