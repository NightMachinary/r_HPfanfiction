Things I like

- Next gen (Any era is fine though)
- Scorbus, Scorlily, Frank/Alice, Hinny, Ronmione
- Crossovers (Preferably with Fullmetal Alchemist)

Things I don't like

- Explicit sex scenes/non-con
- Dramione, Snamione, Tomarry
- ANY kind of character bashing


** This may be too obvious a suggestion, but are you familiar with [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/LinksToFiclets][FloreatCastellum's drabbles]]? They're all great and they all fit your request perfectly, except for the Fullmetal Alchemist crossover, heh.

I also think you'd like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11577120/1/Harry-Runs-Into-An-Old-Muggle-Classmate][Harry Runs Into an Old Muggle Classmate]].

For Romione, I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12855760/1/Eighteen][Eighteen]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13258502/1/You-Only-You][You, Only You]]. I 100% recommend anything by those two authors.

And this is a little off the mark, but I'm willing to bet that you'd also like this male!Hermione/Ron story. It's one of my favorites, and it's so sweet: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13290002/1/a-mass-of-fools-and-knaves][a mass of fools and knaves]]

P.S. -- I'd love to hear what your favorite Frank/Alice is!

*** Thanks!

I would mention I have a few that are explicit sex scenes but I mark them as NSFW and there are only a handful in the 200+ one shots and drabbles.

** I'd have to add a shameless plug of my own. I wrote a one-shot called Shut Up and Kiss Me it's on FFN and A03.
