If a Death Eater regretted his decision to join, do you think amputating his left forearm would free him of his magical link to Voldemort? Or is the Dark Mark just an expression of the magical link, so even if he lost his forearm, the mark would reappear on his upper arm or somewhere?


** If amputating would work, why not just get a surgeon and a scalpel to peel the top layers of skin containing the Dark Mark tattoo off the arm? Hurts like hell, but saves the arm. And you can regrow the skin, assuming that it's not tainted by dark magic enough that you can heal it with a spell.

Obviously, we don't know enough for sure, and it could be anything from a variation of a Protean Charm, to some kind of soul magic where a Death Eater had to make a magical oath before he would be marked. If that's the case, the intent of the magic matters, so physical removal won't change anything.

Though I have seen fanfic authors do it. Even going as far as Harry having his scar surgically removed by muggle surgeons to take the horcrux out. It seems farfetched to me. But I do admit it would make a funny crackfic for a Death Eater to leave the ranks by getting their Dark Mark lasered off at a high street tattoo clinic.

Simple - maybe it runs deeper than that, but not enough to be bonded to the wizard's soul/magic/being/whatever.

***** Why not? I specifically said it's not bonded deeply enough to have that kind of effect. That it's just anchored deeply into the arm.

** I do think it would successfully free the Death Eater from the Mark. In fact, I used this exact plot point in my story at one point (though the reason was much different from just "repentant Death Eater doesn't want to be a Death Eater anymore"). I imagine however that Voldemort would maintain a link to the severed arm, and be able to control it to strangle the turncoat Death Eater, kind of like Pettigrew's silver hand.

*** I've seen it in a few stories as well, and I find it a believable solution. Sure, one could have it be a sort of soul magic that cannot be eliminated with the removal of one's arm, but I see nothing that requires it be so absolute.\\
And part of me really likes the idea of Voldemort retaining power of the severed arm, though that seems less believable to me, since he couldn't control his followers' bodies (only make them hurt), whereas Pettigrew's hand is his own creation. I still like the idea though.

**** Well, I feel like controlling the Death Eaters' bodies while they're alive, and controlling the severed arms, would be completely different things. The former would have to be some kind of remote Imperius Curse, which /does/ sound like a pretty hard thing to do; but the other one would be more akin to Inferi and Necromancy in general.

** If we take the Dark Mark at face value as just being a protean charm, then yeah, amputation should work. The protean charm wouldn't break, but instead would just be connected to the limb.

** I know this might be a bit off topic for the main discussion. But I can imagine in a "Ministry prepares detection of Dark Mark's" fic where one DE goes in really early and gets nabbed. Then the rest goes "They're looking for the marks." and amputates them. And they all get a metal arm of some sort and no, you can't ask why. That's rude.

​

The magic stays, and Voldemort's call is like a really strong phantom pain. Though, that's sort of like how I view it already.

** There is a fanfic somewhere where Snape walks around with his sleeve pinned up because his arm was amputated. He doesn't wear a prosthetic because he wants to unsettle people and has no use for it. Draco Malloy had to cut it off with an axe when Voldemort tried to kill Snape through the mark. Wish I confined that story. (It was not the main part of the plot, but it was interesting.)

Did he stop being a potions master in that fic? Why wouldn't he have a use for it? You know... pouring and stirring. Or pouring and holding a wand... or... I think you get my drift?

** I like the concept of the Dark Mark being attached to the Death Eater's soul itself, and should you cut off the arm, it will just appear in a different place, possibly a more embarrassing and/or painful one.

*** Yeah, I was planning on making the amputation work, but it seems like several other authors have already done that, so I might go the other way just to be different. The horror of your own severed arm trying to kill you, vs the horror of the mark you thought you'd gotten rid of reappearing elsewhere on your body. Actually, why not both?

**** I guess it all depends on how easily you want the Death Eater in question to escape Voldemort's rule. If the story is focused on other things, having a struggle to free themselves from the Dark Mark could take away from the narrative. Like if you're writing a Dramione heist story set in Switzerland or something, you could just refer to Draco having cut his Dark Mark out, or have him have to deal with having one arm only, as to be able to focus better on the story you want to tell.

Though I'm never against making Voldemort and his fellow antagonists more fearsome, so if it fits, I'd definitely go for making things difficult! In my eyes, one shouldn't be able to escape being a Death Eater that easily.

** I think mark is just representation of the magic, not the magic itself. The mark is attached to your magic or soul or whatever, but creates a tattoo on the arm. It's just something that Tom added to spell. Because he is possessive and wants to mark his property.

** I have to go with 'it's just the visible sign of a deeper link'.

​

Otherwise, what's to stop the Death Eaters' enemies from copying the Dark Mark to infiltrate them or just to screw with them?

​

For me, amputation of Death Eaters' left forearms is best left to their enemies, when they don't want to have to deal with a potential Dynamic Entry by Voldemort or other reinforcements if the Death Eater manages to activate his Mark.
