The Marauders deserve better than what they got... Can you recommend a fic where one one or both of them got to live a slightly better life than they did (bonus point for not dying at all, and extra bonus points for canon pairings in Harry's generation). Slash is fine.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): A more cunning and sinister Lucius kicked Dumbledore out of Britain after Halloween 1981. Sirius raised Harry in France. He, Neville, and Weasley kids all went to Beauxbaton.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

**** He has a happy ending in most of my stories. "Patron" is Harry/Hermione, but "Divided and Entwined" has - ultimately - canon pairings for Harry and co. Sirius plays an important role in both stories as well.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I'm in a mobster fic mood so linkao3(The Uncle) and linkffn(The Diadone method). The first is a oneshot with a little Remus/Sirius mentioned, and the second has aminor plot point involving them, but I can guarentee that they lived better lives than canon.

  When she thinks no one is looking, Petunia slaps three year old Harry while stuck in traffic. Mafia Lord Salvator Diadone notices and takes action. This is a Harry grows up in the mafia story, with a bit of a twist.

** Well I once brought Sirius back from the dead in order to give him a happy ending, but I suspect that isn't what you are looking for. I'm confused about what you want when you say 'bonus points for canon pairings in Harry's generation' and 'slash is fine'. That seems contradictory.

*** I mean canon pairings for people of Harry's age - but for the other characters, anything goes.

This is mostly because all the stories I seem to find by searching myself are H/H, Hr/Draco etc and I really don't like these pairings, and much prefer the canon ones.

** Very AU, so it might not be quite what you're looking for, but I found linkao3(1651109) to be a very enjoyable read! It's a non-magical AU and wolfstar, relatively lighthearted most of the time with a happy ending!
