Just caught up with reading Fate which has an amazing Ron characterization and was wondering if there's anything like that out there?


** I'm sure there are others, but this one is my favourite:

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** Linkffn(13312738)

Badass secret agent Ron centric. Here's one of my favorite scenes:

#+begin_quote
  Ron leaned out of the open door and peered down and ahead. "We're about..." He mentally calculated the distance relative to his current size. "...one yard out and two yards up."

  "Alright!" Luna whispered, though her voice was far too loud for Ron's peace of mind.

  The helicopter started to slowly move ahead.

  "Half a yard... one foot. Stop!" Ron called out. "Start descending."

  "Alright!"

  He saw the roof grow closer as the helicopter lost altitude. At around one foot, he called out "Stop!"

  "Copy!" Luna replied, and the helicopter stopped its movement, hovering in the air. Ron kicked the string they had spooled up out of the door, then attached his harness to it. "Ready?" he asked, glancing over his shoulder at Harry on the other side.

  "Yes," his friend replied.

  "Going down!" Ron announced, then climbed out and rappelled down, Harry doing the same on his side.

  They hit the roof almost simultaneously, then went to its edge and fastened more string to the roof rail there. By the time they were set for the next step, the helicopter had already left and headed back to Luna. And, after checking for spiders or other dangerous creatures hiding beneath the rail, they started climbing down. Towards the infrared-sensor.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
