Pretty self explanatory. I'm looking for fics where the SoS either never existed or has been abolished for a long time, wherein the entire world knows of magic whether they can actually perform it or not and the magical and non-magical populations are fully integrated and/or co-exist.

Also, as a side request rather than making an extra post, are there any fics with different kinds of magic? ie; Wizardy is different to Sorcery which is different to Magecraft or something?

Thanks!

  Dumbledore and Grindelwald combined forces and carved out an empire for "the greater good". Now, Harry must enter this confusing world and decide for himself what the Greater Good truly is. AU. Grey!Harry.

** This fic has great ideas (but a substandard execution). Nevertheless, it's a chronological timeline of the eventual fall of the Statute of Secrecy caused by Harry, who graduates from MIT after killing voldemort and eventually integrates the magical and Muggle worlds.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
