:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic a long time ago and I'm trying to find it again, if possible. Basically, aliens? took a bunch of wizarding kids and trained them on different planets before being returned to Earth. Harry, Hermione and Neville are a squad and Ron died in a training accident I believe. Hermione is mute or mostly mute, not sure. They try to fit in but don't really. after camping in the common room they request to be given a separate room that they can defend. The reasoning being that they only feel safe behind defenses due to their experiences abroad. I remember it being short, like only 2-3 chapters. If anyone knows what in talking about, please point me in a direction. If not, no worries.
