*Can be crack or serious.*

No judging, you can write an article about Petunia/Dobby and I'll respect that, but make it interesting, persuasive, funny, or all three.

*Rare pairs mean no canon pairings, Harmony, Snarry, Drarry, Sevmione, and Wolfstar (the most popular pairings on ao3).*

(FYI: My favourite rare pairs right now are Hermione/Theodore Nott and Hermione/Marcus Flint, courtesy of Seselt's stories.)


** [Marauder-era ofc] Sirius needs someone to keep him grounded. Petunia needs someone to help her lighten up. She wants so desperately to be part of the magical world. He wants to do stuff to tick off his pureblood-crazy family.

*** I actually want to read more fics with this pairing! I think Petunia could've actually grown to be a pleasant enough woman if she wasn't consumed by bitterness and jealousy, and Sirius getting her out of her shell and accepting her as she is and not as Lily's non magical sister would be the perfect catalyst for a coming-of-age story.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** Dudley/Cho (post Hogwarts and when he's had time to work on himself a little)

They're both jocks who are kind of underserved in canon and have Complicated relationships with Harry - and throwing them together is a fun way to make that even more complicated.

Plus, anything to get Dudley more attached to the magical world is interesting for me.

On a less wholesome Dudley note... I'd love an AU where Dudley also gets a Hogwarts letter, somehow ends up going, and then Dudley/Draco, two horrible little bullies. They start off enabling each other and bonding over bullying Harry, but later having Dudley around would probably help get Draco to question a lot of his views on muggleborns and could lead to some interesting growth from both of them.

** I legitimately think that Harry should've ended up with a Slytherin girl (or boy, but we all know that was never an option) a year younger than he.

Someone in his year would be a difficult sell, since we never get any indication that any of the Slytherins in Harry's class are anything but totally on board with Malfoy and Parkinson's bullying, and anybody older would have graduated at the end of HBP, so there's nobody to for Harry to worry over in DH like he did Ginny, so it has to be someone younger, but not /too much/ younger, because that'd be creepy. Since Harry was born in late summer, having someone whom he initially treats like a kid because she's a year below him only to have her point out that he's, like, two months older than she is would be pretty funny.

+Plus think of all the "notice me senpai" jokes. Frankly, we should've been making them with Ginny all these years; I'm a little ashamed of the HP fandom right now.+

*** I agree with you, maybe Astoria?

I, however, think any Slytherin would be a nice move to kind of redeem the House, I mean, we never get any named Slytherin being proactive in the bullying other than Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Parkinson, for all we know they were just there and reacted like everyone else, it would be nice to have a character go against the norm and be a black sheep in the House because they are ambitious but don't agree with the racist crap.

This would go against the rather black and white view of Gryffindor = Good and Slytherin = Bad with the other two Houses just being there for show most of the time.

It would also force JKR to write a better romance than HarryxGinny flash romance.

** Harry/Newt. most of the time, harry has accidentally traveled back in time as a result of some shenanigan during his Auror or Unspeakable work. so they are both very capable and they both have a lot of knowledge and sympathy for magical creatures.

** I'm a big fan of Harry x Tonks. When Harry meets her he's super angsty, with the weight of the world on his shoulders. She's a bubbly fun older girl, and a lot of fanon tropes around her include her being bullied/used while she was a teen. While it's overused in fics, with Harry being the one guy who likes her for who she is, I think it could be used in a much better way, with her helping him deal with the bullshit he goes through at school by relating it to her own experiences and how she dealt with them. They have a common link with Sirius, and his death could have been used to bring them closer together. She could help loosen him up, and learn to let the bullshit go and only focus on what really matters and what he can control, like dealing with Voldemort and being with his friends. She's also an auror, so she could help him become a better combatant, and they could have a closer relationship even if they're not paired together.

**** Age difference is a funny thing - it's very much dependent on what 'bucket' we mentally slot people into. Like, I sort Tonks into the one /just/ above Harry, so it feels like it's fine but somewhat borderline - whereas her canon pairing of Lupin feels like he's /way/ older than that.

I don't know how the actual differences stack up, and it's very much an emotional response.

**** Eh, they're fictional characters so I see them differently than real life ones. Although the issue for me would be Harry's age specifically rather than the age gap. Like, if he was 18 and she was 25 no one would have a problem with it, but him being 15 when he meets her makes it an issue.

I know that in a lot of places in Europe the age of consent is 16, although I don't know the full context of it (like if it only applies to people less than 5 years older than a 16 year old or something like that), and the wizarding world's adult age is 17. That also only applies to a sexual relationship, so having them not have a sexual relationship until that time would be acceptable legally within the context.

It sounds like something that /could/ have happened in cannon, a possiblity. Urgh. It's not my fave, and I don't like it because of it's cuteness or anything (Far from cute), I like it because of it's creativity. I remember someone making it up in a one-shot.
