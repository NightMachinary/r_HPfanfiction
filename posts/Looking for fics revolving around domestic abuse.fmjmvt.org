Are there any good stories that deal with domestic abuse. Im looking for something with the abuse as an important plot point and not just as an excuse to split up a pairing the author dosent like.

any pairing is great but i,d prefer ones that have role reversials so abusive Harry rather than evil Ginny or Hermione as the abuser

â€‹

but all are welcome


** Abusive Hermione would be fun to read. After all, Ron was attacked by a flock of canaries.

** linkffn(After Dark by Tydbox)

It's a dark one shot written by me ik crappy self-promotion but one character here was in two abusive relationships ships.

One emotionally and one physically!

#+begin_quote
  A new fanfic that follows a young assassin known to few as Rogue and to fewer as Harry James Potter who fights for innocent lives in the shadows. A massive crossover with mainly Assassin's Creed, Harry Potter and Percy Jackson themes. And some small Witcher connections. WRITING GETS BETTER FURTHER IN. Please enjoy. Rated t for language and safety.

** The website isn't coming up for me right now, but my notes say that [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8265][this]] is a story in which Hermione is the victim in an abusive relationship.

linkffn(Harry Potter and his Resignation by Hexadecimal666) is a story that starts with the first 9 chapters of the above, then goes in a different direction.

  Hermione left Harry Potter after the final battle. Harry finds her years later in Africa, battered and abused, with a daughter of her own. And Hermione still asks him to leave. Spin-off bunny from a Portkey story.

*** Not always I was watching a documentary on the ID channel and they showed a man who terrified his whole family and another episode showed an abuser who never hurt his children

Vernon seemed to truly love his wife so possibly not as he seemed to go after Harry to beat the magic out of him

*** Abuse can be very targeted and narrow. My house was like that, where I was abused by my mother, but my older sister never suffered even a raised hand. My sister never even knew what my mother was doing to me the whole time.
