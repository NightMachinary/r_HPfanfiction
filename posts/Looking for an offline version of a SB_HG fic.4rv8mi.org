Hi Everyone... sorry to barge in but I'm desperate - does anyone happen to have some version of the fic Sirius de Bergerac by Gregor please? It was archived at GrangerEnchanted.com and nowhere else it seems like... unfortunately I somehow missed backing it up and now it's gone forever! Any help would be appreciated... Thanks in Advance.


** Looks like the Wayback Machine has the site: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20151204122409/http://www.grangerenchanted.com/]]

Which isn't to say it has the story.

In the future, if you see a site that's going away, you can ping me and I'll find a way to archive it. Sometimes it's nothing more complicated than =wget --mirror http://site.com=.
