I really really dislike most slash fics. Many have these repeating problems of either desperately warping characters to get them to bang, characters that base their relationships on nothing but lust, not love, characters 'falling in love' and then banging the other person like two pages later, Harry somehow having the hots for Draco (wat), etc. etc.

And even those that don't have these problems, often fall into the cliches which aren't exclusive to slash, like soul bonds explaining away every other possible love interest, true love on first sight, mary sues, etc. etc.

And that makes me very sad, because I know that actually good slash fics should theoretically exist - I know this, because I remember reading one of them!

And what made this particular fic (which I sadly don't remember the name of) better than so many other of the slash category?

Well, it made the relationship a byproduct of a deep friendship, and not just the obvious goal the whole story pointed towards.

Iirc that particular fic was a timetravel or AU fic, where Harry somehow ended up un the marauders era and befriended the crew, or at least tried to. Just that it turned out that James was annoying, Sirius downright hostile over (what he assumed) someone trying to steal his friends, Peter overshadowed by ehat Harry remembered of his future, and Snape (whom he wanted to give a second chance) a git like always. But he and the quiet Remus just clicked, and slowly Harry and Remus became best friends, and they were really similar in lots of ways (secrets they had not yet shared with their friends, opposed to any type of conflict if possible, etc.), but also different in ways that made them interesting to each other (Remus, the voice of reason, Harry, the voice of courage, Remus having a loving family but being afraid about losing his friends, Harry without family, but certain the friendship would work out, etc.)

And the friendship became stronger and stronger, and at some point just became more, completely naturally, without them having to abandon their character traits just to fit the story. It wasn't an adult relationship (I'm not even sure they ever even came as far as kissing), but the characters were actually in a relationship, and it felt important.

And that's something I'd like to read, even the same story again if necessary (if I only knew what it was called), because I really hate missing out on potentially really cute moments between two characters, just because they are buried below a mountain of garbage.

I'm not focused on particular characters, I'm only focused on this certain dynamic, a friendship gone romantic. (I just think that this already excludes some pairings, because I already have difficulties picturing friendships between those charcters to begin with, e.g. anyone with Draco)

  Dean has known he's bisexual since he was sixteen, but he's never told anyone, not even his best friend Seamus. This would be less of a problem if Seamus wasn't so obviously straight. Or if Dean didn't have an amazingly inconvenient crush on him. Dean/Seamus (Deamus) slash. Takes place three years after Hogwarts.

  In a world where wizards are given timers that count down to the day they meet their soulmates, Seamus Finnegan chooses not to look- until a gust of wind and a conversation with Dean change everything. Soulmate timer tattoo AU. Some gratuitous swearing.

** linkffn(Extended Family by Athey) HP/DM It has some clich√©s like Harry and Draco part-veela, but it's tastefully done, and the relationship evolves from friendship not from being suddenly destined mates. In fact, Harry's third year is mostly spent worrying about the veela transformations, not love and allure.

Willful Blindness Author: Teague Author Email: macteague at lycos.com Date: Nov 1, 2001 Category: Drama, more or less. Pairing: Percy/Oliver Spoilers: First through third books, emphasis on the third. Although, if you haven't read the books, what on earth are you doing here? Go read them! Now! Rating: R Summary: Separating truth from perception can be a messy business. Disclaimer: JK Rowling owns the characters and entire backstory of this. Not mine, not using them for profit, merely for entertainment and to increase my writing skills. Consider this a sincere form of flattery. Distribution: Anyone that wants it may archive it, just send me an email to let me know. Warnings/Author's Notes: 1.There is discussion of sexual harassment in this story, so if this is triggering for you, please skip this story. 2. If you're a die-hard Marcus Flint fan, you might want to skip this one. While I like some of the fandom redemptions of the character, I did not like or trust his character in the books. 3. I've changed a few facts around, as you may notice. Generally anything I write is automatically AU to some degree, but this one is more so than most. IE. Sites I checked disagreed with me about Flint's age, I've moved Hogsmeade weekends around, started the Quidditch practices earlier, and of course, none of this happened in the books. /grin/ 4. Takes place during book 3.

** Saving Connor is a good one! It's Harry/Draco which I often hate because it feels forced and makes no sense, but it's very gradual and sensible. However, it is a 7-part story and is barely romantic in book 4. If you've got time for that then it's A+

** Just noticed this post (I don't stop by this sub very often) and wanted to second Remus/Sirius as a good choice for you if you're looking for a Friends To Lovers dynamic.

I'm a little out of the loop on what the most popular authors are in that pairing currently, but one of the classic R/S Friends To Lovers fics is The Shoebox Project: [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/]]
