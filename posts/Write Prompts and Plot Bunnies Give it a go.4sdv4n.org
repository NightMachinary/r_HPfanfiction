Like many people, I have a lot of fun plot bunnies which I think would make great little stories. Sadly I have the dedication of a five year old attempting to complete university maths and although my writing skill isn't too shabby, I'm quite critical of it.

So I thought since /I'm/ never going to write any of these, I'll share them with you guys and we might be able to write something fun.

Feel free to share your own plot ideas or comment with a written piece, as we all know not all stories need to be novel length. Ok I'll start us off:

--------------

*Harry Potter: The Chav Who Lived*

Let's be honest, the Harry Potter in the books is hardly representitive of the best of British children. Let's have some proper slang and shit innit! Harry got in with a group of chavvy kids, since his Aunt and Uncle frankly didn't give a shit what he did as long as he wasn't in the house. He becomes a bully, a criminal (as far as kids under eleven get), all before he ends up at Hogwarts.

How would a chav with behavioural issues do at the finest wizarding institution in the land?

--------------

*Groundhog Day*

Most fanon's have at least one good Groundhog Day style time loop fic, but I haven't found one yet! Possible candidates are Snape, Dumbledore (how far could the greatest wizard of all time be pushed with endless failure?), Harry, Hermione or whoever else you'd like!

Typically I thought I'd focus on a catastrophic Death Eater battle which results in everybody's death as the main event or something equally terrible happening.

--------------

*Mary Sue Yourself*

After reading a great fic in the MLP fandom, I thought this would be fun for the HP universe as well.

An established character inexplicably becomes a Mary Sue (or Gary Stu). Everything starts going amazing for them, they win with no effort at all! But the success starts to become tiresome, romantic partners throw themselves at the character and he doesn't know if their love is real. Even the greatest of feats are unfulfilling and boring. Worst of all, great villains rise for our hero to stop them with their great magic, causing large collateral damage.

(Optional: Dumbledore is immune to the effects of the Sue, and attempts to stop the main character from raping anybody or being harmed in turn while trying to undo the magic of the Sue Curse.)

--------------

I'm interested to hear your takes on these ideas or your own plot bunnies!

Edit: Not sure what the flair should be, sorry!


** *A Proper Riddle*: Merope doesn't lift the enchantment/potion until Tom Riddle Jr. is born, and Tom Riddle Sr. leaves with his unwanted baby in tow. Tom raised by Muggle landed gentry instead of in an orphanage.

I think your first idea would need different Dursleys though, because before Hogwarts I don't think they let him leave the house much.

*** It was a calm, sunny day in Little Hangleton. Men and women went about their business in the market or in the fields, all the while a calm breeze rushing through the grass. Little Hangleton was a small village, a fair bit away from the nearest town. Strangers visiting the village were notable, unexpected or unusual visitors even more so. It was for this reason that everybody in the village, from Jerry the baker to Emily the beggar had heard of the wild man with the bright red hair who had seemingly appeared out of nowhere, not a carriage or car to be seen.

The stranger in question was quite aware of the commotion he had caused, his keen ears picking up the conversation which sprang up as he walked into the village square. A few moved to challenge him or introduce themselves but at the last moment released they had better things to be getting on with. Albus Dumbledore smiled as he watched the muggles fall prey to his minor muggle aversion ward, fingering the wand in his pocket. No matter the slight distastefulness of using even such benign magic on muggles, it was still mildly amusing. As he neared a crossroads, he stopped, turning to a boy sitting on a pile of hay nearby.

"Excuse me young man, could you spare a moment?" he said, startling the boy who'd been gazing at him with undisguised curiosity.

"Erm," the boy hesitated to answer, his eyes glazed. Dumbledore twisted his wand, ending the confusion ward. The boy's eyes cleared and he shook his head. "Yes sir. What do you need sir?"

"I'm in need of some directions you see. Do you happen to know which of these roads leads to the Riddle House?" he asked kindly. The boy nodded energetically.

"'Course sir, its down the left sir. Bit of a walk though." he said. Dumbledore smiled at the lad and patted him on the head.

"Thank you very much little sir. You were of great help." Dumbledore handed the boy a small toffee, and went on his way.

After a half hour, Dumbledore was facing the ornate door of what was undoubtedly the Riddle House, his reflection gleaming off the polished woodwork. He grabbed the brass knocked and gave the door three sharp raps. After a short wait the door opened to reveal a slightly haggard looking matron in a maid's uniform.

"May I help you sir?" she asked politely.

"Yes I believe you may. Could I speak to Mr and Mrs Riddle?" he said. The matron smile became strained.

"Do you have an appointment? We weren't expecting any visitors."

"I'm afraid not, but it is a matter of utmost urgency." The woman hesitated for a second before stepping aside, allowing Dumbledore to enter the house. The hall he entered was immaculate and ornate, if a little dated compared to some of the other muggle houses he'd visited over the last few years. If Dumbledore had to guess, he would say that the hall had been furnished with the most expensive materials and style available at the time, but it hadn't been updated in years. Still, he could see no dust.

The matron, whose name he learnt was Susan, led him into a small smoking room and offered him a cup of tea. Dumbledore declined and took a seat on one of the large armchairs. Too little cushions for his taste, but he resisted the urge to cast a quick softening charm on the seat once Susan left to get Mr and Mrs Riddle. After a short wait, Dumbledore finally got his first look at the couple he had come to see.

Mr Riddle had the look of a man who had aged too quickly. His features were handsome, but they were tarnished by deep stress lines and dark circles under his eyes. From the moment he entered Dumbledore was hit with the smell of fine whiskey and cigars, heavier than even the scent in the room designed for those very things. Mrs Riddle trailed behind him. She was dressed in a fine frock, her light brown hair tied up in a neat bun. She surveyed Dumbledore with a haughty expression, her nose turned up. Dumbledore stood as they entered bowing his head in respect.

"Mr and Mrs Riddle, I am very pleased to meet you." he said, hand outstretched. Mr Riddle gave it a quick shake and then sat down in the armchair opposite Dumbledores, leaning over to pour whiskey from a decanter on a nearby table. Mrs Riddle rolled her eyes.

"If I may be so bold, what is name and what is your business here, we are not fond of uninvited guests." said Mrs Riddle impatiently. Dumbledore raised a single bushy eyebrow. So it was one of those visits then.

"Pardon my lady I shall get to the point. I am a Professor at a prestigious school for children of particular gifts. I doubt you shall have heard of us but we go by the name of Hogwarts. I am here to offer a place at the school to your son." he said calmly. Mrs Riddle sneered.

"Son," she spat. "We have no sons, only daughters." Mr Riddle winced.

"I believe he means..." he started, his voice haggard, but his wife cut him off.

"I know who he means," she said, raising her voice. "He means the bastard. But he is no son of mine."

She turned to Dumbledore, who was surprised to hear the venom in her voice.

"I will take my leave, this does not concern me." And so she left, storming out of the room, the matron trailing behind her. Mr Riddle sighed and took a long sip of his drink, rubbing his forehead gently.

"I apologies for my wife," he finished the drink and placed the glass on the table. "It is a sensitive subject."

Dumbledore thought that much was obvious, but refrained from saying so. He waited for Mr Riddle to continue. The man did so with a sigh.

"You're talking about my bastard," he admitted, grimacing. "I'm afraid you have quite wasted your time, Tom will not be going to any special academy or school. I doubt my wife would stand it. Good day Mr Dumbledore." he stood to leave but Dumbledore raised his hand.

"I'm afraid Mr Riddle that I might be able to persuade you otherwise, might I speak with him?" Mr Riddle looked at Dumbledore with confusion. "Tom is gifted in, shall we say, a /unique/ way."

A few moments past before Mr Riddle's eyes widened. He sprang back, nearly tripping on the armchair behind him as Dumbledore stood up in shock.

"You're one of /them/ aren't you." he said, voice wavering. Dumbledore's hand went to his pocket, this wasn't turning out he'd as expected.

"You are aware of us?" he asked cautiously. Mr Riddle nodded.

"I'm very much aware, the boy's mother was one of you, I'm certain of it." he said.

Beyond his panicked expression, the ghost of a smile shot across his face. He grabbed the decanter and refilled his glass.

"I knew I was sane. I knew I'd been coerced." he said. Dumbledore's brow furrowed. Mr Riddle drank the whiskey in one go, refilling the glass once again.

"The boy's in the small house at the back, or in the gardens, I don't know. If he accepts he can go, if not then leave. I want nothing more to do with this business."

Dumbledore opened his mouth to reply, but Mr Riddle cut him off.

"Go. Now." he said with finality. "His devil of a mother bewitched me. I always had my suspicions but it sounded insane. Now I have confirmation. I've done my duty, I've done more than any other man would have. Now take him or leave. Susan will show you out."

With those words Mr Riddle left the room. Dumbledore shook his head, bewildered by the whirlwind of events but slowly coming to what he hoped were the right conclusions. Shaking his head at the absurdity and sadness of the unfortunate situation, he followed in Mr Riddle's footsteps, hoping the find the boy who was the target of his visit to the Riddle House.

**** He found the boy in the gardens. His features were unmistakably his fathers, though he looked more carefree, skipping stones across the waters of a small brook which ran through the Riddle property. He was dressed in smart clothing, though Dumbledore smiled at the grass stains marring the knees of his trousers. He approached the lad slowly, careful not to disturb the sacred act of childhood. Tom whooped as he managed four skips with a particularly good stone.

"That was a very good one wasn't it?" Tom yelped as Dumbledore spoke, turning around to face him. Dumbledore grinned. Nothing was too sacred.

"Who are you?" said Tom, wary. Dumbledore walked closer and sat down on a nearby stump, grunting as he bent down.

"These bones of mine," he chuckled. "I do say, I'm beginning to feel my age at last."

Tom stood, still apprehensive of the old man he saw as a stranger. Dumbledore sighed.

"My name is Professor Albus Dumbledore, Mr Riddle. I am here to offer you a place at Hogwarts, a school for pupils with gifts such as yourself." Tom's demanour shifted. His face curious.

"Gifts?" he asked. Dumbledore nodded. "What kind of gifts?"

Dumbledore looked knowlingly through his half moon spectacles at the boy before him.

"Oh I think you know." he said simply. Tom shifted in place.

"Prove it." he said after a moment, staring Dumbledore dead in the eye. Dumbledore started pointedly at a large rock behind the boy, who turned to look at it also. After a moment the rock smoothly rose into the air, causing Tom to gasp. With a small hand motion from Dumbledore, the rock shot across the brook, hitting the bank across the waters. Tom turned to look at Dumbledore in amazement.

"You can do it to?" he whispered. Dumbledore nodded, making a mental note of that little admission.

"You are what is called a wizard Tom, as am I. From what I have seen, you may not have had the happiest time here. I am unsure. But what I am certain of is that you are magical Tom. At Hogwarts you will learn how to harness and control that power, channeling it into spellcasting and other magical arts." As he spoke Tom's eyes widened evermore, his composure breaking as a childish glee began to show in his face.

"Could have been better," Tom remarked. "Could have been worse."

"Do you want to come with me Tom? Do you wish to join Hogwarts?" Dumbledore asked, already knowing the answer.

"Yes." said Tom breathlessly. "I want to learn, /magic/."

Dumbledore smiled.

--------------

The ancient wizard sat back in his chair, idly pulling his beard out of the pensive.

"Did I know then?" he remarked to the brightly colored phoenix which sat on the perch next to his desk. "That he would become the most influential wizard in recent memory?"

Fawkes trilled in response, cocking his head.

"No," Dumbledore breathed. "But the thought crossed my mind."

*FIN*

--------------

Phew, that was a fun prompt. Haven't wrote a oneshot in a while, even if nothing happens. I like the thought of a Tom Riddle that has still faced hardship and has a thirst to prove himself as a consequence, but is more lighthearted and faces different issues in his childhood. Tom Riddle could have been a brilliant wizard if only he faced a little more love in his life, even if it wasn't without its downsides.

** Sorry, I had a plot bunny form off of your plot bunny (duobunny?)!

*Groundhog Day -* In the 7th book's Hogwarts battle, Ron attempts to be the hero. Over... and over... and over again, because he /needs/ to save his friends. Yet, every time it fails until the last time in which he plays the sidekick and the canon plot plays out.

I don't want a Ron basher, just one where some wonderful character growth goes on. I wish I was a good enough writer for it.

** I want a long one shot about Floo Powder. I feel like there's a good story in there:

#+begin_quote
  Its manufacture is strictly controlled. The only licensed producer in Britain is Floo-Pow, a company whose Headquarters is in Diagon Alley, and who never answer their front door.

  No shortage of Floo powder has ever been reported, nor does anybody know anyone who makes it. Its price has remained constant for one hundred years: two Sickles a scoop. Every wizard household carries a stock of Floo powder, usually conveniently located in a box or vase on the mantelpiece.
#+end_quote

Who made Moody's trunk and how? I want to read a story about the small family shop that makes a few magical trunks a year. Very expensive, hard to make, jealously guarded secrets. In my mind, they make one super trunk akin to the fanon trunks and a handful of nice, but not as deluxe, trunks a year. Their expensive nature and scarcity means they're passed through families and may be part of dowries and trousseau's.

I have a couple others. I've started sketching one of them-my hope is that I'll write it out! We'll see. I've been looking to start and new hobby and it would be free

*** *Floo Powder Prompt*

The Hopkirk family is rather strict in their teachings. Never misuse magic. Never perform new magic unsupervised. And, most importantly, never change what does not need changed. We do not care whether one is pureblood or muggle, as long as our magic remains constant and useful. If someone is unmagical, we find ways to utilize that too. In our family business, everyone is an equal until they prove they are not worthy of our respect.

Unfortunately, we are mostly Hufflepuffs. Loyal above else to our family and values; forgotten by the rest of the world. Well, it's probably for the best. If they knew we created their main means of travel... well, we would be rich. Or spoiled, my Gran'mama likes to say. Neither sounds horrible to me, but I have not learned the ways of the world, as she likes to further remind me.

You see, a long time ago, my ancestor created Floo Powder from coal. She was not a talented alchemist nor was she what we would nowadays consider intelligent, but she was said to be blessed with Merlin's luck. The right amount of heat, a splash of too cheap wine, and a mispronounced spell creates the magical world's most precious handful. A pile of soot-like particles that can teleport you from one place to another with a simple fireplace connection. Amazing. Astonishing. Too real to be true!

Yet here life is, reliant on its existence.

For only two Sickles a scoop, the magical world lives on merrily. They neither question Floo-Pow's monopoly or want to improve on our only merchandise. They simply expect that this is what is and always will be.

That isn't good enough!

I don't plan to fix our powder. I want to fix our business. Restrict our product's production slowly and watch as our distributors scramble to satisfy the demand. Prices will rise. Select stores will boom with customers. We will flood in cash! My family will applaud me.

As the son of Mafalda, a direct decadent, I expected my idea to be welcomed into the family's ideology. They weren't keen with them at first but, when I was sorted into Slytherin...

I...

I am Jared. I have no last name. I have no ambition. I...

want...

But, I must not.

I...

** Whenever I try to write, I end up with a lot of descriptive and informative snippets, and virtually no narrative. Here's a prompt, something I want to incorporate in the fic I'm working on, but feel like could be a neat starting point itself:

*Snitch's Wish*: Harry, when introduced to Quidditch, immediately sees the terribly poor ruleset and, fed up after a game or two at the unfairness of it all, decides to mess with the equipment to make it more interesting. Acceleration Charm on the Snitch, Featherweight Charm on the Quaffle, etcetera.

After some fun for a few matches, however, he runs into a problem: The school's match snitch is getting fond of him.
