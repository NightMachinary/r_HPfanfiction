So I know this is kind of a strange request, but I'm looking for a specific type of Hermione time-travel fic. It doesn't particularly matter whether she is in the past to change things or not (though I would prefer if she did), but I'm looking for fics where someone (preferably a love interest) notices her scars from the past, and asks questions about them. For some reason I just love the angst of it.

I've read The Debt of Time, and thought I hate that she isn't back to change the past, one of my favorite parts of the story is Sirius questioning her about how she got her scars. Her scar from Dolohov at the Ministry, the Mudblood scar from Bellatrix (yes, I know this is movie, not actual canon, but I love how fanfic authors choose to use this one aspect from the movies - it's just good writing!), and any other scar she might have gotten from fighting Death Eaters. I've also read a few Tomoine fics where this comes into play as well.

My favorite time-travel pairings are Hermione with Sirius, Remus, or Tom Riddle, though if someone were to suggest a really good Severus Snape pairing, I would try it out. HG/SB and HG/TMR are my absolute favorites, though. I would like for it to stick to canon as closely as possibly before she travels to the past, and I prefer no Weasley bashing at all. Honestly, you don't have pto turn Ron into a bumbling, crumb-spraying, cheating idiot to pair Hermione with someone else. Manipulative Dumbledore is okay, /if/ it's done well, though personally, I don't like it. No slash with the main characters, please (e.g. Harry traveling back as well and getting with Sirius, Remus, or Severus). Just not my cup of tea.

I feel like I've read a /lot/ of Hermione time-travel fics, so extra points if you can throw one out that I've never read before!

  In the midst of the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione is given the opportunity to help save Snape's life. Little did she know it would require visiting Hogwarts twenty years prior. She has thirty-one days to befriend the sullen Slytherin, and perhaps save his life. But, as always, things don't always go as planned. HG/SS, time-travel, EWE

  It seemed ironic that the one thing that could ruin the magical world, the defeat of Voldemort, and Hermione Granger's perfectly ordered life was a book. Time-travel fic. Tom/Hermione. DH-compliant.
