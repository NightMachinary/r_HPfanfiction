:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I can't remember exactly whats the summary was because it was quite a while ago, but it was something along the lines of Harry losing all his friends and wife after the war and then traveled back in time into his 11-year-old body. But I'm not sure losing his wife was part of this fic or I'm confusing 2 fics together. Thanks in advance if anyone can find it with this little information *üôà*


** This might have been Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian.

No wife here and sadly the stoy was never finished, but it does fit your description quite well.

And if this is not what you are looking for I would still recommend to read it.

*** I don't think this is it either because I think the story is still on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] I think and the summary is much shorter than this, but after reading the first chapter I gotta say I'm hooked, tho kinda sad that the story is abandoned.

**** The author suffered from some very serious health issues a number of years ago and the recovery process has been long. The story was removed from ffn on some bogus copyright grounds, though the author has appealed ffn. He's starting to feel up to writing again so don't feel too sad. Its a great fic.
