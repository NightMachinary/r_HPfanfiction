By which I mean, rather than some kind of self-serving claptrap meant to justify poorly-written evil plans, Dumbledore's actions actually do improve things for the majority, at the cost of screwing over a small minority? I'm sure I've seen this, but I can't place any of them.

Anything that qualifies is appreciated, from long novels to one shots, and regardless of pairings or genre.

** The majority of Starfox5's fics. Personally, my favorite is linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died), but most are above average or better. Patron also has two Dumbledores working for the "Greater-Good."

*** In as much as the "small minority" being sacrificed are the Death Eaters and their supporters - not innocents. My take on Dumbledore generally is a man who hates killing, but would rather kill the guilty than risk the innocent, and would rather shoulder that burden himself than let someone else stain their hands.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** I thought in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] by White Squirrel has one of the best portrayal, in my opinion, of Dumbledore I have ever read.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** One of the things I realized is that cannon Dumbledore's "Greater Good" is absolutely false for the simple fact that he is essentially one person making decisions based upon secret info that he doesn't share. One person can not make decisions for a whole community.

Dumbledore is in no way evil, but if forced to tell the truth of all his actions to non corrupted officials he would be labeled either a criminal or absolutely incompetent.
