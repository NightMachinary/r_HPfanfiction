So , i recently read this fanfic where there was a self insert that was the attention of -minerva's affection so i though : is there a fanfiction where she is young (still at Hogwarts) and is having a romance with and OC ?

So that is what i am asking, is there a fanfiction where Minerva McGonagall is still in Hogwarts and has a romance with an original character ?
