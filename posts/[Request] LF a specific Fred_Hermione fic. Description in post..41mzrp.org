Hello I'm looking for a fic I read a long time ago (aka many fics ago haha) the details are a bit hazy so I was hoping someone could help me

It's set after the war with Fred living, except he has some kind of memory loss, and wakes up thinking that Hermione is his fiance.

For some reason everyone decides it would be best for Fred's mental state to go along with it.

So the fic progresses with Hermione pretending to be Fred's fiance and subtly trying to learn all the bits of the relationship from Fred so he doesn't suspect it's not real and have a mental break down.

There's a plot twist at the end, which I don't want to reveal in case anyone wants to read it without being spoilered if the fic gets found.

Thanks :)

  Fred went into a coma after the Battle. He was unconscious for days, and when he woke up he believed in a world that didn't exist. One that will forever change his and Hermione's life. "If he says something barmy you want us to go with it?" "Precisely!"
