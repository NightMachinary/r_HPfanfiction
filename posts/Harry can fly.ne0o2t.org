#+begin_quote
  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

**** Okay, so are you looking for via wings (see post above), magical ability, or animagus? I've read several fanfics involving the latter two, though I can't remember any of them off the top of my head.

Now that I think about it, I can't say that I've seen any where the ability to fly was in the forefront aside from a couple of Superman crossovers.
