I figured i'll put this up as some people including myself are looking for wandless magic casting harry.

So any story where harry has at least decent skills in wandless magic, and it must also have at least say 40k+ words.


** *Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum* - by *Irish216* linkffn(9939304) - Harry grows up in Bulgaria and goes to Durmstrang. His scar is a very powerful rune and he has the ability to use wandless magic.

*** I second this. It's an amazing story, far better than Thanks to a Snake, in my opinion.

The author really left us hanging without the epilogue.
