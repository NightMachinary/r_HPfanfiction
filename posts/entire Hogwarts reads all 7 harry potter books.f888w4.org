** I can't help but think the best way to do "character reads the books" is not to do a chapter-by-chapter reaction and commentary thing; but open with them finding them, skip over the time it takes for them to read them, and then pick up after they've finished reading the last book as they try to come to terms with what they've read, and what (if anything) they can do with their newfound knowledge.

** I think the problem is that writing of this type of books becomes so horribly boring for the author they gave up usually. The best I know of this trope is linkao3(A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel;A Sensational Story by Srikanth1808, White_Squirrel) and even the second author passed out in the beginning of the second book.
