I'm sure this gets asked a lot, but with a bit of a twist.

Sirius raises/rescues harry with help. Either Remus, Minerva, Hagrid, Regulus, or even Snape. Or any combination thereof. Hell, it could be Andromeda or Narcissa for all I care, as long as Sirius in not the only adult Magical involved. Also Stricly pre-hogwarts. If Hogwarts is covered, later, fine. But not the main focus.

Thanks in advance.


** These are pretty popular, so you've probably already read them. But I always err on the side of redundancy.

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

*** Thank you for the Dogfather. That was a fun read, at least until the Draco pov story/chapters.

I make a point to not read anything finished before 2007.

I guess people are tired of suggesting these by now. If only more authors in ao3 took the time to use the tags properly... but ow well, the world can't be 0erfect
