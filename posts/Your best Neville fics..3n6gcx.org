  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

***** Not so much, no. The flow of the narrative isn't even really broken up into scenes, and much of it has to do with Hermione wrestling with very personal problems in her head. It's a great tale with a different style and characterizations. Read it someday when you're not feeling finicky about sexual identities, because the three main characters are decidedly open to many options.
