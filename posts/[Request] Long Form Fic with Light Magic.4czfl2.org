there's the Patronus and healing spells but I haven't seen a fic with light magic as a focus. I'd like over 60k words if possible.


** Hm, you could try the Sacrifices Arc. A large portion of the series is focused on contrasting Light and Dark magic. linkffn(Saving Connor).

I'm interested to see other response though. I feel like a lot of fics focus more on dark magic because it's new and unexplored but also because it's somewhat easier to define - it requires strong negative emotions, corrupts your soul, involves rituals, etc. Light magic is a bit harder to define outside of just saying "the absence of whatever makes dark magic dark," especially since you also need to differentiate it from spells that are general and could be used both ways. I mean, it's obvious that the Cruciatus cannot be used for good, but like the old trope goes, if I levitate you above a cliff and then cancel the charm I'm not exactly being helpful.

*** Everyone wants to know about Light magic, and I'm just sitting here waiting for someone to mention legitimate White magic. Like, purification rituals and Turn Undead (and inferi aren't legitimate undead in my book, they're just fresh corpses animated by transfiguration. Proper necromancy would be animating the goddamn skeleton and binding ghosts).

I mean, is a bit of D&D influence asking for too much here?

Yes, yes, HP and the natural twenty, I know. I'll get around to reading it eventually; I highly doubt it has black or white magic in it though.

** It's kind of a focus in An Old and New World. There's light specific magic covered by the so called "Interdict of Merlin" just like dark magic. linkffn(6849022)

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC
