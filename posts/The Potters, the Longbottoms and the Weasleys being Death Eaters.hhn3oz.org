What if James and Lily, Frank and Alice & Arthur and Molly joined the Death Eaters? What would have changed? Would Snape end up spying for Dumbledore?


** That's so extreme AU you might as well rebuild the entire Wizarding Britain from ground up.

Unless Potters/Longbottoms/Weasleys are completely different from canon, Riddle/Voldemort will have a completely different motivation for them to join him.

There's one fic though that has all of them following him without realizing who he really is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/][I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853)

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.
