Title, I'm curious to see how fanfiction culture is accepted in relationships nowadays. Is your partner okay with it? Do they see you as a weirdo now? I know it's not a big deal when it comes to the bigger picture, but humor me.

Til now, I've gotten away with "I love Harry Potter!" And the "I'm just reading a book right now. It's pretty underground so you wouldn't know."


** My husband occasionally makes fun of me and tries to catch me reading something really weird, he isn't a HP fan anyway, but to be honest he doesn't care. That said, I wouldn't show him any of the smut I read üòÇüòÇ. All things considered, I doubt he would care anyway, and on the flip side he knows I absolutely do not give a shit if he is watching porn, so maybe we aren't the norm? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

*** It's the same with me - sometimes he'll catch a glimpse of fan art or will make fun of me. Usually half joking about what he imagines I'm reading. Sometimes he's accurate on what he thinks I read. He can look at whatever porn and I won't give him grief. He shows me sometimes what he watches as if that would phase me.

**** Haha yup, sometimes he will just start making up some ridiculous stuff about ‚Äòglistening centres' and ‚Äòpulsing members' and I just have to laugh. One of his school friends writes fanfic and the things he writes are just terrible (think 15 3/4 inch penis) and so my husband just assumes that's what all smut is and also that all fanfic is smut. Sometimes he will mention something and so then I will search until I find the most ridiculous thing possible (once it was naive hermione giving Dumbledore a blowjob to suck the poison out of his hand so he can live) such as getting turned on by dubledore's beard tickling bellies (see above re hermione Dumbledore) and we both get a laugh out of it.

***** That's so cute. One of my previous girlfriends caught me reading linkffn(Yellow Submarine) and actually didn't even know it was fanfiction- she was blown away by how good the writing quality and remarked "I never thought something this good could be written for free by someone interested in Harry Potter."

But on the flip side now that I'm in my 20s an ex told me I was creepy/ a pedophile for being a guy who enjoys "perverted interpretations of a kid's novel." Not all HPFF is smut, but I guess it's what stands out. Oh well. Shouldn't let them believe a wild gander on AO3 is representative of all that's out there.

Thanks for the feedback. It's a big spectrum of work out there so I guess you have to start them off slowly. What would be some works you would start off showing to them if they were curious? I'm interested. Thanks. Have a great day!

******* Oh goodness, I wouldn't even know what to rec my husband if I was to try and get him to read it- most of what I read ends up being slash!! The very first fic I read which I remember thinking I just had to share with somebody was Harry/Ginny linkffn(2479927) and to be honest I hardly even remember it now, it was probably four+ years ago that I read it, but I sought out one of my fellow Harry Potter loving friends (who I hadn't talked to in nearly 10 years!) and sent her the link. I think the best way to introduce somebody to the world of HPFF is to find something light, fluffy, complete and no more than 50k words though.

*/edit/* just for point of reference, I am nearly 29, married with two kids and obviously really enjoy it, I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of, so many of us grew up waiting for the next book to come out so we could read it, so to me there's nothing creepy about loving and wanting to still be in touch with such an integral piece of your life

I always have this awkwardness about talking to my family about fanfiction. My parents think it's a lot of innocent, heterosexual, action-y fun stories, because I've just never fully explained the sheer /potential/ of fandom, and my mom thinks shipping only goes as far as what couple you want to end up together in canon.

I'll occasionally share snippets of terribly written smut via Steam just to get him to crack up when he's taking something too seriously online.
