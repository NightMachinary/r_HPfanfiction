A wave of nostalgia hit me and I went back and re-read "Red Mage, Looking For Group" by Nemesis13, and now I want to read other fics that follow a similar vein. Any stories that feature muggle!Dudley actually being a good brother to Harry and has them working together to explore Harry's abilities at a young age.

Does anyone know of any good fics that has this? Thanks in advance!


** that one your talking about is sadly the only one i really know of that does this, though i would also like to know others like it

*** Oh I had forgotten about this one, read it shortly after it finished. Thanks for reminding me of it! Sadly I don't think I could read this one through a second time though.

** A Different Halloween, linkffn(6439871)

â€‹

Dudley is the Boy-Who-Lived, raised at Harry's house. Many shenanigans are had. He also has a lightsaber. Still a muggle though. The story is more about magical innovation, pranks, and Dumbles being senile. RobSt story, so it's H/Hr, DD/LL, and NL/SB? Also, Marauders 1.0 and 2.0 are in the castle at the same time (1.0 are teaching).

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
