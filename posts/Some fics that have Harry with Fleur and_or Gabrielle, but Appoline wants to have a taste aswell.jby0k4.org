Harry is with Fleur and/or Gabrielle and they might have an active sex live. Upon visiting the Family, Appoline checks out Harry and flirts with him. Later she seduces him and they have sex. Harry feels guilty, but as he apologizes to Fleur, she already was aware of it, because its "tradition"....or other Reasons.

THe Point is: Appoline teases and seduces Harry, has Sex with him, he feels guilty and confess to Fleur/Gabrielle, but she is aware and ok with it.
