Major spoilers if you haven't read the story. . . . What I recall is Harry is reborn when he dies, and starts life again the day he was born, his magical power grows with each life, each life adding to the total amount. Story starts with harry on his 13th life/do over. Several of his lives he actually pursued methods of killing himself hoping to end the cycle. I think it was a cross over fic but I'm not sure. And I do know that it's over 100K words. Would greatly appreciate any help.

Suppose I should edit this and say a kind person found and linked the story I was looking for. Although the stories others have linked look very interesting as well.


** Is it this one? linkffn(8149841) not a crossover though.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

**** Damn i was really getting the idea until i read the end of the description. Just not really something I can ever read personally. Hope OP likes the story! I really like the idea of a immortal or master of death harry who actively wants to end it though. Maybe there's similar stories out there.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)

This one isn't a crossover but it follows your description and is very AU. Good read. It has a sequel that I haven't read.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
