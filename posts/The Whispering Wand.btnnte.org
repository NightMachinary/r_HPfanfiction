Story outline: Someone (any of the characters) gets hold of a wand (It could be bought or found or anything) that whispers to them as they use it. It could whisper to them about anything - For example the elder wand might whisper about power and fame to the holders, causing them to become insane, or that another wand damages the wizard's self esteem.

​

I also hope you stay away from slashes and pairings, but if you do have them, make them good and natural, preferably not things such as Voldemort X Harry - those make me gag.

​

I think that if someone wrote a story like this it would be wonderful to read! So I hope someone would write a story like this! Thanks for reading!


** There's pretty much exactly that on linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power) with the Elder wand basically talking with Harry for the bigger plot. Its a Harry/OC though, so there's pairing, but to be honest it isn't much of a focus besides for the dichotomy of Ice/Fire Elementals going on.

** "Here, young one, try out this one." Mister Ollivander handed the child her 312nd wand. So delightful to have such a tricky customer.

"Thank you," the small girl smiled politely. Such manners, so rare nowadays it seemed. Such an unorthodox mind and yet so very thoughtful.

"Oh!" The child gasped and then turned around. Her father smiled at her and gave a little wave. Ah, yes, now there was an unorthodox man with an unorthodox mind--Olivander remembered fitting him for /his/ first wand so many years ago. The girl looked bewildered. Ah...perhaps they were getting somewhere.

"Mister Ollivander," the child said. "This is going to sound very strange, but I heard a voice when you handed this wand to me. But I didn't see anyone come in or hear your bells jingle. I only saw Daddy. Hi Daddy!"

"I think it means that you have been chosen by the Whispering Wand."

"Is that something like the Elder Wand? The Deathly Hallows?"

The what? Ah, that must be a variant of the old story from Beetle the Bard. Deathly Hallows, so macabre...

Ollivander gave a light chuckle. "No, no, no--the Wand of Destiny is a brutal wand. If even half the legends are half-true, then it remains as far unfit for you as any I can think of. The Whispering Wand is far gentler, for someone who wishes to unlock mysteries of magic, to learn and discover the unknown."

"Is that good?"

"Whether it is good or evil, I cannot say." Ollivander chose his words carefully. "But I do think it means something that might well be great. You are a wondrous child to be chosen by this wand. Discover all that you can."

The girl and her father paid twelve gold Galleons for her new wand and then set off hand-in-hand.

"Yes, Miss Lovegood," Ollivander said softly. "I think we will see great things from you."

  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the finest school in the world. No better place to study magic. But nobody ever told Hugo Weasley how easy it was to get lost at Hogwarts. How did that Muggle fairy tale go again? The one with the breadcrumbs? Post-canon, epilogue-compliant. Family-centric.

In this Harry's wand talks to him. It's apparently a thing in-universe, as both Dumbledore and Shaklebot are also capable of it.

** I forget the name, but there is a story like this on AO3 I think. It's completely smut, and then out of nowhere takes a hard turn into a mystery. It finishes up as an interesting tale.

I'll try and find it.
