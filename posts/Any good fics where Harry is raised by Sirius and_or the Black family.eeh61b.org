I need the Harry-raised-by-Sirius but he's also raised around pureblood culture, preferably longer fics


** I've just been reading this series. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]] There are five stories in the series so far, four complete, the fifth being actively updated, and just over 1,163k words so far. Sirius raises Harry from the age of eight.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7736764][The Black Resurgence]] has Sirius raising Harry with a lot of pureblood politics/culture, but it's abandoned. I don't know anything about the other fic that continues it.

Not Harry though he's in this iirc, but a fic where Hermione is raised by the Black family that's got pureblood culture is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6237706][The Brightest Black]].

#+begin_quote
  Minerva McGonagall steps in on the awful night the Potters are murdered and arranges to have Harry Potter raised by Sirius Black and his somewhat cousins, the Malfoys. Draco and Harry grow up as almost brothers and everything - well, almost everything - is different. Gryffindor!Draco. Dramione. AU.
