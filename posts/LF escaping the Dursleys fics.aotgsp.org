Im looking for fics where Harry moves out/flees/leaves the Dursleys, and unknowingly and acidentally ruins the Blood wards/dumbledores plans. Essentially a Harry who doesnt know about the bloodwards, and moves out before anyone can stop him. No slash for Harry please.


** I can't think of what it is right now, but I know there's a crack fic where Harry keeps running away and (evil?/greatergood!) Dumbledore has to keep obliviating him and sending him back... I think it gets to the point where Harry thinks he's a bird, but I'm really not sure.

*** I know exactly what you mean! The fic is called Escapologist Harry. Definitely one of my fave crack fics.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** There's one (completed) fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11341620/1/Harry-Potter-The-Boy-Who-Is-Missing][Harry Potter: The Boy Who Is Missing]] where a young Harry runs away from Privet Drive and shelters by an electrical transformer near a university. Since magic can cause issues with electricity, the other way round is also true and the three-phase field of the transformer not only negates every single tracking spell Dumbledore had on Harry, it also stops the Owls from finding Harry to deliver the letters until just before the start of the third year.

Needless to say, this causes... issues, especially when Harry decides that he doesn't really like life in the Wizarding World.
