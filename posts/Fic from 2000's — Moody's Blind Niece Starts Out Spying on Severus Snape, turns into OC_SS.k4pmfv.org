:END:
Hi, I'm having a hard time finding a fic I read back in the 2000's. It was definitely over 100k words, or somewhere close. Basic plot was Moody has a niece, who has been blind since a traumatic event as a child. A wizard (she doesn't know it was Snape at the time) took away her sight so she wouldn't see her parents tortured, only to be unable to put her sight right again. Fast forward to her as a 7th year. She has just transferred to Hogwarts after the 4th book.

Moody and the niece pretend to have a strained relationship, to better help her spy story. She uses a sight-seeing owl, using the owl's eyes to see through a charm. She has a huge interest in Potions. Gets Potion training through Snape, feelings develop. Snape knows she's a plant by her uncle to get close to him. Eventually gets her sight back.

Fic develops over time, after she leaves Hogwarts too, while staying on the down-low. Ends with the Battle of Hogwarts.

​

I'm very positive I read this fic before 2007, because I remember reading this on my palm pilot, lol. Please let me know if there's anything else I can add.
