  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

*** This fic is so dry to me. Its attempts at humor fall so flat that it's just hard to read. I appreciate fics that don't bash Ron, but this story doesn't make me give a shit for him at all. Or /any/ of the characters. They all feel incredibly dull.

** I remember looking and finding nothing. I plotted out a story (Summary and Outline, pretty sure I have it saved somewhere), but other ideas were more demanding to be written :)

**** Well it would need to be written :P

Honestly, I'm not a big writer (every time I start trying I recall how much I hated writing on my Thesis :P ), and a few other ideas have risen in the queue before this. Currently trying to put together a Ginnymorte fic, I posted elsewhere on an idea I had about a hermione-centric trying to recast the main conflict more as grey vs grey, both of which captured my interest more than this.

Honestly, when I storyboarded it out it didn't scream 'write me i need to be told' like some of the other ideas i've had, so it fell by the wayside. Maybe the muse will strike again and I'll come back to it. I donno.

** I know a fic where Ron is female and Harry is male. I recall they are pretty close in the fic, but I am not sure that they are shipped considering that the story takes place in their first year. The author is currently finishing up their third year. Would you like to read it still?

Edit: I meant to say second year. The author is finishing up their /second/ year. I don't know why I wrote third.

  February 29, 1980. Leap Day. At the Burrow, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, and (sigh) Great Auntie Muriel are waiting for the newest Weasley brother to be born. But something unexpected is about to happen. One-shot, prelude to the "Weasley Girl" trilogy.
