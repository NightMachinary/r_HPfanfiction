I've gotten an idea stuck in my head regarding what might have been going on in Wizarding Russia, in the "past" of HP, and concurrent with the books. The general concept is that the reason why the wizarding world /et al/ isn't cracking right down on the remergence of a horrific, ambitious dark lord in Britain is because of something even more worrying happening on the continent. Namely, the breakup of the muggle Soviet Union, and the slow loss of control by their Wizarding counterparts.

However, the format I keep coming back to is the style used on Alternate History forums, rather than traditional storytelling. So, what's written is framed as excerpts from various "in universe" written works - history books, memoirs, academic journals, etc., alongside some interludes of more normal, character-following writing.

For example, [[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/wrapped-in-flames-the-great-american-war-and-beyond.384833/][Wrapped in Flames]], about a possible North American war, is essentially built as a series of long quotes from fictional, in-universe works like:

- "*To Arms!: The Great American War, Sheldon Foote, University of Boston 1999.*"

- "*Snakes and Ladders: The Lincoln Administration and America's Darkest Hour, Hillary Saunders, Scattershot Publishing, 2003*"

- "*Soldiering In Canada, Recollections and Experiences of Brigadier General George T. Denison III, Toronto Press 1900*"

All slotted in a chronological manner, and interspersed with scenes of discussions, battles and such.

Would this be appealing, or at least readable, or should I knuckle down and try to break this into a more normal character-driven story?

--------------

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback! I'm now waiting on an invitation to Ao3 (FFN formatting looks like hell), and I'm plugging away on the first few chapters.

**** I was thinking more the historical Antifa as it was in the 30's/40's, a broad coalition of rowdy dudes with compassionate attitudes who didn't truck with tyranny and genocide. From Communards to Christian Democrats!

And really, what's the Order of the Phoenix but a fancy version of a KPD fighting squad, introducing yet another face to the pavement?

(Though yea, he definitely reads Liberal, unsurprising if you've run into JKR's political commentary)

** If you're gonna rip off (I mean this in the best way) World War Z, just do it in the same way Max Brooks did it. Stories told by those looking back on the events, with references to the different sub events and players interlinked among the stories being told, but colored by different biases and information. World War Z was gripping without being gimmicky and it was an awesome plot device that I haven't really seen well utilized by basically anyone.

*** To be dead honest, I'm not super confident in my characterization. I haven't written much fiction-wise before, so I'm wary of going full oral history. On the other hand, I've gotten pretty comfortable with academic writing as a humanities student, so I'm more confident in my ability to get what I want across that way.

I'll definitely try to incorporate your suggestions though - unreliable authors, and having 'running' characters are great ideas.

  How does a wizarding school with a German name and Slavic students and teachers end up at a secret location in the far north of Europe? Here is one possible explanation of the geographical oddity that is Durmstrang Institute.

  The little French town of Beauxbatons is known in the wizarding world for two things: fine wands and a superb Academy of magic. This is a story about both.
