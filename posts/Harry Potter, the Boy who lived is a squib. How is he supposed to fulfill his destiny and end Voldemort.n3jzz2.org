** "Severus? Are you sure about this?", asked Dedalus Diggle.

Snape monotonously repeats what he's been saying almost all day "This is based on Lily's research, and we've tested it with Filch and Figg. If it makes you any better, feel free to stay here while it goes off".

After activating the rune, Snape apparated away, upon arriving at the small home they've rented, he listens to the multiple soft pops of the other Order members. At least everyone has enough brain cells to leave Privet Drive.

An hour later, Voldemort appeared on the street and waited. Soon, the blood protection will fall, and he can finally kill Harry Potter. Sure, everyone always said Harry Potter can't even lift a feather with magic, but shooting yet another Killing Curse on a Squib is easy, and it might help him sleep at night.

What Voldermort never bothered to research is, the Wizarding world actually tried to "cure" their Squibs. One of the attempts was based on the assumption that it's possible to take one's magic and give it to a Squib. None of them succeed, of course, you just end up with two Squibs. And thus, in the early hour of 27 July 1997, Voldemort unknowingly walked to the largest recreation of forgotten wards that remove his magic forever.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

** Sheer dumb luck, some old military surplus, and a friend or two who's magical. Assuming he ends up in contact with Arthur Weasley in some fashion, I see it going a bit like [[https://youtu.be/g1hIT71Elu8][/The Saga of Tanya the Evil/]].
