So between Halloween and the First Task Harry, rather than stressing out until he learns about the task being dragons, learns as many utilitarian spells as he can. He ends up making a decent magical showing instead of twirling around like an idiot on a flying stick who just so happened to not be set on fire.

And the Tasks are different too, because that's usually fun.
