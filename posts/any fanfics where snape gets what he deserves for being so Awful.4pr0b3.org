I had a really nasty teacher in my hs which reminded me of snape, i hated them so much, i wanted to leave the school but sadly that wasn't possible, they nearly killed my love of learning

anyone know some fanfics where he gets what he deserves for being a petty, childish bully?

*** That's not really a consequence of his horrible teaching though. His abuse went pretty much unpunished and unchallenged just because Dumbledore needed an excuse to keep him close. As if the Headmaster of Hogwarrts, the Supreme Mugwump and Chief Warlock couldn't have created a position for his pet Death Eater that didn't involve ruining people's futures.

The linked post explains my position on why I don't consider Snape's conduct as a teacher to be an issue in HP. Personally, when I encounter any sort of Health&Safety wank in a fic (Snape is abusive, Dursleys deserve Child Protective Services knocking on their door, Dumbledore is a terrible headmaster for allowing stuff to happen, etc.), I click the red X. Maybe not all of it inherently bad, but in the overwhelming majority of cases it's the author thinking how they're so smart for doing it and why doesn't everyone do it, it's so horrible oh my gosh. It tells me they most likely don't have much insight into what makes HP what it is and that the fic is probably bad.

***** I'm okay with the "Health&Safety" stuff in fics, I just strongly dislike how the author tries to seem clever and arrogant about it.

Now that I think about it, it seems to me that Snape uses some form of the flipped classroom method.

*** But that's not how the animosity between Snape and James started. It wasn't because he was picking on a muggleborn but because he made a rude comment about Griffindor.

If anything it was James and Sirius who where picking on the muggleborn (Lily) though of course that was not their intention.

***** I agree that Snape was definitely a Dark wizard (Sectumsempra, for example), but there isn't any exact evidence in canon that he tortured/killed muggleborns. In the Pensieve chapter in GoF, Dumbledore is able to quickly brush off concerns that Snape is a real Death Eater. No one around him seems to point out any particular crimes Snape has done, besides being a Death Eater.

Given his upbringing, it's definitely plausible that Snape is prejudiced against muggles, but being the Half-Blood Prince, I find it hard to believe that he hates muggleborns.

****** I think when Snape said "what about my soul?" when Dumbledore was trying to talk him into killing him to save Draco's soul makes me feel that Snape's soul must be relatively intact.\\
Plus the seventh book implied that remorse could repair the soul. So even if he had killed before, if he was truly remorseful then his soul would have been repaired. If he wasn't, and his soul was still damaged, then why would he be concerned at all??

****** He joined and supported (I doubt Voldemort cared about Tourists) an organization that murders and tortures muggleborns. Blood purity is the first point on their political agenda. He can't have cared about them very much (also, you don't call your black best friend a nigger if you aren't at least a little bit racist).

Whether he ever did the deed personally seems insignificant considering he was basically supporting someone with ethics comparable to Mengele. Was Snape ever truly (ideologically) reformed? Or did he just change sides because he felt betrayed and wanted revenge? The enemy of my enemy...

******* It's never stated in the books why exactly he joined the Death Eaters other than his affinity with the Dark Arts. He could've joined for a multitude of reasons without believing in blood purity. In DH, when Phineas calls Hermione a Mudblood, Snape tells him not to do so.

  Well, he didn't mind killing a baby (indirectly, yes, but he might've as well done it himself) and I suppose that tells you a lot about Snape's moral compass.

I think Snape saw that as a moot point. There was no way of convincing Voldemort not to kill a baby, so he would try to do some damage control, like tell Dumbledore.

I do agree any memento of his parents would be precious to Harry. It always rang a little false to me that Harry doesn't do more to learn about his family as they are a central desire of his.
