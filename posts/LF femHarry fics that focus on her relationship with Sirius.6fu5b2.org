  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** "Son of Potter, Daughter of Black" is kinda. Except Harry wasn't born a girl. He becomes one later, called Melania. Still, I thought it was an excellent story.

**** Just from the summary, this one looks especially squicky. Nope, there's absolutely nothing creepy about an adult getting, ahem, involved with the daughter of his adolescent obsession. Nothing weird about that at all!

Don't understand people sometimes. Especially with how many Harry/Snape, or Hermione/Snape, or Harry/Tom fics there are out there. I do not understand why people are so obsessed about this kind of thing. It's weird.

****** ...I was being insulting?

If that was how it came off, my bad, I didn't mean to be. In fact, this fic is now in my to-read list. Me saying I don't understand why people are into those kinds of pairings, and me personally finding it weird, wasn't intended as any kind of aspersion. Just that I find it weird, and don't understand it

******* I guess for me it was the difference between saying "This is weird" and saying "I think this is weird".

Ultimately it doesn't really matter, but that's why I personally was annoyed by your response.

**** I agree, I really wish this fic did not have that pairing warning. I read it and have enjoyed it (and can confirm that there is currently no romance at all between them), but it really bothers me that people have this need to pair main characters with him. It's unnecessary and doesn't fit his character. I do really like the fic though, good characterizations, lots of interesting plot lines and good writing.

***** It's especially interesting because the author is actually ace and aro. I've noticed in fan fiction that relationships between characters often fall very strictly into a "romantic/sexual" bin or a "familial" bin and there's not really anything in between. It's too bad, I think, because there's a whole gray area in between where I think most relationships IRL exist, and it'd be interesting to see that explored more.

**** I mean, to each their own, but this is quite possibly the best fan fic I've ever read. It's incredibly written, with amazing characters and some extremely good plotting. The friendship between Harriet and Hermione is amazingly portrayed, and made me realize just how few actually good female friendships there are in media. Honestly, this fic has spoiled me in so many ways, it's ridiculous.

There's actually no romance yet, and the series is at over 600,000 words right now (when she says future, she means very distant future), but I understand why the intent behind the fic might put some people off.

***** I mean.... from the /summary/ it sounds like Snape is raising himself a girlfriend.

Which is all kinds of creepy, weird and rather disgusting to think about.

But if you vouch for it, I'll give it a try. I'll believe you and just assume that the summary is really just hitting all the wrong spots in its wording.

****** I'll add my vote for this fic. Fem!Harry in it is one of the best in the fandom in terms of staying close to canon harry's personality, but still being undeniably female. She undergoes a wonderfully complex development throughout the story.

The fic is in fifth year now and Snape doesn't have a single thought of THAT kind towards harry. definitely give it a try.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.
