I'm looking for harry being genetically modified or mutated, could be rituals or experimentation. He mustn't just have extra body parts but rather be mutated on a cellular level. E.g. increased stamina, higher muscle mass, faster and stronger than normal humans and so on. I'm NOT looking for a harry potter/x-men crossover. The best way to describe the mutations is to think of the witcher, though I've already read all of those fanfictions, there is a criminal lack of them. No fem!harry or slash please. Everything else is permitted. You have my thanks.


** You might like linkao3(5103614). Harry [vague spoilers] gets into human transfiguration and starts modifying himself (increased strength, speed, etc).

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

And my first thought was linkffn(12321442) which is a barely started X-men crossover. Oh well.

  Presented with an opportunity, Vernon jumps at the chance to get rid of the unwanted burden foisted upon his normal family. In the hands of those wanting to create a true weapon, Harry's entire life is altered, sending not just his destiny but those of several others down a different path. But when your fate is to be a weapon, can that ever truly change?

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
