**** I've just finished reading linkao3(In the world where things went right by TheTitaniumSerpent) It's exactly the feel-good story everyone needs right now. linkao3(Rewriting destiny by mayawrites95) linkao3(A Good Life by kkwide) This one is among my favorites because it explores the character of Regulus and he's amazing. There're many more time-travel fix-it fics I can recommend but those three are the first that came to mind.

  Hermione Jean Granger was born September 19th, 1959, and her family moves to Cokeworth, close to Lily Evans and Severus Snape. In the world where things are better, wonderful things can happen.A series of relatively short chapters. And contains more fluff than sixteen litters of baby bunnies. You have been warned.

  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around. Time Travel AU. Nominated for Best James Potter and Best Peter Pettigrew in the 2018 Marauder Medals!

  An accident sends Hermione to a time where the war is approaching and where she has a chance to change more than one fate. The story begins at Easter, after the snatchers have caught our golden trio (Deathly Hallows CH 23: Malfoy Manor), and it is an Alternate universe from there.

*** Oh boy, finally an opportunity to showcase how trashy I am!

Angry Harry and The Seven - Harry gets so angry at the Old Goat and the Flaming Chickens literally on his first day at Hogwarts that he has an Horcrux-induced aneurysm that kills a teacher and traumatizes several children. Absolute fucking gold.

Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord - Dumbledore gets mauled by a nundu (or tiger? I'm not sure, man. It's been a while). Harry then proceeds to get married to said nundu/tiger.

He's Not Dead Yet - This is actually half-crack, unlike the other two. But also like, surprisingly good.

Faery Heroes - Fucking AWESOME fic where Harry, Luna and Hermione are Robin Hood-themed time travelling thieves who are working under the blessing of the Fae Queen or something.

Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path - I mean, the Harry/Tonks subplot was a bit creepy, but it's a good enough story.

Harry Potter and the Daft Morons - Harry is that one kid that you keep around because he brings all the Tea and the Drama, but sometimes goes too far, everyone gets fucking uncomfortable and starts shooting you angry looks for inviting him in the first place. Only read if you feel like satisfying the very angry twelve year old in you, or if you want quality comedy.

And if you are the type of person who likes to read a lot of smut and also doing your taxes, read The Harem War.

I remember reading a lot more, but it's been like a year and I have the memory of a goldfish, so this is all I got.

** [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/1__Beauxbatons/][Hope by Jeconais]]

Harry is a stupidly overpowered 22-year-old, the love interest is a sixteen-year-old Gabrielle Delacour who formed a Veela Bond (tm) at age eight with Harry when he saved her in the Triwizard Tournament, and she therefore has to sleep with him before her seventeenth birthday or she'll go insane. It's problematic. It's not especially well-written. It's dumb. It's so, so dumb. But I still find myself going back and reading it every so often.
