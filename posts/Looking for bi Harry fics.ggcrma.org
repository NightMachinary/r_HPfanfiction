I'm looking for fics where Harry is bi set forward in time to the 21St century and he is appalled at the fact that wizards aren't as accepting as muggles.


** You know, it's usually reckoned to be the other way around --- wizards being much more accepting of these things than Muggles. What makes you want to have the opposite situation explored?

*** I assume like a lot of mugglewank that it's a 'Humanity, fuck Yeah thing!' where people want to feel superior to fictional race of beings.

*** They are usually accepting so that the author can write more of slash/femslash smut. I can happily imagine that (as for example in linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao)) very traditionalist breeding-oriented society could be very strongly against homosexuality.

**** Yet most people are not blood-purists. Blood-purism is a literally medieval ideology, whose fires were stoked back up by Voldemort in the lead-up to the First Wizarding War, but, for the very reason that it was endorsed by the ultimate bogeyman in the form of Voldemort, it ended up even more reviled than it was before. To put it in a modern Mugle perspective, the Death Eaters aren't classists, they're neo-Nazis. Per the same analogy, we should no more expect the society at large to be homophobic due to being breeding-obsessed, than expect there to be a strong anti-semitic sentiment in the man of the street in modern London.

Besides, most “mpreg” fics may be appalling messes, but it is absolutely in keeping with what /Harry Potter/ magic can do to imagine that there exist potions to allow at the very /least/ a same-sex female couple to have “natural” children, and it is not outside the realm of possibility for avenues for two wizards to have genetic children to exist as well.

Unrelatedly, and again even if one accepts the "breeding-obsessed" premise, it's worth looking back at the attitude of e.g. the nobility of the Ancient world. They frowned upon ‘strict' homosexuality, but male bisexuality --- allowing a man to take male lovers even as he fathered children by a legal wife --- was often well-accepted. One imagines the same system could exist even in a blood-purist Wizarding Britain, whereby wizards and witches are expected to produce offspring through official heterosexual marriages, but are free to sleep around with whoever they like on the side, with all the proper contraceptive charms in place.

**** It's a common feeling, but there's little evidence of that in canon. The sort of cod-Victorian /fashion/ used in the movies (which doesn't even really matched wizard fashion as described in the books) is pretty thin evidence. If anything the Wizarding World operates more like an atheistic version of the Renaissance.
