Except for those 'only wizard in a world of witch's' type stories.


** Yes. There's a site named hentai foundry which basically has a fic named 'my godmother' or something along that line. I'm fairly certain you can guess what that's about.

** There's an unfinished fic called "Harry Potter and the Distaff Side" where Harry is sent to a dimension where every male is now female, and vice versa. It's got some interesting social changes as well. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Distaff Side)

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** The first thing that comes to mind is this oneshot: linkao3(12006717). I remember looking around for other stories afterwards and not finding anything nice. Been a while though, so maybe there's some newer fics.

** I read a oneshot a while back where she killed by Snape and James which sorta counts lol. (Bellatrix killed Lilly and since Bellatrix was too hard a target they went after the next best thing.)

** I think this is usually done by using Bella or Neville's Mother.

The Marauders was pretty much described as a boys club, so usually it gets swapped over to 'Lily's best Friend'. I suppose 'Everyone Gender swapped' also works, but besides Distaff side, there hasn't been much worth mentioning in that category.
