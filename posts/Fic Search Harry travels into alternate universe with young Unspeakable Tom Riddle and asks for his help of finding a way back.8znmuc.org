What I can remember:

- Harry may or may not be an old man

- Tom Riddle is an Unspeakable.

- Harry first approaches Tom by showing him magic and enchantments he weaved into every day objects magic learned from tribes all over the world and throughoit many years from n8w-dead tribes.

- Harry is suffering from some kind lf magical backlash, constantly in pain. He tries many different ways to combat it and is now using some sort of amulet.

- Harry and Tom strike up a friendship of sorts.

- Harry eventually reveals that he possesses all Deathly Hallows to Tom.

- This may or may not be a crossover fic with the Avengers.

  Harry became the Master of Death but it's not perfect. There's no eternal youth and invulnerability, for a start, and the time travel is cool but pointless, because change is impossible in his universe. But there's another universe - it has superheros and mutants and perhaps enough flexibility to change. This story meshes HP with the entire MCU. Will deviate from canon. Not OOC.

*** Thanks! No wonder I can't find it anymore. AO3 is my main fanfiction source and it seems to have been deleted from AO3.
