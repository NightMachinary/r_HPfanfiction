Warning: Philosophical and scientific contents, in the non-defined world of magic. If you don't care about such things, there is not much here for you.

Also it should be noted, that most likely there will be neither right, nor wrong answers in this thread.

We can find various magical systems/theories about how magic works in the various fics posted here. One such topic is why certain transfigurations easier then others. Let us assume that the popular trope "size equality between the transfigured and target object makes a transfiguration easier". (Obviously, there are other factors, but lets remove them from the equation now)

During our tests we want to transfigure an elephant into a button: A notable difference in size. Also we have preconceptions: the elephant is large, the button is small.

Test #1: Normal elephant to button transfiguration. (Base test)

Test #2: The test subject (transfigurer) now first reduces the size of the elephant into the size of a button. Then a transfiguration will make that small elephant into a button.\\
Question: If we look only at the transfiguration part of this test, is it easier to transfigure the small elephant into the button?\\
My answer: We have preconceptions about elephants, but the moment we shrink said animal, we no longer think about it as an elephant - it is a small elephant, with different preconceptions, and thus the transfiguration used in test #1 and #2 are different, the second one being easier according to the assumption.

Test #3: There is a normal sized elephant in the distant, but due to physics and magic, the test subject can observe this elephant as a small elephant. The test subject now transfigures the elephant into a button.\\
Questions: Was this transfiguration similar to test #1 or #2? In other words, in your opinion would magic take into account what a human observe about the world, or would it act on the real attributes of the object?\\
In Test #3b the test subject is told (falsely), that a shrinking charm has been placed on the elephant beforehand, so his visual observations are now backed with additional information - would this make any difference? On the other hand if subject is told, that the elephant is of normal size, and thus receives contradicting information about the size of the elephant - would the transfiguration be like #1 or #2, something new, or would it simply fail?\\
My answer: If I assume that real attributes drives magic, then the magic should fail in test #3 - the test subject tries transfiguration #2, but it just wouldn't work. This results in the same scenario as #3b - contradicting information. If the subject can realize that he is facing a normal sized elephant in both cases #1 should work.\\
However if we assume that magic comes from our mind, and how we see the world, using #2 to solve #3 is a solid solution. #3b - contradictions however will result in a failure using either #1 or #2 and this is where things get more complicated.\\
If the test subject uses now the other transfiguration (#2 and #1 respectively) it could either fail or succeed depending how the test subject see the scenario: "My previous magic failed, so the elephant MUST be the other size" or "My previous magic failed only because I don't know what size the elephant is" - in the latter a third transfiguration is needed, which transfigures a "could be big or small elephant" into a button. This phenomenon falls in line with the idea that our observations, our ideas about the world changes how magic works, but it also raises questions like "Is centralized learning a good thing in the wizarding world?" However that question would take us to far from the original topic.

So what are your opinions, do you think that magic revolves around the physical state of object, or our believes?

Bonus question: What happens if somehow we change the preconceptions of an individual (special upbringing, confundus charm etc.) - now that someone thinks an elephant is the same size as the button, would the normal transfiguration work, or maybe the button will be elephant sized?
