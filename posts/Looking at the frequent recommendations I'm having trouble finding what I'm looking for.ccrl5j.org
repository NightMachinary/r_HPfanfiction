I hoped that there would be a lot of fanfic that continues or expands on the original story. Yet it seems that most of it are alternate timelines or humorous stories.

Is there any fanfic that basically stays true to the original, in tone and content?


** Seek ye the works of Northumbrian, notably linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian).

*** I like Northumbrian generally, but as for preserving the spirit of books, I prefer linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian) or even linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) and linkao3(Grave Days by Northumbrian).

Strangers are good, I liked them (and James and Me is hopefully going to be even better, if Neil ever gets to finishing it; I am not holding my breath!), but on the second read, I can see how they badly need cutting down (first five or so chapters is just drinking tea and not much is going on), and some pruning (e.g., the chapter about the funeral should be IMHO a separate one-shot, it just breaks the flow of the story here for no particular gain).

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.

** In addition to Northumbrian, the collected works of little0bird, starting with linkffn(4367121) The First Day. There are tens of thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands) of words worth of stories starting immediately post-battle. I think the epilogue is ignored, as is Cursed Child. This is some of my favorite comfort reading - I can start at the beginning and read for days before getting to the present chapter of the last epic story. The author seems to have taken a diversion to Game of Thrones fanfic at the moment, but I'm hoping the story will eventually be continued/concluded.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] linkao3(6701647) is set several decades after the epilogue, and is similar to the series in terms of characters (it's trio-centric), plot (it focuses on a new blood purity movement), and themes (family and death both feature prominently). Plus it's well-written and complete.
