:END:
So what I can remember is that Harry was dragged to a different dimension by The Order and was very bitter about it. In the 'new' dimension, I think James and Lily are alive a and Harry is a girl, possibly with red hair? A specific scene I remember is Harry waking up in the hospital wing and he's given a mirror at some point and he doesn't quite look like himself because Madam Pomfrey (I think) didn't have any reference when she was trying to put him back together I'm pretty sure Harry is convinced by Dumbledore to become a professor at Hogwarts but I can't remember what for I think Dumbledore wanted Harry to mentor the new dimension's female Harry as she's still in school Thanks in advance!

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** It's an unfinished fic that I'd really hope gets finished eventually.
