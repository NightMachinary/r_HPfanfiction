Not that I have anything against Hermione, I just never really enjoy reading her character outside of Rowling's writing. The characterization always seems to just come a across as unbalanced.

Not necessarily looking for Hermione bashing either.

Open to pairings. No slash or fem though.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  With all the crappy stuff Harry goes through at Hogwarts, the smart money would be on him transferring to a different, better school early in his career. Here's one way it might have happened. No planned pairings.

** If your only requirement is that Hermione is not the main character, why not just refine your searches to either not include Hermione (e.g. -Hermione on AO3), or choose a random character and search the best stories with that character.

**** Also stories on AO3 have a tendency to have every single pairing or friendship or relationship that is mentioned in passing included in the tags which makes searching for things an absolute mess.
