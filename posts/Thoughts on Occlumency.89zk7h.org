Something I see in a lot of fics is Occlumency used as a way to make Harry OP.

A lot of people treat Occlumency as a way to create an eidetic memory, perfect recall, extreme focus and increased intelligence.

I may have missed something in the books, but all I can remember is that Dumbledore theorized it was a way to block out Voldemort's mental attacks, not a catch-all way to become Merlin.

On top of that, Occlumency Masters have spent years, if not decades, honing their skill in Occlumency (ie Dumbledore and Snape), but in the fics Harry usually spends a month of summer learning this super obscure art that hardly anyone knows about and he immediately becomes a master at it.


** I have many thoughts on Occlumency. Due to my studies, you will never be able to force them from me.

/s

Snape described the skill as obscure but very useful. Writers intending on taking Harry on a power trip are motivated to take this special-ness away from Snape, so that their super!Harry can not be tormented by him. In addition, those who are known to have some skill in it are mostly impressive with magic: Snape, Dumbledore, Bellatrix. Sirius and Remus have respect for Snape's skill with it, so they know about it and don't have any skill with it, or at least enough to boldly take over for Snape in order to teach it to Harry.

It has been proven useful in dueling, in that a lack of Occlumency left Harry easily outmaneuvered by Snape at the end of the 6th book. So knowing occlumency is at least a duellists skill, insofar as other duellists may train in Legilimency to the level of using it mid-combat.

From my interpretation, I think there are levels of skill in Occlumency, the first one being able to sense someone intruding and the second being able to block casual access. This is the level Draco reached after training with Bellatrix over a summer break (~ 2 months). JKR mentioned in interviews that Draco's personality was more inclined to learning it compared to Harry. I would also add that Harry had an enemy mind stuck inside his head like an unexploded bomb, so it might have made it harder for Harry to reach that second level.

  You can also infer from Snape successfully being a spy, and likely being subjected to many sessions of Legilimency from Voldemort, that there is a "third level" of Occlumency. Something like selectively blocking information without letting the attacker know that any information is being blocked, or maybe something else similar.

***** Well I think the latter is dumb because it's trying to overhype his Occlumency by comparing it to a physical object. And besides, Occlumency isn't just clearing the mind, it's outright stated to involve defending against external mental attacks so calling it a mental shield still seems somewhat apt.

My only gripe with the "shield" analogy is that Snape clearly shows that Occlumency also involves misdirection too, letting a Legilimens see what the Occlumens lets them see in their mind.

** Part 2 - headcanon

You can take this as simply one writer's interpretation.

Occlumency can be developed further than simple defense. It is a way to use magic to disassociate from emotions. This can aid a wizard by controlling fear, minimizing pain, and breaking through enchantments meant to twist perception.

Training in Occlumency is like any skill- it doesn't work automatically, but you may get good enough at it to invoke it by reflex. There are also pitfalls in gaining mastery of it. For one, Occlumens tend to be emotionally detached, having difficulty in establishing emotional bonds. They also (again, this is my headcanon) have difficulty in becoming animagi, as the discipline runs contrary to the process of embracing your totemic self.

On that last one, I noticed at some point that no one in canon is both an animagus and an occlumens. Hopefully JKR won't Joss that on us by making Grindelwald an animagus.

** My thoughts on Occlumency are as follows:

- Contrary to most fanon, there's little evidence that Snape taught it incorrectly.

- Expanding on the above, there seems to be little to /learn/ about Occlumency in terms of methodology or theory. Rather it is a *skill* which is extremely simple in concept but difficult in execution, where the only way to improve is to practice (or otherwise mature emotionally, as Harry did in DH).

- Occlumency is essentially the skill of controlling your own mind. Not in some special mindscapey way, just in the regular sense of being able to choose how you feel and what to think. Snape was clear in OotP: to succeed at Occlumency, Harry had to /choose/ to not feel angry at Snape's provocations. He had to choose not to want to see Voldemort's visions. Harry chose otherwise and in doing so demonstrated a lack of control over his own mind. There's no real ability to teach this, especially to a student who does not want to learn as Harry did not in OotP.

- Nonetheless, I do believe Occlumency to be a magical skill. Consider that there is nothing inherently magical about waving a wand and saying some words, but only wizards can produce spells with wands and incantations. All magic involves procedural steps which are not inherently magical, but which become magical by virtue of the fact that they are being done by a wizard.

*** Your points make a lot of sense. Occlumency as a skill is more practice than theory and while Snape was most certainly enjoying himself during their sessions, it would make sense that he was at least trying a valid method of teaching Harry Occlumency, especially if he was trying to help the war effort.

It just annoys me so much when people write it in their fics like they just walked into Flourish and Blott's and found a book on Occlumency or some such.

Like, this super rare art and you just happened to find a book in /the/ bookstore in Diagon Alley? Yeah, right...

**** I've always believed that Snape was doing an absolutely atrocious job teaching Harry occlumency, and that he really was prioritizing making Harry suffer vs actually teaching him anything. Not because he was needing to 'convince voldemort' but because he just genuinely gave zero fucks about Harry's mental health or wellbeing. The only way he ever cared about Harry was because of the life debt, which only involved keeping him alive against direct threats.

Because unless you believe that occlumency is somehow different than every other skill on Earth and that there is only a single very specific way to learn it (Snape's way), then if Snape had had an ounce of care for Harry he would have tried a different way. And as for prioritizing making Harry suffer over the real objective -- well, the way he was trying to teach Harry wasn't working, and wasn't being effective towards the real objective, so if the objective was more important, logically Snape should have switched to a more effective teaching style.

Instead, he continues using a teaching style that is obviously not working, rather than switch to a more effective one, his /only/ motivation for which was to see Harry suffer. If he had, indeed, been trying his best to teach Harry, he would have immediately stopped as soon as he noticed what he was doing wasn't working. Snape isn't stupid or unobservant enough to not realized how ineffective he was being.

And I think part of Harry's issue is that it was Snape teaching it, and correponsingly, for Snape that it was Harry needing to learn it. Overall it was a terrible idea for Snape to teach it, heh.

** I treat it as something that is incredibly rare, but only because Legilimency is too, and Legilimency is not as powerful in general as Voldemort's use of it suggests. Or, in other words, learning Occlumency is like building a meter thick concrete wall around your house on the off chance that a nuke is dropped on top of it. I'm guessing that the idea of Harry's Occlumency training was an equivalent of a siren-drill. He was trained in the absolute basics of Occlumency, which boils down to the recognition of it.

My next assumption is that the memory, the perfect recall, the focus and the intelligence are more prerequisites to become a Master Occlumens, rather than the result of learning the Art.

But my explanation as to why it isn't as important anyway (unless you have a real target on your mind), is that every human is born with a natural occlumens barrier, simply because of the unique set of cognitive connections and context each of us spins. To dechiper it takes a spell, and ridiculous levels of skill.

** My headcanon pretty much matches the consensus, but I take a pretty dark view of what's involved in the training and in the practice of it.

The way I see it, active Legilimency works by letting the Legilimens inject qualia (thoughts, feelings, mental images, etc.) into the target's mind and read the reaction. (This is why Snape resents the analogy of reading a mind like a book: even figuring out how to probe, to say nothing of how to interpret the response, is difficult.)

Occlumency, then, is the skill of disassociating from and ignoring the injected qualia (i.e., closing one's mind) so that the Legilimens gets nothing, and more advanced Occlumency involves forging responses, perhaps through a form of controlled schizophrenia.

A hostile Legilimens will be looking to find qualia that the Occlumens can't dissociate from or ignore. Once the Legilimens finds one that elicits an uncontrolled response (as far as the Legilimens can tell), they can push on that, keeping the Occlumens off-balance and sending qualia that get the wanted information and other results. The difficulty of learning Occlumency then stems from the fact that the qualia that can be injected are limited only by imagination, the experience, and the personal squeamishness of the Legilimens.

Now, that means that an Occlumency instructor must necessarily expose the student to disgusting and disturbing qualia, to keep them from being surprised later. In other words, if Occlumency training doesn't hurt, you're doing it wrong; and learning Occlumency is traumatic and can cause personality changes, often for the worse.

It's telling that none of the Occlumenses we know in canon are exemplars of mental health.

Oh, and my other Occlumency-related headcanon is that the Memory Charm has two targeting modes: recent memories (e.g., last 10 minutes), which does not require Legilimency; and specific memories, which one needs to bring up using Legilimency, which makes it very difficult to Obliviate a skilled Occlumens without them noticing.

** Occlumency is described as obscure yet useful. I /could/ accept that it at least improves memory storage and recall, but jumping it to an eidetic memory is stupid. It's the magical /defense/ of the mind to external penetration.

In my story, Legilimency is a little more common amongst certain wizards since their job is to embed themselves in various places and levels in Muggle society to keep the SoS intact. So for me, the boons for Occlumency would be slightly better, but even then next to no one should be mentioned in the same breath as Dumbledore, Riddle and Snape.

The most reasonable benefits of Occlumency (after significant training) that don't deviate much from canon (imo) would be:

-Better memory storage and recall (not a perfect one)

-Improved emotional control (Snape really hammered this benefit home to Harry)

-Negate dementor happiness drain to a limited extent. Multiple dementors will quickly overtax the Occlumens's ability to keep them out

-More difficult to Confund and Obliviate, better Imperius resistance too, perhaps.

** I don't like it when Occlumency is portrayed as mental shields. It seems too obvious and boring. Snape used it to lie to Voldemort and hide his true intentions. Because of this, I like when occlumency is a mix of hide and seek and acting. I also like it when a person's ability to use Occlumency isn't static. I would think a mental discipline like this could easily be affected based on the practitioners emotional state and familiarity with the legilimency as well as their own memories. For example, I would think Snape would have a much harder time using Occlumency against Harry, since a harry makes him extremely angry but at the same time he wants to protect harry. Contrast this with Voldemort, whom Snape hates and wants to kill. This allows him to channel a "colder" rage that makes it easier to manage his emotions and their connection to his memories.

** If it gave perfect recall it would be the first thing they taught at Hogwarts. They would teach nothing but that for the first year so the next six would be far easier. It cannot therefore give perfect recall because if it did then it would be too useful to not teach. A bit like people with their Ancient runes wank, astronomy is compulsory and runes isn't, therefore astronomy is more useful to more people.

In my opinion its about how you focus. Making your mind more aware of the magic around you. It can therefore be applied to stuff like Dumbledore in the cave finding the magic Voldemort left. It would make it useful like Snape described it but it wouldn't make it so indispensable that its odd they wouldn't just teach it.

*** I'm not a big fan of extending Occlumency's abilities that much. I think using it to conceal your emotions and their connections to memory and thought is more than enough.

Dumbledore's sense of magical understanding is something I attribute to his years of experience and deep understanding of magic. I like making it more of an art that is not easily understood or explained. It's just something that you start developing as you use magic and depends largely on how you think about magic on attribute deeper level.

I think people like Voldemort and Dumbledore would both be relatively adept at it, but would have wildly different approaches and different areas of deeper understanding. This is why Dumbledore had a much easier time figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of Lily's sacrifice. It aligns better with Dumbledore's philosophy, while contradicting Voldemort's.

It also explains why Dumbledore was able to figure out the protections on Voldemort's cave. He spent years studying Tom Riddle. He taught Tom Riddle, fought Voldemort, learned of Tom's past, and used this better understand how Voldemort thinks.

I think if Dumbledore had never met Voldemort before Voldemort started his war and Dumbledore knew nothing about Voldemort's past, then he would have been far less sure about the magical protections in the cave.

Of course, Dumbledore would still have an understanding of the dark arts as well some idea of Voldemort's philosphy, but he wouldn't know Voldemort intimately.

I don't like to make it some explicit magic sense. Of course, that's just personal preference. A magical works well in other fictional works, but I don't think it fits as well in Harry Potter.

Also, all of this is just how I think on these topics. Some if it may contradict canon, but I don't really care.

Occlumency improves memory and lets you control how you perceive time but also has drawbacks you can sever you ability to feel emotions and turn yourself into a sociopath. Legilimency in addition to letting you 'see the thoughts and memories' of others can let you have silent communications with others and helps you make logical deductions (aka being a deductive genius like Sherlock Holmes).

***** I think that's a pitfall that canon handled poorly as well, though.

Like, Voldemort is hyped as this all-powerful baddie, then Harry is the one that has to defeat him. But Harry is at best an average student, with no specific area where he excells. It could be argued he's above average at DADA, but it is never shown that he's anything special.

But of course the hero has to be victorious, so Voldemort is more or less portrayed as slightly more powerful than the rest of wizarding Britain. And this continues in fics.

Except instead of finding a believable way to make a confrontation between Harry and Voldemort, they make Harry OP and Voldemort the same as canon, and use Harry's summers as enough time for him to become on the same level as Dumbledore/Voldemort.

However, if they make it so Harry is OP and Voldemort is also super strong, then Harry has no competition against anyone besides Voldemort. So then he breezes through any remaining opposition.

It's like a vicious cycle of bad plot.
