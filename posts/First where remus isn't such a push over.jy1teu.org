Preferably one where he doesn't just go "oh hey sirius you just outed my secret to the boy who would've told the whole world if he could and almost made me murder said boy which would've gotten me sent to Azkaban. Oh but no worries man we cool."

But I get that might be a little too OOC for some soooo

Lol but seriously now just fics of remus standing up to people more and being less passive about everything would be interesting


** Must recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][the secret language of plants]] for a Remus with quiet strength

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.
