:END:
Hi, I am looking for a fanfic in which Ron is cheating on Hermione with some fangirl and Hermione catches them. She leaves him and goes to her parent's house and Harry meets her there. Then they fall in love and marry. There is twist in the story as Harry had imperioed Ron into cheating with Hermione. I don't exactly remember the name or the author of fanfic.


** So Harry is the villain?

*** Both Harry and Hermione are happily married. But yes this Harry thinks he is hero and deserves heroine. I also think Harry is villainous in this story.

  Redo of my popular story. The Order of the Phoenix is sent a certain series which depict our heroes exploits. Reads like mysecretthought's 'Under a Watchful Eye' in which the characters respond to the books as they read without the actual book quotes being stated. Helps to have a copy or just be extremely familiar with the stories.
