Luna Lovegood and the Potential Prologue, detailing Luna Lovegood's first year (but the year has been plus-oned)\\
linkao3(27429985)

and my sequel, Between Foreign Skies!\\
linkao3(27487108)

In a nutshell, after conversing with the first one's author in the official Cyan Discord (Cyan being the ones that created Myst/Riven), he made that. It broke me out of my eternal writer's block and I wrote Between Foreign Skies in response to it.

I've actually corrected some of the misspellings in calumTraveler's fanfic, and for me, I need a proofreader. Grammarly's complaining that I have too many things only their "Premium" package can fix.

Also, I might, in chance, rewrite it if Between Foreign Skies needs it. Or else, I might as well write a new sequel called "Under the Gauntlet" or something.
