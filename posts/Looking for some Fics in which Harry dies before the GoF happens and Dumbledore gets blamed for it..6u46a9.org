*** An abusive childhood, a troll, a three headed dog, his stay in the Stone room, an abusive childhood, I rigged bludger, a basilisk, an abusive childhood, a dementor on the train, his near failure to defend Sirius, an abusive childhood, the first task, the second task the third task. I don't care, you choose. So long as Harry dies before GoF happens and his reputation is destroyed, and Dumbledore takes the fall for it.
