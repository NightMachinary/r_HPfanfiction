Hi all, new to this community! I read this series of stories a few years ago but cannot seem to find them anymore.. It was set immediately after the events of Half Blood Prince and starts with Harry being invited to be a professor of DA at Hogwarts, Voldemort is continuing to get into Harry's head and he must find a way of defeating him and they realise the way of doing this is through an old magic linked with love.

Any ideas? :(


** I believe you're thinking of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery) by Semprini, though it is AU after OotP. It has two sequels that finish the story off.

  Post-OotP Reluctantly taking a leadership role in the fight against Voldemort, urging others to 'say the name', Harry tries to learn how he can use his 'power the Dark Lord knows not' to fulfill the prophecy as he becomes his enemy's biggest target.
