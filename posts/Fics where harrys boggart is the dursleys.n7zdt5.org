It's a WBWL story that is so much more than just that. The boggart stuff happens in book three and this story starts at book 1. If you're looking for one amazing fic, check it out

Edit: I think my memory is faulty, the boggart happens at book 2

Edit 2: ffnbot doesn't like my link so I added the full series link above

Um, dark. Vernon raped Harry, Harry boggart is Vernon. No graffic rape, it's a told thing, not shown. Harry/Bill pairing

It's a good fic but not for everyone
