*** Not on FFN. It's a well-written description from Watson's perspective of what would happen if Sherlock Holmes got involved in Book 7. I read it for the prose and different perspectives it demonstrates on ideas familiar to canon.

*** When the Muggle police tried to investigate the murder of Amelia Bones, Sherlock Holmes got wind of it and came to see. This sets him on the trail of her teleporting murderer, and he spends most of the next year pieces together any little clues to the Wizarding World that he can. He finally hits the jackpot the next summer when he stumbles across a pair of teenagers in a cafe who happen to have an invisible companion. With the help of Hermione Granger, he manages to convince to Harry Potter to at least try consulting with him.....

It's told in John Watson's POV - Doyle-style. Modern Sherlock (character consistent) AU. Harry Potter is canon up to the night at the cafe. Canon pairings, plot focused.

Enough summary? Or should I continue?

(This actually links to my personal website.)
