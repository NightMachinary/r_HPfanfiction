I don't know if the books about Harry being a magical prince going off on adventures and having superpowers like beating a Dragon at age 6 are fanon or an offhand mention in canon, but I want to see a book where every single one is true. Harry tames a Nundu as a child, Harry saves, and marries a fairy princess, all sorts of crazy over the top, so when he comes to Hogwarts, the adventures are like "Meh, not worth another book"


** Imagine a crackfic where Harry really did all that except that Lockhart wiped his memories to take credit for it. Some of the stories were too wide spread to steal, but the majority of things that Lockhart did was really the work of Harry.

*** Yeah, this has to be written as a crack fic with a bit of mystery: I can see Harry defeating the Troll through muscle memory / intuition alone and barely giving the situation a glance. Everyone is super impressed and even Harry has no idea how he did all that.

Ron (Wizardry legends) and Hermione (hitting the books) then come up with all kinds of theories how Harry did that: Large Magical core (show me yours and I'll show you mine), reborn Merlin, Heir of Godric Griffindor, wandless magic, spirit possession (opportunity to write a funny exorcism attempt), time traveler, etc... Who would ever think of obliviation in a situation like this? Certainly not Quirrelmort, who has his own theories and might change his plans.

** I'd just like to say thank you for correctly using "set foot" instead of the horrible "step foot" that I've been seeing everywhere the past few years.

*** I was going to ask if 'stepped foot' was also wrong but Google said it was
