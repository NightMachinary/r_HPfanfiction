Here's a quick peak of what I have so far for Chapter 1. Still need to edit it if I ever post it up on FF.net So I give you what I call "The Rebirth"

--------------

He had lost it all. He had won the war, turned back the tide of darkness, murdered his archenemy, and saved Britain.

The price was high, much too high for Harry. He lost his friends, his allies, his love. Even now, years after the last battle he feels no solace in his victory. Long after the dust had settled and the bodies were gone. Ages after the blood that flowed like the Thames had dried. He still felt the pain of their loss like it had happened not moments ago.

Here he was at forty years of age in a large manor home. Empty. Well empty of any other humans. He did have his reliable house elf live with him and that was it. No lover, no friends, not even a pet. The home was anything but a home. He thought it his prison, his punishment for allowing his family to die at the hands of Voldemort.

He was the most powerful wizard on the Eurasian continent. Few could match him in raw power. Felix Torres from Mexico, Mohammed Ibrahim of Saudi Arabia, and maybe that hit wizard from Korea, Mr. Kwan or something of that nature. They could match him in power but they were all much older as well. Into their 70s and 80s it was said.

So what was he going to do? He who had all the time in the world but nothing to do? With all this untapped power coursing through his vains he knew his crazy plan could work. He was going to go back in time and kill Voldemort when he was young.

Would this kill him in the process? Probably. With no first war, he might never be born because his parents never got together. The ripple effects were massive the farther back he went. He had to try though, if it meamt that everyone lived then he would sacrifice everything. He would send his spirit back in time and kill Voldemort in his sleep.

He entered the runic circle, cut his palm and activated the runes. He began to chant a spell of his own creation and felt a burning sensation start from his gut and spread to the rest of his body. It hurt. Badly. He saw the room go dim and as he floated in the darkness he felt like something attack him.

He fought back, scratching and biting. Both fought tooth and nail until Harry finally felt the neck of the creature snap in two.

And then there was light.

His room was ratty, worn, and old. He heard the clip-clop of horses outdoors and the shouting of young boys selling newspaper. He had done it! He stood in triumph! Then he noticed it. He was short. Very short. And skinny too. He ran to the wardrobe and opened it, hoping he'd find a mirror.

While he found none, what he did find was better! An old music box that had the initials T.R. on the bottom. Opening up the box he saw that it had a tiny mirror. Taking a look at himself made him realize he might have screwed things up much more then he would of liked.

He was a child of about 10 or 11, dark brown hair, beautiful blue eyes, a handsome if malnourished face. Looking around for any more information about himself he searched the room. Up and down and over and under until he noticed a floorboard squeak. Suspicious about the floorboard he went and pried it open. Inside was a box with writing on the top. Writing that made his blood run cold...

"Property of Tom Marvolo Riddle"


** Is this Harry going back in time and becoming Voldemort? Could you give an actual summary instead of just the blurb?

** I don't see where the conflict is. If Harry has free will, just choose not to murder everyone and turn into Happy McSnakeman.

Incidentally, magical power is overdone in HP fanon, considering that there's no analogue to magical power in canon. There's just skill with magic. This makes the setup a bit meh.
