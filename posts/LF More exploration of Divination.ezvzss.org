  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

Please excuse the shameless self promotion. It comes in later in the story, but divination plays a large role.

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.

*** I think it was this one that I actually got angry about it being abandoned.

There's so few divination dives and it was new and exciting and I got invested.

I mean I got over it, but still. It's good.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

*** Rent a hero had really fun Divination. I especially liked the flip on the cliché about divination being completely useless without the gift. Does anyone else know if something similar has even been mentioned in other fics?
