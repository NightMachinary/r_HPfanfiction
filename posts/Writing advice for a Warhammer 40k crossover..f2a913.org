Basically, this story is where Hermione is in fact a Primarch from 40k. She was found by the Emperor between POA and GOF. Her powers had to be activated by the Emperor, because Malcador, in his infinite wisdom, suggested that this particualr Primarch be more humble than their brothers, as a General often requires humility to better lead their men. He also took Malcadors suggestion for a female Primarch to heart. She was scattered along with her brothers, but in her case into an alternate universe and adopted by the Grangers. She grows up normally, and in her case the Emperor's dna grants her wizarding powers. When she is found between years 3 and 4, she takes her heritage to heart. The Emperor activates her primarch abilities. She names her legion the 'Dragon Wands', after her wand core. Though unsure of her at first, a majority of her brothers start to respect her after she takes an entire system without firing a shot. Eventually, when the Horus Heresy came, she of course joined with the loyalists. But, during the Battle of Terra, her legion was decimated, being reduced to her and her Second-In-Command. She later had her mind wiped by Magnus The Red. She was sent back to the HP universe. However, during DH her powers start to activate. Any advice?


** The mind wipe ruins anything written previous. While it is exciting to read pre-wipe, having her mindwiped, not knowing, and slowly finding her powers but now regaining memories makes for a difficult read for the readers. It comes up as a "whats the point then?" Of everything pre-wipe.

In my opinion, have her start finding her powers, work on them, have her realise she has been mind-warped, then find the memories/regain them. And tell the pre-wipe in flashbacks.

*** After that, she'll make it back to the Warhammer galaxy, and join in Roboute Guillimans struggle against the forces of chaos.
