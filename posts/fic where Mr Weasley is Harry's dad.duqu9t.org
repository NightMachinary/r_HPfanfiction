:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok so I read this a while back, and I'm trying to find it again.

-Mr Weasley was Harry's Dad

-I think Ron and Ginny were found out to not be Arthur's kids

-Harry most likely had a different name since I can't find the fic

-I think there was some Dumbledore bashing and some Molly bashing

I know this is my second fic finding request but any help would be appreciated


** What's the British version of "Alabama" (you know, the region that's the butt of incest jokes)?

*** The butt of incest jokes in Britain is still Alabama. Why do we need to insult our own people when we can insult the Americans instead, am I right?

** I think I know what you're talking about. Are Molly and Dumbledore a couple and they - along with some Weasley kids - have been stealing Harry's money, so Arthur divorces Molly and disowns those kids? However, I don't remember Harry being Arthur's son.

*** It's been a while so I might have mixed up details. but what you're saying sounds pretty accurate. even if it's not the right story I'd enjoy reading it if you could possibly link it.

**** Sorry I don't know how to link. I couldn't find the story I was talking about, but these are similar if you wanna check them. I know how frustrating it is looking for an old fic and not being able to find it.

The One Appointment We All Must Keep by mandymid on FFN is with a betrothal contract between Harry and Ginny. Arthur finds out and gets an annulment from Molly then she is betrothed to Dumbledore.

True Snakes by LeahBates2 on Wattpad is where Harry is actually a Malfoy named Hadrian who had been stolen. A bunch of people go on trial for hiding the knowledge of Harry's abuse by the Dursleys and stealing money from his vault.

The Marriage Contract by phoenixgirl26 on FFN is where Harry finds Ginny's original birth certificate and she is actually Dumbledore's daughter, not Arthur's.

***** Don't worry it's cool. stories sadly sometimes fall into the abyss, if I'm really up to looking for it i can just pull up my 2016-2017 browsing history, and narrow it down to hp fanfic. I've been known to do that when nobody can bring results. I dont often resort to it because of how messy my search history gets because i have way to many google accounts.

and Wattpad is actually a platform i haven't used for hp fanfic in a while, i just find it hard to sort, so it will be cool to go back there.
