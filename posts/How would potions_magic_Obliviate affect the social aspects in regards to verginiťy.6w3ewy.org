In a world where you can erase both physical and mental aspects of your past, and the equalising effect of magic between sexes; what impact would this have?


** Personality Death via obliviation. Special obliviators who delve into the mind of the person and leave only classroom knowledge and practical skills in place. You would be left with a blank person who is essentially a baby in an adult body plus an infodump of impersonal knowledge. Then they would have to be "raised" so the new personality they develop is socially acceptable.

Therapy. Extract the memory for use in a pensive. Obliviate the person of the memory. Show them the memory in a pensive. You've obliviated the emotional impact and turned a traumatic memory into the equivalent of having watched something on a television. They retain impersonal knowledge of the event.

Relationships between men and women wouldn't change as much as you are thinking they would. The biggest part of why we act the way we do is mental. Men and women are different in our heads. However in a world with perfect birth control and without STDs there'd be a lot more sex happening.

It's so close to A Clockwork Orange. I really don't see how it could go wrong.

**** If you wanted to make it more like Babylon 5 Death of Personality they would have state sponsored wizards directly implant a new personality onto the blank slate.

** Is verginity a typo of virginity? I'm not an english speaker, so I'd appreciate this if you could clear this up to me.

First of all, if we assume it is a typo, why virginity is assumed as sacred? Among those in society who doesn't view virginity as something to be protected until given to your marriage partner, this is mostly non-factor. Assuming you are asking about whether this would lead to different start for active sex life, it would depend on the culture itself, the environment and how the peers in their age group do it.

Now, on whether it would affect the start of active sex life for students, we need to have data on when those spells/potions are taught to students, and see whether there are correlation between those and the start of active sex life. Since we are talking about a fictional world with its own fictional culture, any fictional data would give you justification. But the basis is whether there is a correlation between the time period when those spells are introduced and whether there is an increase of the amount of virginity lost among that age group, or older age group.

It can be seen as a symbol of innocence and childhood. It doesn't have to be religious to be meaningful.
