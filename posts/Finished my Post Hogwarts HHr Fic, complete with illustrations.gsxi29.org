** Oh my god this was amazing. I then had to read your other hp fics too, of course. It's not every day you find such a gold mine after all. The Iron Man!Harry and Cap!Hermione story was unique in the best of ways, and not gonna lie, I almost cried just reading that Luna in that AU was Bucky, poor baby. Awakening, on the other hand, was just perfect. I'm so happy to find a genuinely great on-going fic that incorporates many things I love about hp fanfiction. You have a new fan!

*** Ahh, thank you! Lol, I'm so glad you liked it. Especially, the Marvel crossover haha, that one was a weird AU that I know not many people care for, but it was so much fun to write!

Awakening....I have a lot of plans for that one. ^^

I'm just a bit surprised you read all my fics in the few hours I posted this asdsdfghjk.

***** Ginny knows about recovering from deep trauma? This is never touched upon in the books, JKR never mentions Ginny having any lasting effects from the Horcrux to indicate she had to recover from anything.

In that sequence at Sirius's Harry even forgets it was Ginny that was possessed, so he never noted Ginny ever being affected after 2nd year.

****** You're quite right that nothing is shown, which is a real shame, but there is no possible way that she was entirely unaffected by months - nearly a year - of mind-rape. Harry just wasn't watching her closely for years afterwards.

Edit: Yes, Harry did forget about what Ginny went through. But in the same conversation, she makes it clear that she hasn't and /can't/ forget. It's just Harry being quite unaware of her feelings, which is normal for teenage boys and certainly normal for him. The fact remains that she does understand trauma and recovery, particularly trauma related to Tom, fighting Death Eaters, and having an evil presence in your head.

****** To be clear, I have no problem with Harry and Hermione bonding over their shared trauma. Totally plausible, probably nearly happened in book 7, and it's quite a good premise.

I'm just bothered by the contrast of "Ginny expected everything to go back to normal/Only Hermione understood." Um, no. Ginny would totally understand. Dismissing her just like that feels like a cop-out. With a more comprehensive reason for them not to get back together, I would have enjoyed the story a lot more. Maybe she was struggling with her own demons, and/or Fred's death, and wasn't ready for a relationship for a while; meanwhile, Harry and Hermione were there for each other. The rest of the story proceeds as before. Or maybe Ginny threw herself into something else as a coping mechanism, like professional Quidditch, and was away a lot. I like well-done Harmony, just no cheap shots.

*** Hmm. I totally get why you like Ginny and I agree that she does pull Harry out of a funk a time or two in the series. But so does Sirius...and Hagrid...and Ron. This isn't a shipping thing.

/Historically/, Hermione is the clear MVP of dealing with and pulling Harry out of funks. She spends the entire series doing it and there isn't anyone else close. The big Ginny moments stand out simply because they are so out of the norm in my opinion.

*** /Historically/, Hermione has always been the one that can deal with Harry at his lowest, to bring him out of his shell, to converse with him and understand, to calm him down. They're always there for each other like that. It's what makes their bond so beautiful.

Glad you enjoyed it. :)

**** If what he needed was good advice, then absolutely. Like working out what went wrong on his date with Cho, or why Ron was upset about the Goblet, or a hundred other times. The series is packed full of Hermione knowing the right thing to do.

If he needed a sympathetic listening ear, or someone to help him laugh away his troubles for a bit - which he often does - then Ginny is better at that.
