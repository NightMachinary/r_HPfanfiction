Am in the mood for something cute/nice/fun.

Exactly as it says, Harry family bonding with someone. Either his own parents, Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius, Remus, the Weasley's, his children or someone else entirely.

No Weasley or Dumbledore bashing unless it's Percy.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine. Oneshot is also fine.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.
