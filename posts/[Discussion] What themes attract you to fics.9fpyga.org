So we all have HP-specific things that we love and hate about the fandom, and we've had lots of threads discussing those. The idea here is a bit of critical self-examination: what are your underlying thematic preferences which motivate your specific likes and dislikes?

I'll give some examples to get us going.

*Inequality*

For me, I am interested in the theme of inequality, but not in the idealistic sense of protagonists on a crusade to eliminate it, but rather inequality as a fact of life. For me it's much more interesting to explore the dynamics of an unequal society than to see how that inequality might be "fixed".

For this reason I prefer stories which have a very wide spectrum of talent between wizards, where the average wizard isn't very good at magic, but wizards like Voldemort are essentially "local gods", able to dictate everything about their immediate environment. This in turn requires a magical system which allows the upper echelons of wizards a vast amount of power, so no magical exhaustion. Magical exhaustion is a fundamentally egalitarian world-building device, in that it means even the most powerful wizards can be rendered completely powerless.

Similarly, this preference means I prefer stories where individual powerful wizards dominate politics rather that institutions having the power as in the Muggle world. This also means I have a preference for lower population figures, as the higher the population, the more power institutions will hold.

*The "Good Life"*

Another preference is that I enjoy stories which depict an alternative to modern consumerist society, one where people live closer to the natural world and life is not about the consumption of entertainment media/acquisition of consumer goods.

For this reason I dislike stories where Muggle consumer culture is imported into the wizarding world or wizarding society is depicted as somehow lacking/"backwards" because they have less of a focus on consumer goods/entertainment. Rather I am interested in stories which depict a wizarding society where people spend their time on more "wholesome" pursuits - quality time with family and friends, gardening, adventurous travel, etc.


** *Adventure*

Whilst this theme is very general, I find I enjoy stories that explore the weird and wonderful, from drier more academic approaches to full-on Indiana-Jones-esque romps, I feel like the world of Harry Potter too often loses its wonder in stories saturated with politics, drama, angst and overly-helpful Goblins.

*Growth Though Error, and Moral/Ethical/Philosophical Dilemmas*

I feel that these often go hand-in-hand, particularly when the protagonist of the story starts with a certain perspective or view or moral compass, and finishes the story having changed (and not always for the better). Learning through making mistakes is one of the most human characteristics available to characters, and very often I find stories that have the protagonists either fall into the trap of never making mistakes, the mistakes being rectified before any lessons are learned despite being of a certain magnitude, or for the mistakes to occur in overly-cliché ways or otherwise too close to existing tropes.

Whilst a lot of the moral/ethical/philosophical considerations in stories are often difficult to present without smashing a particular ideology over the reader's head, when done well I feel it can provide a really interesting window into some of the more difficult issues that can impact a person's life or growth with maturity and narrative weight.

  Moral/Ethical/Philosophical Dilemmas
#+end_quote

This is actually not explored that much in fics. Authors are either in the “good guys don't kill” or “let's go all out against Voldemort” camps. I can think of a few examples or scenarios though:

- An inner circle Death Eater has been spotted in a particular location with his family. Harry has to decide whether to take him out by blowing up the area, thus killing potential innocents; or risking the lives of his own people by ordering a direct assault. How should Harry choose?
- An alternative way to kill Voldemort exists, but requires sacrificing innocent children in a horrible ritual. It's guaranteed to work. Because Voldemort created Horcruxes and greatly weakened his soul, it's possible to reduce the cost of this ritual as not to involve any human sacrifices. However, the modified ritual is not guaranteed to work. Which option should Harry and his friends choose?
- Postwar, it was found that in addition to the Longbottoms, up to several hundreds of Cruciatus victims lie around in Muggle hospitals. A potential cure is in development at DoM, but requires testing on live humans. Several Unspeakables propose to use Death Eaters convicted of murders and torture as test subjects. Some very vindictive DA members also support this proposal, saying it's just fair turnaround, but they want the Trio to have the final word. How should the Trio decide?
- After a major engagement, the DA and Order lost several people due to other's side use of the Killing Curse. Some members suggest to retaliate in kind, since Avada Kedavra bypasses the shield charm and offers significant tactical advantages. On the other hand, Avada Kedavra is still very much a taboo among the populace and its use means losing certain popular support. The leaders also worry that liberal use of this curse has adverse psychological consequences. How should they decide?

**** You're very imaginative, but the third one doesn't really work. The Cruciatus takes actual sadistic intent to cast, and so the motivations of anyone willing to use it (even on the Death Eaters) are /extremely/ questionable. The dilemma would work better if there were some way to replicate the effects of long-term Cruciatus through some technique that /doesn't/ require an evil caster by default, but that makes the whole scenario rather contrived.

A more real dilemma (albeit one with uncomfortable real-world parallels) involving the Longbottoms would be that in the /HP/ world with a proven Afterlife (and, if God isn't a terrible person in that universe, one where the Longbottoms would presumably recover their intellect), wouldn't it be kinder to kill them rather than let them live in confused suffering?

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** *Motivations*

In some ways, the books can actually be fairly subtle when it comes to characterization. What initially seem like hollow characters actually have a good amount of thought behind them.

There are the morally complex.

Memorable characters like Dumbledore, Snape, Sirius, James Potter, Percy, and Lupin aren't wholly black or white. Dumbledore is especially interesting since he roller coasters from kindly old mentor to hero with clay feet, proving himself human in the process.

Then there are those with complex natures, or motivations that are more interesting than they seem at first glance. Some of them are the same characters.

Dumbledore, for well-known reasons. Snape for the same. Pettigrew, the talented, yet sniveling traitorous coward. Umbridge, who is an inferiority complex wedded to the perfect little tyrant. Hermione Granger, the overbearing perfectionist who breaks rules when it suits her. Sirius, the pure-blood wizard who broke so thoroughly with his family's worldview that he was cast out as a youth. Slughorn, a man who truly believes in ambition and talent, but not if it completely bankrupts one's morals.

There are also characters will simpler motives for doing what they do.

Bigotry, like that of Bellatrix Lestrange, the Malfoys, and so many other blood supremacists. Doing the decent thing, like Harry and Ron. The need for control, even over death, like Voldemort (who would be an almost textbook psychopath if not for that pesky fear of his).

They all have reasons behind things, rarely just doing them for the heck of it. Some of the reasons are half-seen. There's lot to be inferred from what the reader doesn't view in full, little hints of greater stories.

/Any fics that can give good motivations to characters, either by emulating, extrapolating, expanding, or spinning-off those in canon, gets my attention./

​

*The Allure of the Dark Arts*

But not an allure that's ultimately edgy and full of needless angst and diatribes about all things Dark being misunderstood.

(gag)

Okay, it's a little more complicated than that, and it ties into my first "theme."

I know a good Dark Arts fic when I see it -- a slow slide down the slippery slope, or the occasional gleeful jump off the edge of it.

But there should be a reason for going down that slope in the first place ...

... one that convinces me that the characters couldn't be doing anything else. Half because they want it, and half because they are in thrall to the spells they're using.

Dark magic ought to be as seductive as it is dangerous, and that should be clear in every spell and every awful deed. Most of the spells classified as Dark mean literally having death on the tip of a wand. No one should come by such magic lightly, or without cost, or just "because," which is what the decent stories show.

/A good Dark Arts fic ties character motivations/goals into their pursuit of a magic that is both powerful and devious./

​

(I'm half asleep right about now and up way too late, but this discussion was so interesting that I couldn't pass it up, and I hope everything I wrote makes some sort of sense without too many spelling errors.)

** Some themes I enjoy:

*Critical Thinking*

Canon has a lack of it and completely derailing the canon plot by characters suddenly employing critical thinking skills gives me great enjoyment. It is particularly intriguing when it comes into conflict with a Magical World, where people are conditioned to take things at face value (maybe because Magic sometimes lacks logic). There's a lot of interesting stuff that can be done with it, which is why I like HPMOR so much, but I don't necessarily want all that "sciency" stuff.

*Characters going their own way*

This kind of follows the first theme, but I think it warrants its own point. I'm not talking about the usual independent!Harry stories, because those can often be summarized with "I'm always right and anyone who disagrees with me is my enemy" or worse "might makes right".

It's no secret that I don't like Dumbledore very much and I just want to see people doing something on their own (as individuals or as a group) instead of getting lead by the nose. Similarly I don't want them to be railroaded by the plot, which is another problem in canon (for example: Hermione only being allowed to be smart when it is convenient to the plot).

*The power of friendship, family and love*

Yeah it's cheesy the way I've written it, but this is clearly one of the central themes of the books. Lots of fanfiction writers tend to snub at that, which can be fun too, but all the dark gritty edgelord fiction can become pretty tiring.

I disagree with Rowling in many ways on her definitions of friendship (Ron), family (Weasleys) and love (Snape), which is why I like stories that follow the same themes but execute them better.

This confuses me. I've always seen large parts of the Wizarding World as a persiflage by Rowling of our mores in society. It's why we see corrupt politicians, idiotic Bureaucracy that doesn't get anything done, greedy bankers and - yes - ridiculous consumerism (teen witch weekly, shopping districts, popular broom brands, spectator sports and team affiliations, Berty Botts Beans, collectible trading cards, Celestina Warbeck, the main news media are firmly in the hand of private interest... I could go on).

There's no reason to 'import' muggle consumerist culture into the Wizarding world, it is already intimately involved with it and I see no indication that Rowling had any romantic naturalist intentions about the "simple life": People in her world follow a post-industrialization life style. They have jobs (wage earning labor performing often menial tasks that can't be very fulfilling) and consume, follow the news, gossip, etc.

Lots of my fanfiction interests are in contrast to canon, so I don't want to argue against your enjoyments of such themes in AUs (though I personally find this kind of romanticizing of such a lifestyle dubious at best), but criticizing stories for bringing consumerism into the "pure" magical world just sounds flat out wrong to my ears.

In canon, the bad guys like the Malfoys seemed to flaunt their wealth and indulge in consumerism, while the poor Weasleys were the tight-knit happy big family.

On the other hand, Weasley kids seemed to hate their material/monetary scarcities, and would later become big money raking operators.

This Wizarding world was just as consumerist and materialistic as the Muggle world, if not more so. At least we are still aware of some of the damages we are causing, hence the green parties, sustainability drives, billions of R&D money and government incentives into promoting anything "green", and of course people like Taure who think we suck. In Magical Britain, their sense of superiority reigned supreme and they didn't seem to want to change at all.

The Weasleys are only poor in the sense that they can't afford all the same luxury items as everyone else, which is probably the most capitalistic/status-based definition of poor that you can have. They own their own house, have a huge garden are all highly educated and have all the tools, including magic, at their disposal to be basically self sufficient. Yet they are seen as poor because they can't afford the latest Nimbus 2000.

Their status within their world is probably one of the best arguments (that I didn't come up with in my post) why the Wizarding World isn't very impressed with the simple good life (also no-one appears to pursue that anyway).

** *Change and Redemption*

I'm a rather idealistic person who wants nothing more than for everyone who isn't a sadistic psychopath to finally stop with their nonsense, share notes and shake hands. I am, thus, a big fan of villains coming to see the errors of their ways, either on their own or through outside interference. Tyrants and villains and murderers need to be removed from positions where they can harm others, given the therapy they desperately need, and then given a chance at a happy, /harmless/ life.

I love remorseful, contrite Pettigrew struggling between his guilt for what he's done and his paranoid fear, I love those stories where Scardemort or Diarymort or some other version of Voldemort comes to admit that murder isn't a very nice thing to do and conquest won't ever really bring him happiness anyway (which doesn't mean he has to go all lovey-dovey-fuzzy about it; it really diminishes the value of such a plotline if it's done through a romance). And that goes for the Malfoys and Filch and whoever you want.

On a related note, I really like seeing the Wizarding World as a whole (or just Hogwarts) become generally a better place for everyone involved. Much more than in our depressingly-inconvenient, magic-less, entropy-riddled world, the /Harry Potter/ world is a universe where if all the magic-users could just stop squibbling and get along, you could very realistically get a heaven on Earth.

** Compromise.

A lot of people supported Voldemort, some might have just supported his ideas but not got involved. Some of them are from older families that might have piles of gold. The Wizarding world is in chaos. Gold is needed to repair the damage. Where is the line between punishment and justice? How do you satisfy the need some have for vengeance with a society that needs to come together to move forwards. You don't want to go full Treaty of Versailles and create another issue years down the line due to festering resentment.

They say a good compromise is one nobody leaves happy. Can the wizarding world afford to not be happy?

In the epilogue Harry lives happily ever after and marries his best mates sister. Ignoring what makes their relationship tick, because I do think H/G works, its a tiny bubble Harry lives in. The Weasleys are such a huge part of his life and they look after him so well that he never has to leave their bubble when he's in the wizarding world. I want Harry to leave the bubble and compromise on a personal level. I want to see Harry date a pureblood stuck up bitch with terrible views because she's funny, witty and hot. They get on great but he cannot agree with her views. I want a story where that reflects the wider society. Can they compromise? Can they find a middle ground and go forwards together or are they doomed to blow up in another huge fight? It doesn't have to be yes but I think it would be interesting to read.

** *Moral Conflict*

Stories where there are deep, real moral disagreements between the different factions interest me far more than obviously good vs obviously evil stories. Like oh no, it's the magic Nazis vs people who want to not do that. There's no possible nuance there - no was there supposed to be- one side is simply wrong. Less clear cut moral divides can draw me in very easily. But don't have stupid references to moral categories as "Oh that's Gray" or shit like that. Sounds ridiculous.

​

Also:

Is that how it's used? I nearly always just see it used to create tension for the MC (especially in crossovers) and it's always boring. In my experience, it's either that or the MC is just so magical that everyone else gets tired after five charms while the MC is a god who can cast for hours.

Granted, it is a theme more common in ASOIAF fanfics (usually targeting the Lannisters and Freys), but there's nothing quite like reading how the bad guys are getting defeated, all of their plans fall apart or their big charge is mowed down by superior firepower (ASOIAF Industrialisation SIs for example, or Mass Effect time-travel).

However, I don't enjoy the realisation of this theme in the HP fandom because usually just Harry and not his friends/companions as well. One overpowered character is not very enjoyable to read.

** The struggle against Nazism and bigotry. Also, the struggle for equal rights. I hate stories where the global scope of human rights, one of the greatest achievements of humanity, no matter how imperfectly it's enforced in our world, is dismissed, either openly, or in a veiled manner by ignoring them, as not applicable "because magic". When it comes down to it, Harry Potter, for me, is a story about three friends defying all odds and fighting for what is right - to the end. It's not a story about magic - magic is merely part of the setting. An important part, but not an absolutely essential part. It's a story about humans.

** Hey, that's an interesting perspective on "mugglewank" I haven't seen before. Contemporary muggle culture having the flaw of being consumerist / a capitalistic hellscape, that is.

Anyway, there are a few themes that I found attractive:

*Muggle/Magic Cultural Differences*

I love fics that explore muggle-borns finding their place in wizarding society and on the polar opposite pure-bloods fighting to adapt in a muggle world. This is why I adore fics that toy around the idea of the consequences of breaking/toeing the Statute of Secrecy, having serious long-term muggle/magic relationships, or doing business with folks "on the other side".

I've personally been thinking of a concept of a muggle/magic black market for a fic (feat. e.g. wizards trading ambiguously magical items) but I don't think I could rather pull it off just yet.

Too ambitious.

*Magical Morality and Ethics*

Here's a case study, still somewhat related to the theme above.

/In HBP, Hermione sicced a bunch of actively attacking canaries on Ron -- an action that would have proven fatal in the non-magical world./

/But they weren't in one./

Still though, Ron got multitudes of scars that even magic couldn't heal. And if these canaries acted like actual canaries, he would've lost his eyes had he not shielded them fast enough -- could magic re-grow eyes? He also, while a jerk, wasn't being actively aggressive towards Hermione. Some people also say that since magic acted as an equalizer, Hermione doesn't have the "she's a girl" excuse (not that, IMO, it's a valid excuse; just bringing it up) since what's relevant is their magical prowess. And Hermione is more magically inclined than Ron, so she was the more powerful party among both of them.

But violence is also normalized in the wizarding world. Hitting speeding, heavy balls towards the opposition isn't only legal in Quidditch; it's a /part/ of it. So one could argue that Hermione was only adapting to wizarding culture and that the whole thing was not to be taken as it would be in a muggle context.

The question: /How much should Hermione be called out on her action?/

I could go on and on, particularly with Fred and George's disturbing idea of humor, but you get the idea. One fic that comes to mind is The Heinz Dilemma; be aware, though, it gets preachy in the end.

** Well; It'd be easier to say what I ‘don't' like in a fic than it would be to say what I do. But, even though I generally enjoy all kinds of things; I've taken the time to compose my all time favorites on an ever growing list that's Much shorter than my ffn favs (which I just use as a read history list).

If you care to see my short list, it's all in a Community here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Those-Less-Forgotten/124884/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]]

Although be warned, it's not all HP, that's one of the most common, but it's not the only fanon I fallow.

** /The Lone Hero against the darkness/ I love reading stories where Harry slowly and intelligently cuts his way through the Death Eaters and their friends, where Harry is active in hunting his enemies down or intelligently drawing them out into the open.
