We need more crossovers with Magicka. For those who don't know, Magicka is basically like Harry Potter, only everyone is as powerful as Voldemort, as whimsically nutty as the Lovegoods, and liable to murder you for stealing their sweetroll only to resurrect you a moment later to act as their ally in the fight against someone else who happened to take the last slice of Pizza.

Imagine if Hogwarts was written by Terry Pratchett and the Wizards all thought they were in Borderlands and you've probably got the general idea. It's fun, chaotic, and slightly psychotic, and I think we need to see more of it. :)


** Is it a cartoon or book, where can I find it?

**** Thanks, I'll have a look at it. I'd like to see that one shot continued, what Harry did to they Slytherins and Snape was funny/scary/insane.

*** Sondrex is right, it's a game. If you want to see what it is, Lordminion777 has a decent lets-play of it.
