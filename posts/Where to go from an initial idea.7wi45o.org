There was a great discussion the other day about different outlining strategies. I really enjoyed seeing how you all take these thoughts out of your heads and put them down for us to read. Many people mentioned that they “already knew where they wanted the story to go” or “pretty much knew the main plot from the start” and then fleshed it out from there. The problem I face is that I don't know how to do that. I have good ideas for starting points and know some important scenes I want to write, but I don't know where I want to end up. I would love to be able to make a solid outline in order to make sure my pacing is good as well as adding some foreshadowing but I can't do that if I don't know exactly what I'm heading towards. I don't want to end up with a fic that starts solid and then ends up rambling into nothing.

So, any suggestions from others who have started with the beginning premise and without a specific end in mind?


** (Wall of text warning)

For me, this is all part of the outlining process, but it's not so-much an outline, as a work-in-progress that's constantly changing as I write. As you've got starting scenes, I assume you know what sort of story you want, you're just not sure what that story is.

I usually start with a basic idea (e.g. a Slytherin Harry who does nothing unless it benefits him) along with a sub-plot or two and maybe the odd scene along the way then build it out. It's easier to show rather than tell, so for the purposes of this, let's say I'm writing an AU from OotP featuring everyone's 'favourite' Dark! Independent Harry, with manipulative! Dumbledore and a relationship with Daphne Greengrass. Each of these is a heading, Dark!Harry, Harry vs Dumbledore, Harry & Daphne etc. and has four acts, act 0 to act 3.

As well as Voldemort, that gives me several other plot arcs I need to figure out, made more difficult because by OotP Harry is clearly a good, selfless person who trusts Dumbledore:

1/ Why does Harry go 'Dark' and what exactly /is/ dark?

2/ Same as above, but his independance

3/ How is Dumbledore being manipulative and why?

4/ What makes Harry and Daphne attracted to each other and how does the relationship start

For the first three, I'd summarise it in a sentence: Harry, with the prophesy hanging over his head, goes looking for more powerful magic to try and hold his own with Voldemort, and he'll use whatever means required, even if it's viewed as 'dark' - not that means he'll be sacrificing virgins - he's still Harry.

This has given me fodder for my other plotlines:

I can damage his relationship with Dumbledore - already slightly rocky after Sirius dies because Dumbledore didn't warn him Voldemort might use the connection to get him into the DoM - over differing views of how to prosecute the war: Dumbledore with his meandering insights into the life of Riddle is going to go against the grain to a Harry with an urgent need to 'level-up', so here we have the thin end of the wedge for the independent Harry and Manipulative Dumbledore plotlines. This is two different entries under Harry vs Dumbledore:

Act 0 (Basically an establishing shot for this story arc): Harry is slightly cold toward Dumbledore when picked up from Dursley's as if Dumbledore'd not kept secrets HArry wouldn't have gone to the DoM and got Sirius killed.

Act 1: Harry, frustrated by Dumbledore's continued secrecy over the point of his lessons and apparent lack of concern over the fact that he doesn't even know half of what Dumbledore and Riddle were doing in the Ministry Atrium fight, stomps out of a lesson, vowing that if Dumbledore won't help him, he'll help himself like in the Twiwizard. If he's taught the DA, he can teach himself - it'll just take longer.

Stommping out of the lesson has given me another idea - if he's too keen at looking for 'dark' spells, it will likely bring him into conflict with Hermione. She generally acts as a calming influence and stops Harry acting rashly. When Harry's acting in the grip of emotion he's often careless e.g. cruciating Carrow because he insulted McGonagall, using a dubious spell on Draco in HBP, so reducing her influence would 'up' Harry's 'dark' factor in terms of spell choice, and more conflict is always a good thing. This doesn't really fit anywhere yet, though it'll probably end-up under Dark - if I use it at all, so I'll just stick it on a separate page

As well, if Harry stomps into the Library looking for dangerous spells in a bad mood, he's liable to open his mouth before he thinks. We can have him looking at dubious spells and hurl the book aside in anger, then cue Daphne to walk on looking for the book. "Who're you trying to kill with that?" "Just Voldemort - just need to wave my wand a few times and he'll turn into a rabbit. You?" "My father," said Daphne quietly. (That might be an act one or an act zero, so I'll just stick it under the heading for the moment).

Oops. I've just created a whole new plot. Why does Daphne want to kill her Father? (this is actually potentially good relationship conflict. Harry's slightly disillusioned with James, but I could see him having a very idealised view, so the two can argue about Daphne's plan and Daphne can have character growth through starting to make a reconciliation with her Mother, and it's got potential irony points for Harry being seen as falling to the darkness while he's gradually walking Daphne into the light. It's also good as a means to show the nuances of Harry's evolving 'darkness', though Harry being Harry it'd be more of a grubby white than actual black). Let's say Daphne's Father's a true-green Death Eater, but Daphne's determined she's not going to go down the path he's laid out for her and she's got practically an entire mosaic floor of chips on her shoulders.

And now we've an act 2 for Dumbledore v Harry: Once Harry and Daphne's growing relationship becomes public (learning spells together perhaps?), Dumbledore's suddenly got a reason as to why Harry's temperament has changed, why he's being more questioning and why he's using some slightly alarming spells - Daphne's a bad influence and is carrying the whisperings of her Death Eater Father into Harry's ears. Dumbledore can try and influence Harry away - engineer situations to show all of Daphne's flaws, show prejudice to house elves, surreptitiously enlist Ron 'I-hate-slytherins' Weasley etc., then, just after some significant milestone in the relationship, but short of a kiss, Dumbledore gives up on subtle and drops Harry into a pensive of Daphne's Father's greatest hits, followed by a 'are-you-sure-this-is-wise' Harry talk. Harry explodes - he's wanted someone to want him for his whole life and he's not stepping away from Daphne because of who her Father is - he's not his father and the same goes for her.

Act 3 for Dark!Harry could be using a much more sinister spell from his arsenal on Draco in the bathroom when Draco tries to use the cruciatus on him, which would also shift the Harry vs Dumbledore plot into a higher gear toward it's own act 3. As a preliminary scene, Harry could ask Daphne and/or Hermione for suggestions as to getting the memory from Slughorn, and go for something much more invasive and much less benign than luck potion. No other ideas are firing, so I'm going to write the sentence for the Harry/Daphne relationship, even though the Dark!Harry is missing an Act 2, as I've used her a lot earlier so have a very rough personality and a few things they do together to try and build out the character arc:

Harry and Daphne bond over training to kill people and are both too suborn to listen to all the reasons they shouldn't be together (to be fair, I don't usually do this for relationship ones. I know the Act 0: Mutual suspicion by reputation, Act 3: A kiss and agreement to be boyfriend/girlfriend and roughly where the relationship builds from - helping each other practice spells, then I just fill in the gaps as I go, often while writing, and I'll just jot it down when the idea strikes).

Repeat the process until all sub-plots and main plots have four acts, making notes of other ideas as you go. Once you hit a critical mass the ideas should start feeding off each other and come together faster. As I read back/plan, I'll often have ideas for scenes before/after the act ones, or just ones required to make the big act scenes work properly (like Harry needing to know where the Chamber is, so he works out it's probably in or near a bathroom, so Hermione researches a clue about it moving in the pipes, and she works that out by Harry hearing it moving through them, but only Harry can hear it, otherwise everyone'd know, so it speaks in special snake language, and that skill is shown by Draco trying to use a snake at the duelling club. So in the context of my made-up story, before the Dumbledore Act One scene can really make sense, Harry needs at a minimum one introductory lesson with Dumbledore, at least one further lesson (or a scene which shows part of a lesson to show that it's happening before following Harry out the room for the main event, say sneaking into the library and almost getting caught with a dubious book) and a few moments of Harry thinking/complaining about the disparity in ability between himself and Dumbledore/Voldemort and the need to do something about it.

I'd then usually go back and tidy the outline and fiddle a little. If I can't think of ideas for individual scenes, I'd write a short sentence or two describing the gist of what I want for that particular act.

I use my outline like a treasure map - I've got the landmarks, but I put the dotted line from one to the other down as I go, adding in scenes as and when I realise it's required, like a character doing something which requires a follow-up scene before I can get to the next pre-planned scene.

Pacing is broadly sorted in that you have your target scenes (Act 1, 2, and 3 of each plot thread) and you more or less evenly disperse them through the novel, with the main plot being roughly 1/3rd, 2/3rd and 3/3rds then slotting in the others to keeping conflict and interest up in the intervening period, though clustering some of them, especially in the climax of the novel, will give them more impact - even better if you can get one scene to do double duty in multiple plotlines. Pacing is something that's fixed in editing really - you can't really check pacing when you don't know how many words i.e. time you've used up to and after that point.

Like I said at the beginning, the outline is basically an aide-memoire. If you know where you're going you can drop in some foreshadowing, but it's so much easier to foreshadow once you've finished and can just slot it in - the same way Agatha Christie wrote her novels, picked someone to be the murderer, then went back and 'fixed' the novel so the clues made logical sense.

*** Similarly, don't feel you need a completed outline with (if you're following my method) all the acts filled in before you can start to write. Sometimes over-planning kills the story and by the time you've planned it you're so fed up you don't want to write it. I've one story that I started writing with no middle at all, but as I wrote the ideas played off each other and the scenes already there and I'd slotted all my act twos in before I'd finished a first draft of chapter two.

Don't be afraid to follow your characters off the beaten bath either. I don't think I've written a story I've not scrapped entirely after 20k, done major structural work, then started it again. This can be removing entire plot-devices/subplots that don't fit or are too powerful/peril destroying, combining characters or just starting the story from a different place - I usually start much further into the story, such as removing a series of prologues covering years one to four and jumping straight in with Harry in the hospital wing informing four girls that he's used their bond with him (which he didn't tell them about) to siphon off their magic (which he didn't ask permission for), to escape Lord Voldemort (who they didn't know existed). There was no need to re-tell four years of story when the only really vital information was a short series of scenes where he rescued the girls - periodic flashbacks would work just as well and it kept the story's pace up from the start. I've also scrapped major scenes when I reached them and replaced them with totally different ones half-way through a story - a slight adjustment to the outline and on I went.

I've had one story where I'd been writing away, then realised that if I kept writing Dobby's going to be used as a means of transport to get to a kidnapped Harry because it was the logical solution. So I did that. Then I realised that he was too powerful to be left alive, so I killed him off to stop Harry being able to escape without putting in some effort on his own part. I then had to follow those ramifications etc. Basically, don't be a slave to the outline.

This is really long-winded, but the short version is:

1/ List your main plot threads

2/ Write a sentence describing the general idea

3/ Split it into a starting state (Act 0), first change (Act 1), second change (Act 2), end-state (Act 3)

4/ If you've an idea for one or more of these, slot it in.

5/ Make notes of any other ideas for scenes

6/ Work out what knowledge the audience requires, whether plot items or character traits/interactions for the scenes you've already got, then slot a scene in showing that earlier on

7/ Are there any events in the last scene that you need another scene to show fully?

8/ Repeat until either outline complete or you have enough to start to write

9/ Revise outline/misc. scene list as and when required/you get a new or better idea

I'm sure there's far better ways of doing it than this, but it seems to work for me. If you want to PM me, I'd be happy to for you to bounce ideas off me for what you've currently got or show you one of my actual outlines.

(Side note: Why did I do this? I've got too many projects running around in my head as it is - I don't need to have practically planned another ;) ) (2/2)

**** Thank you! I really like your method. I'd already started to think about some of those main plot threads, but trying to figure out how to implement them through acts should help me figure out what act 4 should be and where I want to go.

** I would say to go ahead and write down what you have in your head right now. Little scenes, bits of dialog, description--whatever is percolating. Once you've got your initial bits written down, read them over, think about them and jot down thoughts that occur to you while you're reading. Before you know it, your ideas will solidify and start to take shape. It's also helpful if you have someone you can bounce ideas off of. I do this with my husband and beta reader all the time. It's like building a house brick by brick and like building a house, it can be work.

Sometimes a story just comes at you out of the blue, birthed from your head like Zeus birthed Athena and sometimes you sit down with a giant block of marble, a hammer and a chisel and you just have to chip away at it. The temptation to start publishing right away is strong, but if you don't have a concrete idea of where things are going to end up, hold off for a bit until you have several cohesive chapters. Alternatively, you can write a one-shot where the entire story is contained in one short piece. It can be a prologue for your larger piece or something completely on its own. In other fandoms, I had a bad habit of abandoning multi-chapter works, so for HP, I limited myself to one-shots in the beginning and then started doing longer pieces as I gained confidence.

As for myself, the longest thing I've written is California Dreamin' and I can say that I did not have a super-concrete ending in mind for about halfway through the story and honestly, it kind of shows. If I'd done a better job of outlining, I could have tightened up the story a lot and probably done it in 20 chapters instead of 39. But I had a lot of fun writing it and I learned a lot, so it is what it is.

Don't be afraid to start! Get to writing and see what happens!

*** Thanks. I am not planning on posting it unless the entire story is complete, and even then who knows. I have two solid chapters so far in my main story that I work on when I have both time and inspiration, with a single chapter done for three other ideas.

I think part of the problem I've had with writing down some of the scenes I have in mind for later is that I don't know how much of what I want to do should be revealed in those scenes and how much should be done before. I bet just writing it at all would give me a chance to figure out what works and what doesn't.

** I just started writing my first fic and I find that I'm much more a talker than a writer, if that makes sense. So I tell myself the story, over and over. I say it out loud, making it up as I go (I kinda know where I want to go, just not exactly how), and when I have told myself the chapter enough times that I have refined it, I write it in one go, plus a few edits a day or two later. It's maybe uncommon, IDK, but it works well for me. The hard part is to make it as good as it sounds when told out loud, voice intonations and subtle face details and all. It also helps me imagine where it's going to go, I have key scenes in mind and a general ending ("they get together and they live happily ever after" kind of thing), so telling myself the story makes me try and imagine more than just that chapter, it helps spark the imagination needed for the rest.

*** I'm a talker, too. No so much to myself, but I'll be chatting to my husband and something like, “So I was thinking I'd have Harry start breeding hippogriffs...” and I'll just trail off with this look on my face as inspiration strikes. Drives him nuts.

** Start with the idea you have. Figure out where to start the story, and then how you'll want it to end. I'll use my abandoned Fic as a base here:

*Start:* Tonks' take over guardianship of Harry shortly after beginning of his schooling. The Tonks' live in Crawley which make Harry and Hermione interact a bit and by the time they get to Hogwarts they are close friends. Harry also sort of becomes a living doll for Dora to play with, which he finds really strange but goes along with it. Alongside this, Peter is found and Sirius gets exonerated and eventually takes up the actual guardianship of Harry but he lives most of the time with the Tonks'. As Sirius and Amelia rekindle their relationship, Harry and Susan meet each other as well.

*Year 1:* Most things go the same, except Susan becomes a Gryffindor. Ron and Harry does not become friends. Harry may decline the position of seeker. Troll event may be entirely circumvented.

*Year 2:* Most things go the same up to the Christmas holidays. Whereupon Harry and Susan reveal what's going on. Letters doesn't seem to be leaving if they have to do with the petrifications. Rest of school year currently unplanned but likely to be rather massive with investigations and shit that'll happen beyond the view of the kids.

*Year 3:* Well Sirius is out already. So most likely to be Peter and I think Bellatrix and maybe another. Unsure of what they'll be doing finding Voldemort or killing Harry. Maybe bits of both.

*Year 4:* Most likely going the same as Canon with the obligatory changes to the events and the obligatory 9 new events.

*Year 5 and on:* Like 70% off the rails until the story is done.

And like that I'm 90% more prepared for the rewrite I'll likely start during the summer.

*Just to concise it a bit:* Idea. Figure out where and when to start it. Use the years for what they're worth and then map things out from the usual 'tent-pole' events that are there until you're done or they can no longer be used. Finally take each of those year outlines and transcribe it onto chapters. And then flesh out the individual chapters. Where do you see the characters being at the beginning of the year and where do you see them being at each 'tent-pole' event. Flesh in the between. Then start writing.

Don't get me wrong you can write without fleshing it out, but that leaves you too much leeway, at least for me as I know I'm a terrible pantser. But I know that If I have things halfway outlined I'll write more and faster than if I didn't outline at all.
