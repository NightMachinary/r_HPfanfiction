Looking for stories in which Harry suffers a malady when it comes to luck. Whatever he puts his mind to he would achieve in the most bizarre and unexpected way. Whenever he starts to get bored something unexpected would happen. Wherever he starts to explore and gets lost he'd stumble on ancient relic, an artifact , a workshop or a portal to hell. The Potter luck curse is strong in those fics.


** Well, I did propose an idea a while back for Harry having a karma-overflow from a time-travel related glitch, which would result in his /gaining/ good karma whenever a good thing happened to him. Something to do with cosmic interest rates and overflow exploits.

Make A Wish, by a certain /someone/ has Harry innocently enjoying a trip around the world while all kinds of zany stuff happens in his wake. That one has Harry being fairly oblivious, mind.

**** Say what you want about the execution of his stories (which is often rather questionable), but I haven't yet found anyone that's better at One Dialogue, Two Conversations. Some that do political stories get close, though.

** I seem to remember linkffn(Sphere of Influence), the title of which may or may not be the fic I'm thinking of. It had Harry get hit with a whole lot of FF and basically any person within, like, five degrees of separation was affected by his luck. Good things happened to people with good intentions toward harry, and bad things happened to bad intentions.

  Go back to the beginning, that was the plan. Stop Voldemort on the cusp of becoming a dark lord, stop him before he created his first horcrux and change history before it could be written. That was the plan, only Harry made a mistake.
