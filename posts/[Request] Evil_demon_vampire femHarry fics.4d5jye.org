The only fic that comes to mind is Sanguine, in which fem!Harry was turned into a vampire pre-Hogwarts and has been living in the basement since.

The story begins around the time she recieves her Hogwarts letter I believe.

She's not especially evil, so it may not be what you're looking for.

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.

  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE
