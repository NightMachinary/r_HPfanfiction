I started writing HP fanfic between OOTP and HBP and I used to post to Checkmated (RIP). I stopped after a couple of years, but last year I realized that I enjoyed writing and that I missed my little 'Potterverse', so I decided to pick it up again.

All of the sites I used to know are gone, so I post now on AO3 because I write about adults doing adult things and they seemed the most open archive for that sort of thing.

I'd dabbled a bit in anime fan fiction in the 90s (Ranma 1/2) and I already knew that I was rubbish at finishing chaptered works, so with HP I stuck mostly to one-shots and I found that one idea often led to another, so all of my stories are connected somehow. This year however, I did finish California Dreamin', a 39-chapter Harry/Ginny work, so that's pretty cool.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/users/jenorama/pseuds/jenorama][You can find my works on AO3 under the pseudonym jenorama.]] I'm always open to reviews, constructive criticism or questions. I do tend to write stories as ideas come to me, so there isn't really a prescribed order to read them in, but if you are super interested, I can provide the secret decoder key. Be advised, since I started writing way before the end of the series, my work is non-canon compliant and AU.

I've made some good, long-lasting friends in the HP fandom and I enjoy working on my little corner of it. I hope you find something you like. :D
