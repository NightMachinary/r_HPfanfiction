** Dumbledore's army uses snape and the carrows as antagonists. Highly recomend it.

*** Thanks for pointing it out, but I'm already on the third book of that series! Actually, now that you mention it, that whole trilogy has different antagonists. Although the A Peccitas one is still a mystery.

**** I think were talking about different books here, because I am talking about Dumbledore's army and the year of darkness, and i think that is only one book? Are there more, or are you talking about a different fanfic?

***** No, it definitely has sequels. Book 1, of course, is Deathly Hallows from Neville's perspective as he leads the D.A.

Book 2, Sluagh, is set between the end of the war, and the epilogue. Neville, as an auror, is tracking down a serial killer in Ireland. That's the basic premise of the plot, but it gets much, much more complex the further into it you go.

Book 3, A Peccitas, is set after the end of Sluagh, but still before J.K's epilogue. Very political, and again with a complex plot. I can't really do it justice in a summery.

The author actually made trailers for them, come to think of it:
