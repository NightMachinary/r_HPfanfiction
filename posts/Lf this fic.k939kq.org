It's a time travel fic where after Harry is expelled at his trial he eventually becomes a sort of assassin, eventually him and his girlfriend/partner somehow piss off Hermione to the point she essentially magically suicide bombs them and some how sends them back in time. Some more details I just remembered, Harry's wand is somehow made into a rifle after being broken and once they're in the past they discover Dumbledore apparently went through a similar situation in his past


** Thank you!

  Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort, what was his payment? He got kicked out of the Wizarding world! They tried to bind his magic and it backfired, so what has Harry been doing the past 15 years since his escape from that world, and what happens when he gets a chance to take another trip around the bend? Time Travel Story, some bashing. Independant!Harry. OOC.
