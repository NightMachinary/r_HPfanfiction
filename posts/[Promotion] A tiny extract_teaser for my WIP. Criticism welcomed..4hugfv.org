Okay! Ummm...well I'm terrible with words, so I'll just plunge right in.

--------------

The boy was dreaming of waves breaking on the forbidding rocks when a sharp pain in his arm jolted him awake. He sat up, rubbing at his eyes, and glared down at the brownish-green band coiled around his upper arm.

"What was /that/ for?"

/Food/, the snake hissed, round black pupils unblinking. /Food./

"I've told you, Olive, I don't have any - "

/Hungry./ She wound her way higher up his arm and bumped his shoulder with her head, though thankfully she kept her mouth shut this time. /Food. Food?/

"Oh, all /right/," he huffed, swinging his legs over the side of the iron bedstead. The floorboards were rough beneath his bare feet as he padded over to the tiny window, pulling the snake from his arm and dropping it to the floor as he went. Ignoring her startled hiss, he closed his eyes, opened the window and /waited/, the summer breeze warm on -

/- wings flexed to rise on the wind, a panicked squawk bursting from his beak as he dove towards gray-brown roofs, towards -/

- his face as he reached out and caught the sparrow that flew into the room. His head felt as if someone had forced a brick through it. The urge to warble his displeasure rose, but... /No, that's silly, I'm not a bird./ He swayed on his feet, and Olive reared up in alarm.

"I'm fine, you silly creature," he snapped, and the bird in his hands jerked at the sound. It was rather pretty now that he looked at it, and he couldn't feel any really bony bits where he held it. So he ran a gentle hand up the striped back, then grabbed its neck and twisted.

The limp bundle fell to the floor in front of Olive, who bumped it with her snout. /Food? Food!/

"Yes, food."

He wiped his palms on his nightshirt and flopped down on the thin mattress, watching as Olive stretched her jaws bigger and bigger around the sparrow. /I'm not a bird. I am a boy and my name is Tom. I was inside a bird, but I'm not a bird. I am a boy and my name is.../

oOoOoOoOoOoOoOo

He was dreaming of waves breaking on the forbidding rocks when a sharp pain in his arm jolted him awake. Again.

"Oh for goodness' sake, Olive," he growled. "I just fed you!"

/Man,/ the snake hissed. /Strange man. Smells different./

Tom shot to his feet, ignoring the pain in his temples at the sudden movement. "Where?"

/Coming. Coming up./

"/What?/" he wailed. "Why didn't you /tell/ me earlier? No, don't answer that, we have no time, and don't you /dare/ bite me again."

Olive gave a coughing, rasping hiss, a sound he'd long since realized was one of amusement, and he scowled. She coiled herself tighter around his arm; even with her swollen belly, the grip of the scaly skin felt as comfortably weird as ever.

He needed to think.

One, his head still ached. Ow.

Two, someone was coming to his /room/ and he didn't know who and he didn't know /why/ and /what if -/

Three, Olive was going to vomit if she kept moving around.

"Right, first things first," he sighed, easing his fingers between her coils. "Let's get you somewhere you can /stay out of sight/. And sleep."

Under the bed was out of the question, even though she slept there a lot of the time. It was the first place anyone would look and it wasn't dark enough to hide her. That left the chair and the wardrobe, so...

He eyed the line-up of gray shirts and trousers; there was no time to change out of his nightshirt. Instead he pulled a cardboard box off the wardrobe's top shelf, stuffing a shirt over its contents before laying the restless snake down in it. "It should be warm enough in here for you."

There was a knock on the door, and the boy jumped. Grabbing his dressing gown from the wardrobe, he slammed it shut with a strangled "Be /quiet/". He'd just shoved his arms through the sleeves when the knob turned and the door opened.

Tom stared.

The man in the doorway was the strangest person he'd ever seen, with a mustache that covered the entire bottom half of his face. He was about Tom's own height, but made up for it by seeming at least as wide as he was tall. He wore robes like Father Duncan's. They were green, though, and Tom could spy a cravat, what looked like a waistcoat, and a thick silver chain that ran across his enormous belly.

His fingers twitched.

"Oh dear, oh dear, I didn't mean to startle you. And you not even dressed yet," the man gasped, holding a hand to his chest. "You must be Tom, I'm simply /enchanted/ to meet you, I've been looking forward to it." All the while he was trying to fit his bulk through the door, which creaked noisily in protest. Finally he gave a great sigh, and pulled a stick from the folds of his clothes.

"/Don't!/" Tom shrank back, stumbling backwards until his legs hit the bed. And then, dark blue eyes peeking up at the mustachioed face: "Are you a clergyman?"

If Tom had blinked, he would have missed the slight narrowing of the man's eyes; his voice was as jovial as ever when he spoke. "I've been accused of many things, my lad, but never of being a man of the cloth. Horace Slughorn, Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, at your service." As if to punctuate his words, he tapped on the lintel with his stick.

Tom /stared/.

Right before his eyes, the door /changed/, growing upwards and sideways, the splits and warps in the old wood smoothing themselves into a lovely pale grain that was quickly covered with polish. Mister - Professor? - Slughorn eased himself through the now twice as wide doorway, muttering "That's better" before bowing with a flourish and holding his hand out to Tom.

"Am I correct in my assumption that I'm speaking to Mr. Tom Gaunt?"

Tom looked at the outstretched hand. He looked at the door. He looked at the hand again.

"Who's Tom Gaunt?"

This is an interesting shift in perspectives, but I'm wondering what type of magic you're using here. Voldemort's ability to 'possess' someone isn't very well flesh out in the original series, so I'd be very interested to know what limitations you've imagined for this particular ability. Unless it has some hard checks-and-balances, it could quickly become overpowered, and hence, boring.

As [[/u/SniperGW]] has said, your dialogue tags are a bit complicated, but in some cases I think you've used them really well.

The frequent use of italics diminishes their impact. I'd suggest using them only when necessary, but this is more of a stylistic choice. You're using them to indicate when TMR speaks Parseltongue, but I think you've made it more complicated than it needs to be.

#+end_quote

This sentence might work better with a 'though' before the second clause unless I've misread your intention.

You've combined two things I really like: canon scenes from another person's perspective and an AU twist on the original material. Please let us know if you decide to develop the idea further as I think it would make for an interesting fic.

So /that's/ why my teachers kept underlining it! I was too lazy to ever actually look it up. Well fuck, apparently I owe twelve classes' worth of teachers an apology.

Oh boy, I get to talk about my half-baked magical theories!

Yeah, this is my interpretation of his possession ability. I lifted it almost wholesale from the Discworld series, where witches can 'Borrow' the minds of animals. At this point Tom has to deal with hours of existential crisis after just a few seconds of possession. With practice a wizard can hold onto their own mind for longer periods of time, but inevitably if they stay too long they start to lose themselves (the post-possession pain also lessens with practice, but never stops). It's why few wizards bother with this sort of magic; an Animagus transformation is the only real way to keep your mind indefinitely in an animal's body.

Human possession, on the other hand, is at once easier (much less risk of falling into goat-thinking patterns, for instance) and more difficult (the target has greater mental resistance, and can conceptualize and effectively fight against an unwanted intrusion into their minds). Possessing any animal that's self-aware raises similar problems, and a struggling mind might as well trap you as force you out. Again it's more dangerous than it's worth (unless you have a willing participant), and with the Imperius (for physical control) and Legilimens (to gain information) it's all but obsolete.

In fact, child Tom only discovers possession because he doesn't know those spells exist. His strong desire to control, to make them do what he wants, manifests in the more primitive magic (sort of like a magical child using telekinesis to lift objects because they don't know that a wand and a 'Wingardium Leviosa' is way easier). In this universe it's more a sign of his natural talent for mind-related magic than a full-fledged ability.

Wait, what? I know I overuse italics, but here I was using them to show emphasis and delineate thoughts. None of what Tom says is in Parseltongue. Or rather, he doesn't /realize/ he's speaking another language, so the narration has him speaking "English". Kind of like Harry's conversation with the snake in the zoo.

Looking at it, I probably should cut down on the italics or figure out some other way to show Parseltongue. Bold maybe? Though that might be a bit much...

Thanks :) It's a fully developed idea; I've almost completed the first arc of three, and I want to have at least that much done before I start posting chapters (so even if I run out of steam it can stand on its own).

Are you going to explain Aberforth's legal troubles with a goat this way? It could make for an amusing anecdote.

My mistake then. I thought you were using it to show the reader when TMR was speaking directly to Olive.

  Or rather, he doesn't realize he's speaking another language, so the narration has him speaking "English".

This makes a lot of sense to me as well.

  I'd say it's pretty good. I read pretty quickly so I would have missed spelling mistakes, but the grammar seems good to me. Sentence composition, word choice is okay
#+end_quote

Does it feel like the head of an eleven-year-old though? Tom was extremely smart for his age, so I probably could get away with him sounding more like a teenager, but the prose reads somewhat...adultish to me.

#+begin_quote
  Looking back I note a severe lack of "said", and while it didn't seem like an issue here, it could become one.
#+end_quote

True - a lot of the places where I'd have used a "said" I just dropped the speech tag entirely. I'll keep it in mind for longer bits of dialogue.

#+begin_quote
  I like your plot. I think this could have some potential, obviously depending on how you play it out. The base idea is solid, however.
#+end_quote

Awwwww, thanks :) There are really few fics set in the thirties and forties that aren't time travel.

** I'm a little disappointed in myself. I saw this post yesterday, but I had recently read someone's fanfic excerpt and it... made me avoid this for fear of not having anything good to say haha.

However, I very much enjoyed this! Any sort of syntax or composition errors have already been commented on, so there's not much that I have to say there. The only thing that really, really stopped the flow for me was

#+begin_quote
  "What?" he wailed. "Why didn't you tell me earlier? No, don't answer that, we have no time, and don't you dare bite me again."
#+end_quote

I don't know about the 'wailing', and part of me feels like it shouldn't jump out at me as much as it does, but I think I'm slightly justified as well? Unless you're going to give Tom a completely different persona from canon (which, it's not like it's set in stone; JK really left some leeway in regards to Riddle's character, I think), this just seems like an action that I could not associate with our poised and handsome Tom that we've come to know. As I said though, this is incredibly minor, it was just something that jumped out at me.

Tom is one of my favorite characters from HP, so this was an incredibly pleasant surprise! I really hope that you begin to post this soon, and if you do, I better get a heads up about it! :) I'd very much like to read it!
