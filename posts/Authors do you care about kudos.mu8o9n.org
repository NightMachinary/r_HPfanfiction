Just what the title says. I'm curious, since on [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] there was recently a post saying that they didn't see the point in following their kudos count.

Personally, I somewhat care?? Like, I appreciate kudos, but there's nothing quite like a comment or subscription (I've heard it comment notifications compared to drugs before and wow, I understand XD)


** Any recognition at all is just great. Like, it's that vain selfish pride of "yes, they liked my thing!" I'm so goddam needy I need consistent validation it's pathetic.

But kudos is nothing on a comment. Jesus, comments are like heroine! The fact someone took the time to write to me to tell me they liked a thing I did!?? Those people are the best, I love those people they just make my week!!

My real gripe-that-isnt-a-gripe is people who follow my stories on ffn. I only write oneshots, and I put "A Oneshot" in the description and still people follow it. Which, thank you, thank you but there's nothing more for you here! It's done, I don't have the brain to write a proper plot. Please don't follow it, it'll just dissapoint us both. Just favourite and comment and let's leave it there. I'm sorry I can't give you more!!! I know I'm a failure!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠

*** Sometimes I follow a one-shot or a story that's been completed to keep tabs on it, so to speak. Kind of like it's like my own personal Reading List so that I can easily find it via Alerts on FFN when I have time to sit down and read it.

****** I solved that my creating my own Community for the Harry Potter stories I read that were complete, and I liked well enough to add. Of course, my tastes have gotten more refined over the years, so some of the ones in there, I may not consider good enough to add these days, and have removed a few from there upon re-reading. This give me an easy access to all the stories I have enjoyed, plus as a bonus, is open to the public for others to peruse and hopefully find something they enjoy.

I have had my Community for about as long as I have been a member of fanfiction.net, for about 16 years now, and currently have 1126 stories and 93 subscribers. In contrast, my favourites stories list currently has 191 stories in it.

I've only posted a longfic so I can't quite empathize, but I can't imagine the mixture of emotions you must feel XD (also, that paragraph made me laugh and then wince - you're not a failure!!! oneshots are fics too!!!!!)

*** Since FFN has no "read later" list, I sometimes use the "follow" feature for that. That being said, I get your confusion about one-shots, especially when you get the mails for favourite and follow simultaneously (meaning that the person has probably read the oneshot already).

*** As a writer of only one-shots myself, I quite empathize with you regarding the follows. Then there are the ones that, on a story marked as One-Shot and complete, in the comment say they are awaiting the next chapter. This makes me feel a little guilty, as I know they will be waiting forever.

*** Haha I love leaving comments on fics! Tbh I think it's the least a reader can do, especially because the author's gone to all this trouble to write a fic /for free/, a detailed comment is like the bare minimum I can do.

My favourite thing is when an author responds to my comment, it makes me so happy! It feels like if a celebrity responded to an Instagram comment lol, I'm always starstruck. It basically guarantees that I'll write a comment for every subsequent update they make. If an author doesn't respond then that's totally fine but I'll generally assume that they're too busy to read the comments so I'll leave it at the one comment.

** I like getting kudos, and I suspect they're generally from people who wouldn't have commented anyway.

What I really love is getting comments that mention specific parts of my fic that they liked or thought was well done.

Seeing the notes people leave in bookmarks is also really nice, and I do enjoy seeing that people are either subscribed to me as an author or to one of my long fics.

** Comments actually make me incredibly anxious after a nasty situation with a troll, and I disabled them before joining the HP fandom, so I love receiving kudos. I think they encourage more people to read because they're public. I personally always sort by kudos and probably wouldn't read something with less than 100 unless it was recommended by someone I trust, so I definitely pay attention to my hits:kudos ratio and whatnot.

The best (if you don't have comments) are definitely subscriptions, but public bookmarks with flairs added are nice too. Overall, kudos are probably the least exciting type of response, but at least no one can troll me if I say something they disagree with.

**** Thank you for saying that ‚ù§Ô∏è! I think that when I finish my series and accompanying collection I might turn comments back on, but right now, I don't want anyone to ruin something that I enjoy writing so much. The last time I got trolled, it ruined the whole fandom for me, so I don't want to risk someone doing the same to Harry Potter before I've gotten all my ideas out.

*** This, more or less.

If a story gets kudos or not, I don't really care much.

If someone comments, and more importantly, comments more than '<3' or 'Next chapter!'? It's the best.

** Any recognition is cool. I get excited for all of it. Somehow my comment count has always exceeded any kudos or bookmarks i have gotten (I rarely get kudos), which i am grateful for because comments are actual feedback and i try to use them to make improvements or see how the story is being received. There also seems to be no correlation between people who leave kudos vs comments either, I have noticed. Like some of my most consistent commenters have never left kudos, and i have never gotten comments from a lot of users who have left kudos.

IDK, if you like a story, leave something on it. A good chapter can take a few hours to bang out. Authors put a lot of time into their fics dammit go make their week.

** I didn't used to, but these days while I still don't put much stock in specifically how much kudos I have collected, it's nice to get the emails that people are reading my stories and enjoying them.

But after being on that sub and seeing people brag about how they stingily save their kudos (like they cost money) for fics that would otherwise win literary prizes, I honestly don't put much stock in whether or not people choose to click that button (or how many comments people leave, especially with the sheer amount of ‚Äòupdate please' comments rude people leave lmao)

** My friend, when I make a post on reddit I became obsessed with the comments and keep checking in every 5 minutes to see what people thought of my post. I'm sure that with fanfics it would be even worse, I already posted some, and abandoned it precisely because of the lack of comments. Maybe I'm obsessed with knowing that people are enjoying what I do, especially in something I love, like writing, and I see no reason to continue if nobody likes it.

** Short answer: yes.

It's nice to know that somebody enjoyed your work. I might even go so far as to say I prefer them to comments, because apparently there's a perceived social obligation to reply to every comment and that can be tedious for the ones that are just a generic "liked the story" comment. Unless the reader has a question---I'm always happy to answer questions or expand on a plot point.

I honestly could not tell you whether I have any followers, though I suspect not. I don't actually care about followers. (I mean, I would get a warm fuzzy if I saw somebody followed me, but have no expectation of it and feel no need to try to get followers/subscribers.) I think one of my stories has been bookmarked by somebody, which was quite flattering. I sometimes look at the number of times a story has been read, more to see which stories have a higher read-count because I'm curious more for the ones I've never mentioned on Reddit versus the ones that (very) occasionally match a request.

I do, in fact, check out the profile of those who offer me kudos to see what they've written. I figure if they like my story, I might like theirs as well (if they have any).

** No. On AO3 I value comments and bookmarks, but for some reason I've just never felt like receiving kudos was worth paying attention to. Feels like a kind of consolation prize - "I liked your fic, but not enough to actually do something about it."
