This story takes place in a (VERY) Alternate Universe where, among other differences, Tom Riddle has yet to become a monster. It's... difficult to describe why this story is absolutely incredible without spoiling some rather significant plot elements, but I encourage people to give it a try. The chapters are relatively short, and I was drawn in completely by the 5th.

I don't typically like slash stories, and I even more typically despise attempts at HP/TMR. This was a purely accidental find when searching for dimension-hopping stories and a failure to properly read the story tags. I'm very happy I didn't read them, because the story very much pulled me in.


** I love the summary, the idea of Harry being a Divination professor is hilarious! Definitely will check it out, thank you!

Reminds me of a work where Tom's teaching DA planning to mold young minds and nothing goes according to plan.
