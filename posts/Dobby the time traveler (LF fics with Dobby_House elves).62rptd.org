A lot of works by nonjon have this side of house elves that was very amusing to watch; with Dobby the mischief maker, or even as in BajaB's Harry the Hufflepuff series, we have house elves in a very amusing role

Are there are other such fics? If not, take it as a prompt, maybe... What would happen if Dobby went back in time?

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.
