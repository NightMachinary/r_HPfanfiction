Just looking for some fics where Harry builds his power at a realistic rate or at least a reasonable one. I read a lot of good fics where he gets stronger incredibly fast. Would prefer if they are complete or at least regularly updated.

** Yes! I want a fic like this. So many stories show Harry learns about magic at age 8, and then at age 11 he can wandlessly and nonverbally summon Patroni.

*** But you don't understand, Dumbledore was blocking his core and cursing him to be less intelligent! But since he's so amazing he broke the bunds so now he's super duper smart and talented at everything now and a natural prodigy of mind magic which also means he's got a perfect memory! Also the goblins sucked out the Horcrux since Harry was so nice to them and it was draining his magic so he's even stronger and smarter now and he gained all the knowledge that the Horcrux had!

**** True, also he is obviously Lord of most of noble houses from wizarding world and because he's so amazing, he has a god-like understandment of politics at 11.
