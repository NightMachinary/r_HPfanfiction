Except, it's a sex thing... I'm not sure why I'm asking but I kinda want to see a fic like that.

Basically any fic where the whole Master of Death title is more of a fetish that Death has.


** ...You know, Death doing this whole convoluted gauntlet with the Hallows, just so she could find herself a husband would be fucking /hilarious/.

"Now I've finally made you, now I just have to court you!"

"Uh, I'm dating Ginny. And haven't you got this all backwards? Marriage is supposed to come after going out with someone."

"Really?" She blinked. "Oh well, oops? Oh, and don't worry about her," she said, gesturing vaguely into the distance. "It'll all work out in the end."

Harry paled.

** I don't know of any fics but consider: it's more of a mastery of /le petite mort/ and he's /very/ popular with the witches

*** I'd honestly rather have death be female, and I'd love it if Harry is female too. Sapphic love stories are the best ;)
