I mean, I'm sure we're all tired of the Killing Curse to the face in canon and the overdone, clich√® of the Goblins doing it.

My personal favorite is in the wonderfully fun linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter)

The spirit of Usagi Tsukino possesses Harry (who fell into a Cursed spring containing her spirit thanks to a minor crossover of Ranma 1/2) as he's being strangled into submission and burns it out of him as she attacks the guy.

The Unspeakables say Snape died due to Legimencing Harry and his Sould touching leftover basilisk venom. Dumbledore never quite trusted Harry anymore, as he didn't dare read Harrys mind after that... Voldemort made eye contact and Legimenced Harry like he clearly did to any who met his eyes (the paranoid bastard) and his spectre got dissolved too... the Horcruxes are found hundreds of years afterwards by some historians now they rest in the Lovegood vaults.

** Ignoring the quality of the fic overall, I liked what happened to the horcrux in Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart.

In his third year when Harry has those close encounters with Dementors, he nearly has his soul sucked out. That destabilizes his soul and the horcrux enough that there's an internal battle for control which he wins, leading to Harry's soul assimilating the horcrux.

I like it because I'm a fan of powerful Harry and it seems to be one of the most canon-compliant ways of giving Harry a boost. I feel like it makes sense that a soul fragment accidentally attached to a person can't just happily sit there forever. Dementors having a weird effect on the horcrux seems completely reasonable to me.

Also, I think it works perfectly with the self-fulfilling prophecy theme that was going on. The Dark Lord will mark him as his equal.

Personally, I'd probably prefer for it to happen when Umbridge sends the Dementors after him. Or in a non-canon event. Just so that Harry is a bit older.
