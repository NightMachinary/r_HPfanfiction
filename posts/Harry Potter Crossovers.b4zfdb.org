** If you are a LOTR+Silmarillion fan, then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]] is a must read. A long read. Harry gets summoned to Middle Earth by the Witch King.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10884162/1/Incendio]] In this one Harry is actually a dragon. Actually kinda enjoyed it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8250381/1/Forging-A-King]] A long read. Set in year 5. Umbridge tries to get rid of Harry by magicking him into a painting that is a secret doorway to Middle Earth. Was actually pretty interesting, althought, I wouldn't read it again.

From elf!Harry the only one I kinda liked was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12092681/1/The-Harbinger-s-Song]] in which Harry has somehow been 'connected' to Arda trought dreams ever since he was a child and he was always meant to go there. It starts out well, but when he actually gets to Arda - kinda meh.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8182529/1/Prince-of-Death]] Of all the PJ crossover with HP, imo, this is one of the better ones - Harry is son of Hades (the Peverells (and so also Potters) were his descendants), and wizarding world is actually kinda aware of half-bloods and it gives an interesting plot point. Has a sequel.

​

None of them are romance.

  Harry as an elfling on Arda. A new world, a new life, a new chance. A new hope to finally find that which he had been searching for for such a long time. Can he truly start afresh, or are the shadows of his past too lasting to shake off?
