The only specification is that has to be Harry who is the BWL and somehow everyone thinks it's his sibling/Neville..

Longer fics much appreciated (:

I've read a lot of this genre and I even started my own (maybe abandoned?) fic a while ago ðŸ˜…


** Linkffn(antithesis)

Brilliantly well written, interesting and really pulling throughout the whole thing.

BUT: and here comes a really big but. This story is so fucking depressing. Like, really really fucking depressing. I binge-read the whole thing and nearly wanted to jump off the nearest curb.

It's been a while since I read it, so I can't recall everything, aside from the aforementioned disclaimer. But I remember it as a really well written fan fic.

******** Was still a really good fic and I respect you for it.

There are only a few writers, who would manage to paint such a grim yet utterly realistic picture. There was no overtly ridiculous happy end from out of nowhere but rather a more realistic approach to what really came across as a serious topic.

I /hate/ that I read it, yet somehow I am /happy/ that I did.

********* When I started writing it, it wasn't ever intended to blow up like it did. That's reflected in the earlier chapters, particularly the first third of the story. When it started to get so much traffic and people left such heartwarming comments, it inspired me to write...better? I actually started to listen to podcasts and watch lectures from writers, trying to incorporate better style and ideas. I never really imagined so many people would relate to it, and don't misunderstand me I can rationally tell that the story is horrifically dark. I thought that by dragging the main character through hell and back, various people and readers who experienced tiny life circumstances could find themselves in the story. That meant that the protagonist would have to experience everything. I often wish I wrote the first portion better, or thought about where it was going more realistically. I'm incredibly proud of the story, but I'm more proud and happy with the people who manage to finish reading it and are happy they did so. Reading the comments on the last chapter are one of the more meaningful moments in my life- fan fiction be damned :P

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
