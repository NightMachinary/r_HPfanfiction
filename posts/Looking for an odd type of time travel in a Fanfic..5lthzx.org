I'm looking for a type of time travel where time is linear but where the future doesn't exist yet, and therefore is ever-changing. Where if you travel to the past then it becomes your present and your future isn't written. Beyond a curtain point. Almost similar to the way it works in the TV series 'continuum'. Just because the future you came from existed when you were there, doesn't necessarily mean it will exist when time passes again. Just because your in the past as an adult doesn't necessarily mean the past you will live to be a teenager, and if they die before coming back, you won't be affected. It's not alternate reality, it's a byproduct of the fact that the timeline is linear though in ends in the present, and the moment one person travels back the future doesn't exist anymore so no one else can. I want that in Harry Potter. Say, there's an 8 hour buffer or whatever, in which the future is still present, because magic is predicting it, natural divination, I'll call it. And if you go farther back then that, then the future beyond your present buffer no longer exists, and you can change it as you will. But you don't, because your afraid of a paradox. Weather or not one will actually happen is irrelevant to the magical world. I want a fanfic where some Muggleborn, say, hermione, desides to try it and see what happens. It doesn't necessarily have to be a good fic, anything will do.


** Tbh thats not exactly an odd type of time travel. If you go back in the past, you have technically already wiped clean the future as you know it because you have created a ripple in the past simply by showing up. Its one of the main reasons that folks dont think time travel backwards is possible.

Unless I am completely misunderstanding what you are getting at...

Regardless, i think you may need to explain yourself further to get any recommendations beyond typical time travel fics (if there are even any).

*** Yeah I've read a lot of time travel and I'm also not sure I understand. To clarify, you want a fic where an adult can go back to before they were born and say kill their parents but without dying/never existing themselves? I've not read one like that, but in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]] there are multiverses of futures which is similar. Great fic regardless. Linkffn(8581093)

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
