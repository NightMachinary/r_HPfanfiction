I was rewatching Crimes of Grindelwald and it suddenly popped into my head what would the WW be like if Grindelwald actually won?


** I am only going by the books here, but I am guessing that he'd /want/ to implement the sort of magical meritocracy that fics that whitewash Voldemort tend to ascribe to Voldemort, and have wizards rule over Muggles as benevolent (as he sees it) dictators.

However, I would question whether he'd be able to make it work. Even supposing that he manages to abolish the Statute of Secrecy and subjugate the Muggles, he is going to need massive numbers of wizards to govern them, and very few wizards are going to be interested in that.

Now, when you have a tiny number of people trying to govern a huge number of people without any [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political][legitimacy (in the Max Weber sense of the word)]]), they will inevitably turn to terror and collective punishment as the only way to maintain control.

So, I expect that the whole thing will end up in a very colonial setup: a meritocracy for the wizards, a reign of terror for the Muggles.

Muggleborns might be better off in terms of discrimination, but Grindelwald strikes me as the sort to take them from their families and give them the best possible upbringing (as he understands it).

And, that's not even getting into the Dark Arts side of things.

So, my prediction is that Grindelwald will start with much better and more egalitarian intentions than Voldemort, but end up almost as bad as Voldemort but affecting even more people.
