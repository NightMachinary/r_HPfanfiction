I am so incredibly tired of the "its a war! We need to fight back and take out the death eaters! 'Stupify!'" Trope. Big speaches, proper build up, finally fighting back, and then the good guys starts throwing stunners -_-" So any fics with proper spells for war? Magical land mines, siege spells, hunting death eaters, laying traps, using the taboo against the snatchers etc. Simply fics where Harry and co. Fights back properly and doesn't take prisoners that'll just get broken out of prison again


** As far as I remember there were some pretty epic magic battles in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] linkffn(12511998)

Not quite the same timeline, and no real war, but certainly some intense battles without any of the typical standard spells. :)

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** But has an awful character development. I mean, Harry goes from Canon to "fuck it, I'll kill them all" in a few chapters and without any additional trauma happening other than his short death. That's what I do dislike about these grey!Harry fics. No 15 year old would suddenly decide to become a murderer like it doesn't mean anything. Even Draco Malfoy, the shittiest of shit stains didn't have it in him to kill Dumbledore's when his parents' lives were at stake.

Now, if the writers build up to this new, pragmatic Harry, it could work but I've rarely seen any good examples of that, sadly.

Granted that the deconstructed setting did look to be well thought-out, it missed the spirit of the original setting too much (e.g. muggletech being too OP, power levels being too distinct and concrete things, etc).
