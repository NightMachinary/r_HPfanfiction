I don't think I am the only one but I tend to not really read Harry x Ginny (I think the reason is because I never really like her as a character) but I am wondering if there are really good fanfics where that is the pairing.

** Yellow Submarine is a post-war teacher Harry fic that has some dark tones to it with Ginny (as a 7th year student) dealing with rape and Harry not knowing exactly what to do, but wanting to help her out while also dealing with his own issues.

It's my #1 favorite fic of all time, especially when it comes to romance which in my opinion is VERY rarely well done.

It encapsulates the (realistic) obscene sexuality of most guys around this age that the vast majority of girl authors don't do well at all or seem to even understand (it's actually written by a girl, but she's very brilliant).

Smut authors (who are mostly horny wish fulfillment males) go way too far on the other end of the spectrum, making males degenerate sex addicts.

It's extremely relatable if you're a guy especially, since I feel like masculinity gets kind of warped by most authors but she does a brilliant job and makes a very likeable Harry.

It also has an actual plot line that's decent, a ton of character growth and development and you get really emotionally involved in the story.

In media, you see a lot of rape, and abuse, and talking down from, and "oh my old lady hur hur", and the heros GF just cheering him on, etc, just generally women being secondary in relationships. In slash - both partners are men, and equal.

******** Lol well the statistics refute that too pretty harshly too, though.

Pornhub actually released a lot of their data about it. Women's top 3 categories were lesbian, gay, andddd then bondage (women being tied up, used and abused) - in that order.

I feel like I'm just being overly disagreeable here but I don't think that your reasoning is accurate either. Women almost universally prefer to be submissive.

At the end of the day our fantasies don't often reflect our genuine desires for real life, so I don't mind what women like at all but it is still curious to me.

** Probably. You'll find at least a few good fics for pretty much every pairing.

My favorite short one is Compromise: A Love Story linkao3(1181280). I love Ginny's characterization in there and how she and Harry interact with each other. I think Harry/Ginny fics can get too sappy sometimes, to the point where it doesn't really feel like them. The best ones are the fics that keep in mind Harry and Ginny are both stubborn, quick-tempered, and a bit mean.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

*** How much R/Hr is a dealbreaker for you? For example, if in an H/G fic, there is literally only a line or a paragraph saying something along the lines of "R/Hr are married and here are their children Rose and Hugo, now I'll shut up about R/Hr for good and focus exclusively on H/G", would you still not read it? Because I think that in H/G fics, there is a spectrum from "there is 0 R/Hr" to "R/Hr go on constant double dates with H/G".

**** I have read good Ron/Hermione pairings, but all of them ended up in a smutty threesome with a permanent triad to follow.

As for a normal R/Hr relationship, my biggest issue with them is that by the end of book seven, IMO they are really incompatible due to the baggage from their past. During the books, Harry is clueless about girls, but Ron can get downright insulting. For the relationship to be believable, they need to grow up and take things slowly (same applies for pretty much any postwar fic, but that's an entire different can of worms). And by take it slow, I mean not getting married straight after the eighth year but live together for several years afterwards.

And perhaps my biggest gripe with Ron/Hermione is it ending with the "big happy Weasley family" trope, which I utterly despise. My opinion of Molly Weasley is as low as it can get because she claims to care about Harry, is angry about the Dursleys, and yet never does anything about it despite knowing by CoS. As someone with personal experience with getting abused, that is simply unforgivable and if she has any place in Harry's life, I'm instantly out. Ron/Hermione usually has her in, so it's a red flag. If Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione do their own thing, I'd be in.

Ron/Hermione also leads to all of them working in the Ministry, something I find rather boring and really unfitting for Harry, who just won a war. He really should do something besides hunting dark wizards. Any of the trio working for the organisation who was busy running their own Final Solution a few months ago without some Stalin level of purge is rather is implausible.

R/Hr usually is a symptom of a lot of things I don't like and therefore serves as red flag to filter stories. Also, I feel like that pairing has a lot of baggage, which needs to be addressed on screen. I think that the pairing can work, but I've yet to see a decent one outside of smut oneshots.

***** I like Molly. My opinion of her does tend to swing around a bit, but I'll be honest - she suffers from bad writing. JK needed Harry to stay with the Dursleys, but she didn't want them to be anything more than maybe two chapters at the start of the books, and a few lines at the end. And thus, all adults who otherwise care about Harry quite a lot, suddenly become unable to do anything more than send a hamper if food, and glare at them.

Also - what could she do about the Dursleys? Nothing. Just because she has magic and they are Muggles, doesn't give her the right to override them as guardians. Ask anyone who had a neglected friend growing up; their parents could do no more than Molly could.

Who do I have a problem with? Arthur. He was a shit dad who ducked out whenever shit got tough. Of course Molly was not the best mum - she had to be a dad, too. Arthur was a foolish man who broke his own laws, and refused to parent his kids. He, and his whole family, had the potential to be in serious shit over that car, but of course, Molly is the one who gets censured for scolding her son - obviously acceptable in that society.

Let's not even mention his setting up the floo without the homeowner's permission. Or even an invitation.

And Harry was an important political figure, with no other relatives, in a tiny society. The scandal that would explode would be huge, and Harry would become a foster kid who'd end up anywhere.

Not to mention the blood protection that eventually saved his life for a third time. Leaving him there definitely worked out for the best.

***** See, I agree with the “big happy Weasley family” trope being annoying, but instead of it being Ron/Hermione, it's Harry/Ginny that bothers me. In the story I'm writing right now (different from the H/G one), I'm about to have Ron tell Harry, “You don't have to marry my sister for you to be a part of my family. You already are.”

As for Molly, both she and Lupin have a redemption in my H/G story. When they find out the blood protection is rendered useless (Voldemort has Harry's blood so he can waltz in any time he wants), they give Dumbledore the metaphorical finger and immediately remove Harry from the Dursley residence. Otherwise she's barely featured in my other stories.

  Set after the COS. See how Harry Potter's story will change, with Ginny being Sorted into Slytherin. A Ginny who is not going to be a victim, and a Harry who realises those closest to him may not have his best interests at heart. Major Molly/Ron/Dumbledore bashing, some Hermione bashing.
