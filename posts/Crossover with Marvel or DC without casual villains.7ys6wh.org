** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] is the best one I've read. It seems to be abandoned though.

Your first point doesn't really apply here, as he is in another universe. Hopping between the universes might sound cliche and pointless, but it was further explained later in the story, which made my only real criticism go away.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

** Nimbus Llewelyn's Child of the Storm and it's sequel Ghosts of the Past might be what you're looking for.

** Isn't M rated but it's rather interesting (imo). It's not really a Harry Potter / Avengers crossover. It's a Draco Malfoy / Avengers Crossover.

  After the war, Draco Malfoy was given a choice.But what no one knew was that the Veil is more complicated than Severus Snape, more enigmatic than Albus Dumbledore, and as unpredictable as those Weasley Twins.Now Draco is trapped amidst horrifyingly advanced muggles, without a wand or a prayer. All he has are his wits, a surfeit of trust issues, scars and tattoos he'd rather not explain, and a raging case of xenophobia.Then the aliens attack...
