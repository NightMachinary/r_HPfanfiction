Hey, I am searching for a fic where Sirius is helping/teaching harry or just being a father figure to him.\\
I would like Sirius to still be in Azkaban till Harry arives at Hogwarts but if there is a good fic where it is different I won't mind.

** Linkffn(Staring From Scratch by JadeSullivan)

Linkao3(A Life More Ordinary by orphan_account)

These are two of my favorites! Beware that Starting From Scratch does contain two scenes of corporal punishment (Chapters 1 and 13), however, so if that's upsetting then I'd steer clear of that one.

Also, A Life More Ordinary is not complete and the author has seemingly abandoned all her accounts with no word on wither or not she has any intention of returning. Still, I think the fic is worth a read, even if it is incomplete. It's a lovely fic and the relationship between Harry and Sirius is great.

Also note! A Life More Ordinary does have Sirius/Remus in it but the main focus is the parental/guardian relationship between Sirius, Remus, and Harry.

*** Why would someone write a fic where Sirius abuses Harry. That's super messed up. And I figured most people who still believed in spare the rod spoil the child in 2016 don't read Harry Potter since anything featuring witchcraft is viewed as devil worshiping to them.

**** I'd hardly classify a few smacks to the bum abuse but some people have that mindset and that's fine, don't read the fic then. Second of all, it's not everyone's cup of tea. It's not particularly mine either but it's only two quick scenes and it's not the focal point of the fic--which makes it easy to overlook.

And you'd be surprised at the amount of CP you will find in mentoring fics (especially Snape ones...). But it upsets some people, which is totally understandable, hence the warning I gave the original poster.
