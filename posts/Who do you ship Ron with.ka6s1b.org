I find Hermione is shippable with almost anyone, but if we were to pretend she ended up with someone who wasn't Ron, who's the best person to ship Ron with?


** Lavender Brown.

She treated him with respect and liked him for who he was. Never insulted him.

*** Yeah, but Ron doesn't treat Lavender with the respect she deserves, and it is a disservice to her character to let her end up with him.

Ron dates her to get a response from Hermione, was ashamed of her tokens of love, did like the necking, and didn't have the decency to dump her properly and instead froze her out. Who gets back together with a guy like that?

*** I hate her portrait in HBP and the lack of conflict between Ron and Hermione. We get so much of jealous Ron in GoF (that Yule Ball was going on far too long) because he didn't recognize her as a girl and paid the price, but Hermione doesn't have to question why Ron would like Lavender and date her.

Would've loved if it was more serious in canon, so Hermione would be challenged in her approach of belittling Ron instead of admiring him like Lavender does.

** I personally ship Ron/Lavender over Ron/Hermione. I don't think Ron and Hermione are good for each other: Hermione kept complaining at Ron's idiosyncracies, and there are times where Ron's jealousy really hurts her. I don't think they're bad people at all, I just don't think they're good for each other.

The only major issue Lavender seemed to have is that she didn't seem to believe herself to have a chance with him, she was intimidated by Hermione and very clingy as a result. Given canon, she's clearly not wrong, but I think that if she were to be able to get over it after it's obvious that Ron/Hermione wont end up working out, she could work well with him.

*** I completely agree 100%! I never saw Lavender as someone Ron would be happy with (mainly because she was so clingy and eager to please that it was definitely a turn off for him) but after you explained it like that, it's obvious she was probably that was because she was threatened by Hermione.

And yeah, I also agree about Ron and Hermione not being a good match for each other for exactly those reasons!

** I see Ron being paired with Parvati. My headcanon is that they became friends when he was dating Lavender and as Lavender was becoming more and more over the top, he talked more to Parvati, initially as an excuse not to engage with Lavender, but he found that he actually really liked talking to her.

As with Lavender, Parvati is similarly positive, bubbly and relationship focused, but because Lavender has such a big personality, Parvati is used to being the more quiet and patient one of the two.

Because both Ron and Parvati are used to focusing more on their friends' issues instead of theirs, they're both able to give the other the attention in the relationship to be more themselves than they can be with their friends.

*** Ron couldn't stop dreaming of that night. He felt fear. He felt terror. But there was a strong stirring inside of him that he could not put a name to.

Since Fred and George turned his teddy into a spider, he had an almost pathological fear of them. The clicking their mouths made. The hairy feet. The scuttling sound as they traversed the floor. His reaction had always been to run away, and run away far.

Yet, something called to him. And as his second year ended - the basilisk slayed, Lockhart exposed, Ginnie saved - he found himself sneaking out of Gryffindor tower, headed to the deep forest, following the stirrings of his soul.

The acromantula clearing was just as he remembered it, dark trees full of silken webs, yet bereft of the many eyes of Aragog's offspring. The old spider, large as a small elephant, lay alone in the middle of the clearing, his long hairy legs spread out.

"You came back, friend of Hagrid. I knew that you, in particular, would." The spider said, his voice deep and hypnotic.

"Do not worry, we are alone. When my children sensed you entering the forest, I ordered them to leave the clearing. You are probably wondering why you are here, friend of Hagrid." Aragog said.

"My name is Ron. Um. Ronald Weasley." Ron said. His legs trembling as he faced the ancient arachnid.

"Ah. Ronald. Now I know your name. Just as I know your taste." The large spider said, his fangs clicking in the air. "The origins of the Acromantula are lost to wizards. They only know that we were magically bred. But we remember, oh yes we do. All acromantula are descended from the great Shelob, and her mate - the wizard Bilbo."

Ron's jaw dropped. "But... That's..."

"Impossible? Not really. Look at Hagrid, the offspring of a giantess and a human. Love knows no boundaries, Ronald Weasley. And magic finds a way. You feel it, don't you. Your magic is calling out to mine." Aragog intoned. "It has been many moons since Mosag, my wife, passed away. I have been lonely since. Come closer, Ronald Weasley..."

Ron couldn't resist. His feet dragged him to the large spider, and his hands reached out to caress the spider's face.

** The Harry Potter X Ronald Weasley fanfics will always hold a special place in my heart. Otherwise I am always fond of the ships where Ron gets to be his best self with his partner which means equality within the relationship and respect.

Too often is whomever Ron gets to date in a fic a cardboard character that 1) Henpecks Ron the way Arthur is in the worst fics out there; 2) Is a baby incubator for the continuation of the Weasley clan, as if that is all there is to Ronald's entire existence; 3) Is Ron's cumdump (m/f), because a distracted Ron is the best for whatever is really important to the plot.

Tldr; Idgf, as long as Ronald's character & ship gets some well meant and sincere tlc.

Ron x Pansy - see below

Ron x Luna - Canon Ron finds Luna amusing and charming, and I feel like Luna could feel the same for him.

Pansy requires a little bit more creativity since we know so little of her in canon, but not like that's ever stopped any HP fan fic author. :) But in general, the fanon characterizations of Pansy I usually like is that she's a little bossy and uppity, but secretly charmed by Ron's Griffindor-ness and by how down to earth the Weasleys are.

** Blaise Zabini. Okay I almost exclusively read m/m but hear me out.

People love the enemies to lovers trope and the easiest pairing for that would be Draco/Ron (which i like dgmw) but I find that their relationship has way too much tension, years of hatred and bullying and envy (Draco jealous of Ron's family, Ron jealous of Draco's money) and way too may fights and insults and slurs. And on top of that a centuries long family feud (this is not Romeo & Juliette).

Blaise on the other hand...

Rich, attractive, intelligent, calm, takes no shit, loving mother (I assume), has not attacked or insulted Ron or his family, never an explicit supporter of Voldemort or his followers, Italian (so no real roots in British politics even though he was present for the war).

He is the counterbalance to everything Ron is or may need.

Ron is hot-headed, rash, and sometimes insensitive.

Anything he does though - Blaise would easily take and then calmly and coolly inform him how what he did/said was wrong so that he may apologize.

But Ron is also a strategist, a loyal and amazing friend (who has had issues with jealousy he was a child ffs!), who is intelligent and has street smarts though he may act otherwise.

He was the 'normal' in the trio, the one that counterbalanced Hermione's overthinking, and Harrys emotional response to problems. He has a brain and knows how to use it and use it well.

Blaise's mother is a black widow. He's met many men and probably knows who is worth is time and who isn't. After a lifetime of step-father after step-father, he would welcome Ron's loyalty and commitment. Blaise is from the higher echelons so he would be attracted to intelligence, to loyalty, to a warm and caring person (Molly heavily influenced Ron I swear), to looks (no one can convince me that Ron isn't tall, lean, well muscled from quidditch, and a complete knockout).

And when they get together and are dragged into the political arenas of the rich and the ruthless? Well...no one is a better strategist then Ron.

** I think Ron/Lavender would work as a couple if, unlike in canon, neither of them is trying to make Hermione jealous.

In canon, Ron is basically /just/ trying to make Hermione jealous by dating Lavender. Lavender, in turn, sees Ron looking at Hermione and starts staking her claim - which basically becomes a feedback-loop of clinginess that spirals into the end of the relationship.

If Ron /didn't/ try to make Hermione jealous, I think Lavender would be much more subdued in turn - she'd still make a few public passes at him to "stake her claim", but not the overly-clingy behaviour we see in canon.

Finally he just kinda told her he didn't care who she was he liked her and that wasn't gana change (as long as she wasn't pansy XD) so she made her wand light up and he was of course shocked not because it was Milly but because she was a Slytherin and he was a Weasley.

** Probably an oddball pairing but Ron x Draco actually. Granted it's an easy paring to fill the “enemies to lovers” trope, but there's a decent amount of well written stories with this pairing.

I sort of imagine their pairing to be like CC and Niles from “The Nanny” tv series. The sniping and insults was all flirting, lol.

** Yes, I generally ship Romione (many many authors, including [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbiran]], has shown it is possible for both of them to grow up to make it possible). However, my alternative would be Ron/Lavender, when after Ron's poisoning both of them decide to take the relationship seriously and they start to work on it seriously. However, I haven't found good story like that.

** I am really a Ron/Hermione fan. I think they balance each other. They also went trough hell together and know each other in their lowest points. And in a mature relationship that is very important. Relationships need to work at the low points of live not at the high points. It is easy to love each other in good times, it is harder to do the same in bad times.

If Ron wouldn't end up with Hermione I can see him with any of the Quidditch-girls:\\
Ron and Cho Chang - at least after Hogwarts/the war. Why? They are both Quidditch-fanatics and both lost someone they loved to the war. Sure, the first boyfriend and a brother are not nearly on the same level, but they could come to an understanding of each other.

Ron and Katie Bell - both were in the Quidditch-Team, both were in Dumbledores Armee and supported Harry during year 5 when most people didn't.

Ron and Demelza - Demelza has the least character of the three. But she is a Quidditchplayer so they have at least that in common. You could literally write her as any OC you need.
