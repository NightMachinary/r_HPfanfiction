I always wondered what would happen if Harry became friends with the other kids before he became friends with Ron and Hermione.

Normally in these people take out Ron and put in Draco. But, I don't want him being friends with Ron, Hermione or Draco (At least not at first, if it can be helped, better if not at all).

What if he became friends with Susan and Hannah? Or Neville and I don't know, Blaise or Theo.

Or instead of sticking to the trio aspect, what if he only finds one real friends, or four? What if he meets, I don't know; Cedric earlier or something and becomes friends with the older students faster, then the ones his own age?

Maybe someone that has a crappy childhood, and realizes that there was something up with Harry's childhood?

Maybe they talk Harry into telling someone about his scar suddenly hurting whenever Quirrel looks at him and other such things? Who knows?

No super smart or superpowerful Harry, Harry smarter or more powerful then he was in canon is fine, but make it believable

No Harem Harry

No Seer Luna

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

What would it be like if Hermione had been killed in her first year because of the troll? Or other such happenings going on. It'd just be interesting to me to see things happen differently, just because Harry has a different set or group or just one friend.

No Weasley or Dumbledore bashing if possible


** I think there are lots of stories or there like that. Most of them will have Harry in Slytherin though. I don't have many on hand because I like H/Hr but there is Linkffn(Black Luminary)

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

** All three of these are all pretty good reads and have Harry with a friendship group who aren't the usual crew.

In Hogwarts Battle School, Harry is Slytherin, best friends with Blaise and Tracey, and never befriends Ron. He has an initial rivalry with Hermione but eventually forms a partnership with her where they are more colleagues working on a project, rather than friends.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]]

In the Art of Self-Fashioning, Harry's a Ravenclaw who's really only friends with Terry Boot for much of the work, although later (much later) he's friends with Neville. They don't form a trio though.

linkao3(The Art of Self-Fashioning)

In Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, Harry, a Ravenclaw, doesn't make any friends at Hogwarts. He eventually makes friends with an OC and Victor Krum.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.
