Like showing that nearly being smashed to a pulp by a troll is nothing easy to get over with 11years.

Or nearly being killed by a professor and killing said professor is very traumatising and what can happen if not talked about with a therapist.

Or being seen as the evil in person by other students and having to fear being attacked by an unknown monster is not good for someone's self-esteem and character grow.

Or that realizing a grown man slept in the same bed as you is a horrifying and stressful thing.

I think you know what I mean


** I like to think that it's more realistic for some people to struggle with traumatic events and for some people to get over them quickly. People can develop PTSD or at the very least struggle when they see people get hurt or die. I've never struggled with that, and I've seen some brutal things. Some people would.

Mental health is an important thing, and woe be to anyone who claims it isn't real or doesn't deserve to be treated. The treatment of those with mental illness in the justice system is ironically criminal. But it's important to remember that it does not happen to everyone.

I think canon does a good job with it. Harry definitely had PTSD post-GOF. He had nightmares, many of the symptoms, and a lot of people have written articles on the topic. But not everyone with traumatic psychological disorder suddenly turns into someone incapable of functioning. Harry developed PTSD, but not everyone who went through something traumatic did; I think canon is all the more realistic for it.

Edit: My flair means physically resilient by the way, not mentally so.

** An Interesting topic to be sure but o e that is pretty hard to do in a believable way. I say this because my cousin was in the French foreign legion for 5 years and has both seen and done crazy stuff and is relatively ok. In fact he said it's the best year's of his life but some of the guys he served with have had literal mental breakdowns.

** The First Day by little0bird is dealing with everything from grief to trauma and survivor's guilt. It's making me feel my own feels. It's dealing with some really raw emotions in a realistic way.

*** I second this. Wonderful writing and realistic characters with the impact of the war setting in as everyone tries to move on.

** I know that JKR sucks at the whole mental aspect. Harry alone should have been completely different person when he first showed up at Hogwarts with his childhood.

I headcanon it as the pumpkin juice being spiked with calming potions and whatnot.

Ron "almost" gets knifed in third year, you think he's horrified? Fuck no, he's using it as bragging rights and gossip material.

Troll in the dungeons? Oh no, let's go back to our common room in the dungeons.

Nobody thinks to call the DMLE or anybody equipped to deal with anything that happens that requires them. The closest thing to any type of authority showing up was second year with the Basilisk and that was because Lucius set it up.

It's plotholes like this that make openings for bashing.

TL;DR: School doesn't act like a school, must be drugged to the gills.

** I've read a couple fics that address the impact of the war, and they're mostly "8th year" fics.

** This recent [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i417og/ginnys_second_year/][thread]] has some links for stories about Ginny recovering from the diary possession.

** I don't have any fics in mind, but Brandon Sanderon's works are almost all fantasy genre, and mental health is a huge factor with many of his main characters. In fact, The Stormlight Archives (his epic fantasy series) has 2main characters with mental illness. 1 with major depressive disorder, and one with disassociative personality disorder. I also viewed Elantris as an allegory for how those with depression are ignored and shuttered away from the rest of society. (Though I did ask him about that at a signing, and he said it was just a zombie story LOL.)
