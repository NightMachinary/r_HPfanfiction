Do these stories exist? Plenty of stories have him going back in his own body but what about him going back into someone else's?


** I know of one fic, but I don't remember its name.

- Harry possesses James' body at times
- [[/spoiler][The start is right when Sirius tried to lure Snape into Remus' shack at a full moon.]]
- [[/spoiler][Harry prevents that]]
- [[/spoiler][Harry thinks his father is a prick (at least at times)]]
- [[/spoiler][Pettigrew is beaten up at the knowledge that he'll betray James, Harry consoles him]]
- [[/spoiler][James' wand doesn't work perfectly for Harry, I think]]

I know Freshenstein is interested in that fic, so if you remember it, please link it :)

  They say there are many things a wizard shouldn't do while ridiculously drunk; flying, apparition, and testing unknown spells just to name a few. But as the BWL just learned, listening to one of your equally as drunk godfather's 'brilliant ideas' is another one of the things you just shouldn't do. DISCONTINUED
