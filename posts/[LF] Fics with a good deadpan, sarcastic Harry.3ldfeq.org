Hi, all! I'm in the planning stages of writing a HP fic, and one of the things I want to have in it is a great deadpan, sarcastic Harry. I really think JK Rowling paints Harry as smart-aleck figure (though not as often as I'd like) and when an author allows Harry to shine like that I love it. So, can you guys recommend me fic where the author writes Harry in that way, so I can get a feel for the dialogue? The book shows Harry having one-liners here and there, but it doesn't happen often and typically not in extended conversations. Thanks!


** Harry in linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) might be a bit extreme for you, but I loved him.

*** I see this story recommended a lot. Is it worth my while reading it, if I've never read any of the Dresden Files stuff?

**** Oh yes! Even better if you haven't read DF, IMO, actually! That's how I started. Any important DF reference is well explained.

It really is a must-read, one of the best series out there for sure!

**** It might take a good 8~ or so chapters for you to get more into it. It's much heaver on Dresden early on when Harry has like no want magic or anything else going for him, but I'd say it gets way better once Harry moves to Chicago or so.

**** It really grows on you as you read on. I actually quit in the middle because of Harry being a little shit, but I came back to it as I realized that it was strangely addictive and fun to read.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  My take on Harry's first year starting with him getting his letters. Add a lot of sarcasm, stir, and serve cold.
