Heyo I'm looking for some warrior mage harry fics. I prefer fics that take place from Harry's perspective long (100k+ words) and as always romance subplots are appreciated but not necessary. Thank you for your time.


** Well Wind Shear by Chilord has Harry mowing through Deatheaters.

Linkffn(12511998)

Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence has Harry being pretty Brutal.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** Well, apparently I'm just recommending this fic all over the place today, but if you want a War Mage Harry fic, you've got to read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7888873/chapters/18019618?view_adult=true][The Mirror of Maybe by MidnightBlue]]. It's an abandoned WIP, which was started in 2002. It's the fic that hooked me on fanfic.
