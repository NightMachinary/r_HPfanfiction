Like in the last few months. Figured the hype for the newest season might have inspired new fics.

Also, is there any (recent or not) fic where Harry/whoever just obliterates the White Walkers?


** [Swords and Roses] follows Harry after being born to the Tyrells as he travels Essos, conquers his own patch of land and consolidates his power on both continents as he shatters the board upon which the Game of Thrones is played.

[Hadrian Lannister Lion of the rock] is a completed story about Harry being the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, who has to deal with backstabbing whoremongers, evil sisters and psychotic nephews.

Both are by Sage1998 on FF.net and are phenomenal.

*** So I looked at these... are they actually Harry Potter crossovers, or are they just ASOIAF stories with an OC main character who we are told is Harry but has no real connection to Harry Potter?

From the brief look I took, it didn't look like Harry was going to be a wizard or have any memory of his life as Harry Potter or anything like that.

**** Meh, i dont know if i agree. When I read it, I found Harry to be the kind of OP character that is boring. He literally has no difficulties as far as I remember, and that's quite boring. Though if you're not looking for something great, but something decent only, I think it fits.

  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.

**** Then you're out of luck. The only ones I've ever found to be actually complete for this crossover are usually terrible. Spelling mistakes that make first graders look good, godlike!Harry that sneezes every single problem away; stuff like that.

The good ones try to be more GoT instead of HP, and that means they usually just make Harry born in that universe, and are abandoned before anything actually happens because they quickly learn people reading FF don't want 10 year old Harry to watch mercenaries that his grandfather hired rape his 9 year old friends. (I read a story like this. Abandoned, of coure.)

**** So did I, but I'm actually sort of into this story. I got really bored a few weeks ago and actually read it. I skipped a few chapters to avoid the setup, and I'm still required to read over some of the shit, but it's mostly an engaging story. It's probably just that I'm a sucker for empire/city builder type stories.

** The Blue Winter Rose (linkffn(11941470)) is the best one I know of that's somewhat recent. It's not really anything to write home about imo, but it's better than the usual insert-Harry-into-Westeros fics. The Black Prince also updated recently despite previously being abandoned but it's old and you probably knew about it already.

  After he sacrificed himself to save the lives of many, Harry Potter was ready for the Afterlife. However, what he didn't expect was for Death to give him another chance to live in another world. Reborn as the only daughter of Rickard Stark, Harry grew up as Lyanna Stark; the girl who would become the catalyst for the wars to come.

  It only takes a single disharmonious element to throw off the entire composition. Fifty years before Robert Baratheon ascends the Iron Throne, Westeros receives one hell of a bad musician. Harry never did care about any player other than himself.
