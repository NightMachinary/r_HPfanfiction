Hi everyone!

I would like some help to find two fanfic:

1- Where Hermione is the only magical surviving in England after the war. She goes to Hogwards and discovers that the muggleborns are still born, and she "becomes" the future teacher and instructor of these children, who will be the future of England . I think it's a one-shot fanfic.

2- Years after the war, Hermione is killed in an attack, and her death drives Harry crazy, and consequently, to become a Dark Lord, who in his crazy mind, wants to create the perfect world that Hermione always dream. With this new danger, Narcissa goes to the past, at the time when they were looking for the Horcrux to give tips to Hermione, about her dead. In this story, Narcissa and Hermione are a romantic couple.

Thanks!


** Searched Narcissa/Hermione and sorted by time travel and found this. Skimming it looks like it could be the second fic mentioned:\\

  Who would have ever guessed that Hermione's death would be the key to ending a war and not Harry's? Narcissa never would have until her present was taken over by a Dark Lord worse than Voldemort. She travels back to save a young woman that holds the key to a brighter future. Canon until DH - not an epilogue complaint possible rated M. (Narsissa and Hermione paring) I dont own HP.
