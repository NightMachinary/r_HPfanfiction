Are there any fics in which Harry agrees that muggleborn are changing the Wizarding World too much, but that V went about it in a totally wrong way.

Like, he listens to Tom's sales pitch, nods and says, "I don't care. You killed my mother." Or some such shit and kills him?

Edit: I started wondering this because I read a fic a long time ago, which I remembered again, in which Harry finds that Dumbledore was manipulative, a lot. Something about "The real Dark Lord" and Harry suddenly becomes chummy with Tommy. He even convinced Sirius to do the same. That just sounded wrong to me and I ended up closing the tab.

I mean, I get Dumbledore orchestrated your parents' death, but Voldemort is still, ya know, Evil? He still killed your parents and tried to kill you.


** I've been looking for a fic like this, where Harry is also slightly dark, but hates Voldemort as much as he does Dumbledore and carves his own path to the future sort to speak. There aren't enough of these fics and too many of the ones where he goes dark and is like, oh yeah I don't mind that my parents are dead at your hands, obviously Wormtail was to blame and not you, who raised the wand and killed them. Traitors might be worse than enemies but that doesn't mean your enemy isn't bad.

***** You know how in the movies Hermione is shown erasing the memories of her parents just right before she's supposed to leave for Bill's wedding.

Well the theory said that she already knew that a war was coming. After Harry brings Cedric's body back, Hermione knows that Voldemort is really back, and there'll be a war. Even if their dumb minister might not agree with it.

So she erases her parents memories, and sends them away.

Proof?

Hermione spent the summer before 5th year in Grimmauld place. There's no mention of her parents. They just said, it's safer for her there.

The summer before 6th year is spent with the Weasely's, I think. I don't remember the book and I can't find the post where it's all posted. But again, no mention of her parents.

And finally, summer before 7th year, Hermione is with Weasely's for Bill's wedding with Fleur.

It fucked me up man, really fucked me up. I might read the books again to confirm it, but she didn't spend the summer before her 4th year with her parents either. It was with the Weasely's. But I didn't find any reason why she would think a war is coming that early.

****** The main problem with that theory is that the Ministry would have traced her performing that magic, unless someone from the Order did it instead (which would be suspicious as all hell). It was never brought up until DH, and that's the only time she would have been able to perform magic without getting caught.

Another thing is that it was never said that she was /only/ with the Weasleys or at Grimmauld for the entire summer, just that she arrived before Harry did. And while I think that Hermione could survive on her own for a few weeks or more during the summer before staying at those places, I feel like someone would have brought it up if they always saw her alone and never getting picked up by her parents at the end of the year. This is weaker than the other argument, but it still raises some questions. I also don't remember if Hermione's parents are ever mentioned in the later books or not. I think that she does mention them, but I'd have to check.

Overall I think it's much more likely that JKR just couldn't be bothered to write about Muggle parents in a magic world. She already has the Weasleys and the Order, there's not much Hermione's parents could do to affect the plot, hell they don't even have names, so she just left them out of the story.
