Hi so i'm looking for this hp fanfiction. the only things i remember about it was

Harry was coming back from Gringotts with a bag full of money(i think he was running away i'm not sure) and diagon alley use to be a magical wishing well. and harry makes a subconscious wish and ends up traveling back in time. i think it showed everyone's prospective after harry disappered where they where searching for him but hermione found out that harry time traveled because of diagon alley.
