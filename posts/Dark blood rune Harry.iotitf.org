I remember there was this one story on fanfiction that basically had Harry find out about blood magic and instantly went power hungry and gained as much knowledge as he could about it and other dark magic like necromancy and soul magic. But what I can remember the most about this story is that the sorting Hat is a villain and that all the magical items have their own personality, and that Harry basically turns the dursleys i to his soul slaves as well as make his own undead children servants and that he didn't want to be a dark lord "because they just get themselves killed" and would rather just be a dark wizard.


** I remember reading that one myself, I don't remember the name but more plot points include that the blood magic in question was based entirely out of runes that he had his own language for and how Harry had a never ending journal that he wrote all his blood spells into with a special fountain pen, furthermore he contacted some council of “true mages” (or something to that effect) through ollivander and declared himself master of blood magic
