So basically, people adore firearms. They think that guns can solve most wizarding problems. Why is this? A bullet has very little kinetic energy so a simple protego would be able to absorb massive amount of firepower. Guns need lots of skill to use. Guns are easy to predict. But I mean, why would you need to shoot bullets at 600rpm when you can shoot a aguamenti a stream of water, curse it to be.... on fire or something duro it so it turns into thousands of droplets of stone, and then oppugno them towards a target to produce hundreds of cursed-fire droplets of stone coming from all directions?


** As a first you fall into the same mistake as many fics, I feel. Kinetic Energy doesn't matter. Physics doesn't matter, because magic is outside of physics. Protego protects against harm. A bullet does harm. Ergo, Protego protects from the bullet.

Guns do have their use. For one, they are incredibly accurate. While yes, we know that some wizards have good aim with their wand, gun-sights are perfectly accurate. Sniper rifles would be a devastating thing to have in wizarding combat. Furthermore, you shoot 600 piercing hexes per minute. Especially during battles like the one at Hogwarts, using heavy muggle weaponry would have been very effective to put the attackers on the defensive. Also, guns don't need an incantation, wand movement or anything like that. They need ammo and a finger to pull the trigger. The travel time of a bullet is way faster than a spell. We know that spells are slow enough to be deflected, shielded,... If you fire a bullet at a reasonable range, nobody has the time to react - /nobody/.

Bottomline would be that a wand in the right, a gun in the left hand would be a interesting combination. Both have their strength and their weakness. If brought into the fight in HP, a gun would at the very least surprise your opponent enough for you to get an advantage.

What you describe, I doubt anyone beneath the level of the most powerful magic users could do that. I try to come up with more fights, but the only one I remember with such a variety of spells would be the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort in the Ministry. Transfiguration and Charms with such precision, during a fight, has got to take decades of training if we compare it to what is normally done.

The only issue with that will be aiming. Either they'll most likely miss by shooting the gun in their off-hand, or they'll probably miss the targets of most their spells with their off-hand.

This can be compensated for by taking a shotgun (20 gauge, maybe, to limit the recoil) and sawing that bastard off, and carving the stock into an easy to hold handle.

EDIT: Also sights are only accurate if the gun has been sighted in (adjusting the sights so that the correct target [bulls-eye] is hit). And that is only true at the range to which it is sighted in. Closer and farther you'll need to adjust.

**** A shotgun would be devestating in the range wherein most magic fights are fought. However, it'll be difficult for said person to reload that weapon. I'm not a gun expert here, but reloading a semi-automatic shotgun/double barrel while holding a wand/casting isn't condusive to survival in a spell fight. Diving for cover puts one on the defensive and that person will lose ground.

Maybe it's feasible for an opening shot but in a prolonged fight? I doubt it.

Also if a user is using a gun with sights is it a given wherein that person is trained/have background knowledge about it?

***** With a sawed off, say, double barrel, you could easily have multiple on you.

As for the sights, all guns (with the caveat that I've only used a shotgun twice in my life, so I'm not actually sure about them) come with sights. The issue is that they can get misaligned, so at minimum you should check them once a year. Plus the setting that works well for say, 75 yards isn't accurate at 100 yards because of drop. Same issue occurs with scopes. The gun I use hunting is a .30-.30 lever action. Not the most accurate gun for longer shots, meant for hunting in the woods and not in the fields. Probably should have the scope set to 75 yards, but we have ours set to 100. Every year before the season comes around we generally need to check how well the scope is sighted in.

**** That may all be true, but the fact remains that in fights during canon, wizards basically used slow moving bullets with effects on them. The only time, and I repeat myself here, that we saw people use something else in a fight was Dumbledores and Voldemorts duel in the Ministry.

Maybe wizards are just incredibly uncreative in a combat situation. Maybe chaining spells is harder than we think. But the observable evidence in canon would point towards some explanation that would tell us why your proposal is not done in actual wizard combat.

If you want to incorporate your fast-paced transfiguration and charmswork in a fic, go for it. Its a better concept for fights than canon. But if you're asking why guns would make sense within the observable canon, I keep standing to my statement.

On another note, combining the use of firearms with the use of magic has serious potential: apparate around the battlefield, picking off enemies or attacking your duel opponent from unexpected angles, or imbue your bullets with magic appropriate for the situation.

** Here's the thing about guns

1. Excepting small calibers (.22 for example) they are /loud/. Pretty sure my hearing is far worse than it should be from all those years of hunting.

2. Muzzle flash occurs, so if it is any level of not-bright out, they'll be a sudden source of unexpected /light/

3. With rifles, incredible range. The Shield Charm is useful only if A) you can cast it (please see the old shield hat argument) and b) if you know you need to use it.

4. Bullets are incredibly fast. A wizard who can cast a shield charm might not always be able to cast one before a piece of lead goes through vital portions of their anatomy.

5. The Wizarding community is incredibly ignorant of Muggle customs and items.

So guns are really great if you're going up against a wizard/witch who can't use a shield charm and can't apparate (please remember it is said in the books that some can't/don't like to), and for the ones who do know the shield charm, they probably won't know what the hell a gun is. But once wizards know, they'll still be useful for the long range when it comes to killing, and in close range they're incredibly distracting.

** So everybody's like guns are faster than hexes and in close combat they could be so and so.

But the only idea that has some merit is the sniper rifle one.

Humans can only focus on one thing at a time, so if you choose to use a weapon in a magical fight, at least while you're actually using the weapon you cannot use your magic. In close fight your opponent can see your weapon and then you have the issue of not what he can do to defend himself against your gun, but what you can do to defend yourself from your opponent while using your gun. And what your opponent can do to your gun. It's a gamble not worth taking, imo.

Plus, another point against that argument. In close ranged fights a knife is actually much more effective than a gun. Maybe wizards are not familiar with muggle guns, but surely they have knives. And in all the history of wizardry you want to tell me no one thought of using knives in combat? That's because they're either not effective or the effort you would put in mitigating all the weak spots you'd have is not worth it.

As for sniper rifles, I actually think that would work once or twice, as long as they don't know what they're dealing with. Once they figure it out? I don't know, but remember there's magic that lets them know your position as soon as you say a certain word out loud, a spell that affected a whole country, so who knows what they can come up with to deal with that.

Edit: despite this, I can see it being done correctly by a very strong author. Say, Frank Herbert strong. So if Herbert would return from the dead and instead of writing the 7th Dune novel he'd write HP fanfiction, and he would use this trope, something good could come out of it. But for anyone else it would be impossible.

** Because guns have far better range, rate of fire, and can be aimed far more easily than spells. In the time you cast one spell, dozens of bullets can be on their way to you.

How well they do against magic shields has never been shown in canon, so that's all up to the author.

But I have to point out that your proposed course of action is something no canon wizard has ever been seen doing. And it would likely take a transfiguration expert with a lot of experience to achieve. For the average wizard who has trouble casting a shield spell (which is canon - the Ministry bought shield hats from WWW for that reason), a gun could be a great tool - in the typical magical combat, even an untrained user can be effective with one. Not everyone is Dumbledore, after all.

And yet, if they actually took the time to learn how to use a gun properly in combat, they could learn how to cast effectively instead.

  Gaiety Ollivander, the nineteen year old great-granddaughter of Garrick Ollivander, opened her wooden case, revealing her carving tools, her original wand, and a branding iron with vials of liquid gold and liquid silver. She took out the knives and set them on the table then laid out the branding iron and the vials, pulling a scant ounce of each into modern syringes.

  The blank of ivy wood and a dragon heartstring---both very common ingredients---awaited her first foray into a complete wand instead of just assembly line runic work. She took the half inch sickle blade and began carving the blank down to a rough heptagonal shape, twisting it so that its eleven inch length would have three full rotations.

  She winced as she cut herself and scowled, flicking the blood away, then used a muggle styptic pen to close the wound---magic near a raw wand was the best way to destroy one---and went back to carving, slower. I know better, she thought to herself angrily.

  With the rough shape done, she placed the wand into the holding stand and took out the flensing, coring, and obsidian flake blades.

  The obsidian flake blade was the first to be used, the only magical item used to make a wand. She ran it carefully along the wood, following the strongest looking grain from tip to tip, making sure she didn't go too deep.

  Sure she had done it correctly, she loaded the heartstring into the coring knife and inserted it, pressing it past the depth of the obsidian blade's cut, twisting. The blade spun, cutting the core cavity and expelling it out of the secondary cavity of the knife. She moved it, just a hair, and spun it again.

  Four hours later, she had finished coring the wand and began moving it backwards, watching the heartstring slowly bond to the wand wood.

  The core installed, Gaiety took the syringe of silver and carefully lined the cut with it, watching the magic of the obsidian blade left behind in the grain of the wood use the magical potential of the silver to bond it back together.

  "Well done."

  She jumped in fright and turned to look at her great-grandfather, breathing hard, a little unnerved by his intensity. "Gramps!"

  "Carry on."

  She took out the last piece to complete the raw wand, a small dragon pearl---actually a piece of talon fashioned into a orb using the dragon's own scales---and carefully inserted it into the cavity at the tip of the wand, carefully undoing the metal string she had used to compress the pearl, allowing it to expand and fit into the cavity she had carved for it. While her grandfather and great-grandfather eschewed decorative accents, she felt that each of her wands required them.

  She spent the rest of the day doing the final carving, using the flensing blade, taking almost dust sized particles with each pass until it was completed, the wood dust and the other ones she would shred and compact later, mixing with the silver to finish the wand.

  ~•~

  Garrick Ollivander watched his youngest descendant leave his shop then picked up the raw wand, twirling it, checking for the closing. He had been a little surprised she didn't use three biscuits to strengthen the seam but the curving she had been forced to follow would have made them harder to install and only a reinforcement of a natural strengthening. "Exceeds Expectations, my dear," he said then placed the wand back in the carving slot. "She will cut and burn you well, little one. When she's finished with you, a golden lacquer will adorn you and then, should you pass muster, you will be the first of her wands to join my wands awaiting young witches and wizards, ready to use you or your siblings in their education magicks. Someday you may do great things, terrible things, or some mixture of both. Choose your companion well little one," he whispered, taking his hand away. He made a mental note to remind her to speak to the wands she crafted as she did so. The wand looked for a moment as if it was about to tremble as he walked away.

  ~•~

  Gaiety studied the documents her great-grandfather had given her. She was to carve the blanks to roughly fit the dimensions of metal objects she didn't understand at all but would do as asked. The dimensions would test her skills since they would occasionally be thinner than a ring of growth and have cavities and holes yet would still have to hold a core and the multi piece wand design of two of the units would require her to create numerous prototypes. And were of a wood type wholly unsuitable for most wands.

  She turned to see her father busy carving a staff for a customer and decided to just start. Failures will teach me just as much as asking for help, she decided.

  ~•~

  Ollivander nodded. She had finished the single piece one and it looked correct. He took out a pair of calipers and other measuring devices then checked each dimension, seeing she had done it all near flawlessly. The only mar on its finish was a runic heart with an x through it. Her maker's mark on a small plane of the wood that was too high. It would be carved off carefully so he could add the runes after installing the liquified core. The design specifically required no maker's mark due to its technical illegality.

  ~•~

  Three months had passed and finally Gaiety had finished the carvings to Ollivander's approval and was off for a few weeks with her friends to Australia.

  While she was gone, Ollivander closed the shop and began the process of carving war runes on the three receivers. Designed to make a wand obey any master, it would cripple the wands for anything beyond destructive magic. The last time he had done this, he had conjured some songbirds and ended up with mutilated inferi birds, disgusting little avians that had made the elderly man who had lived and survived through two wars vomit. But if the wand decides to choose the user, even if designed for combat only, Garrick mused.

  Over a week he carved, burnt, and embellished with gold arrays of runes that covered every millimeter of the receiver, so small he had to use a seven array lens system to make the runes large enough to see.

  On the eighth day he carefully mixed ironwood dust and liquified silver then began painting it onto the wand, filling in the runes, making the receiver look solid once more. When it was complete and covered with seven layers of a diamond hard ebon lacquer, he tried to cast a reducto against a conjured block of wood. A miasma of charcoal was all that was left.

  "You've been crafted for a purpose," he told the wand. "For a specific user. He plans to use you in new and fairly exciting ways. Please, be a good wand for him. While he has his wand already, you are more than an experimental design. The care required to make you, he could have taken any wand and bonded it to the device you're shaped to be a part of. To make a whole from many pieces. So, understand, you're not just an experiment, you're a part of a whole. You and your two brethren will likely be his protectors." He was thoughtful for a moment. "I know you can't know who Harry Potter is but you're to be his. His companions. His allies. His tools. Be excellent tools for him, prove that you're what he needs." Garrick knew they weren't just experiments.

  The wand/receiver trembled in his hand, growing warmer, then stopped.

  He placed the wand carefully on the stand then remeasured and sanded off some of the lacquer in a few of the holes. With the first done, he started on the second. Gaiety's runic arrays were too simple so those would add another day or two to the crafting of the next day.

*** Shield charms do block physical objects, so yes. But it's not just time. Fred and George enchanted clothes to be permanently shielded. Raising and sighting a gun on a dynamic target is difficult and takes time to get a good hit without good luck, so it's quite probable that a protego can be thrown up in less time than an accurate bullet can go out. (Note to self. Enchant self aiming guns ASAP)

#+begin_quote
  "The question of why a wizard would need a sword, though often asked, is easily answered. In the days before the International Statute of Secrecy, when wizards mingled freely with Muggles, they would use swords to defend themselves just as often as wands. Indeed, it was considered unsporting to use a wand against a Muggle sword (which is not to say it was never done). Many gifted wizards were also accomplished duellists in the conventional sense, Gryffindor among them.

  There have been many enchanted swords in folklore. The Sword of Nuadu, part of the four legendary treasures of Tuatha Dé Danann, was invincible when drawn. Gryffindor's sword owes something to the legend of Excalibur, the sword of King Arthur, which in some legends must be drawn from a stone by the rightful king. The idea of fitness to carry the sword is echoed in the sword of Gryffindor's return to worthy members of its true owner's house."

So the use of firearms is just an evolution of a martial wizard.

** Guns are stupid because magic. If wizards can make whole buildings jump out of the way of a vehicle moving at ludicrous speeds I'm pretty sure an enchantment to make bullets swerve and avoid them would be nothing. And it's not like wizards are completely ignorant of the concept of non-magical ranged weaponry, so I'm sure they've thought of something already.

Also the firearms knowledge on display itt is laughably bad.
