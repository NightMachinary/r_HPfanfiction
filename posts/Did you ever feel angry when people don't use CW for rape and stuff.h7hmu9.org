I just hate it and it makes me angry, especially if they present this rape in a positive light. I hate it! It is not just fun and stuff, but so freaking harmful to people!

I wish there were functions to block fics from ever shown up in your search list again.


** I don't think I've ever run across any fanfics where CWs didn't appear for that. I'm not saying they don't exist, of course, just that I've been lucky enough to avoid it.

**** Ah. Just about every fanfic I've read involving sexual assault averted it with doors being blasted off hinges and attempted perpetrators being thrown into various solid objects, such as tables, walls...

The only one I can think of where this didn't happen was when the victim was more confused than traumatized by the event.

***** It's not quite rare that male rape, especially in older fics, is played for laughs. Or treated as a just punishment. Like the fic where Snape gets raped multiple times - by dragons and by a tentacle monster. It's not graphic, the actual act is cut, but the story leaves no doubt what happened.

******* That wasn't as explicit as say Sanpe saying: "oh, bugger me - no, wait, I didn't mean it literally! No!"

And [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/7c/2e/657c2e726a6f3c8be16dc6933bcf7c07.jpg][here's]] an alternate (though not entirely serious) explanation for what happened to Umbridge:

******** RE: The "bugger me" scene, if you're thinking of the same fanfic I am, i hope you also chuckled at the thought. Btw, love your TWT story.

****** The fanfic I read mostly had the victim viewing the experience as very confusing, embarrassing, but otherwise pleasant.

** It's why I use ao3, and why I have user scripts. I can permanently blacklist tags, works, or authors. I even have it set up to ignore fics with 30+ tags, because I hate seeing drabble collections with 60 different fandoms in it! But even without user scripts, I almost never have a problem with people not tagging things, especially important things like rape, on ao3. I never use ffn.net, unless I'm clicking through from a reddit recommendation, now!

** No. I've seen some pretty fucked up shit in real life, so coming across something fucked up in fiction doesn't bother me. If it's not something I feel like reading then I'll just stop reading it.

I can understand someone more sensitive to this kind of stuff being upset, so I'm not against it. It just doesn't bother me at all, which is what you asked about.

*** Sorry shouldn't have used a shortcut without explaining, but what the others said, Content Warning for things that are often triggers for really sensitive traumas, like rape, abuse, things that you really want to avoid or at least know what you get into
