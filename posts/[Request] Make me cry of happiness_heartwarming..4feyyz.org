Chances are that if it made you teary-eyed or complain about the dust in the room it'll make me cry.

Completed fics and no-slash preferred.

#+begin_quote
  Argus Filch has always been a grumpy, lonely man. After his retirement, his life is mostly quiet and blessedly free of having to clean an entire castle without magic. One morning, though, everything changes, and without the gentle, non-judgmental love that has kept him sane for so many years, will he ever find a reason to smile again?
