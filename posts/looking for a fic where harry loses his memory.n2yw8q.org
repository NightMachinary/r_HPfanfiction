  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** I'll have to look up the name but I know one where Harry loses his memory, befriends Snape & gets a Honeybadger animagus form. He doesn't get resorted but he does eat Voldemort
