So part of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g82d7k/stories_that_have_hermione_taken_down_a_peg_or/folgh85?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][this comment]] made me think about the intrinsic unfairness of quidditch as it was portrayed in books. About the Firebolt issue - when Harry and Ron didn't want to have Firebolt checked:

#+begin_quote
  [...] the justification for such is nothing more worthwhile than to gain an unfair advantage at sport.
#+end_quote

And honestly, I understand H&R but putting aside everything else about this situation and focusing only on the quoted part - there is an aspect of quidditch that allows a major, unfair advantage over others if you're rich enough.

Harry has Nimbus 2000, then he has Firebolt. The entire Slytherin team has Nimbuses 2001.

Then there's the rest of the school on their Cleansweeps. There might be others who have their own brooms but I assume not every team member can afford themselves a fancy-schmancy racing broom.

And the difference is striking - it's like there was a race and a contestant on a scooter stood beside a contestant in a fairly new model of sports car beside a contestant in the newest F1 racing car. *And there there's Carl on his rollerblades.*

So I think that any official matches or those matches that are supposed to be taken seriously should have a requirement that players of both teams should have the same model of broom ideally or at least brooms with similar enough properties.


** How is it different from the real world? You don't see many people complaining that there are no standardised cars in Formula 1, or standardised horses in the steeplechase. That's unfortunately how the world works.

*** there may not be standardisation, but the concept of leagues in sports are a thing. they ensure that you're only competing with people/teams who are actually similar to you.

Hogwarts quidditch has no such limitations, which results in the equivalent of F1 cars competing against soap box racers.

*** The standards and regulations for F1 cars are actually very tight, the teams cant really go creating the fastest possible designs because of the constraints. It's not a standardized car but they end up very similar. F1 isnt a great comparison either because all the teams that are in it are all fairly well funded. Just nitpicking a little there. But in terms of quidditch, it is very much like real life sports where it's not based solely on the individual. Barring genetics, 2 people from different economic backgrounds would have a very different time getting on in sports where the baseline cost to play is expensive like hockey or bobsleigh or something. You have to pay for equipment and then on top of that ice time/slide time?(whatever its called). The less well off person could maybe never even have a shot at trying it, even if with the same rich person support they could may well excel even more than the person who has access. Comparing that to low baseline cost sports like running or soccer, everyone has to work just as hard for what they are able to achieve, barring politics and nepotism of course. Once at higher levels though, sponsorships and the likes happen and the baseline for monetary support gets reestablished so if you make it that far on money alone, and arent good, you get dropped, because you have never had to work hard for something ever. It kinda makes me wonder if Harry would have had any success at higher levels of quidditch, sure at Hogwarts he worked hard and had success, but he did always have the best broom, so many people on his side. Once you get to higher levels every one has that, they are all using the very best gear. Which also makes me wonder about the quidditch league itself. Like how does it work, how is recruiting done? How long do people play on average before they retire? How big is the player pool in Britain? I feel like it would not be terribly hard to get into compared to soccer or some other large player pool sport. I cant be bothered to do the math on it but I'm making the non researched assumption that. Anyways sorry, I meant to just respond to your comment but ended up writing more than i thought i would

** Even when the entire Slytherin team has Nimbus 2001s they don't beat Gryffindor. I'm inclined to think that talent and skill trumps a better broom most days. After all, being the fastest isn't everything in quidditch.

**** I guess it might. Consider, though, that Ron, Fred, George and Ginny all make the Gryffindor quidditch team. None of them have what you would call the best brooms - they rely on their skill. When Harry catches the remembrall, he's on an old school broom.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that your team isn't better than the players on it.

***** It is fortunate that they are good. What I'm asking is to imagine this theoretical scenario where Gryffindor and Slytherin are comparable but Slytherin has the best brooms out there.

Turning the argument about skill around - Gryffindor won because, as luck would have it, Slytherin sucks.

** A really interesting idea in a fic I recently read (can't remember the name) was that different quidditch positions require different strengths on a broom and that the idea of just buying the newest/fastest broom rather than the one best fit for your position is actually a hindrance. For example, seekers who have to fly super fast to catch the snitch benefit most from fast brooms, while keepers who need quick maneuverability don't.

*** This is an interesting idea, however from what I inferred from canon - the newer the broom, better the overall spectrum of utilities it has. If I remember correctly, Firebolt seemed to have both speed and maneuverability and more.

But this is definitely something to consider if one were to write a more Quidditch-focused story.

** You might like this snippet, not posted yet, from one of my works in progress:

Dearest Mother and Father,

I hope this letter finds you well. I have an idea, which I hope you will agree is a good one. Today, a Gryffindor boy was taunting me, claiming that the credit for my apparent quidditch prowess was actually due to my high-quality broom (for which I thank you again.) I laughed at this suggestion, and challenged him to a one-on-one snitch snatch, using school brooms from the shed. I offered him first choice of course. He accepted. I then suffered an embarrassing defeat, as I was quite unused to the very poor quality of the school's brooms. I could barely steer it. I have an increased admiration for the students who can fly them at all.

After congratulating the Gryffindor for his victory and thanking him for the lesson, I sunk into a deeper level of embarrassment when I realized the repercussions. The pride I had formerly felt at the Slytherin team's victories was, I now realize, quite unearned. Slytherin, mainly containing students from the generally wealthy old wizarding families like ours, has a team with the best brooms in the school. The other houses, which accept students from less ambitious families, as well as muggleborns, have teams with much lower-quality brooms. Now that I think of it, I don't see why the school allows competitions between teams flying such mismatched brooms. The only fair competition would be on brooms of equal quality, so the only variable is the students' skill.

I feel that the school brooms need to be replaced with some of a quality as good as mine. There should be fourteen, so two teams can play a game. I believe there should be a rule that only the official school brooms may be used for games. They should be inspected before every game to ensure that they are evenly matched, and randomly assigned, so neither side has an unfair advantage. Could you suggest this at the next meeting of the Board of Governors?

Of course, paying for these brooms is the issue. Perhaps Grandmother could organize a fundraiser, as she did for the penmanship tutors for the muggleborn students. Or this may be too much to ask, but I believe our family could just buy them outright and donate them. They could then be known as the Riddle brooms, which would burnish our name, not that our name needs any help.

Please write back soon, telling me what you think of this idea. I assured the Gryffindor that my father would hear of this, so we are both eagerly awaiting your reply.

Sincerely, Your loving son, Tom Riddle III

His signature was ornamented with so many flourishes and swoops, even Tom thought it was ostentatious, but such extravagance was forgivable in a teenager.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** In international matches(Quidditch World Cup) it came across as the teams could choose what brooms they used, but they all opted for Firebolts. If they want they could have chosen slower brooms that allowed them finer movement maybe? And even the weasleys has their own brooms, they were just old and second/third/fourth hand

*** But that's what I'm talking about - they can choose whatever they want, which could be e.g. a specially commissioned new broom with all the best features that's not even available yet or maybe won't be at all.

In Hogwart's matches - how is it fair that one team has newest generation brooms while the other has brooms older than their grandparents? There should be a uniformity in my opinion.

I'm all for Harry being out there and crushing his opponents into the grass, but still.

Brooms are such a major, game-changing, so to say, in-game factor, is what I'm saying.

**** It's a school match. The school wouldn't be able to afford to do that and we see that the school brooms are really bad. Oliver Wood panicked when he thought Harry might have to play on one in a match. But as we see in canon, the broom clearly isn't everything, otherwise Slytherin would win every game. They don't. The Gryffindors have a more skilled team.

I see where you are coming from though
