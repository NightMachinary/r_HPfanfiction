  "It's just a book. No harm ever came from reading a book." Unfortunately, for one Hermione Granger, this wouldn't prove to be exactly true. An AU of "Chamber of Secrets", in which Hermione receives the Diary instead of Ginny. HG POV.

**** Okay, this made me feel /extremely/ uncomfortable. I would have liked to share it on my own, preferrably privately. I didn't request critique publicly for a specific reason, I got horribly flamed the last time which is /why I waited so fucking long to even write anything/. That's why all my other stories are deleted on my profile.

Now, one of the first things in my inbox is a a bunch of - /public/ - nitpicks / critiques /that I didn't ask for or consent to/. The whole reason I posted was because I finally felt confident enough to post again, and now I feel like my confidence is destroyed all over again.

As an edit, to clarify, I've been actively doxxed and stalked on my other accounts, because my work was shared without my permission before - with the express purpose of making fun of it. I asked them to stop; they refused. It's why I removed all of my other stories from my account.

Tagging [[/u/UndeadBBQ]], [[/u/ReadsABitTooMuch]], and [[/u/Taure]] too, because I want to share why I didn't post the link to my fic straight off the bat.

So, thanks. Thanks, so much. /s

***** Okay, first let me tell you that I get you. Getting critic can be pretty harsh on the self esteem and on ones confidence. I get that, I really do. I'm an artist myself and this specific form of anxiety is basically job description.

/However/, and this is a big however, you /did/ post your story on a public platform that is specifically designed so that stories can be shared throughout the internet. So my question is: What the hell did you expect? Yes of course someone finds it and posts it. Yes of course people are going to tell you what they like and didn't like about it. The thing is, this is something you /already gave your consent to/ by posting your story on Fanfiction.net. You published your story. Public critic, sharing of the story on public forums and a certain lack of control over it is what you consented to the moment you pressed the "publish" button.

If you wanted to keep it private, send links to a google doc for interested people. Something that /isn't/ a worldwide, public platform.

The next thing: You received /nitpicks/. Take a moment and realize this. Nitpicks, small details people found odd or didn't like - a lot of them purely for subjective reasons. As far as critic goes, you got the /very/ good end of it. And not undeserved I might add. I did favorite/follow your story and hope for updates. Because it is among the good stuff out there. But even professional-tier fanfictions get criticism. That is something you simply have to accept when you publish Art of any form.

You specifically took out [[/u/ReadsABitTooMuch]]. But read his reply- really read it and analyze what he is saying.

I quote what he says after his many points of criticism:

#+begin_quote
  All told, it's a good start. Strong writing style with few - largely ignorable - errors (some formatting and a couple of Americanisms) that I saw. It's an interesting premise. Characterisation seems on point. The only other issue is an over-reliance on ellipses... Apart from that, I like it. I've followed you and look forward to reading more
#+end_quote

So what he is saying is "I found some details amiss, but your story is pretty damn good". That is incredibly positive feedback.

So, if you may have hoped for an apology, you ain't gettin' it. What I can offer you is a "well done, good chapter" and "I hope for more".

***** Please don't feel uncomfortable. I'm a person who constantly changes the pace of her own story because of what I read on reddit. It's been over two years and 100k words already written, but I can't write the first chapter. (A year ago, I managed to write it. I published it only because I was very, very drunk. 12 hours later - /poof/ gone. Why?) I take posts on reddit siriusly. Every time I read a discussion on OCs, I think something along the lines of, /"Wait wait, does my character do this? Will people dislike it? Did I explain it right?"/ or /"Well yeah, that plot-hole inspired me to write this fic in the first place. I figured out in an unique way to fil, but will people be willing to read it? Will this satisfy them? Will they find it weird or reasonable?"/

My point is: I admire you. You already wrote and published your stories, got flamed, stopped writing, BUT you *came back*. So don't feel bad. It takes courage to write /and/ publish. You're awesome. Keep up the good work.

** Interesting read so far.

A couple comments:

- One nitpick: I don't think the goblins would be bowing to the wizards because of their animosity.

- So far you followed canon mostly, but I hope that was just to show the divergence from canon. Please don't write a Canon rehash. Change the events, do something new. Don't follow canon too closely.

Just my two cents. If you ever need a beta, PM me.

** That's amazing!

Also, if you need someone to go over your story for editing, I'm glad and willing to help. The reason I mention that is because while reading something you've written by yourself, you're always bound to miss something or the other.

It's always happened to me while I wrote fan fictions, and when everything seemed perfect when I uploaded it, I literally cringed when I read it years later and found all the grammatical errors I'd missed.

** Reading through and I'll write my thoughts here as I go. Unfortunately that probably means this comment will be biased towards negatives as they what I'm most likely to comment on while I read through. Should get better at the end (or I just won't post this):

- I rarely consider stories with a quote in their synopsis as a good sign. I'm fairly sure I'm not alone on this, and I'm not sure everyone will realise it's a quote from "The Mummy," so that might bias some people against your story
- Typically, I prefer Harry-centric fics. It's a personal thing, but I'm willing to give most stories a chance
- Interesting premise though, and enough to convince me to give it a shot
- Why are you using Mr and Mrs Granger when the fic is from Hermione's POV? Dad and Mum would be better. Even if their relationship isn't great, I don't see why Hermione would refer to her own parents so formally. It just feels a little stifled
- "Whether or not whatever methods they used were illegal" is a double negative. It's a small thing (I'm being nitpick-y here), but I'd prefer "legal." Part of this is also because the previous sentence is, more or less, "they wouldn't do x" and I think this is better followed by "However, the methods used wouldn't necessarily be legal." This just helps imply that the most common course of action taken by a person in that situation would be legal
- "Hamburger shops" should probably be changed. For one, most people in Britain go for "burger" most of the time, or "beef burger" if they're specifying the type of burger. "Burger shop" wouldn't be used either though. "Burger bar," "fast food places," "takeaways," "chippies" or "fish and chip shop" would be more common. In this context, I'd probably go "fish and chip shop." I'm not as fussed on this because it isn't a character speaking, and Americanisms aren't as out of place there, but it's probably important if you're trying to inject as much of Hermione's character as possible into the writing.
- "'Well, aren't you turning into quite the young lady?' said Tom." It's a question, so you still use the question mark. When used at the end of someone's dialogue, it doesn't necessarily mark the end of the author's sentence.
- Roles such as prefect shouldn't be capitalised, especially when used with the indefinite article. It's not a proper noun, so it works the same way as "You could be a teacher." Later, you actually don't capitalise it. Annnnnd then you do. You seem to capitalise the singular, but not the plural, so at least you're consistent
- Again, it's not used in dialogue, so it's not too bad, but "trash can" = "(rubbish) bin"
- "'That sounds absolutely fascinating...'" The ellipsis isn't needed. Ron doesn't trail off, or pause, and it reads as if Percy cuts in pretty quickly
- On the subject of ellipses, Percy's dialogue has four within two sentences. That's too many
- Lucius Malfoy's dialogue has four ellipses within one sentence. Then three in a shorter sentence
- There's a couple of paragraph breaks out of place in Mr Weasley's and Mr Malfoy's scrap

All told, it's a good start. Strong writing style with few - largely ignorable - errors (some formatting and a couple of Americanisms) that I saw. It's an interesting premise. Characterisation seems on point. The only other issue is an over-reliance on ellipses... Apart from that, I like it. I've followed you and look forward to reading more

I disagree with this one. It's in third person limited, not first person. That means that while the story is told from the perspective of Hermione, including giving us a view into her thoughts, the narrative voice isn't itself Hermione's. It's a hypothetical observer who has attached themselves to Hermione's mind. If Hermione's parents were referred to as "Mum" and "Dad" in the narrative it would sound odd. The meaning of "Mum" and "Dad" as proper nouns is relative to the speaker, so would only make sense if the narrative voice were Hermione's own. But if the speaker was Hermione then the pronoun being used to refer to herself would be "I" (and she certainly shouldn't be referring to herself in the third person).
