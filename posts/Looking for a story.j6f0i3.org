Looking for a.harry/hermione where Hermione arrives to her last year at hogwarts from being sick with the pox. Her and harry are dating and head boy and girl. Harry has been causing havoc with Neville. Snape is missing draco is freaking out. Susan Bones is turned into a boy and is now dating hannah Abbott


** Never heard of it but now I'm fascinated. Not often you see a Hannah/Susan story -even if one of them has been turned into a boy.

** That would be linkffn(Never Again by Kuma2216). By the way, you should use the flair, "What's that Fic?" for requesting a story identification like this.

  Having been ill Hermione does not arrive for her seventh year until September 9th. Everything should be fine right? Harry can't get into that much trouble in just 9 days... Does not follow cannon. HP/HG NL/LL
