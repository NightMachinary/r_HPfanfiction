I hate pointless drama and characters holding idiot ball. I want a MC where he/she actually learns tons of spells(not just for combat, utility spells, healing spells too) and actually uses the spells when there is a problem that could be solved with it.

** Linkffn(11669575) 'For love of magic' is basically this. Harry doesn't care about anything but magic. He's openly and proudly nihilistic. It's a multi-partner fic. Harry is frustrated by Voldemort more than anything because he'd rather unravel the secrets of the universe.

Linkffn(8551180) 'In the Mind of a scientist' is another prodigy Harry that casually embraces the crackfic. It's fun, it's complete and the crossover with SG-1 is only mentioned in the last chapter as a lead into the sequel which I didn't bother with.

Linkffn(10937871) BLindness has Harry and Hermione pairing up to science the hell out of magic. They mess with advanced conjuration, the hallows, necromancy and altering mythical beings.

Linkffn(9036071) by the same author as the above, STrength of steel wings has a Harry with strange and unusual power and uses them. I did not finish this though.

Linkffn(3427377) Harry gets motivated is a fantastic one-shot.

Apart from that, you can search Prodigy in the Reddit search bar and a ton of stuff should come up.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

***** Honestly, it's not terribly strong on Harry/Daphne. There's no hint of romance until third year and Harry is 100% oblivious to the idea of it up through the current chapter. Daphne has a crush on him, but it's in character for a girl her age and feel realistic.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
