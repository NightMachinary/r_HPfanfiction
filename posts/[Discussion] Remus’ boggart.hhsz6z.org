Ok, so Remus is a werewolf. But that shouldn't make him afraid of the /moon./ Maybe if it represented his wolf side it could be stretched, but it just doesn't make sense.

A more realistic form for his boggart to take would depend on what part of his lycanthropy he fears. If it's his ability to hurt people maybe it would show himself as a wolf mauling someone (the person he fears to hurt the most perhaps). Or if it's his ability to pass the curse on to others, someone (again, a loved one) who is a werewolf and saying it's his fault.

Has anyone else thought about this? And what do you think would be a better boggart for Remus?


** The moon represents his transformation, which is what he fears and hates.

** He fears the moon because he could attack someone he loves during his transformation, which the moon signifies for him personally. You also have to take into account that at the time he was teaching that class, he hadn't met Tonks yet in a romantic way and he wasn't yet close to Harry at that time. So maybe by the time Remus and Tonks did get together, his boggart may have changed. Like Molly's did at the beginning of the war. Your boggart changes as you grow and your fears change. Something that you feared when you were five should be different by the time you are twenty. The moon just symbolizes all that fear for him because he associates the transformation with moon. Lunar cycles and all that.

*** The moon symbolises that, but it's not a literal thing to actually be afraid of. It would be like Harry being afraid of... I don't know. A flash of green light. Neville being afraid of a bat. Because they symbolise their fears. But a boggart is most effective when it's the thing they're literally afraid of isn't it?

**** No not really. Neville fears Snape which is literal but Harry fears fear. Not the Dementor. He fears them because they bring about his worst memories, not the actual being. The Patil sister fears the snake but does she fear the snake itself or the bite? It's not always the literal. Sometimes it's symbolic. The moon just happens to be the visual part of being a werewolf, the waiting every month for the moon to be full, the fear of what's to come, and the promise of the transformation. To Remus, the moon is the threat. How often has he had to check his calendar or the sky itself to see how long he has till the monster within comes out to play? Hermione's greatest fear is McGonagall telling her she has failed an exam which symbolizes her fear of failing as a witch in general.

** Well I always though that the moon was specifically used to be vague and mysterious, not accurate.

(In books it did not even look like a full moon. I remember them discussing what profesor Lupin fear is and Ron asking why he's afraid of floating ball.)

Someone being mauled by literal werewolf boggart isn't discreet and does not leave much room for interpretation, it would spoil plot too much. Also it was a scene from a child's book so violence like that couldn't really be randomly included in a classroom full of students.

Also someone raised a point that Remus did not know Harry nor Tonks. It may be turned around: Remus already lost everyone he cared about. He had no one who could show as victim to describe his fear. He was alone in this, only him and his moon induced wolf. So the boggart could be theoretically werewolf snarling at him. But he never sees it from that point of view - the last thing he clearly remembers is always the Moon.

*** Maybe his greatest fear isn't hurting other people but loss of control over himself and his life.

The only time we know that he came close to attacking a human was where someone/something made it possible. Sirius playing Snape, Pettigrew apearence shocking him and making him forget the potion in his rush to reach Harry. All circumstantial and pretty rare considering how careful Remus usually is. How good he is at managing everything after years of transforming month after month.

But that don't negates the fact that being werewolf destroys his life. How nerve wreaking is looking into calendar and seeing the full moon looming? How many times he did not get any Wolfsbane Potion and lost night to the madness? Or woke up in shredded place, blooded, skin full of fresh claw marks that will scar?

Maybe it sounds selfish but self preservation is instinct that you never know how strong it is till you find yourself in pain or mortal danger.

** My thought was that the full moon is the time when he loses control and is always worried that now matter his preperations he will hurt someone. The moon would do I think because it represents the time when he has literally no way of changing things so he has to hope his preperations will be enough.
