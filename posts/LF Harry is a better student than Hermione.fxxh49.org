I don't even care about the plot, Gryffindor or Slytherin, or if Hermione gets jealous or not. I just want a fanfiction where Harry is actually the greatest wizard of his time and prepares for Voldemort.


** linkffn(The Mind Arts by Wu Gang) has Harry as arguably the most capable (for his year, maybe period) student at Hogwarts.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) has Harry as the most accomplished team commander in Hogwarts - he suffers a setback to Hermione early in the story and from that point on, they trade for the top spot pretty regularly, though I think I remember Harry coming out on top most times.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is already looking to be more complicated than the first. He has a place in Slytherin House, but it's by no means secure; he's still feuding with his father and his twin brother; he still has a problem with trusting authority. On top of that, there are whispers of dark things coming to Hogwarts, and as much as Harry might like to stay out of it, he probably won't be able to. Especially since he's the Slytherin Potter.

The main issue is not only did he ask for donations to his organization in a community with children, but that the science in the fic was atrocious. The social psychology references were consistently misinterpreted, physics theory was dated, and there were numerous other issues with the science.

******* It's called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality with a premise of Harry Potter but science, so science was the point. He literally says "all science mentioned is real science" but it's not. The story suffers when its premise isn't even executed correctly. He even lied about the premise, it was to argue his positions on certain issues under the guise of a Harry Potter fanfiction exploring magic through science. Those cognitive theories being showcased in the story? Showcased via faulty theories, faulty reasoning, and misapplied theorems. What's wrong with asking for donations? The way he did so. He convinced people his organization was going to save the world. Other authors merely ask for donations to help support them. I already find the latter ethically dubious so I suppose this might stem from an ideological difference between us.

******** Not quite. The premise isn't ‘Harry but science,' it's ‘Harry but /rationality/.' There is a very crucial difference there, because the author isn't trying to teach the readers about every field of science---just one. That of being able to think with as little bias as possible, a system of thought. He does endorse the scientific method.

However, you do bring up valid criticisms. It strayed from the implied promise of exploring magic with science in order to build a more engaging narrative, it vastly simplified how biological inheritance works, and, yes, there is outdated/wrong science. Now, if you can bring up examples of those cognitive theories being wrong, I'll agree that it fails in its main purpose. Now your latter complaint is very odd. He /truly thinks/ he's working toward one possible avenue of preventing catastrophe. And yet that is framed as a bad thing, somehow. He even brings up that exact attitude with his tale of Atlantis. Why is there this pervasive thought that someone who thinks they are literally out to save the world is a /bad person/? Say he's wrong, say he's mistaken, even say he's lying, but if you take this as a good-faith effort to stop an apocalypse, why the hell would you say this is wrong?

***** It's just super controversial. The author can also come across as a bit cultish at times(he's not running a literal cult, just some of the terminology he has used is weird and his personality seems similar) The story itself is above average, though the first few chapters are awful. If the author wasn't associated with it whatsoever it would have a better reception (though still not be a favorite). It's been hugely influential outside of the HP fanfic world, so it's worth reading at least for that (its influence inside of it is less, "rational" fiction being taken to different fandoms fanfics or original webnovels).

(Sidenote: I clarified on the "not actual cult" because we've had that happen before. Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness' author did try to run multiple different cults according to multiple sources)
