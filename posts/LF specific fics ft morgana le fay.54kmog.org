Im looking for 2 fics, one where camelot was frozen and time and harry is the king, i think his oarents are alive for this.

Another is where harry is in egypt and is sent back in time, and becomes morgana, and has a relationship with merlin etc.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
