*** Yeah, it seems every fanfic I read with them in they're 'unkillable' but the second the protagonist gets his hands on the macguffin or learns some secret knowledge they spontaneously combust near him.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.
