So we've pretty much established that wandless magic is hard enough. Wandless apparition is almost undoable. I was reading Worm and saw the premise of the Birdcage, a prison designed for people to never get out of. One thing the Ministry could do to house Death Eaters (not Voldemort for obvious reasons) is to first take their wand. They put them in a fireplace connected to the Floo Network and transport them to HP Birdcage. There is zero floo powder in the prison, so they can't transport to the outside world. Get a Dementor through the Floo and you still have Dementor prison. There are no doors in and out and the location is kept completely secret. Not foolproof, but ypu can have a high-security facility with little security! Absolute genius!


** Where in the books did it say that you couldn't apparate without a wand? Am I misremembering or is this fanon?

*** I believe it's mentioned it can't be done by Luna when Ron is trying to apparate out of the Malfoy dungeon even though that would presumably also be due to protective enchantments on the Manor, but it's apparently also the reason neither Lily nor James could escape when Voldemort dropped by for a chat, so sorta-canon sorta-fanon.

**** I always thought the reason Lily and James didn't apparate away was because James was trying to hold Voldemort back while Lily got Harry and then Lilly didn't apparate because of protections/being too scared to properly apparate and risk splinching her baby.

** Didn't Harry apparate onto a roof as a kid? Accidental magic is without a wand, and surely if a kid can do it by accident then an adult wizard can do it on purpose

** At that point why not just execute them?

** Of course, you could always ensure that you use veritserum on the accused and when they confess to multiple murders and rapes you execute them and they can never commit another crime or harm another person.

*** Veritaserum isn't foolproof, and in a world in which it's possible to edit memories to the extent that people forget they have a daughter and think they want to move to Australia, a lot of confessions must be fake.

**** I'd say might be fake. So caution would be needed. The problem on the memories is whether or not a memory could be copied and viewed and determined whether it is real or false. Right now I'm not sure if that capability exists in canon or if it exists only in fanon.

If the capability exists then the combination of veritserum and memory review (and you could add the fanon concept of a magical oath (assuming you're magic knows the truth even if you have fake memories)) should reduce/eliminate innocents suffering the ultimate fate and ensure a lot of guilty truly get punished.

***** You may make up whatever magic system you want for your own fics, but in canon, nothing's foolproof. There's always some magic that can beat some other form of magic, no matter how powerful it seems.

The Grangers would have testified under veritaserum that they had no kids and had always dreamed of moving to Australia. There's nothing in canon saying fake memories can always be detected. Therefore I assume that any careful murderer would pick some innocent to take the blame for the crime, and that any careful court (which the Wizengamot generally isn't) should doubt confessions.

*** I always thought they should have a department of mysteries team that use time turners to investigate. You can have them sign contracts or make vows that they'll never mess with time or the investigation but instead use cloaks of invisibility or make themselves invisible, then have them go back in time to find out for certain what happened. Then you don't need to worry about the word or truthfulness of the accused. Who cares of they erased or had some erase their Memories? Send a team back in time to the crime scene and get a first hand view.

**** Yeah but you might need to go back prior to the crime only to check and ensure that someone wasn't under the imperius when the crime was committed and to identify the true culprit. Of course that also means you need a highly accurate forensics to identify actual time of crime etc. But not a bad concept.
