I've been thinking about what types of WMDs that could be used within the potter verse magic I feel a basilisk qualifies I've also figured mandrake with a sonorus charm what interested to see what everyone else could think up.

** I tend to think of WMDs as having the capacity to either 1. Kill a significant number of people at once and cause a considerable amount of destruction (nuclear and radiological weapons), or 2. Able to affect a large population over a short period of time (like biological or chemical weapons). I'm not sure I would include the basilisk in that if it has to attack one or several people at a time and cannot efficiently affect a large area, but if we're thinking in terms of a proportional population (since the wizard population is much smaller), then maybe.

That being said... Airborne Amortentia.

Or, whatever that gravity-screwing mist was in GOF inside the maze. Throw that over a large area and the chaos would be impressive.

*** I like the Amortentia idea and as far as the basilisk I'm basing it off the fact that it's eyes are instant death I'm also operating on the assumption that the rooster thing is bullshit.

*** Did that mist actually do anything though? Harry thought he was flipped, but then he just kept going through it and was alright on the other side. I got the impression it was purely a mental effect, like an upside-down reflection but for all his senses and not just vision.

**** Yes, I think you're right. But Harry, at the time, was going through a trial in which he knew everything he would encounter would be a test or challenge. Imagine getting enough mist to cover a large area of wizards who /aren't/ expecting it and don't know what it is, or worse - Muggles who have NO idea what's going on. And, if there's enough mist, they wouldn't be able to escape it, either. Before it dissipates, any amount of chaos could occur, resulting in injury or death.

***** Sure, it's potentially catastrophic, if big enough. But it's an effect in an area that is quite obvious, and it's not inherently lethal. It'd be like if there was enormous tanker truck full of Lube and a truck full of Super Glue that crashed and spilled all over the street.

*** A basilisk could kill a whole lot of people if you got them to look in the right direction, it's deadly anywhere you can see it.

Even indirectly it's a decent weapon as petrification is not easily cured.

**** True. I guess because the idea was WMDs I'm thinking on a /much/ larger scale than others and basing my criteria on that.

** Fiendfyre (already listed).

Whatever created the Dementors.

Transfiguration.

That /Geminio/ curse what multiplies things. Cast that on a Poison Dart Frog, and throw it at someone in a crowded street.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14031132][Petrification Prolifiration]] by wizard_md. What if Wizards actually treated basilisks as WMD. What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa. complete. Ao3.

** In linkffn(Guy Fawkes Day by MisterQ), Harry makes explosives with a wide range of yields by using nested expanded spaces. I'm not certain that destroying Diagon Alley is enough to qualify as a WMD, but it may be. There's certainly nothing stopping him from making larger ones.

And in linkffn(The British Reformation by kb0), Harry deploys a WMD to destroy British magical society.

  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.
