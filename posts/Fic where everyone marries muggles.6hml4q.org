It occurred to me that it could be a decent comedy of a fanfiction. Basically it's no secret the wizarding world is shrinking with the persecution of Voldemort and his followers combined with pure blood ideology. It would be funny if Harry and his friends or even the DA entered an agreement to try and pursue muggle relationships in an effort to diversify the wizarding population.


** I would probably read it, if only due it being original.

** Heh. Well, that's one way to put a spin on the Marriage Law fic.

** You know, given how wizard genetics work (Once you're in, you're in, with rare exceptions.), aggressive exogamy could have wizards displacing Muggles demographically over a few centuries.

There's a plot bunny I have of Voldemort deciding to pursue /a different kind of immortality/: a decade later, Hogwarts is deluged with a hundred handsome, dark-haired Muggleborns, who tend to be highly intelligent but also often possess psychopathic traits. Next year, two hundred, and the year after that, and so on. (It doesn't even have to be unethical. Handsome, highly intelligent, good at hiding his psychopathy, and able to pass on magical powers, Tom Riddle could be a pretty popular sperm donor.)

*** That's another decent way to look at it! I just find t funny how inbreeding is clearly implied in cannon and never once did anyone pursue muggles relations intentionally. Like what if Harry, Ron, hermione, Neville, etc all go to university on purpose.
