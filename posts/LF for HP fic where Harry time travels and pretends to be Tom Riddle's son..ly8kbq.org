:END:
Hiii! I humbly ask for your help in locating this specific HP fanfic that I cannot, for the life of me, seem to find.

The fic in question has Dumbledore sending Harry back in time to accomplish a secret mission. The mission was to pose as Tom Riddle's underage son. If I recall correctly Harry was about 15-16 years old, and the time period/AU (?) Harry was sent to had Tom as the Minister for Magic (Tom isn't Voldemort yet in the story). Harry basically has fun with it and screws with Tom by having everyone believe that he's his underage son. Last I read, the fic was still incomplete.

Thanks so much!

*EDIT: Story's been found!


** this seems fun
