** Essentially, Daphne Greengrass is a blank slate. We know almost nothing about her. We know she's in the same year as Harry. We know she's a pureblood, a Slytherin and a member of the Sacred Twenty Eight. Beyond this, such little is known about the character that she can be made into whoever the author wants her to be. She's the perfect catalyst for 'Harry marries wealthy pureblood girl' without having to commit to certain already established personality traits.

It's similar to fics in which Hermione is paired with Theodore Nott. He's a named character with no established personality. He can be an evil Voldemort loving maniac or a poor teenager forced into service by his father. You can just twist them to be whoever they need to be in your story.

Daphne makes sense in a lot of ways. She's also a good opportunity to bring Pureblood Politics into everything.

Harry having some kind of relationship with Slytherins also adds a great source of conflict and is a convenient escape route from Dumbledore and the Weasleys.

** She became popular when Blaise was revealed to be a guy and people needed someone to fill the "good pureblood/Slytherin" love interest role. All other Slytherins we know are evil (with the exception of Andromeda) or not a pureblood (Tracy Davis), so Daphne became the plot device for a ton of bad "pureblood" plots.

Other than the unambiguously down market Weasleys, and for some reason Harry (whose parents demonstrated straight up Chav values using a nickname for his proper first name), no one is referred by a nickname nor were any girls named some yuppy cutesypoo traditionally male name.

It all comes down to unvarnished ignorance. Blaise is in no way a name used in English speaking populations. It isn't traditional, nor even an obscure English name, it's a French male's name.

EDIT: And to demonstrate my own ignorance, the name is actually Greek in origin from Saint Blaise (who was a man).

****** At least in the early German translation, they had to pick a gender for grammatical consistency in the first book when Blaise was sorted (the source wasn't clear) and they chose female. They fixed the translation after the sixth book was released, where his gender became clear.

The name does sound quite feminine to me, to be honest, and as a child who grew up with Harry Potter, I didn't know of Blaise Pascal until much later - Blaise Zabini is the first Blaise I encountered.

** So some folks already on here have explained the whole "blank slate" aspect where you can make her whatever you want while still having some basic guidelines (Slytherin, Pureblood, Sacred Twenty Eight, Somewhat outside the typical).

However, as someone who personally LOVES Daphne Greengrass/Harry Potter pairings (or similar), I will explain why she is, in particular, appealing to me.

So apart from the blank slate aspect, she can be utilized in some really interesting ways.

First off, Shes Slytherin allowing a Slytherin connection for Harry, either from outside the house looking in or as an ally if Harry is sorted into Slytherin.

Secondly, She likely has stature, is a pureblood, and has a mysterious background which allows her to play many roles and wear many faces, especially when connected to a figure such as Harry. Her family name is also a bit of an unknown as it pertains to the war(s) and Voldemort. Again, this allows for interesting choices to be made regardless of the direction its taken in.

She is also implied to be a beauty. I'll be honest, apart from liking her name, I like the idea of Harry with a beauty by his side as they both achieve greatness in whatever form it is.

This next one I feel people often overlook but I think its an important factor:

The "Astoria Factor"

I like the intriguing aspects Astoria brings into the picture. Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are only children. Ron and Ginny have a massive family and it's all brothers. The point is, by having a slightly younger sister (1-2 years younger), it brings a dynamic not often seen around Harry and allows for some interesting development. Pair Harry with Astoria as well? Have Daphne die and Astoria connects with Harry later? Have Astoria die or Harry save her or something else intriguing happens to change Daphne? Have Astoria bring Draco around to Harry's views or Daphne bring Harry around to Astoria/Draco views? You get the picture.

To a lesser degree, Fleur and Gabrielle also work for this.

** What drew me to Daphne as a character initially, was that she could be a Slytherin student who isn't a huge twat. Canon lacks sympathetic Slytherins, even though just statistically speaking they can't all be bullies, and or Voldemort supporters, etc. Depending on what the author wants to do with her, she can be a really interesting character.

Does she believe in blood purity? Why or why not? If yes does she change her mind or the mind of another character like Harry? Can she teach, Harry and or Hermione things about wizard culture that Ron doesn't know or didn't think to bring up (nice world building opportunity here)?

Her personality is a blank slate so the author can create a character who fit their needs.

I also quite enjoy Harry/Daphne as a pairing because there can be a hidden friendship/forbidden fruit element to it with Gyriffindor/Slytherin element. The author can also use a friendship or relationship to address the house rivalries and maybe unify them. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a Harry/Daphne fic that doesn't have the same cliches like Ice Queen Daphne, Ancient and Noble Houses, Ron/Dumbledore/Molly/Ginny bashing, Mary Sue Daphne, Gary Stu Harry, Marriage contracts, etc, but there is a lot of potential for the character and the paring as a whole. Some of those cliches can be okay if handled properly, too.

** I don't know. She's literally just a name given once as a student who took OWL's with Hermione in OOTP. That's it. She didn't even have her House mentioned, or her family, or her friends, or her blood status, or anything else ever. She's just a random one-off name. I could make her a deaf, sweet little Hufflepuff who likes to chew gum and play Quidditch if I wanted to and that would be as valid as any other fanfiction characterization about her. :)

** I wonder why it was only the indy!Harry corner of the fandom that latched on to Daphne as its Slytherin female of choice, while every other part chose Pansy. Ron/Pansy, Hermione/Pansy, Ginny/Pansy etc are all mildly popular pairings, while Daphne is a complete non-entity.

*** Pansy is just the female version of Draco, and almost as bad: pureblood bigot, Voldemort collaborator, and a bully. Such a wonderful catch /s

**** I'd argue she's worse, as Draco at least has complex motivations throughout the series, where Pansy is cruel, as far as I can tell, just because she's cruel.

***** She was criminally underdeveloped because she was essentially based on every mean girl Rowling dealt with growing up so of course she can't be a sympathetic character. I really enjoy her fan fic counterparts where she's an unapologetic bitch but also an interesting, developed character.

***** Even if I was interested in reading that pairing, HP on AO3 is all but a wasteland.

AO3 is so overwhelmingly dominated by slash and blatantly squicky slash that I can't read anything over there. Even stories that have pairings I'm interested in I can't read because almost every single fic in HP there is slash.

I have no problems with background slash (Charlie Weasley, or any other canonically unpaired character), but that is nonexistent on AO3 it's either all Harry slash, or Draco in leather pants crap.

****** 361 on ao3 for Harry/Pansy. 185 for Harry/Daphne, most of them being harem fics.

Harry/Daphne on ffn is way more popular - 296 fics vs 63 for Harry/Pansy -- which just reinforces my observation that she's popular in a single section of the fandom - the indy!Harry one, mostly limited to ffn.

** Honestly, it's because she's easy.

Get your mind out of the gutter. Not in that way.

She's a blank slate, meaning that authors have license to do what they will with her. (Again, mind? Gutter?) You can't make Ginny or Hermione into something too discordant with their canon selves or a substantial fraction of the fandom will balk. But someone as nebulously defined as Daphne? Have at it. Make her a femme fatale, a Death Eater wannabe, a violin prodigy, a foil fencing champion, a displaced Native American, an Ice Queen®. She's plot putty.

And she's a Slytherin, so you have instant house-dynamic conflict and the possibility of family conflict with Harry and the gang.

She's just an easy character to write. And sometimes when writing fanfiction you just want to stretch your wings a bit and don't want a complete mental model of a stock character. "Ron, teaspoon?" much?
