Someone linked to a story called... black goo? I think?

It talked about how Dementors can apparently breed, but not die (Though I believe the wording in the books was cannot be killed?)

The story got me thinking: The wizarding world obviously isn't over-run by an ever expanding population of immortal depression elementals. So... Either:

A) It merely hasn't happened yet, and any and every fic would theoretically eventually become 'black goo' given enough time, or...

B) Dementors can die... somehow...

In searching to see if this has already been answered I found a lot of references to people's pet peeves being Harry randomly having a Patronus that can kill them instead of drive them away. So my question is: What is a reasonable cause of death for a dementor from a consistent world building perspective?

As an example, I would assume that somehow lighting off Fiendfyre *inside* of a dementor would kill it given that as I understand it Fiendfyre consumes magic and dementors are magical. (Note that I have little by way of suggestions on how a witch or wizard safely get /that/ close to a dementor)


** A good question. The most obvious answer is that they can starve. If they couldn't starve they wouldn't need food aside from pleasure, and wouldn't stick around Azkaban for stale food. If they couldn't die at all, the world would have been overrun by now. It'd be like cancer, just one missed dementor and your infestation pops up all over again.

Speaking of infestations, there's a plot bunny that the Black Death of Europe was a dementor population boom, and not just sickness.

I find it likely that either multiple Patroni boxing them in, or some kind of white magic ritual is capable of killing them off for good. Lighting Fiendfyre on the inside would kill just about anything, I'd think. I have a personal theory that dementors are, in fact, anti-magic/anti-energy, which is why nothing except a very specialized spell is capable of harming them.

It's also possible the Auror Department or the Department of Mysteries has some other spell or object that, when properly applied, can kill Dementors.

As for breeding, there's a fic called The Nightmare Man, I think it was (someone source me) that had Dementors created by Harry vomiting some special seeds and implanting them in corpses, then burying them. They would sprout black trees with pods and out pop new dementors.

That's all I got.

*** I'd prefer it to be a rare fartiact, like a holy sword or spear, to a lost spell because otherwise all wizards could do it and they wouldn't be as terrifying plus you'd have to get all up in their grill to give them a good smiting. You could then give the head dementor a sweet scythe or sword for the big boss fight.

/(source: my headcanon)/

In case of Dementor population in general, fading into non-existance ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxiLUEgN6vQ][like Queen Mab]] from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_%28miniseries%29#Cast][Merlin)]] due to lack of proper emotional attention. In case of particular specimen, long-term starvation (like Angels from Dr. Who).

Dementors are a reflection of a problem, not a problem of its own --- that's also why they can't be killed through direct attacks. They are manifestations of despair and depression of a collective unconscious, be that of wizards or muggles (though a desparied wizard will be generating more “Dementor power units” than a muggle).

The life cycle of a local Dementor population looks something like this:

1. Something major happens within the human population (Overpopulation→Famine→War→Disease) to cause people to panic en masse and become depressed;
2. This spike in negative feelings spawns additional Dementors as its manifestations --- or as Avatars of a semi-conscious quazi-god, if you're a fan of anthropomorphized beings;
3. The much bigger Dementor Group starts affecting people on its own, to a degree even causing new ones to get spawned;
4. Eventually the effect reaches a point where most of the people who lack proper emotional control or are vulnurable to depression get killed in one way or another (suicide, lack of motivation resulting in starvation, lack of survival skills in general, etc);
5. This leaves the local human population with a higher percentage of people who are used to “sucking it up” and fighting on despite the current state of affairs, and the Dementors lose most of the empowering them emotional background;
6. The Dementor numbers return to “normal”.

/p.s. Here are the [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-31520/dspeyer+Black+Goo.htm][story]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xjlja/dcffhp_black_goo_remember_that_line_in_hbp_about/][thread]] you remember./

** Makes me wonder how they reproduce anyway - splicing themselves? I just cant see a dementor, like, breastfeeding ... Maybe you cannot kill them and they just burn out, like a candle, after a certain amount of time. Or maybe they die when they give birth, so the population is always the same.

*** I figured they turn people into dementors somehow. Suck out their brain instead of their soul, give 'em a nifty tattered black cloak, and the dementor army is +1.

**** In one fic there was something about a boggart turning into a dementor after a while, that sounded interesting, too.

*** Huh... I always just assumed it was a mystical form of mitosis once a dementor had consumed enough emotional or soul energy or w/e to sustain two of them.

I feel like the way the dementors are breeding comment is made implies that their numbers are increasing... But I obviously can't prove that.
