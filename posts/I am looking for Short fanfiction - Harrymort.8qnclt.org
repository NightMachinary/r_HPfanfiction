I once read one fanfiction and now I can't find it. It was romance and a little fluff. It started when Harry watched the memory of Snape like in Canon and he went to Voldemort but he decided that he doesn't want to die so he tells Voldemort that he is a Horxruc. Voldemort took him with him and take care of him.

Soo... Do you know some of fanfiction like this?
