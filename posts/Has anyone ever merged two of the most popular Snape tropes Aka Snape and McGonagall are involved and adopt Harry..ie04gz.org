What it says on the tin. There are probably a million Snape-adopts-Harry stories and McGonagall seems to be the most popular het ship aside from Hermione (which doesn't work with adopting her classmate for obvious reasons), but I don't think I've ever seen a story that combines the two...


** There was one in which Harry is rescued by McGonagall from the Dursleys and McGonagall- Snape adopt him, after McGonagall using a deaging potion to turn 25 yrs younger. Evil Dumbledore, Good Tom Riddle. Harry's animagus form is some magical creature that can duplicate and gives a body to the Tom Riddle horcrux in his scar.
