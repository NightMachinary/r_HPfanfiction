Is there a list of wand woods and cores that has cores and woods that are not in the list written by Rowling? I´m searching for a wand wood that would pair well with Horned Serpent Horn and a owner that is intelligent, quite and ambitious. The owner to is a Parselmouth.


** I'm not sure, but if I've learned anything on this hellsite, it's that people don't care if it's canon if it is well written. There are fanfics where Harry is a goddamn dragon, your wand woods and cores will be just fine

** Most likely you would want something that grows in North America. I would suggest the Sassafras tree

Sassafras leaves are used medicinally and the snake is a common symbol in medicine.

The wood of the tree is used as a fire starter, which could imply the wood would be good for offensive magic

Also Sassafras just sounds like a word in Parseltongue... And maybe it is?

And naturally, you won't find "Horned Serpent Horn" on it.

*** Pretty sure they're looking for resources other than those specific lists, considering they said “other than the lists written by JK Rowling.”

**** ... reading comprehension 101. I mentally skipped "not in the list" for some reason.

Thanks for pointing it out & and my bad @OP.

** Are you looking for an actual canon list or something that other fans have created based on their own research? There's a tumblr account called Clover's Wand Lore that you might find interesting if you don't care if it's fan-created.

** When in doubt, you can never fail with the most noble of woods... oak.
