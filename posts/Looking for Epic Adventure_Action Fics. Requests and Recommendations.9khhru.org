I've run out of stories at present and I desperately need some new ones! I need more fics to help me procrastinate so I don't have to pursue my studies.

I am going to put the sort of thing I'm after here, with some summaries:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment][Realignment]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5057319/PuzzleSB][PuzzleSB]]

A story set in 1943 where a young Tom Riddle is being hunted by Harry Potter (calling himself James Bond) who has come back to kill him. Dumbledore acts as Riddle's protector and mentor in the story. Grindlewald appears in fine fettle. The action scenes are magnificent and perhaps the only failing of the plot is that it is a little too streamlined.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4263138/The-Wayland-Smith][The Wayland Smith]]

Set over a century after the second wizarding war (which ended in a truce) an immortal Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort are pushed into an adventure by a rather contrived plot. It has some really excellent fights. Main problem is that it isn't massively focused, it gets from point a to point b, but keeps going off down sidetracks.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991][joe6991]]

Obviously a classic. A time-travelling, thousand year old Harry fighting a war he just can't win. Atlantis, demons, a terrifying Voldemort. This one has it all, even if the sequel isn't quite as good.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][A Stranger in an Unholy Land]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/606422/serpant-sorcerer][serpant-sorcerer]]

It has been a while since I read this one. The sequel was never finished.

The summary, 'Days before his 6th year, Harry Potter is sucked into another universe by forces not of this world. Dazed and confused, Harry finds himself in a world where his parents are alive, where Voldemort has never fallen and he is Voldemort's key enforcer' doesn't really do it justice. There are some incredible fights and some brilliant world building here. It goes on perhaps a little too long, but it really has some excellent parts to it.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1077111/DobbyElfLord][DobbyElfLord]]

'Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald.'

I adore the image of Harry just telling a demon to come at him during the bombing of Dresden.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/524094/Shezza][Shezza]]

'By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files'

Honestly I find the characters a little wearing in this just because their personalities are so abrasive, but on the other hand it and its sequels have excellent combat sequences. Maeve vs Dumbledore in particular.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][The Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1355498/Mizuni-sama][Mizuni-sama]]

A masterpiece of world building the sadly unfinished fic, which follows Harry in a world where Voldemort won (and isn't that terrible), has some of the most intense battles and adventures around. It features faeries, sieges on Hogwarts, battles in cities, battles in the air, duels and so, so much more.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight][The Red Knight]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/335892/Demon-Eyes-Laharl][Demon Eyes Laharl]]

'When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive.'

I am not sure quite how I feel about this one. The fight scenes and action are, however, really well done. Certain aspects of the plot bother me, but not enough for me not to be eager to read more like it.

​

Tentatively I would add [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7769074/Wu-Gang][Wu Gang]]

'What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings.'

It suggests that there will be some very entertaining action sequences to come. As yet it is fairly good, although the fight scenes aren't quite as fluid as many on this list. It does compensate for that with close and careful plotting and consistent characters.

​

Honourable mentions to at least the first half of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and much of JBerns' other work (though I'd prefer less bashing), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] (sadly unfinished), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] (again sadly unfinished, but with some of the best Dumbledore writing in fanfiction), and the sequels to most of the ones I've mentioned.

​

So, please send me your recommendations! Give me something to fill the void. Please!

​

Edit: I forgot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][Skitterleap]] By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/980211/enembee][enembee]]

Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?

I've always really liked the way that Silens writes action.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
