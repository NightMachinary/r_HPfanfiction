What do you think of them? Does it depend on how they're handled or do you not like them at all?

I've heard so many different opinions on this over the years in all my fandoms and I was wondering what you lot might have to say. Feel free to recommend good examples if you have any


** It truly depends on the writer. Some writers turn them into Mary sues but other have them be fleshed out characters with their own strengths and flaws. And the canon book didn't reveal a lot about most females, so pairing Harry with anyone aside from Luna, Ginny or Hermione usually results in a O.C or a O.C. Stand-in. And even the personality of Ginny is a little underdeveloped and Luna is almost impossible to write for most writers, so they both get turned into an O.C too quite often.

** The main problem ist the fact that they're OCs. Character Development ist hard work, with many pitfalls, that needs some Class-A execution. To build a character you need more than just "I want her/him to be a Slytherin and best friends with Harry, but loved by Draco and everybody else in school" - Mary Sue awfulness, which is, it seems, 99% of all OCs in the HP fandom.

So before we even go into ships, you can just root out 99% of all OCs simply because they're bad characters.

Then you have the question of "Why". Why do you want to pair Harry (or whomever) with an OC? OC here does not mean characters like Daphne, or Susan, as their characters have been defined by fanon. I'm talking about a complete OC, with no mention anywhere in canon, Pottermore or fanon discourse.

Frankly, the answer I often think is accurate is "I want to pair myself with Harry". OCs are /mostly/ self-inserts. Even if they're technically well written, they suck because no one wants to read your romantic daydream. And this is already talking about one fraction in the 1% of not just unreadable bullshittery.

So we have somewhere around 99.5% (perceived) chance of the tag "OC" being a bad sign. There is only a very little chance of some OC being good. Case in point, I can only think of two stories that do OCs as anything but sidecharacter fillers well. "Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived" by The Santi, featuring Calypso Rosier and the "Alexandra Quick" series. Thats it. I would say that I enjoyed the Harry/Calypso pairing a lot, simply because Calypso was a great character, but probability speaks against OCs in general, and pairings with them in particular.

**** True, that one was also pretty nice. I forgot it because it was overall not my genre and I never read it to the end.

** As I write a CC/OC pairing , obvously I'm going to come down in favour; but with the proviso that it's not written in first person from the OC's POV and that the OC is paired with a CC who doesn't have any love interest in canon, or the story is set well after canon events.

I would agree that a lot of OCs are badly written (not mine I hope!), but that's because a lot of fanfics are badly written.

I don't see much difference between an OC and a 'canon' character who in canon is no more than a random name without any description, background or personality.

** I'm not into them at all, personally. I've read some great OCs, but there's always something that stops me from liking them. I think it's because when I'm in the mood for fanfiction, I'm really just looking for MORE Harry Potter. I don't want to meet somebody new, I want to hang out with my friends from the books again.

** The most important thing is that there is a plot relevant purpose for introducing the OC. If they just add an OC because they want to write an OC or because they don't like any of the canon characters, it's an unnecessary complication.

** It really does depend how they are handled. Sometimes its interesting and sometimes its extremely dull. That said, I do enjoy reading outside cannon pairings for Harry because its neat to see how the author develops the character hes paired with. Authors writing stories where they are taking blank slates such as Daphne, or Katie, or even semi blank slates like Fleur and developing them into solid characters is a neat thing to read.

Of note is that I also was NEVER a fan of the pairings JK ended up going with. It disappointed me EXTREMELY when Harry ended up with Ginny and Ron with Hermione. I had been rooting for Harry/Hermione, with Luna/Ron and Ginny/Neville as the other possibles. When it didnt happen I actually moved away from the HP world, only coming back upon discovering fan fiction and the ability to have the pairings I wanted, or at least new and interesting pairings to explore.

So OC's or blank slate characters (like Daphne) are always fun to see.
