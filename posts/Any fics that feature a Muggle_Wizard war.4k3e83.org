** More of a sci-fi exploration story, but the overarching plot and both beginning and end are Muggle/Wizard wars - linkffn(Voyage of the Starship Hedwig). It's complete and there's a sequel which I haven't read (it's an unfinished Star Wars/HP crossover, although the first story has no Star Wars in it whatsoever).

The story is very original, and I recommend trying it out, although it's at times rather brutal.

** I wonder, would a Muggle Wizard conflict really be a war. Sure, Muggles have nuclear bombs, but a wizard could just imperio the president/prime minister into surrendering and destroying all nuclear bombs. Disillusionment spells and imperio's could destroy the entire government and the leaders of the army(general, lieutenant general). You'd have to think wizard's would win really easily.

*** This assumes a competent wizard leadership and attack strategy. They are a classic inept bureaucracy. Also, the muggleborn could potentially work against them. Agree that magic has the advantage despite this, but it could be doable, especially if Muggles made the first few moves.
