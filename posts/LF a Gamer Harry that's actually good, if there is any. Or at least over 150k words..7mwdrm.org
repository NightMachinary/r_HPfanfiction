One of my first fics i've ever read was linkffn(Percy Jackson and the Game) and i loved the genre because of a webnovel I read a few years back, RE:Monster. A few months ago I tried looking for a GamerHarry, but found only 3, and of which only 1 was sort of good, but abandoned and only with 60k words.

sadly there are not that many good gamer Harry story's in the Harry potter fandom mostly because people keep using manhwa the gamer,Skyrim and fallout as the basis. why cant they use Re:monster or Danmachi as the Basis for a change.

I wonder if there's a xover of Tatte no Yuusha with HP, it would also be kinda cool. Or even maybe a good SAOxHP besides the "Mystic Knight". Thanks for the suggestions, gonna check them out =D
