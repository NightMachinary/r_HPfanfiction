No, not the Denarian trilogy or Awaken Sleeper (though both are quite good), and not the one with Harry and Lasciel, either, forget the name of it.

**** That's the one.

*Dresden's POV:*

I saw Morgan arch his left hand back and fire leapt from it to pool in his right palm. That's not fair, how can he have this much control over a third element? I saw the Outsider's eyes widen, maybe in surprise? Morgan saw this and inclined his head arrogantly before the fire pooling in his palm shot at the Outsider and enveloped him.

 

It was the most hideous thing I heard...I knew what would happen to the Outsider, how his skin would boil and tear and how he would scream, but he didn't do that and its one of the most horrible things I've heard.

 

When I had fought my master, I'd burned him, even then when I was high on black magic coursing through my veins and burning my master's flesh I was disgusted by the smell and his screams. Even when I tasted murder like honey his screams had cut into me, but it was nothing like when the Outsider burned.

 

...He laughed!

 

Morgan's rushing flames on the heel of his guttural incantations writhed around the doubled over form of the Outsider and he laughed!

 

Laughed as if he was going to burst from it, laughed in high peels of unholy mirth, laughing uncontrollably like he'd just seen Moe slap Curly - he was enjoying being on fire!

 

*Potter's POV:*

It had been close, the wizard was powerful, I don't know how he made his sword magical but I felt his strength. And I almost lost it when he conjured fire with his bare hands, wandless magic that powerful is incredible. My flame freezing charm was weak, I was too shocked to cast a proper one, and so it was like a ridiculously over powered tickling jinx.

****** linkffn(6989216) - "A mature Harry Potter finds himself in Dresden's world through unknown means with no way back. Not having any lingering connections to his old world, he decides to make the best of things and do what he does best-survive, with style."

 

linkffn(7779108) - In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

 

Though unfortunately neither are finished and are probably abandoned.

 

On the off chance that you're a Stargate fan, I'd really recommend both linkffn(8005922)God's Eye and its spin-off linkffn(11445721)Shattering Occam's Razor.
