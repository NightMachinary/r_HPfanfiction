So... I was searching for a Snape-centric fic that's quite long. It's definitely over 100k and I believe that Snape loses his magic or can't use it, and so retires to Spinner's End to live in solitude. But then he meets his elderly neighbor who convinces him to have tea with her. They become friends. Draco shows up to talk to Severus, and eventually start to date his neighbor's granddaughter. Anyone know the fic?
