I remember DH epilogue fix it fics used to be popular, but I haven't seen them as much lately. Curious if there's a fic that you all prefer for the end of the arc.


** No. I dislike the epilogue for quite a few reasons, but in order to truly fix it, you'd have to rewrite the entirety of DH at least, HBP most likely as well.

There isn't really a singular thing where I would say "this is how it has to be". I dislike the Ron/Hermione romance, but removing that would hardly improve the mess which is called the seventh book. I dislike what was done to Tonks' character in books 6+7, but again, just changing that would not improve the overall feel of the finale. You would need to rewrite large parts of those tomes because, by the last chapter (excluding the epilogue), the damage has already been done. The epilogue was the final blow, but at that point, it was a mercy killing.

Which is honestly the reason I never got around to writing a post-war/next-gen fic. There is just so much wrong with DH that it is little more than a rotten foundation to build on. As entertaining as a Teddy&Delphi fic where they act like siblings would be, I feel like I would spend more time trying to "fix" HBP and DH through flashbacks, exposition and the like than actually writing about the next generation.

There are many fics which are, in my opinion, better than the epilogue, but that's not a high bar. "It could only happen to Harry" is a harem smutfic and still a better ending, despite its unbelievable premise. The one where Tonks tries to be a dark lady and ends up repeatedly saving the day is a cracky comedy and likewise is more satisfying than the mess which got us to "Albus Severus".

**** - Malfoy avoiding justice for his war crimes (according to Pottermore, even Lucius got off again)

- The absolute stupidity of the Horcrux hunt. There are a hundred times more Tescos than Death Eaters, nevermind other supermarket chains. There was no need to starve or be otherwise miserable. Also, see below

- No one leaving Britain. Apparating across the Channel or even taking the rowboat would be preferable to camping in the countryside and being summarily executed like Ted Tonks.

- The Ministry happily switching between genocide and cauldron bottom thickness. There was no apparent denazification afterwards. All was well.

- HBP only working due to everyone passing the idiot ball like a bong. Most notably, Ron and Hermione not believing that Draco, the guy who has been calling for racial purges since age 12, could work for Voldemort.

- The reception of certain characters, most notably Dumbledore and Snape. Dumbledore is incompetent throughout the series (most notably his useless lessons in HBP, his actions in OotP and his inability to deal with the plots of books 2 and 3), Snape a massive dick (a good deed does not wash away a bad one). Harry should be hating them with a burning passion. Yes, it is due to the chosen medium, but "this is a YA novel" should not stop Harry from dislinking Dumbledore for letting Malfoy attack and nearly kill two of his friends.

- The Tonks home repelling the entirety of Voldemort's forces without the need for child abuse. I don't mind that per se, but it should lead to a massive rift between Harry and (the memory of) Dumbledore.

- The Order being completely ineffective. No reckoning towards the Dursleys, the utterly braindead extraction plan and lack of resistance after Voldemort's takeover.

- No one else taking up arms against Voldemort. I mean, again I am fine with this element, but it paints a rather bleak picture of the morals of magical Britain. And yes, it would most likely have been futile, but that didn't stop any of the WW2 resistance groups.

And that's just the plot, not to mention narrative tone or the epilouge.

***** I agree on all of your points.

- Malfoy /could/ have been redeemed, but it would have had to happen before year six at the earliest, and preferably even earlier than that.

- The horcrux hunt was beyond stupid and handled so horribly. The amount of pointless angst that came about from the camping and lack of food was inane.

- With regards to the ministry after Voldemort's defeat, everyone knows that racism is solved by beating the final boss of racism /s

- HBP was arguably worse than DH, which really says something. It felt like JKR was trying to stretch her ideas thin in a desperate attempt to make her remaining ideas fill two more books

- While I dislike the standard manipulative Dumbledore portrayal, the way he's written in canon means that he's incompetent at best. A good, competent Dumbledore basically requires the entire story to be written from scratch. Snape... Snape was on the right side of the war, but he did it for selfish reasons and was still a terrible and petty person. Not to mention that making him act evil so "Voldemort would believe him" was insanely stupid. If Snape wanted to keep his cover, he should have /pretended/ to be loyal to Dumbledore so he could reasonably pretend that he had fooled Dumbledore. Did Voldemort actually believe that Dumbledore would believe a man who constantly bullied children had reformed? Maybe. Voldemort was pretty stupid in canon, after all.

- Gods, don't get me started on how fucked up it was that Harry /had/ to go to the Dursleys. Having Harry go there immediately after his parents died was the only time it was close to justified, but the fact that he had to /keep/ going back there was awful, especially after the events of books four and five. Sending him back to apathetic and abusive relatives after he just witnessed the death of people close to him was the worst thing they could have done, especially with how the just cut him off in the start of OotP. Not to mention that given how Tom Riddle turned out, you'd think Dumbledore would do something different the next time a student came to him and asked him to stay at Hogwarts instead of going back.

****** Malfoy redemption is possible to the point where he carries out the attack on Katie or after a lengthy stay in prison. A romance with the trio is only possible if you make changes before year two.

For the Dursleys, Dumbledore's justification alone should be enough to get him behind bars. He says that Harry might have been underfed, but at least he wasn't pampered. How can you leave such a man near children?

I think Snape's action fooled no one, both sides knew that he was at least a double agent, the only question was whom he was ultimately loyal to. And his canon actions leave that one inconclusive.

******* First of all, Pottermore is not canon for me (I know, it is for some, but we are talking here about books, don't we?), so:

1. I don't think there is any evidence that Malfoys were not punished, certainly there is nothing about Lucius Malfoy being spared, it is possible that even Draco in the Epilogue was there after spending ten years in Azkaban (I don't think there is any evidence contrary).

2. yes

3. yes

4. there is no evidence for “no denazification afterwards”

5. yes

6. it is a bit more complicated, I have tendency to agree somehow, but I think it is a bit more complicated; yes, Snape was a dick, and no I don't think whatever he felt towards Lily was love; yes, Dumbledore is highly problematic, but I don't think anybody should hate him with passion ... probably distrust him with the one, but hate is a very strong word,

7. I don't understand, what you refer to ... Tonks home and child abuse? Sorry, not getting it.

8. Not sure about Order being completely ineffective, we just don't know about much (there are many stories, which don't conflict canon, and they show plenty of action and effect Order made in the life of many). Yes, whole “saving Harry from the Privet Drive” was completely brain-dead (why in the world he was staying there for two weeks, just to get two more weeks of a secure house?), and of course all scenarios of “Harry under the Invisibility Cloak goes to a bus station and drives to London” are valid.

9. We just may not know about it ... The Trio in woods didn't have the best news available. Also, how much you know about the underground activity against the Nazi regime in Germany during the Second World War? There was really not much to talk about, die Weiße Rose movement is so famous, because it even existed, but comparing to it The Order of Phoenix was the paramount of effectivity.

******** There is evidence of Malfoy avoiding Justice other than the Pottermore article. Namely Draco's son existing and being at a Hogwarts age. If Draco is had spent a decade in prison, Scorpius would be 7 during the epilogue, not 11.

As for the Tonks home, it repels the entirety of Voldemort's forces, himself including, at the end of the 7 Potter episode. And this was possible without Nymphadora being abused there, so this proves that there were alternatives to the Dursleys when it comes to protection, especially since Voldemort had Harry's blood and the protection at Privet Drive only covering the house and little else. So Harry would be vulnerable as soon as he went to fetch something from the shops.

As for the Order's inefficiency, just look at the losses they suffered. Based on the picture Sirius shows Harry, at least 80% of the members die until Voldemort is finally defeated. Most militaries consider 50% casualties for a unit catastrophic.

********* OK, I get the Draco not conceiving Scorpius while in Azkaban (although, at least in some Czech prisons in some time periods, it was possible for prisoner and his wife to be let alone in his room, for exactly this reason --- after all this doesn't help anybody if the prisoner's marriage falls apart because of sexual frustration), so you are possibly right. My main point was that we really don't know much what happened after the war (and OK, if Draco was in Azkaban, he could still manage to have eleven-year Scorpius conceived in 2005 and be for seven years in a prison), we certainly know nothing what happened to Lucius or Narcissa (although, she probably was the least punished ... [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/d0i11y/narcissa_organized_murder_of_her_cousin_sirius/][although]]).

Tonks parents? Yes, some warding charms apparently truly exists in the wizarding world, but they are not absolutely secure. Exactly Tonks' wards themselves were overcame and both of them were brutally tortured. Perhaps, the first attack was not done very well?

50% loss as catastrophic is for /military/ units. The Order was however not regular military. Consider losses of partisan units during The Second World War ... many of them were wiped out completely. Yes, it is a catastrophe, but they were group of volunteers fighting against organized military and whole Ministry, which was much closer to the reality of those resistance movements. And yes, obviously, JKR tried too hard to make her novels YA acceptable by keeping good guys (and gals) towards non-lethal guys. Real resistance movement would have to be more bloody.

********** And how would Malfoy find a wife while in prison? Tinder isn't exactly an option and if you are in for unforgivables, war crimes, torture and attempted murder, I doubt that they'd let him out to go on dates.

The canon line you refer to about the Tonks is rather inconclusive about what reallyhhappened and illogical since Edward, a Muggleborn, was left to go back home and not charged by Umbridge. And while the protection of all Order safe houses broke, that is another plot hole AND there is no telling if the chosen method would have disabled the protection at Privet Drive.

As for losses, well while partisan forces might have suffered catastrophic losses at times, against badly led forces even conscript units could do well. Simo Häyha, the most successful marksman in history who averaged 7-8 Soviets a day, was just a conscript. During the winter war, the Finnish managed a K:D of more than 10 because their opponents used the kind of stupid frontal assaults Voldemort ordered against Hogwarts. And they were a baldy outnumbered conscript force. I'd argue that you can compare the Order to that since quite a few members were fully trained Aurors (Moody, Tonks, Alice and Frank Longbottom) while others were combat capable as well (Sirius, James and Lily, Lupin, Dumbledore). The DA should be comparable to partisans, but the Order had too many professionals.

*** Everything after GoF tbh. Dumbledore was outsmarted in GoF, but he was just an idiot in OotP and HBP. Harry looked at a serpentine S inlaid with green stones and didn't connect it to Slytherin at all? Sirius being all mysterious about the mirror is hilarious in hindsight. Whole families were wiped out in the first war, Andromeda, Harry, Susan, Aberforth, etc. lost damn near everyone, but somehow 8/9 members of a family connected to Harry Potter managed to survive.

**** OotP is great IMO because it shows the true nature of the Ministry and Dumbledore's unwillingness to become a dictator even if he could so. Umbridge is a great antagonist who deserved more screen time in DH (and an appointment with the headman in the end). The darker tone certainly fits Voldemort's return.

But yeah, the Weasleys surviving 8/9 seems odd when everyone else is dying like flies. As Aurors, Tonks and Moody were certainly more combat capable than all Weasleys bar Bill (who should be equal to Tonks but still behind Moody).

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
