Can't remember the name of the fic nor are my searches yielding results. Harry was a Slytherin and an outcast, Sirius is free and I believe he's Dark, Harry is Voldemort's lover and goes to the Marking of the other Slytherin's. It isn't long nor is it complete which is a shame as the story has/had potential.

*** Hmm, I remember he returned to Hogwarts with the other Slytherins, Malfoy said they wouldn't follow him and he then destroyed Malfoy in a duel. Apart from that though there isn't many details I can remember.

***** FFN, about 6 months, after as Harry is known to Voldemort as a Horcrux, third, dark/horcrux Harry, it starts with their initiation in 6th year, pretty sure it was M rated, Harry is an outcast in Slytherin and bullied by the others, they think him weak and pitiful, then he turns up to their Marking, makes out with Voldemort, and then they return to Hogwarts, with the others saying they won't listen to Harry, then he beats up Draco in a duel to prove his dominance. If I recall correctly it was about 5 chapters.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
