I kind of want to read a fic where Voldemort actually goes to prison instead of getting killed (bc it just feels more efficient tho less dramatic). Doesn't have to be focused on Voldemort.

Why couldn't Dumbledore or OotP have just imprisoned the 'main soul' that makes up Voldemort instead of going to the trouble of finding all his Horcruxes while on a time limit? Technically if they didn't kill him his soul would have just stayed in his body and the Horcruxes would just sit there like they'd been doing for the past 10 yrs without a problem, and they could get around to slowly finding and killing them off while Voldemort was sitting in Nurmengard or something.


** If they were able to capture Voldemort, they could also:

- Push him through the most vigorous interrogation and make him spill ALL his secrets, including details on each of his Horcruxes
- Use Elderwand to obliviate him back to infancy, so that even if his wraith escaped in the very likely event, he would roam the mortal plane as a confused spirit until the end of times!
- Dose him with Draught of Living Death or petrify him outright
- Lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard

--------------

But I would say capturing Voldemort is significantly harder than destroying his body.

*** on the note of the obliviate im surprised wizards don't throw it around in battle more, considering what it did to Lockhart (tho I guess that would bring up the moral dilemma of doing stuff to an enemy that doesn't remember doing it)

@ the capture bit, true (for us muggles definitely) but also its a matter of idk, stupefy, as opposed to expelliarmus (which should honestly not be that effective)

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.

** You could even add some tension where one of the Death Eaters abandons Voldemort for being captured, and is also tracking down the Horcruxes to bring to life an earlier, less disappointing version of him

** How do you imprison an immortal man?

All the wardens die before him.

All the walls crumble to dust before him.

All his crimes will be forgotten.

And his anger only grows.

Dumbledore is old, and he definitely doesn't trust anyone with the Horcruxes. He doesn't know where any of them are, and it's only his own intelligence and power that allows him to find them and his staunch hate of all things dark that allows him to resist their immense power.

Anyone else is corruptible, not as motivated - and as time passes and the dust grows in Voldemort's cell, his crimes will grow faint in memory and the need to find his horcruxes does too. After all, he's contained, right?

And if it takes a thousand years for the prison to be forgotten, the magic holding it to dissapate and the walls to crumble, he still lives by the end of it, unopposed and terrible.

*** Do what every government does and offload the problem onto future generations. Lock him in Azkaban and enjoy a century of peace. By the time he dies of old age and escapes as a wraith it won't be your problem anymore.

**** He has a horcrux, it would be pretty idiotic a device and sacrifice if it didn't prevent death.

Never got this whole train of thought, where people made horcruxes weak as shit. That stuff is completely insane, rightfully so, and it is /powerful/.

Also, no. You don't willingly kill your descendants.
