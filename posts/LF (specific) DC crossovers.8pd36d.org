I'm looking for a couple of specific fanfics, but other suggestions are also welcome. I know I've read these but couldn't google them again.

Fic 1 is Harry transplanted to the DC universe, where he runs into Ivy and Harley Quinn. They take him in and he works with them. Ivy doesn't trust him and puts a seed in his brain so she can kill him instantly.

Fic 2 is Harry and the Scarlet Witch dropped into the DC universe. I think the first part is him searching for her; they have some nice epic battles near the end of the fic.

Thanks!


** You should flair your thread as "Fic Search" instead of "Request". :)

**** Yup! Under your text there should be an array of buttons - one of them will say "flair" and you can select them from a list. :)

It's nothing you really need to /apologize/, per say, but you get different kinds of people to read your thread based off of your flair. People who are willing to help look up a story, for instance, will look for "Fic Search" flairs, while others won't.

The difference is subtle, I'll admit. Technically you said you were "open to other suggestions", which would indicate a "Request" mindset, but you were predominantly /looking for/ a two specific fics, so this would be better suited /for you/ to be flaired as "Fic Search".

Anyways, "Request" is typically for people who have an idea of what they want to read and are requesting people suggest stories for them. "Fic Search" is for people who know what /fanfiction/ they want to read but, for whatever reason, can't find it. Maybe they can't remember the title or the place they knew to read it at was deleted.
