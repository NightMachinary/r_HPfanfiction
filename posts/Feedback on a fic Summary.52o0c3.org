Here's how the current summary goes:

- *With the powers of Gamer given to him Harry sets out to prove himself to the world of magic by becoming the best he can be despite the impossible odds against him! Watch our hero grow in this action filled adventure full of heart, humor & spectacle. And the occasional swear word. Politics!Action!Drama!Manipulation! OP Harry! Mindblowing Magic! Year-1 Complete!*

And here's the one that I've just written:

- *Harry often wonders how he's supposed to raise a baby Phoenix, learn obscure magic, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets and deal with political manipulations, all the while trying to make it through Hogwarts alive. And what about the fact that his own Mind might be his greatest enemy? 'Ping! +2 to WIS!'. Awesome! Totally worth the existential crisis!*

Do either one of these summaries seem to work? I'd really appreciate any suggestions, corrections or feedback.


** The second summary is not just significantly better than the first, it is orders of magnitude better than the first. But what's with the +2 to WIS thing? A Gamer fic?

*** linkffn(Harry Potter & the Game)

It isn't great, but if you like game!fics it is readable. Mostly a generic rehash with super!Harry except with constant(and I mean constant) repetition of his stat points.

  Harry often asked himself how he was supposed to raise a baby Phoenix, uncover the Founders' darkest secrets, learn obscure magic, and deal with political manipulations, all the while trying to make it through Hogwarts alive. Oh and his own mind could turn out to be his greatest enemy. There was that. 'Ping! 2 Points to WISDOM' Awesome! Totally worth the existential crisis!

** Start a forum on ffn and just update his stats in that(with each new chapter a reply to the previous chapter). I'm reading michaelsauve's harry potter rpg story and the repetition of stats is so fucking annoying.

*** Michaelsuave goes for a 'one level up every chapter' approach in his rpg story. It works well for a lot of people (including myself), but its quite understandable why seeing the same long stat text again and again when Harry levels up gets annoying to you.

My story goes a bit slower than his. The level ups(and thus showing the stats) happen in chapters 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 18 and 30.

Notice how the chapters between the level ups keep growing? That's because of a level up system that doubles the experience requirement at every level up. 400 for Lv2. then 800, then 1600, then 3200 and so on. Currently, at chapter 31, the experience requirement for next level is 819200.

That's pretty much the method I use to reduce the repetition of stats to minimal amounts. Its also helpful in making sure that the character stays OP, but doesn't really go to God levels.

Do you think that as a reader something like that would work for you in a story?

** I'm glad that feedback from your [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4wm688/got_a_bit_of_free_time_help_me_trope_my_fic/][last post helped]]. The second, even if I am a bit biased, is much better.
