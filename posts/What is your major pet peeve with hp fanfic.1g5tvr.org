** Slytherin "masks"/hiding their emotions, because it isn't really true in canon. Draco and Pansy are depicted as prone to yelling and being quite the opposite of poised. Most of the Syltherins were also very upfront and not underhanded when they were mean (the others such as Crabbe, Goyle, and Nott are either stupid and meek).

Going by canon character portrayal, they are the rejects house where the dumbest and most weak willed people go.

** Poor grammatical or punctuation structure.

Sounds nit-picky, but if my brain has to make up for sorting out which character is saying what because dialog "tags" are always after the words, and characters are shifting, it's a problem. That, or if when there are multiple paragraphs of dialog, and the non-end paragraphs have quotes at the end, it tends to ruin the flow.

Proper grammar can make up for a story that is lacking in characterization accurate to the books, or a plot that has holes in it.

Also chapters that have no plot significance but are just people out on a date or something equally realistic yet not really important. One of the things I like about the series is that every chapter had /something/ relevant to the plot, whether direct advancement or foreshadowing or establishing something for later. But when I see a fanfiction that devotes an entire chapter (or more) to a Hogsmeade date and nothing else, I'm left wondering "what's the point of this?"

**** It's been a while since I read through the series but I legitimately cannot think of a single chapter that didn't include at least one plot relevant detail. Strictly speaking, this is different from "everything had a reason for being there." For example, running into Lockhart at St. Mungo's was pure comic relief. But the chapter he was in served a purpose, namely showing the reader that Bode got a bedside plant for Christmas that ended up being an assassination via Devil's Snare. The epilogue is the only exception I can think of, and I'm not sure it should count for obvious reasons, but even it had a callback to Harry's own Sorting in the first book.

I'm open to counterexamples if you can find any.

EDIT: This can probably be read in a confrontational tone, which wasn't my intent. I just loathe having to slog through walls of text waiting for something to happen. Rowling managed to avoid this by dropping lots of little hints and tidbits that tie up neatly at the end of the plot, so I look for similar narrative quality elsewhere.

In other words, I believe quality should take precedence over quantity in regards to fluff that doesn't impact the plot.

****** Yeah. I decided to go ahead and take PS (since it's the shortest) and see exactly what was slipped into each chapter. It's surprisingly lengthy:

Chapter 1: Introduces the Dursleys, Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Hagrid, and tells the reader of Harry's backstory. McGonagall is revealed to be an Animagus, although we don't know it's called that.

Chapter 2: Introduces Mrs. Figg, reveals that Harry can talk to snakes.

Chapter 3: Marge is mentioned in passing. Harry gets his Hogwarts letters, hilarity ensues as Vernon and Petunia dispose of them en masse.

Chapter 4: Harry meets Hagrid, learns of his parents' death, gets to actually read his Hogwarts letter. Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in the past.

Chapter 5: Harry meets Quirrell en route to Diagon Alley. Hagrid fetches the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts, although we don't know that's what it is. Harry meets Draco. Harry's wand is linked to Voldemort's.

Chapter 6: Introduces Ron, Hermione, and Neville, while Draco gets a proper introduction. Nicholas Flamel is namedropped on Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog card. Hermione is a textbook bookworm and teacher's pet. Sets up the status quo between Harry and Draco.

Chapter 7: Introduces the house ghosts. The Sorting Hat tells Harry he would do well in Slytherin. Introduces Snape. Harry's scar hurts while looking at Snape and Quirrell. Introduces Peeves.

Chapter 8: Introduces the rest of Harry's main teachers. Quirrell's turban smells perpetually odd. Snape singles out Harry. Harry finds a newspaper that mentions an attempted robbery at Gringotts the same day he and Hagrid went.

Chapter 9: Harry becomes Seeker after demonstrating natural talent. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville meet Fluffy, Hermione notes the trapdoor, Harry deduces that whatever Hagrid picked up is beneath it.

Chapter 10: Harry's class learns /Wingardium Leviosa/ in class. Quirrell lets in the troll, Harry notices Snape lurking around. Hermione becomes friends with Harry and Ron after Ron uses /Wingardium Leviosa/ to knock it out.

Chapter 11: Harry sees Snape's injured leg and concludes he tried to get past Fluffy. Quirrell curses Harry's broom, although we think it's Snape. Hermione sets Snape on fire, knocking over Quirrell in her haste. Fluffy is revealed to belong to Hagrid.

Chapter 12: Ron is established to be good at chess. Harry receives a flute from Hagrid and his Invisibility Cloak, one of the Deathly Hallows, although we don't know about the latter tidbit until the last book. Harry finds the Mirror of Erised and learns of its power.

Chapter 13: Harry finds Nicholas Flamel on Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog card, deduces that the item Hagrid took out of Gringotts and is now guarded by Fluffy is the Philosopher's Stone. Harry eavesdrops on Snape and Quirrell, the former apparently threatening the latter.

Chapter 14: Hagrid gets Norbert, Harry and Hermione get detention when they're caught after leaving him with Charlie.

Chapter 15: Harry hears Quirrell begging for mercy from an unseen person. Detention ends up being in the forest, where Harry encounters Voldemort. Firenze gives us some exposition on the matter.

Chapter 16: We learn how Hagrid got Norbert while being , Dumbledore is absent, McGonagall and Snape are no help. Obstacles are oddly tailored to the trio's strengths and abilities.

Chapter 17: It was Quirrell the whole time, /le gasp./ Voldemort is under his turban. Philosopher's Stone is hidden inside the Mirror of Erised. Harry's touch is agony to Voldemort due to the power of love. We learn a little bit of the reasoning behind Snape's hatred of Harry.

** Overt character bashing. I am sick and tired of that shit. You want to make a character hateful? Fine. There are plenty of ways to do that that don't revolve around turning the character into a dumb prick. Evil, yes. Depraved, yes. But with motivations and actual planning, your hated character of the day can be both an ass /and/ look more like a human being.

Case in point: Snape. He's an ass in canon, but he's an ass for a reason. Yet almost all fics skip over the fact that he is actually fairly smart and go straight for the 'asshole' aspect of things.

If you want a simple fix for the situation, have him act as a triple agent as Voldemort has promised to rectify his error and bring Lily back from the dead if he did. Why faff around keeping Potter alive as penance when he can undo Lily's death instead? Make him a horrible ass? Give him a reason to be one.

As an aside, manipulative dumbledore plots that can be discovered/undone with a trip to Gringotts, vengeance fics in general (yes, there are some fine ones, but where?) and super-duper-hyperpowered characters that don't use their power in an adequate manner are all fic-breakers in my book.

If you write the most powerful wizard in human history into your fic, then have your wizard/witch do things that are commensurate to the level of power he/she possesses. If you want an idea on how to achieve this, read 'the wizard of the kaleidoscope'. Otherwise, don't bother-giving them cool powers to use that they may employ once is kinda pointless.

TL;DR: Bashing, easily undone manipulations, badly handled superpowers. Those are my pet peeves.

Harry with the patronus is the only time i think its even really demonstrated that some magics are harder to preform than others, and that was arguably do to the emotional component of the spell as most (?) of the DA were able to cast the wispyness of the spell after only a lesson or two.

********* I've read a debate about the Avada Kadavra curse and battling a few years ago (before book 6&7) and the general consensus was that the curse itself was like the patronus in that there was a strong emotional element to the curse, which we now know is wanting kill someone aka "you have to mean it", and that this needs a level of focus.

If we stick to that vain of thinking and look at the people who cast the spell they are all, as Ron would say, mental.

Contrary to popular option the desire to actually kill someone is hard to manifest and maintain, and the dark lord can do it because he's a genius level psychopath. Moreover, in a battle situation (from what ive learned from friends in the army) is that is less about killing the enemy and more about not letting your self get killed, so focus and maintain the required feels need might have more to do with it than a 'magical core'.

If this were true it would mean that magic in the potter universe was actually to the amount of emotion, focus and creativity a wizard/witch could maintain during a battle/whatever, and would equal out that actual magic as a base resource is unlimited for all wizards.

********** 1) It is a great hypothesis and deduction you have made. However, the problem occurs when you get to writing a story. If nobody tires from doing magic then you can theoretically have a battle that will last forever if you can keep a cool head.

One of the reasons people make it draining, is to indicate that what they have done is worth something and/or to indicate that they aren't invulnerable or overpowered.

You can also use it as a way of indicating, that the person is progressing. Having him become better attuned with his magic or 'training his core' is suddenly a small sub plot in and off itself.

2) You are talking about the military. The differences between the armed forces and the Death Eaters are almost everywhere. Where they are sent in to help a community the Death Eaters seek to destabilize and cause mayhem. They are not looking to get out of there, because they have gone in there to find their victims, they want to murder, that is how they show their power. By having them fire off.. say 5 quick AK's each and then leave you have a very effective hit and run tactic that does everything their goal is. Then they are also able to quickly run away.

*********** Theoretically, if one could keep a cool head during battle then yes, case in point would be Dumbledore and why he was such a powerful dualist he was able to keep the enemy off their toes thus weakening their ability to focus. However, unless someone was writing a Powerful!Harry fic, Harry just isnt that level headed naturally until the last two chapters of the book where he has become 'enlightened' and has no fear of death.

But you are right, I can see why a magical core is a more used theory in fanfics, the west capitalistic mentality draws us towards cause and effect characteristics of magic. You train your 'core', your core gets 'bigger' and you became a more powerful wizards. This then breaks the character away from other wizards 'who just arent trying hard enough' or you get into the grounds of 'he was just born with it', which sort of undermines the whole us vs them of oftp and de, imo.

I know its sacrilege, and i don't want to sound like a hippy, but there's not a whole lot of difference between military tactics and terrorist. The military is most certainly not to help communities, they are there to come in and take over places where they usually have no right in taking and then enforcing their ideologies upon the population. To that end, ideally the Death Eaters don't want mayhem, they want silent compliance and in the book use both Nazi and Orwellian methods to maintain control, subtlety and fear being the pillars of the voldy-ministry . People don't get killed by the death eaters in the street, this wouldnt be the show of power they want. If you talk out/or against the government you disappear, its a far more fear inspiring tool than dropping into town and randomly killing folk because that causes an outrage sort of fear and gives people an enemy they can see rally and fight against.

************ They actually do want the mayhem as far as the sources go. One of the order's main focuses is/was to help defend muggle places, because they were often seen practicing muggle hunting or muggle baiting. However you want to call it.

To say the military does not help the community is because you do not understand what the military is doing. In by far the most cases where a force is stationed in another country their job is to protect the peace. Yes, the Death Eaters are somewhat seeking the silent complacency, but at the same time they hunt those they do not like or that don't fit their description of the ideal servant. They do actually kill people on the street. Try reading Half-Blood Prince again. They constantly check the newspaper for more deaths. One of them being a little kid killed by Greyback for no purpose what so ever.

************* I would strongly disagree, Death eaters don't want to cause mayhem in the wizarding world because it doesn't make sense for them to do so, thus they chose the muggle world, but we're not talking about the muggle world. What the death eaters want on a fundamental level, in their own twisted way, is to protect the wizarding world from what they see as a colonizing force in the shape of mugglesborns and muggleness threating the pureblood way of life. Muggle baiting and the like arent for reason of chaos, there means of entertainment and dissociation with muggles as human. The only true act of terror by death eaters in the books is at the match, every other murder committed by the death eaters has been either at a house, or people have been taken away, there isnt a mention of any attacks in broad daylight against wizards in the streets unless the wizard being taken puts up a fight.

As for the military, I can see you wanting to be ideological but 'protect the peace' isnt what a military is for when stationed in another country. The good that you think you see is happy slap reporting for the dominating forces. When a military is placed into a hostile zone it is for two main reasons: seek and destroy an enemy or resource of the invading country (even though this enemy might be a hero in the resting country) and colonization (if they think like us, they wont be our enemy).

** Wow. I have so many things that just turn me away from some of the fics.

- First off: Severus Snape centered fics or anything about him being a good guy. I hate that man, and he is creepy as hell. To suddenly turn him into some lovable guy even to the point of pairing him with one of the characters.... yuck. I really can't stand the thought of a 30 something year old starting a relationship with a person not even of legal age.. /makes me cringe/

- Second: Slash with people confirmed not to be gay by J.K.

- Redicilously fast paced / bad writing. Some people make changes to the society like there's nothing holding Harry back. All he has to do is think he wants it and BAM it's done.

The easiest example is in the romance genre where everything just flowers and sunshine because they both know they like each other. Come on! Give us some conflict!

- Harry suddenly knows everything about the wizarding world because he read a letter (often something his parents or Sirius left him in Gringotts)

- Harry all powerful. He is not going to be more powerful that Dumbledore and Voldemort just because he decided he wants to go against them. Also, stop with the magical barriers excuse. Make him work for it.

I can understand the fics where it is because he is sent back in time, which leads me to

- Time jump fictions, where everything happens that is in the book. Have you ever heard about actions and consequences? If things don't happen the way they did in canon I think there is a pretty good chance the future will change.

- Dumbledore is an evil manipulative bastard but his weakness is Harry being stubborn. A) I can kind of get why you make Dumbledore behave like that, but I don't agree. However B) He is over a hundred years old. If you say he has been a manipulating and scheming master for almost all that time, just giving Harry a backbone won't change that. C) If something doesn't work the first time, he probably won't go do it again. Again I stress the fact that he is very old and has probably done so before.

- Evil and or dumb Weasleys. It just doesn't sit well with me. Especially making Ginny working as a sort of whore for Dumbledore, where their plan is for her to ensnare Harry. There are plenty of reasons why I don't think this should be written, but I understand it is because some people just don't like the Weasleys and it is the easiest way of having Harry distance himself from them.

- As other people mentioned: redicilous thing like Harry suddenly playing the guitar etc.

- Draco/Hermione. I have never read any of the stories surrounding this fic pairing, but I just don't see it happening.

Often it is explained as him just acting, and in reality he is a completely different kind of person, or something like that.

Pick a time or times and if you want to including something you're not sure about then google it and make sure. In short, sloppy research.

I also can't stand the majority nicknames. I read mostly Hermione x Severus fics and if I go to start a new one and see "'Mione", "Mia", "Herms", "Sev" or any other variation it's usually an insta-close. IF the writing is decent, I'll let "'Mione" go, even though I think it's awful.

I guess that I always pictured Draco as prejudiced but more forced than anything else. Just like Harry was molded by Dumbledore, he was molded by his father. Besides that major flaw I always thought Draco was relatively intelligent. Whilst his academic history is never mentioned, undertaking the task of fixing the vanishing cabniet must have required some decent form of intellect.

From that point I guess that Draco was the only character with the ability to intellectually challenge Hermiome... In comparison to Ron :/ Who whilst a great character mocks Hermione's intelligence and drive to study a handful of time in each book. It was more a forced pairing (from my PoV).

I do not like the pairing when Hermione is OOC. Draco has to also relatively in character but the more they can keep him in char and develop a sound plot, the better the story can be.

Edit: if you have the time the last one on the list is a well written war fic which starts out herm/ron.

Acknowledge that way back in the past, that relationship and feeling had an impact on making a decision as to which side to follow - and than end it there. Most people don't need a constant driving obsession to continue a particular course they have set themselves on, and an obsessed character is rarely a fun read.

Also it's easier to think of Snape as a character if you pretend/remind yourself that most glimpses we were given in canon of him was through the somewhat biased eyes of Harry who being a teenager would have a natural tendency of exaggerating all characteristics and behaviour of a person he found distasteful and abhorrent. Because teens tend to do that.
