Ok guys, slytherin here who is on her way to writing an HP fan fiction and would love to get your advice.

Myself, I have read many HP fan fictions, more than I can count. Some of the stories I've read have been good, and some have been bad but nearly all of them get something not quite right, and that's their depiction of the slytherin house. Haha that kinda rhymes! Anyways, I have a list of mistakes that writers make when writing a slytherin student or the house as a whole, but I want to hear from you guys!

Of course this isn't in anyways calling out anyone, I just want to know what you guys think so I can make my fan fiction the best it can be. I see myself making the same stereotypical mistakes everyone makes, so I want to avoid that.

Anyways, what do you guys think?


** Hmm, I think what comes to mind for me is less specific mistakes and more different tropes/interpretations. That being said, the takes I find most jarring when it comes to Slytherin are ones which seem to forget that they're still children/teenagers or the ones which treat them all as one homogeneous group.

Those apply to both positive versions (where they're ~classy~ and ~mysterious~ with pureblood rituals and nobility) and negative ones (where they're all sadists and occasionally rapists). Even in a group of likeminded people, there's going to be differences of opinion and personality. Slytherin /is/ different than the other houses due to the nature of the wizarding world politics but not to that extent.

*** As you say, things change depending on tropes you are avoiding, following, or subverting. While many people hate the scheming machiavellian 11 year olds of some Slytherin fics, there is still a lot of people that want that.

So personally, I'd say the biggest mistake in writing Slytherin is in making characters one dimensional. That doesn't mean everyone has to secretly be sympathetic, they can still be utter bigoted twats, but you can make them more than that. Give Flint a Grandma that scares him, Daphne self esteem issues with living up to her mother, etc.

The next mistake is a lack of internal consistency. Sometimes people complain about realism, but this is fantasy, it doesn't matter if your Slytherin school children are realistic, as long as they are internally consistent. For example, of literally every Slytherin is a master manipulator by the age of 11, then they would probably constantly be taking advantage of the other normal 11 year olds. If the cunning back stabbing ness of Slytherins is a learned behavior, have them get better as time goes on. If you want Draco Malfoy to "rule" his house from the get go you better provide a good reason for why 17 year olds would ever bother to pay attention to an 11 year old.

**** I completely agree. The ones which bug me are very much a personal preference and how they're written ultimately matters just as much or more than the tropes themselves.

If Slytherin characters are going to be taking a backseat in your narrative, then being on the one-dimensional side doesn't matter as much. You can leave them with the depth afforded to them within the original series - or less - based on the story. If they're going to play the starring role, however, then there should be an effort made to flesh them out.

** Rather than mistake, I will rather talk about "interpretations" of certain authors that, while not having any problem on their own right, don't have any canon evidence (I didn't say your fanon suck, please don't kill me).

- 11 years old politicians : In some fic, it's like every child sorted in Slytherin is some kind of master tactician who already has "a plan" to take over the world. These Slytherin children also talk has if they were into some kind of Renaissance Fair (while I'm at it, Harry calling a girl Miss something at the end of every sentence while she answer with Mister Potter is not flirting).\\
  I think this fanon theory is wrong, mainly because for most (if not all) of the serie, Draco comes more as some immature teen than a master politician, most of his plots being . . . childish. And even without him . . . Crabe and Goyle.
- Clear leadership : in a lot of Slytherin Harry fic, the house seem to have some kind of organisation, with some students clearly at the top. These "leaders" ever appear in the form of a council, or a Trimvirat. These students "control" the house and can force other to do things (like stopping them to have friends in other houses).\\
  I am personally doubtfull that a house full of kid (because that's what they are) would have a clear organization like this, especially about the fact that they could hide it from other houses (and sometimes even teachers). They are kid, let them act like this. Even if a leader appear, he could as well be a unofficial leader (you don't need a title to be listened).
- Unidimensional House : as said by solarityy, in somes fics, all Slytherin are the same. All the man are some kind of young lord soooo mysterious, and all the girls are some noble lady who are waiting into their ivory tower for a brave knight to take their heart. In others, all the guy are sadic rapist and pretty much 90% of the girls got their cherry forcefully picked by the time they reach 4th year and live in terror.\\
  All the other Houses have both good and bad characters, let Slytherin have that (oh and general I think one rapist into a serie is bad taste, let alone 1/8th of the population, especially in a society who is very advanced with Sex Equility thanks to magic being an equalizer, and where the limited marriage prospect means that the boys of the house would usually have to marry a girl who would have been rapped by half the Boys her age, including the now husband).

Basically, I think the mistake a lot of authors make is to separate Slytherin House from the other Houses. It's true than in canon they are the House where most bad guys come from, but not all Slytherin are Blood Purist Death Eater and not all Death Eater are Slytherin. Hogwarts has 4 Houses, not 3 Houses + Slytherin.

Wouldn't this completely undermine the Prefect system?

**** Probably. Though just to play the devil advocate, it can be argued that if you are good enough to "rule" the house, you are probably already a prefect.

** 1. Flair incorrect , it is a discussion not a request of fanfiction within criteria.
2. You will have to give some example as I personally did not find in the fandom any anomalies of depiction of Slytherin House. It is possible I did not it as I did not read all of the Fanfics written so some examples of your allegation are necessary for me.
