** It is not that aurors are useless so much that they are not only understaffed but also have to fight with one hand behind their back and only use the "nice" spells.

Anyway, what exactly do you mean "not essentially a god"? You mean as in where he isn't OP or just where people treat him more casually?

*** Where he isn't way OP like I enjoy fics where he's feared but when he's somehow invincible starts getting boring. I get that he's powerful and really knowledgeable but making him completely and utterly invincible and the only one who stands a chance against him being Dumbledore or somehow Harry is irritating.

**** A Black Comedy is one where Voldemort and the Death Eaters are treated more as terrorists, although people are still scared of him.

But yeah, there aren't many fics where Voldemort is easily fought by other people aside from Dumbledore.

***** i'd say a lot of fics still treat him on the same level as dumbledore, possibly better when its clear from the ootp fight scene that dumbledore could easily take him in a fight. voldemort would never be willing to duel 1 on 1 though like grindelwald.

****** Not sure about easily. Dumbledore is old, after all. A drawn out fight might end up being on Voldemort's favor.

Voldmort just feels too paranoid and afraid to die to engage without being certain of his victory.

******** Yeah, it is not like we have countless canon examples of how physically stressful magic use can be or anything.

It is not like people are clearly strained overusing their magic and pass out, get tired or anything.

Not like duelling has a lot of moving around and dodging or nothing.

********* And yet with age comes power. There's no 20 year old spell slinging monster. Dumbledore easily handled Voldemort. Maybe those dodgy straining people need to get better at magic, stop being such rookies.

Relative to age, why? Just because older people can't run as well as young people doesn't mean they can't cast spells as well/better.

The better you are at magic, the less of this is required. Pretty sure I remember Dumbledore kind of sedately walking through the ministry while schooling Voldemort, though admittedly I could be mistaken here.

********** He was walking fairly chill. Harry describes him as super casual during the duel with the most feared wizard ever. Plus he didn't need to dodge the killing curse he was just sending in statues in front of him. I feel like people just remember the movies.

******* i mean he's old but so is voldemort. voldemort is like 70 and dumbledore is 100ish in a universe that people regularly live to be like 150. in the scene of their battle voldemort is terrified and dumbledore only becomes scared when he thinks harry is in danger

******** That is still a significant difference. About 40 years difference is nothing to sneeze at.

Plus, Voldemort might have lived for 70, but his body was probably about 11 years younger since he did that ritual and got back his old body from before he killed the Potters and got smited for his trouble.

****** I never understand why people think that Dumbledore won that duel. Voldemort fled, yes, but not because of Dumbledore, but because of the arrival of a large number of Ministry staff.

The OotP fight shows Voldemort as a stronger duellist that Dumbledore. Dumbledore required the intervention of Fawkes to take a Killing Curse that was otherwise going to hit him. So if it had been a 1 on 1 fair fight, Voldemort would have won - the only reason why Voldemort didn't kill Dumbledore in OotP is an outside party saved Dumbledore's life. /And/ Dumbledore had the Elder Wand in that duel.

******* That fight was definitely a strategic win for Dumbledore.

[ ] Capture Tom

[ ] Capture Bellatrix

[x] Keep HP alive

[x] Make sure Tom/Death eaters kill no more people

[x] Showcase to the world that Tom is still alive

[x] Get the Ministry of Magic on his side (or at least neutral, with him being a fugitive before)

[x] Stay alive

For no cost.

Meanwhile Tom did not get the prophesy, did not cause damage to HP, did not cause damage to Dumbledore and got exposed to the world.

For it not being a fair fight, yeah, but both had 'cheats' and problems. Dumbledore had to defend HP.. while Tom had cheats in the form of out-of-body-possession, horcruxes and the ability to throw illegal spells.

******** The question as to who gained more strategically from events is distinct from what the duel tells us about the characters' fighting abilities.

Also in the books Dumbledore doesn't have to defend Harry during the duel. He gives Harry a magical guardian before they begin fighting and doesn't have to do anything further to keep Harry safe.

Further, Voldemort using his innate magical abilities isn't really a cheat - those abilities are part of his fighting ability, unlike reliance on allies.
