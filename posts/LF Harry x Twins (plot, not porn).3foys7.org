Basically the title. Name your best!


** As in the Harry is in a relationship with the Weasley twins? Or the Patil twins? Or the Carrow twins? Or random twins?

Or Harry /has/ a twin?

Really need a bit more than the title here.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has finally had enough of Ron's thick-headed ways and takes Padma for a dance at the Yule Ball while his own date, Parvati, watches on. Harry's Gryffindor chivalry leads him clueless through the halls of Hogwarts to the Ravenclaw common room, where a rather pleasant ending to a great night awaits him. Rated 'M' for a reason. Harry/Padma/Parvati

  Harry is depressed. He has no sexuel experience and his relationship with Ginny fails. Parvati wants to help him by giving him experience. Her sister is also included. See what happens. My first Harry/Parvati/Padma story. Hope you enjoy it. And please be lenient, my English is not perfect.
