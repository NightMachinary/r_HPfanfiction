For some reason I want to read about Harry potters time at hogwarts , but with out all the plot about Voldemort, like a slice of life fic , with Harry doing normal kid / teen things, like asking a girl on a date , fighting with friends , having fun with quidditch. That kind of stuff

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD. DISCONTINUED

** linkffn(12085137) Seven Normal Years of Harry the Hufflepuff.

Voldemort didn't read the fine print on Horcruxes and dies permanently the first time around. Harry ends up in Hufflepuff and just ends up having a relatively normal life at Hogwarts because Voldemort isn't there to make it miserable.

Story's told in the form of diary entries.

  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU

** Harry is a dragon, and that's okay LinkFNN(13230340) is a very relaxing read, mostly with this slice of life. Has one of the best Dumbledore I've ever read in a fic too.
