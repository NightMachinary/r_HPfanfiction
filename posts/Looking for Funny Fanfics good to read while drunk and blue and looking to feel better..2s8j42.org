I have a friend who's sometimes been feeling depressed, so I'm going to give this friend a bottle of rum or vodka, and some fanfic recommendations, to read next time they feel down so they feel happier. Off the top of my head I thought of A Black Comedy, but looking for all kinds of recommendations for someone to read while drunk/sad to make them happy.


** Here's one that's good for a chuckle. Snape advises his Fifth Year Slytherins on choosing a career.

** I've always thought that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again]] is the written equivalent of comfort food.

** [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2rbxpf/what_is_the_funniest_fanfic_you_read/][Try this]], there were some great responses there.

I'm going to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors Never Die]] again, drinking is very relevant.

** I generally find it's not a good idea to get somebody drunk if they are already sad. It usually leads to further sadness.

That being said, Rorschach's Blot is good for such drunken times.
