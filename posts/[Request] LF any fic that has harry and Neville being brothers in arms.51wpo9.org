** Linkffn(The Marriage Contracts Redux) As hilarious as it is, this story does need a shot: "I'm Neville Longbottom, the Man-Who-Held-Harry's-Cloak-While-He-Killed-the-Dark-Lord."

*** I read 'cloak' as something else. I was like, "Now that's going to be good."

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.
