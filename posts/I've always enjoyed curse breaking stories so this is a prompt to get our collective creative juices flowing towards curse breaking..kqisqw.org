I took a stab at writing this out like a one shot. I believe it could be cleaned up and expanded into an interesting fic or just used as the prompt for a good curse breaking story.

Most historians will agree that the noble art of curse breaking started soon after the fall of the Egyptian empire. Before the Egyptians, magic users believed in burying their dead in a manor that allowed them to become one with the earth and magic. This all changed due to the influence of Egyptian culture. Magic users of great power often have egos of proportionate size. If a non-magical pharaoh can have a tomb that contains all his worldly possession you can bet magic users will not only do the same but try to do it better. The tombs of the pharaoh's were usually well known and protected by guards. Magic was only used to keep the tombs in good repair and keep out vermin. The tombs of the most powerful magic users however were protected by every bit of magic their owners could throw at them and their locations were never shared.

While the Egyptian empire remained in power only the most desperate would attempt to steal from a pharaoh's tomb and nobody was stupid enough to try to find a magical tomb. As the years past and the empire fell into ruin, looting of the tombs of the pharaoh's became a tempting endeavor. However, knowledge of the locations of many of the tombs was lost with the empire. With the rise of the Roman empire and the discovery of wands more magic was available to the average magic user. It was due to the discovery of wands and the vast hidden wealth of the Egyptians that curse breaking was born.

Originally curse breaking was quite simple since the pharaoh's tombs only used Egyptian runes and rituals. To keep the muggles happy, the magic users of the time would open the tombs, take most of the valuables and reseal the tombs after removing all traces of magic. The magic users would get most of the treasure and the muggles would get to find the tombs and believe they had been unopened. This policy kept tensions in the area to a minimum and eventually played well with the statue of secrecy once it was put in place.

Once the pharaoh's tombs had been pillaged, curse breakers turned their sites on the tombs of their fellow magic folk. This is when curse breaking became and art and quite deadly. The tombs of the pharaoh's strictly used Egyptian magic. The greatest magic users of the time would not have limited themselves in this way. Most minor magic users only learn the magic of the locations where they live most of their lives. The strongest and smartest of magic users though often traveled to different parts of the world learning every form of magic they came across. In an effort to protect their legacy and wealth the full breath of their magical knowledge was used to protect their final resting places. Curse breakers believing they could break into these tombs with just a knowledge of Egyptian magic soon found themselves in their own graves.

Now you may be asking yourself why is curse breaking still a job these days. Shouldn't all the tombs have been found. Surely with so many years and the advancement of magic all those tombs should be empty by now. You would be correct. Most historian agree that it is very likely that all the original tombs created in the time of the Egyptians have been found and plundered. However, the Egyptians had started a trend amongst curse breakers and the most powerful of magic users. The creation of their own final resting places that of course contained wealth and knowledge for anyone smart or powerful enough to bypass the tombs defenses. Each magic user would use all the knowledge and skill they gained over a lifetime to make a stronger and better tomb then the ones that came before them. Each magic user (known as wizards or witches today) keeps the knowledge of the location of their tomb a secret and every curse breaker agree to not go looking for someone else's tomb until the curse breaker dies. This gives the curse breaker the time and experience needed to build a challenging tomb and fill it with a lifetime's worth of treasure and knowledge.

This trend of creating ones own resting place is still used by wizards today. It is theorized that Grindelwald built his tomb under Nurmengard. Many believe the prison is just the first level of protection used by Grindelwald to safeguard his tomb. Many believe that Albus Dumbledore has created a resting place for himself under Hogwarts. However, with the recent discovery of the Chamber of Secrets under Hogwarts this theory is being greatly questioned.

This could be a good starting point for an after the war fic where everyone starts to look for Dumbledore and Gridelwald's tombs. Just pretend the "tomb" that Dumbledore is laid to rest in on Hogwarts grounds is a monument and his body is magically moved to his tomb. This could be a really good "Ready Player One"/"Tomb Raider"/"Harry Potter" type fic.


** Chapter 18 of the story 'surrogate' on ao3 by author 17734 has the coolest description of curse breaking that I've ever read in a fic, if you're interested in that sort of thing! If Bellatrix/Voldemort isn't your jam you can still read most of the chapter and have it make sense if you just skip of the part where Bellatrix and Voldemort are talking alone and only read the part that Voldemort is breaking an ancient Egyptian curse placed on the wife of a professor he wants to employ (which is most of the chapter).
