I'm looking for something new to dive into, and I was thinking about the characters I haven't seen focused on before. So, in that vein, does anyone have anything Arthur-centric that they would recommend? He's one of my favorites, but he doesn't often get much attention, so I'm interested to see if there's anything like that out there!

I'm ok with any genre, rating, pairings, etc. I'm easy to please lol.


** This author writes about when Petunia Dursley and Arthur Weasley meet, have an on-and-off relationship, and correspond with each other. It's more Petunia-centric than Arthur-centric though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee]]

*** I was just going to write this one down. I have made even my story to this universe as linkao3(18770464), when linkao3(13682133) was just at the chapter 3.

  This was the craziest thing Petunia decided to do in her life: speak the truth. Also, how parents disappoint us.

  (Sequel to Petunia's Invitation) Evanses, Dursleys, Weasleys, Potters... All these families, past and present, and all of them a source of some strife or another. Petunia doesn't seem to be able to disentangle herself from any of them.

** There is a Snape/Arthur fic on AO3, but I am struggling to find it again.

Just entering "Arthur Weasley" into the searchbox got me over 5000 results.

EDIT: There seems to be whole series focused on Molly, no clue how good it is.
