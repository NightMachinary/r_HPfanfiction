Does anyone know if there is a story out there where Voldemort's eyes were talked about as much as Harry's killing curse green eye's are normally in fandom?


** His cold eyes were as red as the crucio curse, reflective of the hate for his enemies that had once been his friends

*** Oh! The crucio curse works as well! I figured it would be the disarming charm because Harry's is always compared to Voldemort's killing curse. But I like this version too! It's very poetic.

**** That's true! I should've added an /s but it's fine lol I picked cruciatus bc it goes with the theme of unforgivables. But imagine having yellow eyes the color of the imperius curse

******* I can definitely see ocd control issues coming from a quidditch referee. But I don't think it would be all that flattering for your eyes to be compared to the imperious curse (of course I don't think it's all that flattering for harry to have to be killing curse green) Imagine hooch being on a date and her partner true too woo her by telling her how controlling her stare is...in a spell way...like the imperious curse.

****** Well the wiki artical itself is based on both but the color is likely based on the movies as I don't remember a color being mentioned in regards to the cruciatus curse in the books. But I could be wrong.

Some people would say that the movie version is just a very expensively done fanfic of the book. The harry potter movies however turned out quite well if you can compare them to most other adaptations of other good book series. Take Percy jackson as an example.

  A strong Witch or Wizard almost always has a soulmark. Still, it is a rare and private enough phenomenon that the concept of Soulmates is rarely spoken about in polite company.A soulmark can take on a variety of shapes --- the first words one's soulmate says to them, a symbol specific to their soulmate, one of their iconic phrases, a symbol that represents their bond, or even their soulmate's name.There is a problem, however, in that until the younger of the pair is born, the older does not receive their soulmark.
