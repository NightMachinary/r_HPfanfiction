When Harry or sometimes Hermione goes back in time to Tom Riddle's childhood they seem to just fall in love with him. Even worse is when they fall in love with him in the modern day after they know everything he has done.

Yes, being good at chess just shows that he is good at analyzing when he has some idea of what he is doing or what to expect, which is essential in chess.

But it's more like "Fred and Jorge always make a joke when they give me a birthday present, so I'll be careful."

Not to manipulate every detail, including their first encounter as a big scheme to manipulate Harry and take over the world. At 11 years of age.

** A really minor, commonly used plot for fluffy Harry/Ginny fics - the pair are seperated because Harry is at "Auror Academy" or Ginny is at "Harpies Training Camp".

My first issue is that there's no reason for them to live seperately or have weeks of absence between them - they can apparate wherever they want, they don't need to live near work.

My second is that I've never heard of top athletes having to live at training centres and not being allowed to see family and friends? Is there some sport I'm unaware of where the whole team has to live together?

Finally, where has this concept of auror academy come from? In OOTP they hadn't hired anyone in three years, so I doubt they have enough recruits to justify a little college type place for them to go to. It seems to me they probably learn on the job and all the training and exams are done within the department/Ministry.

** Sirius always getting killed. Like almost every time, without fail. Just why? I understand wanting to make Harry the MC, making Harry go through hardships and the like, but having an adult that he can trust, would be great for him.

Even with him free, if Harry (has to) stay at the Dursley's, for whatever reason, he can do it until x amount of time and then go live with Sirius.

Without fail Harry and Hermione are best friends. Rather Ron joins them or Draco or someone else, is another matter. I love Hermione, don't get me wrong here. But, at the same time. Why? You have so many other characters you can play with.

But then: Instead of making personalities to like Blaise or Susan or whoever, they're Ron Weasley 2.0 or Hermione Granger 2,0 I understand it's difficult making different personalities, but come on. It'd be better to use Ron and Hermione instead, if you're doing that.

*** I always thought an interesting way of doing it might be more akin to having his brother need extra attention for reasons. Maybe the killing curse had a negative effect on his magic (if he's the bwl) and now any magic cast nearby might cause him to have a magical meltdown as his magic tries to protect him. James and Lily have to spend more time with them to try and stop these or maybe try to fix them.

I'd see them as still trying to spend time with Harry, Lily having a film night with him or reading to him/James having one on one time with him too. But sometimes Lily is tired and falls asleep even though she tries to always make time for him. Sometimes meltdowns happen during 'Harry time' so they need to cut it short. Sometimes James gets called into work unexpectedly.

So he's not neglected, they do care for him but he can be put to the side a bit at times. Sort of more like a child with severe health issues and the healthy sibling. It gives you a lot of room for sibling relationships too and how you'd want to do them.

** Honestly, Draco x Hermione makes no sense.

it would be like pairing a black person with a white supremacism or a Jew with a Nazi.

the thing is, you could write a story about a nazi falling in love with a Jew you would have to be a talented author and exploring the Nazi realizing the belief system he was bought up in is wrong and growing as a person.

But draco x hermione fics never do that, in most I have seen, he just insults her alot and eventually they fall in love with not exploring the fact that draco was brought up with an extremely terrible mindset that requires effort to shed so they just sweep away that he was young wizard hitler youth and make him a snarky bastard.

I notice its quite common in fandoms to have relationships that seem quite abusive and toxic being cheered on as romantic.

I honestly find it quite disturbing, with kids shipping it makes more sense as they are still growing as people and might look back and go that shit was fucked. but then you have grown ass adults doing those stories and its like fuck dude.

***** I once read a story about that very topic. It was where draco was a Jewish wizard. And Harry grew so sick of his Pureblood BS. That he did some spell where Draco dreamed about living In WW2 era and finding out what it was like to be hated for BS reasons. As for where the Jewish part was explained. Well there is a bit about Creative license where nazis were not controlled by Grindlewald and The malfoy (Dracos grandfather) family left France to avoid The whole Nazi stuff. It turned out thats why Malfoys hated Muggles. Before they were indifferent. But anyways, Draco would dream everynight about living in (Don't Remember where) Under Nazi rule and being forced to hide what he was (Jewish That is) without realizing he's dreaming. And when he wakes up he slowly realizes that he is for all intents the same kind of individual that the Nazis were. Hating someone for things out of their control. And everyday he starts to change, Going through stages. Denial, Blaming others, Self doubt, Disgust, Self loathing and remorse. Not exactly in that order.

I agree on principle with what you're saying here. The thing is the polarization of JKR's world. Your idea of making him struggling with his own internal beliefs is compelling as long as he didn't end up basically espousing Hermione's beliefs at the end and so having nothing of his former self because he end up forsaking everything for his righteous muggleborn girlfriend.

The thing is HP is pretty black and white with cartoonish bad guys. Draco and his family are one of them. There is nearly no middle ground or "grey area". So either you have to totally remake the worldbuilding and bring so nuance which is taxing. Or having Draco switching personality and character to become a Gryffindor with a green tie.

** Rich Harry and manipulative Dumbledore. What surprises me the most in this trope is that Dumbledore has to steal from Harry. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore has been a professor for at least 86-87 years (1910-1997) and headmaster for 41 years(1956-1997). He also holds two of the highest positions in Wizarding World- CHIEF WARLOCK of Wizenagamot and SUPREME MUGWUMP of the International Confederation of Wizards for presumably many years. I'd be surprised if he is not 5 times richer than Harry is.

** I figure it's all too easy to think of things that make no sense in time-travel fics, but what seems to be my pet peeve is when our time-travelling protagonist (and it doesn't seem to matter if it's Harry, or Hermoine or xyz..) is superior in every way to all of the wizardkind of the days they travelled to. In power (oh the power...), wit, skill, snark, intelligence, and emotional detachment, if you can call that a superior trait 🤷‍♀️ Not to mention how they seem to memorise all the events and their contexts of a century ㅡ bullshit by the way, who can even pretend to know what anything was like? You can only parse the information and stories passed on by those who lived it ㅡ and they're the only ones with a shred of capability to affect it, of course.

Before anything, humans are quite irrational. They have faults (other than being ~too jaded), agendas, fears etc. Fine, your OP OOC Hermoine prepared well, she knows what she's set out to do and she won't take shit from nobody! But she should still be affected by whatever circumstance or environment she threw herself into, have doubts, deal with loneliness etcetcetc And in the same tangent, she can't possibly be so superior that no witch or wizard of that age with their own agends has any way of thwarting her...

On second thought, it seems I actually have problem with OP characters in general. What's a story without conflict? Without payoff? What is the point?

** Look, I don't read those but I feel like most of those stories exist to try and make a Voldemort pairing work but for whatever reason the authors never decide to go with, "What if Harry and Voldemort were contemporaries?" (meaning they were born in the same year... or, possibly, one was the year before the other so they go to school at the same time). I guess some of them want the scarcrux but if that's not a feature of the fic, I don't get the point of using time travel in it.

(If you still need Harry to be an orphan... maybe they did actually die in a car crash or maybe James and Lily decided to fight Grindelwald or whatever.)

I feel the same way about time travel related Snarry or whatever the Hermione version of that's called. The latter's more tolerable or, possibly, I didn't nope because the time travel Snape is also an AU Snape and I was too busy waiting for the selling point (a minor character interaction between Ginny and AU Voldemort) to care as much as I do about my usual problems (I'm picky, okay?).

**** Fascinating.

I've just read the start and it's a bit "replace Draco with Riddle" so... it kind of runs into the same problems as the time travel fic anyway (or, at least, different problems that people raise in the context of Dramione... although, at least, Harry isn't a muggleborn but he's still friends with Hermione so...).

However, I am more convinced than I was before that the concept has merit. Now that I know they exist, I might try and find another.
