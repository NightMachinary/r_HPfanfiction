WARNING:I'm on mobile so if there're any spellinh mistaked then that'll be the reason

I'm also going to be experimenting possibilities for a fic that I plan on writing so PLEASE give your opinions on the ideas that I have

How would it change the plot or the friendships if Harry were to be sorted into Ravenclaw, I'll go over my personal thoughts and stuff and the possibilities with it

Would've made it for all the four houses but I'm lazy

differences begin here

Okay this would change a bit because then Harry wouldn't just go running into the stone room in Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone

Instead Harry would likely go tell a teacher. (Mcgonagall or Flitwick most likely as the most responsible teacher in Harry's opinion and his head of house) and then ask thhe teacher's what to do and would get answered to go to the commons which Harry may or may not do Idk

CoS would differ in similar manner but would go with the teachers as Harry is the only one that can speak parseltongue to get in

PoA wouldn't change much except for Harry learning stuff faster and getting the patronus charm down quicker

GoF would be different in the fact thag he would learn the spells quicker and learn more spells while researching useful spells

OotP would be similar except for the toad (Umbridge) getting verbally and intellectually destroyed dunno what would happen because of that

HBP would be similar imo

DH would be the same except for the fact that Harry would get the horcruxes out quicker and that the wards they put up would be a lot better than that (and also they wouldn't get kidnapped by the snatchers, thus Dobby is spared death) and then Harry would be like more powerful for some reason and would destroy Voldemort.

Oh and then the friendships

When Harry gets on the Hogwarts express he sits in a compartment with 3 others (at the beginning there was only two girls) the three others are Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis and Terry Boot so my fic would be Haphne with Terry/Tracey on the sidelines. (no it wouldn't be like sex in the first chapter kid on the second or something)

So Harry-Terry friendship and Daphne-Tracey friendship and then maybe some others from the Ravenclaw house and some from Hufflepuff and just Fred and George from Gryffindor

Then the houses Harry-Ravenclaw of course, Terry-Ravenclaw ofc, Daphne-RAVENCLAW and last but not least Tracey-RAVENCLAW yeah so I kind of changed Tracey's and Daphne's houses but ehh it'll be an AU so it won't be that much of a difference

Plot of the fic; Harry got a natural disasters power and is now dang powerful with that power and a lot above average on normal magic. Escapes from the dursleys via his new familiar phoenix, which will be called Ember, Ember takes Harry to Potter manor where Harry resides until Hogwarts (he'll still stay there on summer breaks and stuff) practising his power and wandless magic. All the while Dumbledore is having a mental breakdown on Harry disappearing from the Dursleys and not knowing that Ember erased the Dursleys memories of all things Harry because why not lol.

That's basically it shortened down.

Thanks for reading this friking novel


** There's a lot of ways to go through what might have happened - but it depends on what you mean by 'Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw'. After all, the houses don't really change your personality - they just have an emphasis on different things. So you could have Harry go there with no change to his canon personality, making your entire list of differences... mutable. They're not givens, at least.

What you seem to be asking is not just what would happen if Harry was in Ravenclaw, but if he also respected authority and was more studious. In that case, it could be similar - but I would not hold myself to the canon plotlines in that case. As for friendships, it depends on who is in Ravenclaw of course - it sounds like you've already decided who you want him friends with though.

For a bit of critique, the description of your fic (the whole phoenix part) doesn't strike me as particularly congruous with the premise you're discussing before it. Is there a reason that you're comparing the two? Also, is there a specific need for you to include a Super!Harry like that? Not that you can't do it, of course - it's your fic. But it feels to me like you've got two ideas that you're smushing together in this - one about Harry in Ravenclaw, and one with Super!Harry and his new power and phoenix familiar stuffing it to Manipulative!Dumbledore. The latter would, IMO, overshadow the former heavily. I would consider splitting them.

I would also push back against the description of that as a plot. That is a setting description - the initial changes. But it is not a plot - do you consider Harry going through the stages of canon? What are the challenges he's going to be faced with? What happens? Those are the important plot elements to consider - not the base idea that you've got.

I'll stop here - hopefully this helped you a bit. I don't want to critique it too much, because in the end it is your fic - so the fact that the description of it isn't my thing doesn't matter.

Not directly, but your surroundings influence you, especially while growing up. Harry would inevitably spend less time with Ron, Neville, Dean and Seamus but spend more time with the Ravenclaws.

Also, with Harry being in Ravenclaw, the first Halloween could go very differently. Either Ron doesn't make his complaint about Hermione or Harry does not notice her absence, which might have her squashed and/or Ron feeling incredibly guilty for the rest of his life. That could quickly change him, and also Harry if they are still friends (they might simply find not enough time to deeply bond with Harry in Ravenclaw).

*** Well the thing with Ravenclaw is that you would have to be smart or knowledgeable or able to think outside the box or have a thirst for knowledge or all those combined or a few of those combined and have those be the dominant personalities and stuff, so then I would need ho have Harry be knowledgeable or have a thirst for knowledge and wisdom, those because they would be probably the easiest to write although it would be fun trying to write a wise Harry that just speaks in wise quotes or something. So in the end I don't know what to do with the Ravenclaw thing.

AND NO HARRY WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AUTHORITY FIGURES.... sorry I just hate the fics where Hermione does nothing if an authority figure hasn't said anything and Hermione also seems to think that everything a book says is truth. I just hate those fics so Harry will not have an authority figure problem.

I don't know about Dumbledore being manipulative in my fic, I always thought that if Harry would have disappeared from the Dursleys in canon then Dumbledore would have for sure started searching for Harry in secret along with the order of the phoenix.

And about the phoenix, the thing is that I'm not yet sure it would be a phoenix but I don't wan't to copy The Lightning Lord so Idk what bird or animal it should be. I also don't want to copy the accidental animagus in Harry becoming a kid animagus accidentally at the Dursleys so I decided to go with a phoenix, but IF someone does manage to give me a plausible alternative I would definitely consider it

I think that's it

BTW there's never too much critique if it's constructive criticism and not just like ”HEY THATS SHAIT BECAUSE IM MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOU” so yes it did help me a bit with my ideas.

Thanks for the constructive criticism!

Because Harry was not in the picture until she had agreed on the date to Cedric. She seemed sad to have to shoot him down.

Say Harry invites his teammate to Hogsmeade during his 3rd year, her attachment to Cedric does not go beyond "well, he looks nice" and Hermione would, most likely, be dead, so she wouldn't be an issue either.

****** Yes, but the insecurity still exists.

It could work out, but they really never had a basis. Cho took him to Madam Puddifoot's though he was really uncomfortable.

It's a huge hypothetical. We honestly couldn't know.

******** In general. She wasn't very secure. Absence of Hermione could very well mean someone else takes her space.

Now bashing her is weird, but she's not that compatible with Harry.

***** I agree they wouldn't last because Marietta, but I will say Cho's reaction to Hermione (and Ron) is pretty realistic to me. Imo, Harry's relationship with them is the main reason Ginny and her relationship with Harry are so very shallow. Honestly, Cho, Ginny, /and/ Lavender were all shafted to keep them together.

I think anyone, man or woman, would feel like the odd one out and both Cho and Harry lacked thr maturity to fully understand it. And Ron ending up with Hermione and Harry with the accepting sister is so very cookie cutter perfect.
