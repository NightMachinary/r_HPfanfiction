** This has to be one of my biggest fanfiction disappointments. It's so highly recommended and talked about but seriously what a pile of crap.

It starts of with a brilliant concept and is well written but turns into the ramblings of a man convinced he is much cleverer than he really is.

  but what the heck happened?
#+end_quote

The author started withholding chapters to milk the story to its maximum for attention and financial donations towards the NPO he's associated with.

His ego got too much out of control and made him lose any self-awareness about the whole thing.

The community started developing an unpleasant whiff that was reminiscent of a fledgling philosophical or political sect (e.g. the level of its members' susceptibility to Roko's Basilisk as a memetic virus was concerning).

Most importantly though, while the story's initial promise was to develop a /smart/ hero who would be solving his problems /rationally/, halfway through this stopped being the case. MoR!Harry was still spewing various psychological and epistemological concepts and facts to keep his “smart” image but the decisions he was making were in fact very stupid in their nature. The story wasn't being properly used for introducing tools of rational thinking either anymore. This made the story into just another crackfic with an OPed self-insert as the protagonist.

In this instance, he is grammatically correct. However, grammar isn't as important as being able to read a sentence out loud without getting out of breath. Now, that can be a perfect way to show a character is worked up when they're speaking, but...

Why on earth would the narrator ever need to be gasping for breath at the end of a sentence? He shouldn't, unless it is first person narration.

Also, I've just realised, I feel like this is an excellent example of "telling" instead of "showing".

MoR struck me much the same way, except that I hate the writing style, and there's no joy in the reading of it. The author writes like he intends it to be an academic work, and that makes it such a pain for me to slog through!

He gives reasons for why he isn't writing as much as we all wish he was, but that is not nearly the same as asking for money since even if MIRI(Machine Intelligence Research Institute) got more funding, that would more than likely mean more work for him to be able to do for them.

********* not disputing that. It wouldn't matter at this point though even if LW printed pages from HP books on TShirts and sold them.

My point it is that since HP is copyrighted to Rowling, it is up to her to accuse LessWrong or anyone else of infringing on her copyright. Not you. Just as it is not for you to decide if there is money owed to Rowling or how much of it

I could understand your condemnation of LW's conduct, if it was done in *support* of an existing effort by the actual copyright holder who have decided that their copyright was infringed upon.

However without such an effort, it simply looks like a bunch of ardent fans are taking it upon themselves to make decisions that aren't up to them to make, and trying to inspire public condemnation themselves.

For all you know, she might be a fan of his, or just liking that particular endeavor and be in tacit approval of LW's use of her work.

edit: also in regard to this statement

#+begin_quote
  I have a problem with that unless he is giving some of that money to JK.
#+end_quote

just in case you are unaware - if Rowling did decide that LessWrong's sale of said TShirts is infringement, him giving her part of the proceeds, or even all proceeds wouldn't make that infringement any *less wrong*. Since it's not up to him either to unilaterally decide the license pricing or permission of use of intellectual property someone else owns. It's quite common for copyright/trademark owners to refuse use of them entirely if they feel that use might reflect badly on the trademark overall. For example it's likely that Rowling wouldn't appreciate a porn shop marketing one of their dildos as "Harry Potter's Wand", even if the shop choose to send her a cheque for 100% of sales revenue - seeing as the HP trademarks and copyrights are mostly marketed to children and young teens.

Imagine that somehow this has gotten past JK's staff and she finds out about it tomorrow and sues. Would it then suddenly be okay for me to have a problem with it?

By the comment about him giving some of the proceeds to JK Rowling I hoped to get across that he was doing so with permission from her and therefore would probably be sharing the profits.

I don't like how copyright law works in the US but I do understand it. I know little of how it works in Britain.

*********** but if you are not accusing him of infringing, why do you have problem with him making money of Rowling's work? Money is not always part of licensing deals. He may in fact have had permission free of charge.... or maybe he didn't, but Rowling decided that his use of her property is fine with her.

The only thing known with relative certainty is that: (1) he made some sales of those tshirts (2) Rowling or whoever on her staff handles licensing is definitely aware of it and (3) they chose to ignore it for one reason or another.

So if Rowling doesn't have a problem with what he did, why should anyone else have a problem on her behalf.

  Would it then suddenly be okay for me to have a problem with it?
#+end_quote

well yes... that's exactly how it should work in my opinion. You wait for potentially aggrieved party to decide if they are in fact aggrieved - and only if they do so, you start posting on forums about what a shit LW is for violating Rowling's rights.

************ Just to be clear I haven't insulted LW in any way.

Secondly, while I'm sure JK and more likely the other people holding a copyright have a staff dedicated to finding infringement cases, It is not obvious that they would catch every single case or that they are definitely aware of this one.

I disagree with how you think my opinion should work but again I never even saw the t-shirts and can't even say for sure if they are objectionable.

  Do you have a problem with that? The quotes had nothing to do with Harry Potter.
#+end_quote

Yes! That's absolutely to do with HP, it's a fucking HP fanfiction! If he's not giving money to JK under a license agreement then he's breaking copyright law.

There's a reason you have to have a disclaimer on all of your fanfiction and frankly JK owns everything written in that universe and he shouldn't be profiting from it.

******* Those disclaimers actually don't do anything from a legal standpoint (in fact, a case can be made that they do more harm than good from the standpoint of protecting the fanfiction author).

While I think LW is an unrepentant asshat and I find his stories unpleasant to read, he's not the first to sell T-shirts off his fanfiction. Abraxan (or one of her fans) did for awhile, selling jerseys for the fictitious Quidditch team from her /Refiners Fire/ series. That stopped quickly after a CAD.

******* The t-shirts are mentioned [[http://hpmor.com/notes/98/][here]], with the quotes being

#+begin_quote
  World domination is such an ugly phrase / I prefer world optimisation

  Probably a member of the Bayesian Conspiracy

  Optimize Everything
#+end_quote

None of those have anything to do with HP. They have to do with his own work, but he's not profiting off HP's characters.

I don't see how any of those break copyright law.

** I'm not sure why so many people seem to hate this story. Sure, it's propaganda--but propaganda can be entertaining! /Atlas Shrugged/ is propaganda--/Animal Farm/ is propaganda--/The Shape of Things to Come/ is propaganda--but they're still great books. I don't agree with the philosophy of /Atlas Shrugged,/ but the story's awesomeness still brings tears to my eyes every time I read it, even if it's absurdly exaggerated.

*** It's not just that it's propaganda or the guy goes against the fundamental principle of fanfiction, it being free, or that he's a smug dick.

It's that it's just a bit shit.

Yeah it's well written but the pacing is horrific, the characters unrealistic and the plot is everywhere but the difference between say Animal Farm and MoR is that AF works as a story with no deeper meaning. MoR is just a vessel to push his views, the actual story is terrible. That's why it isn't good, it's basically a series of poorly written scientific papers put into the HP universe with a vague attempt at linking them together.

*** So I had a thing that I typed out in response to your post, but then realised it'd probably be better as a comment to OP. However, in fairness, since I wrote it because of the thoughts you inspired in me, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2u2vhl/final_arc_of_harry_potter_the_methods_of/co9bixl][this was that response.]]

Also thank you. :D

** I started reading HPMOR about a year ago. I finished it within a week(well to the then current in progress point). I've been waiting for several months for EY to publish the Final Arc and I can't wait for it to be done. For me, this is the best HP fanfiction I've read. It is as good as Rowling's books, which almost feels blasphemous to say. The next few months should be fun.

** nice.

Story was funniest book I've read, before going really downer in later chapters while also slowing down.

Best version of OP Harry in fanfiction.

I made myself ignore it until it's finished - good decision too considering that was over a year ago.
