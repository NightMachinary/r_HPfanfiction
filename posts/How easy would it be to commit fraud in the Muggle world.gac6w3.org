So, I'm writing a fic where the main character is talking with a friend about living in the Muggle world and needs to get a lot of money quickly. They are speaking hypothetically about the best ways to get a lot of money in the Muggle world and bring it back through Gringotts. I think I've got it, but don't know if it's plausible or if anyone could think of a better idea, either would be really appreciated?

1. Duplicate a £20 note. Take the fake note to a shop and exchange it for two £10 notes (or whatever gets the full amount back but in genuine money). If there is a certain amount of time before a duplicated object disappears, then it's not a problem as you've already exchanged it. If the new money is identical, it'd pass any Muggle tests as long as it's still there, right?
2. Repeat.
3. Either spend the money, which has gone from £20 to a *lot* more. As is genuine money now, could be sent to Gringotts and exchanged for Wizarding currency. There wouldn't be any problems as the money isn't fake.

This character has slightly twisted morals, but doesn't want to attract attention by explicitly stealing the money (which I'll admit would be a lot easier).

Would this seem right? If not, why and how *could* I make it work?


** If you're happy to cheat people out of money using magic your best bet is to probably go to the races and put on a large bet on something with crazy odds then use a light Impediment Jinx on the other horses. As long as you cast silently and don't get caught on the cameras you should be fine as long as you don't do it too often or too much and try to blend into a large crowd.

For the more trivial matters, I can't think of anything that'd be comparable to predicting which horse would win a race - Trelawney seems to be deliberately vague in her assertions.

It would be in violation of the statute of secrecy if someone was looking at the money as it disappeared. Also there are probably muggle protection laws in place to prevent this sort of thing. Arthur's department has in the past been said to deal with things wizards who sell shrinking keys to muggles to gaslight them so there is probably a system in place to catch you.

** I think the key is that you have to put restrictions on it - if there's no oversight/limits, it'd be incredibly easy to scam/steal from Muggles without a problem (eg - use the imperius charm on a billionaire, siphon all their money away million by million, profit).

So the first thing you'd want to set up is /how/ the Wizarding authorities would identify and stop that type of misuse of magic. Is it a team of aurors/other officers? Is it through cooperation with a muggle team? Some sort of wide area sensor like the Trace? Etc, etc.

Those parameters are important to set up, because they define what your character would have to operate under to avoid detection.

In terms of shovelling wealth back into the WW, the method in question would probably depend. If you have Gringotts as heavily removed from the Ministry's control, then the Goblins might never tell on your character - and he could waltz in with purchased gold/silver/jewels and cash them in with the goblins without anyone knowing.

If there's some Ministry oversight to catch that sort of fraud, your character would probably need some sort of cover - say, a company that operates in the muggle world that the money would be laundered through.

One concern might be with how galleons are created/made - and stored - in the bank. We don't know if in canon, Gringotts has particularly advanced banking system - we just see the vaults with cash in it. Do they have accounts where you deposit it into a ledger and let the goblins invest, instead of sitting in your vault? If so, that sort of constant depositing/purchasing of things from the muggle society would work (probably hard species like gold/silver/jewels, assuming that magic can't create those). If not, and it's limited to just the physical galleons, then going through the goblins would have a limit. Instead, you'd need to find something else that you can sell at a profit to wizards (unless the goblins have no limit to how many galleons they can produce)

**** It'd be even easier if you brought the non-copied money to Gringotts, because it'd probably take a while for it to be redistributed. Although Gringotts might be able to tell if the money was copied, so that could be an issue. Another way is to go to another country (magical transportation makes this pretty easy) and exchange it for their local currency, as, again, it would probably take quite a while to make its way back into the original country's system. Alternatively, just use it in different places across the country, and use a different disguise (polyjuice or otherwise) at each place. Different disguises would be a good idea either way. Once you have exchanged all of the money you want, and gotten rid of all the bills you duplicated (so you only have clean bills that haven't been touched by magic) then take it all back to Gringotts and get it exchanged. Even if the government caught on and found all of the duped bills, they wouldn't be able to tell who it was, and if they saw different people exchanging each bill then they probably wouldn't be able to prove it was someone perfectly counterfeiting money, so they might assume it was a printing error and just destroy the duped bills.

** There are any number of ways to steal from muggles, but the key problem isn't how to get the money as it is how to get the goblins to turn it into wizarding money. There may be an understanding about converting muggle funds to magical /for new students coming from muggle families/, but there would be an obvious upper limit to how much they would care to convert.

Instead, the goblins might accept gold and gemstones, as it seems they believe such things hold value beyond the reach of wizard spell shenanigans. So, your potential embezzler needs to arrange to buy gold and gems with his cash and bring it to the bank to ask for an exchange. If he's bringing enough to flood the market, the more he brings in, the less they'll give in trade.

That depends. If Gringotts are the sole/main company dealing with precious metals and stones, then if they operate like De Beers does in our world they could easily limit the amount on the market at any given time in order to jack up prices to the extreme. You'd likely still get paid a lot less than market value, since they're buying it from you presumably in bulk, but the amount they pay you would likely be consistent since they can keep their prices consistent by limiting the stock available.

** Obviously we are in fiction but real world one of the last estimates i saw was the world had over 171,300 tonnes of gold in their vaults. That equates to over 6.1 Billion ounces of gold. That would equate to a lot of galleons if in the hands of the goblins.

Now i like the stories where galleons were made from an ounce of gold and the protagonists melt the gold and sell it. For most of 91-97 the average gold price was $350 (£280) which was way more than the common fanfiction exchange rates of either £5 or £8 per galleon.

Some of these stories require goblin magic to be overcome, some stop this due to individual micro serial numbers on the galleons etc.

On the muggle side why not just disillusion yourself, apparate into a bank vault and take the money you want. Back in 1990's a lot of the protections for tracking currency weren't fully deployed or used. The downside would be they would know they were robbed.

Or better yet how hard would it be via spell or runes to take a £20 note and duplicate it but have the serial number increase by 1 for each note? Since each note is different and due to magic exactly real the odds of the muggles discovering the fraud would be minimal.

Finally, how about just stealing the currency from criminals (drug dealers etc) though in that one you risk getting bills marked by police who were looking at those criminals.

** I think a pretty strong argument against muggle fraud would be simply that, with magic, there's just no point in fraud. Even if you make conjuration and transfiguration temporary, so you can't just mass-conjure expensive electronics, you can still get broken things cheaply to repair with reparo. Perhaps you can divine or arithmancy stock markets. If you're not a student, you can automate quite a lot with magic and produce muggle items.

Otherwise, banknotes do have serial numbers, so perfect duplicates can still be detected. Even if a shop wouldn't, Gringotts may as well catch it.

Gringotts probably does some business with muggle banks and I wouldn't want to make the goblins mad at me.

** I expect it depends on when it was set. Money in the UK has a UV pattern/number on which only shows under UV light. Counterfeits don't tend to, or people have written them on with a UV pen and it is really obvious. Not sure when this began. Any £50 notes are considered to be particularly suspicious and always warrant extra caution. My thought it that unless they knew to transfigure the UV part, then the transfiguration would be poor.

Money from the Bank of England is extremely uniform, too so it's easy to notice any change. In Scotland Royal Bank of Scotland, Cyldesdale and Bank of Scotland.

Of course, if magic can duplicate this then it was fine, but a great many people are unaware about the UV so it.

** I think this could work on a small scale, for buying things here or there. But if you try doing this on a large scale, or try doing consistently as a source of income, there'd be a huge problem with hyperinflation. It's the reason why printing more money won't save poor economies. Although, I suppose it would be fine if it disappears. just a little suspicious. And you have to make sure it disappears out of sight.

I read a fic (I think it was Harry the Hufflepuff) where Harry started a sweat shop of house elves making high quality socks. It was great, because the production was cheap and fast but also high quality. Well, it /was/ great, until they made tons, and flooded the market and then everyone had the socks and no one needed to buy anymore, so it didn't sell at all. And sweat shops aren't quite ethically sound. But the point is, with magic, you could make a lot of menial tasks and services a lot easier. So I guess you could start a production company, and just be careful about how you go about it?

edit: and then there's that plan to exchange muggle money into /actual gold and silver/, melt down the coins to uphold the statute of secrecy, and then sell it back to the muggle world at exorbitant prices. And repeat. (from hpmor, and probably a few other fics)

** Duplicating bank notes is likely to draw a lot of attention if done in mass quantities. They'll either disappear raising questions or get noticed as counterfeits eventually promoting a high priority investigation. Also if you're breaking the law you don't want to be having to run large quantities of money through a bank that would also raise questions better left unasked.

Thefts of items that can have value to be resold in the wizarding world is a much safer plan. Taking those valuables (precious metals, gems, raw materials, luxury foods,...) and reselling in knockturn alley seems easiest. As for the thefts themselves you have polyjuice, obliviate, confundus, imperious, muggle repelling charms, apparition, switching spells, bottomless bags, apparition, transfiguration, and plenty of other options to steal without leaving any evidence. As long as it is not either high profile and obviously magical the dmle won't be aware/care.

** Fraudulence is making money through wrongful deception. Most mundane fraud schemes can be magicked up a bit with no issue. People are gullible enough to fall into scams every day. A minor confundus charm on a paper to be signed, or a glove worn during a handshake and it becomes a thousand times easier to trick people out of their money.

Fake designer handbags and rolexes would be easy to make. Cars would be easy to steal with an unlocking charm and then probably easy to wipe vins on or create fraudulent registration on.

Identity theft through legilimancy, polyjuice, compulsion charms, etc.

Romance scams would be simple with love potions.

That's just covering scams and fraud, not general crime. So lots of way to make muggle money through magic and a lack of morals.

As another poster mentioned though. If shouldn't be that easy, if there are laws against muggle baiting then there are going to be laws about scamming them out of money too. Is enforcement purely magical? Are there muggle teams looking for discrepancies in crimes that can only be magic that they report to wizards? Are their muggle teams that take care of magical criminals themselves? How well does that Statute actually work? Are most muggles actually unaware of magic, or is power power in the end, and do wealthy business owners and crime moguls keep a wizard close by to protect their interests?

** ...People posting some form of "just use the Imperius Curse". Yes, use something that will get you life if caught when there is less evasive and evil ways. Remember your a thief not a wannabe Death Muncher!

** Very hard.

You cannot transfigure or conjure money in any form. This is a law of nature in the HP universe, one of the Gamp exceptions I believe.

Not to mention, even if you could do this, real money has a lot of hidden or secret attributes that signify its realness. It's very likely that your fake bills will be detected as a counterfeit. Transfiguration is hard, and requires some understanding of what you're making, so to transfigure a bill you'd need to know the exact chemical makeup of the inks, the precise fabric used for the bill, all the secret hidden markers and be able to duplicate them perfectly. If you're that good at transfiguration, you can probably make more money by doing it as a job in the wizarding world.

*** The law is about “real” Wizarding money, there is fake out there (leprechaun gold) and people can be tricked. As for mundane money it depends where and when you are for any security features to be present and that's just with paper money. Some currencies have high value coins with no modern security that a metalsmith could replicate. The muggle on the corner store would have no clue if a bill/coin is real or not. Also Transfiguration is just another skill, to be good you need to work at it.
