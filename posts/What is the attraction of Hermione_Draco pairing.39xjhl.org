I don't understand how it could work. I know it's very popular and for whatever reason why isn't the reverse of this ship popular? Pansy/Harry. Could someone explain this and maybe link some good fics to show why and how it might work. I really am trying to keep an open mind about this and understand it but it's so baffling to me fall in love with a bully.


** I don't really like it, and I think fanon sees Draco as far smarter (and therefore Hermione's intellectual equal) then he actually is in canon. For the record, JKR [[http://i.imgur.com/DlwoimVh.jpg][tweeted]] something about Draco the other day.

**** that's sort of the point of the attraction from the male fans...

Some of us were real shits at some point in our lives or just 'misunderstood' (meaning still a shit but unfairly exaggerated as far as reputation goes), and the whole 'good/smart girl looks past all your crap' thing is an enjoyable fantasy trope ('fantasy' because AFAIK, that just doesn't happen in real life)

Also, Draco was written into canon as a major case of underdog. Rowling made him obnoxious, craven, petty and weak. A caricature of a character really, rather than a real character.

So there is also the whole rooting for the underdog thing going for him.

****** we going to judge things on the surface only?

By that measure, Harry had a neat childhood - couldn't possible be an underdog during his first year what with being a famous and almost universally adored celebrity.

They are not organic people. Both are characters an author deliberately created, giving them various aspects.

And she gave Draco exclusively bad ones - so bad in fact that in her books he isn't even a remote believable character.

No one person could possibly suck so much, in so many ways.

******* that's a false equivalency. and i suppose it depends on what your definition of 'underdog' is. to me, it refers to social capital. neville was consistently an underdog. i wouldn't call harry an underdog at hogwarts. if only possessing negative qualities makes you an underdog, then crabbe, goyle and voldemort are also. it's like saying veruca salt is an underdog.

******** first. if Draco was 'not an underdog' because you think he was a member of aristocracy, then Longbottom can't be one as well - has at least equal as far titles go.

second:

#+begin_quote
  it refers to social capital
#+end_quote

no idea where you are getting your definitions from

definition of underdog is 'least likely to come out ahead'. Came from dog racing. Absolutely nothing to do with social capital.

Yes, Crabbe and Goyle are also underdogs, since they were portrayed as borderline retarded. Their singular positive traits are being physically big and strong.

Voldermort has more positive qualities to somewhat compensate for his weaknesses - he is (a) portrayed as very powerful (b) for most of the series he is kept 'mysterious' in that he is hinted as being immortal/capable of coming back from the dead (c) has notorious reputation, which he can potentially leverage to work for him

Draco has no strengths at all. Even his social standing/money is actually his father's strengths on which he is trying pitifully to hang. His portrayal in the books is just one long string of 'epic fail' scenes.

Such consistency is usually given to sideshows like comic relief - except Draco's scenes aren't even funny. Just pitifully pathetic in every regard.

I am hard pressed to remember a more 'crippled' underdog in all of fantasy genre.

********* different dynamic. pureblood plus wealth and status, which i'm not sure neville has. his guardians also constantly browbeat whereas draco's are supportive and encourage him to use his privilege.

i'm saying 'power', 'success' and any measure of coming out ahead is explicitly social.

he has cronies. he uses his wealth to buy brooms for his entire quidditch team, ergo social power. he isn't the most powerful, but he isn't the least either. i'd say he's sufficiently competent. that wealth belongs to his family, which he can freely use and will one day totally control. i'm sure lucius didn't earn it either.

i mean really. 'wealthy, privileged bigots with consistent emotional support systems, cronies and friends are the REAL underdogs'

******* There is a difference between draco and severus. (Let's be honest albus severus is a terrible name. ) draco is brought up to think he is at the top of the food chain. Changing ideology that ingrained in one since developmental years is hard and nearly impossible for most people, it also makes it hard to do it for a girl. Severus met lily when he was a kid. They were friends before their fallout. Lily also cared for severus. Can't compare draco to severus.

**** of course we dont see Pansy's emotional depth. Draco is the main supporting character. Pansy is there to give a form of.. well arm candy for Draco. Draco is Harry's childhood rival. Harry has Ron and Hermione, Draco has crabbe and Goyle. Harry has Ginny, Draco has Pansy. Harry has the Order, Draco the DE. JKR is big on the concept of balance. Voldemort is balanced by Dumbledore. Snape by McGonagall. Its how she also portrays evil. Umbridge is so evil because there is no check to her to stop her from being such an evil bitch. Voldemort, only does the trully dark things after Dumbledore is killed. Ginny gets I think ten or so pages worth of mentioning outside of her relationship with Harry. Eight of those pages are about her being Voldemort's Diary Slave. For most of the series we see Ginny and Pansy around the same amount of time.

** Tom Felton and Emma Watson are both much dreamier than Scarlett Byrne and Daniel Radcliffe. Same reason people ship Snape with anyone -- Alan Rickman is a good actor and made Snape interesting, and he's also somewhat handsome.

Fandom has already papered over Hermione's personality flaws, and she's a sufficiently interesting character to write about. I'm not sure how people get around Malfoy's issues, though. Did the movies minimize them? Maybe people saw that Malfoy wasn't that much worse than Harry, just on the opposite side.

**** This is all too black and white. It conflates behavior with personality. Draco acts cowardly, and he acts racist, and he acts as a bully. And yes, that's very contemptible. But you have to consider the context and the motivation. He was raised by racists, bullying cowards. He is, in fact, behaving exactly as he was raised. In that light, he's incredibly loyal and loving to his family.

You can also read his actions towards Harry as being a facade for his insecurities. JKR made it clear that Lucius instructed Draco to befriend Harry, and had high expectations for Draco at school. Draco probably felt ashamed and frustrated that he couldn't live up to those expectations. He took that out on those around him.

I don't know. There's no doubt Draco does a lot of reprehensible things, but I have trouble seeing him as little more than a kid -- a kid who wants to live up to his family's expectations. At the end of the series he was forced to "walk the walk" for the first time and really decide whether he wants to fight for his parents ideals (through murdering Dumbledore). I think it a testament to his character that in that moment he didn't go through with the murder. It says that there is some measure of good in him, even if he has not been shown how to channel it correctly. Also, JKR's info on Pottermore makes it clear that Draco largely turned his back on those ideals later in life.

So yes, I think Draco has a lot of good qualities -- loyalty, love, the ability to change your perspective (harder than many recognize). It just takes him some growing up to use those qualities for good.

I think it's important to keep in mind that he's only seventeen by the end of the series, and he'd spent his whole life being influenced by his father and Death Eater cronies - I like to think that after the war ended (and Lucius was hopefully sent to Azkaban), he calmed down and started to unlearn the prejudice he'd absorbed.

I imagine the UST and such is a draw for Hr/Draco but.... I don't want ANYONE to end up with Draco... even a GOOD Draco... unless it is Ginny Weasley.. I like the idea better of the Blood Purist and the Blood Traitor, especially because their fathers hate each other.

But I only like Ginny with Draco if she's Potions!Ginny or if it is because Harry ended up with Hermione or someone else.... idk I'm very conflicted about Ginny.

** There's this excellent explanation I once read that I certainly can't do any justice, but basically if everything else is mostly cannon, this ship is about redemption and rebirth. Draco and Hermione are literal opposite ends of the spectrum, and to come together would signify personal growth and social growth, and in Draco's case, discovering that his pureblood status doesn't mean anything and that there is good everywhere. And if he were to be accepted by her friends and the reverse as well, it would be an excellent growth by the cast of characters in general. In essence, it makes his character much more grey and not so much black and white. Hermione as well.

****** "The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger-" seems to imply to me that it's more than one person who has beaten Draco, but that Hermione leapt to mind first. I don't think he's a slouch, but it's likely more that if he is intelligent, he has no need to apply it in the slightest, and so he coasts through. With the Vanishing cabinet, his life and the lives of his family were on the line, so he made it work, and applied himself.

It still took him most of a year to get working though iirc?

Smart kids don't purposely antagonize a hippogriff. Smart kids don't continously say wait till my father hears about this. Smart kids don't join up with umbridge.

****** Pure motivation? The Vanishing Cabinet was broken and involved some pretty complex magic. Remember how many students were struggling with Apparition that year? Imagine those same students trying to fix an object that's capable of basically Apparating other objects and multiple people between locations. I don't think many would have succeeded. He was also smart enough to realize this was a way around Hogwarts' enchantments, which surprisingly escaped all the teachers (at least some of whom had knowledge of Montague's Vanishing Cabinet incident).

And considering Hermione wound up in Gryffindor, I think it's safe to say that Ravenclaw doesn't have a monopoly on smart kids...

***** I am not sure what that has to do with her moral code.

If you mean that he would teach her to give "all the rules" less moral weight, then she doesn't need that, since she does not hesitate to ignore any and all rules when the need exceeds the cost. For example,

- /Don't break curfew and wander around an unfamiliar magical castle at night:/ Good rule, not worth violating over a matter of preadolescent honor, because one might, say, run into a hungry cerebrus and/or get expelled from the only source of magical knowledge available to you (because, unlike purebloods and halfbloods, you don't have any other connections in the wizarding world).

- /Don't set teaching staff on fire:/ Good rule for most situations, but OK to break if it's literally a matter of life and death.

And for actually thinking about consequences unlike Harry, Ron, and Draco, she gets labeled as having "a stick up her arse".

#+begin_quote
  and maybe help her see that things like SPEW cause more harm than good.

That's not morality either. That's political savvy. (Since when does Draco have any in the first place, anyway?)

Unless, that is, you are saying that Draco would dissuade her from caring about House-Elf rights and welfare in the first place; in which case, why would that be a good thing?

***** I don't fully get why people think she's so obsessed by the rules, she broke plenty of them, she just doesn't think you should arbitrarily break them just because you can. She does let her own principles outweigh the rules though, unlike Percy (for example).

I've seen people argue that her notifying Mcgonnegal of the firebolt was her being obsessed by rules, but really, her provided reasoning was a lot more sound than "this is a cool toy, I want to play with it NOW".

My favourite of her misdeeds:

- She lit a teacher on fire and helped Harry reach the Sorceror's stone in first year
- She stole ingredients and used it to create polyjuice illegally to verify Harry's suspicions in second year
- She started an illegal militia and maimed the student that turned them in

Don't get me wrong, I love Mr. Darcy. But charming he is not. The reason his character stays with us is because of the development he undergoes over the course of /Pride and Prejudice/.

Yes, Malfoy's utterly unlikable. So's Darcy, at the beginning. Dramione is a chance to give Malfoy character development by exposing him to someone who can unfound his views of the world. It's not about loving the Malfoy in the books, it's about the potential to change him.

** Dramione for me, is the redemption of Draco Malfoy through love. Hermione is the physical embodiment of everything Draco has been taught to hate. Draco falling in love with Hermione represents him turning from his prejudices and becoming his own person, and not one who is just parroting his father's beliefs.

On a more personal level, the Draco/Hermione pairing is appealing to me as a person of color because I love the idea that someone could fall in love with a person they have been brought up to hate because of their blood (or skin color as in the real world).

I can see the idea of dating, say a former white supremacist that had changed his ways before you met him, but I would have a harder time if I had personally been targeted by the person when they were a white supremacist.

Obviously it's not her job to convert him, but if their paths crossed after the war and it was clear that he'd changed and regretted his past actions/behavior, I think she would be compassionate enough to recognize that he pretty much had no chance under his family's influence.

Canonically, Draco and Hermione bickers. When Draco is raised from a petty spoilt child to a misunderstood handsome perfect snarky intellectual young man, automatically every girls are in love with him. People love relationship between people who bickers because of "muh romantic" sitcom, and the "aww they really do love each other" after 50 +episodes+ chapters of teen romcom bullshit. There is also a slight hint of self insert.

As for Harry/Pansy, it isn't popular because there is Harry/Daphne, which is the equivalent. Fanon Daphne is your typical perfect Slytherin Ice Queen that's not a bigot character, and instead of bickering, we have defrosting the ice queen

Draco is a pure-blooded boy from a prominent and rich family (aka the Perfect Death Eater).

Hermione is a smart ^{dare I say it} mudblood (aka the Essential Enemy of the Death Eaters).

They are foils of each other, and the taboo of their attraction is very enticing to authors, I believe.
