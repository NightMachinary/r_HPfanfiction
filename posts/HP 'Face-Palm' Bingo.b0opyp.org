** The author notes spots were my favorite.

I would add, "I know I took a ton of time getting this chapter up but the next one will be much quicker!" Then the next chapter takes just as long and the author includes a variant of the same message. Also they claim that reviews are the lifeblood of their creativity.

*** Thanks for this!\\
I'd only say in response:\\
Sev: I should have amended it to "anyone but Lily calling him 'Sev'" or something. We were thinking of those fics in which an adult Snape allows people like Harry or Draco to call him that.

Abandoning stories: I actually don't mind (though of course I don't love, when this happens). But it seems like whenever the author protests they won't abandon a story like this, updates stop a chapter or two later. It's like a death knell.

Screeching: holy crap, I never noticed how much she uses that verb! Thanks. I suppose we were thinking of bashing fics that have Molly and Hermione screeching, but that's a solid point.

Swearing by Nimue etc.: fair point.\\
Thanks!

*** Would actually enjoy something like that again, IF it came at a cost. Like reading an Elder Scroll in the Elder Scrolls Universe. You get absolutely immense amounts of knowledge and insights written down by the forces that created the world past, present and future, BUT you will lose your sight.

Many times in fanfiction the biggest problem seems to be that their is no cost or not a counter-force (villain) build up that makes this whole lot more power in the protagonist necessary.

But most of the time it is for me: „Ah. Of course your newly acquired library comes with a dimensional portal that gives you a day for every hour in the normal world.“ - closes the FF.

  Lamentable ignorance regarding average penis size.
#+end_quote

While it's true that pretty much every smut fic ever tends to give the male lead an improbably large dong (8 inches being the bare minimum when that's in fact solidly in the top 95th percentile IRL), I think there's room for an interesting -- if still M rated -- fic that explores the "culture shock," for lack of a better term, of a society where there plausibly exist potions and/or spells to change the size of one's endowment to one's liking. And not just dicks, but any body part where size is a matter of kink or self-image.

****** Krum turned his head into a shark (after /failing/ to turn his entire body into a shark) and didn't have any long-term issues. I am completely subscribed to the idea that human transfiguration can be used in sex with little consequence. Hell, given the difficulty of the subject, I imagine that it's something of a bragging right. Like, "I'm magically skilled enough to make myself literally hung like a horse, and oh yeah, I'm also /literally hung like a horse/."

******* That's something specific that he had been practicing for a while. Maybe there would have been major health problems, but there's a professional healer available right there.

It does seem to make sense that with enough time and practice, most reasonably talented wizards/witches would transfigure their bodies into what they want. At least the details. We just haven't seen anything like that in canon.

******** There are potions too. Fred and George managed to make cookies (Canary Creams) that /turn you into a canary/ for a minute. They did this in their sixth year, which makes them a school-year younger than Krum (and almost two calendar years younger - I looked it up). If two young sixth-years can turn people into birds, then I'm pretty sure smaller, simpler transfigurations are also relatively common.

Mind you, as a children's book with a limited amount of time to devote to fluff, JKR probably wouldn't have bothered writing that stuff even if it was possible. Maybe there's some sort of cultural taboo on cosmetic self-transfiguration? IDK.

  Unironic appeal to tradition to explain discrimination
#+end_quote

I mean, yeah, traditionally people haven't been the most open to out-groups in their behaviors, and there are good evolutionary reasons for it: reproduction and survival necessitates discrimination, on a sexual and social level.

So it's a perfectly valid appeal, depending on the context, especially in such an insular world like HP. Certainly as valid as the opposite.

Also, now I want to see all of these done in one story, preferably in one chapter. But by Circe, that would be difficult!
