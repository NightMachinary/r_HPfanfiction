Any time travel Tomione fanfiction that involve Harry going back as well? Non time travel is fine as well.


** This is a Victorian AU and it is fantastic. It's quite dark and is unfinished but has been recently updated. However, there is no magic linkffn(Madam Umbridge Home for Wayward Girls)

  Hermione's life takes a dark turn after the death of her parents, leaving her at the mercy of a tyrannical Matron. Her new home is more prison than sanctuary, haunted by ghosts bearing terrible, bloody secrets. Though she's surrounded by troubled young women, it's the men in her life who teach her freedom comes at the greatest price of all. Victorian AU, Tomione, Dramione, no triad

*** I wish I liked it more, but I couldn't get over the fact that the author has certain writing idiosyncrasies that apply to every single character, and makes their mannerisms and characterization feel quite same-y.

If you count, you'll see that someone will lick or wet their lips ~10 times every chapter, and someone will go rigid ~2 times. And that the writing goes out of its way to avoid using the word "he said" or "she said" as a dialogue tag, which means it's hard to tell who's saying what in conversations with multiple characters speaking at once. Once you see it, you can't unsee.

**** Hahaha, I just started realising it and you are quite right. I mean, does everyone have a steal spine? The image of their chest breaking open. I also have that she purposefully obscures who a character is talking to. There were a couple of scenes where that was extremely frustrating. It is also 400,000+ words, so it is a commitment.

That being said, there is some great stuff in there.

  There is only one person Lord Voldemort trusts to guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament and into his Muggle father's graveyard at the opportune moment. It is not Barty Crouch Junior. “His name is Professor Riddle, and at least for now, no matter who you ask, nobody knows anything more. Professor Riddle, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher.”

  With the war looking bleak, the Golden Trio, Ginny, Draco, and Lavender go back to Tom Riddle's 7th Year to destroy Lord Voldemort once and for all. What Hermione DIDN'T count on, however, is a shared common room, a curse, and a crazy little thing called love.
