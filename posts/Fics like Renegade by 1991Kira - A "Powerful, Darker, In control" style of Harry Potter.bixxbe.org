I have been reading Renegade by 1991Kira.

linkffn(11302568)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11302568/1/]]

It has a Harry Potter who is the darker side of grey, but still considered a "champion of the light" who is utilizing his fame, significant magical power, and smarts to guide wizarding Britain towards a grander goal, and take out Voldemort in the process.

It is told from the perspective of those around him and what I am looking for are fics of a similar style of Harry, but preferably told from Harry's point of view.

So a magically powerful, smart, talented, and clever Harry, but a Harry who is willing to do what it takes to protect those he loves, get vengeance on Voldemort and his followers, and guide the wizarding world in a better direction or at least a direction he chooses. But who is often working behind the scenes or portraying an image of the champion of the light for the public view, but behind the scenes is willing to get his hands dirty and manipulate and intimidate others.

I would prefer mature leaning fics. Smut is fine but plot should come first. No Harry (main character) slash please but slash in the story is fine.

Thanks all!

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
