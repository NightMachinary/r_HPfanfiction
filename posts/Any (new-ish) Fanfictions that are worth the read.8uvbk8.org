Hello fellow Fanfiction-Lizards.

I currently cant seem to load [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] because my internet is acting up.

Are there any new-ish (lets say: published in the last 12 months?) fanfictions that are worth the read?\\
Regular Fics, Crossovers, Oneshots - all is welcome, we are a tolerant bunch.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought?

** My story linkffn(The Coven of Albion) is pretty decent, I was really surprised by the follows and such. It's a run through an AU that is kind of like canon (though the plot has and will have significant divergences), but the antagonists are competent, the protagonists are proactive and not useless, and the pagan religious views of the characters who raise Harry (the many members of the Black family) play a crucial role in character development and plot progression.

Ignore the bot, I added a new chapter a week ago.

****** How absurd. Just because you are unable to view the world as anything but black and white does not mean that the rest of us are the same.

Firstly, Sirius and Andromeda were raised by Blacks, and yet, became decent people.

Secondly, Harry was raised by terrible people himself in the books, was he not? He was raised by child abusing magic haters, and yet, he didn't become a bully or a magic hater. Therefore, there's no reason he would grow to dislike Hermione.

Thirdly, this is fanfiction. Even if we ignore the two main points above, the author can make other members of the Black family decent people as well.

Fourthly, being raised by a blood type does not make you that blood type. Harry would remain a half-blood. He wouldn't be a pure-blood purely because he was raised by them. Otherwise, he'd be considered a muggle(born) for being raised by muggles in the books.

Fifthly, I don't think there was any indication and this Harry would become dark.

****** James Potter was a pureblood, and married a muggleborn. Andromeda Black - raised by Blacks - married a muggleborn. Sirius, raised by Blacks, rejected blood purity even as a teenager.

And Harry's mother was a muggleborn. Why would he look down on muggleborns?
