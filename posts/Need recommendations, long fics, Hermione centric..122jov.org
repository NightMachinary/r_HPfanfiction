Recently re-read God of the Lost by gravidy that left me with a craving for more. Decided to appease it by re-reading Parade of the Sun by Sage/everythursday ... helped for a bit but made matters worse.

Need a fic of similar quality. Long (100k> words) and must be with Hermione as main character. Doesn't specifically need to be Hermione/Draco, though that would be a plus. I prefer for characters to be mostly not OOC or if they get that way, then via a believable transition. Above 2 examples work for me because they both put the characters in impossible situations where cooperation is vital to survival and develop from there gradually. Don't like fics where OOC behaviour/feelings/relationships spring up out of nowhere.

If anyone has any treasures like that - please share.


** I'm sure you've read [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]], as it's a semi-famous fic for Dramione shippers... but if not, I thought it was a wonderful story.

edit - You definitely have, since everythursday is the author of PotS. haha. Sorry! I'll dig through my Dramione bookmarks.

** "Just to be" - great story about children of the Death Eaters, the only one SSHG known to me with acceptable quality - [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7454117/1/Just-to-Be]]

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2531969/1/Somewhere-I-Have-Never-Traveled][Somewhere I have Never Traveled]] is unfortunately probably never going to be completed but it's a DHr murder mystery that's very intriguing IMO.

*** I have definitely read basketcase... except it was apparently so long ago that I no longer remember what it is about. Going to have to re-read. Thank you for the reminder.

*edit If you have not read this before fair warning: both in terms of relationship and story plot this fic is a long and gradual buildup to what seems like epic breakthroughs and developments that cuts off right where the next chapter would have been the "pay off" for all of the reader's investment. Like... worse then Firefly.

It was never finished. Hits really hard because of how good it is and the point where it stops, and is probably the only WIP that I've read that I wish I had never laid eyes on. If you are new to it, I strongly advise you to skip it. Parade of the Sun is similar in development and quality but has an ending.

**** Ugh. I had no clue that God of the Lost was abandoned when I started reading it. It KILLED me. But also, check out [[http://dramione.org/viewuser.php?uid=13][AkashaTheKitty]], if you haven't read her fics yet. She has some one shots, some shorter stories, and some longer stories. Highly recommend The Bracelet.

***** Thank you - I have read her work and am currently trying hard to ignore her existence until she finishes Secrets (Silencio part 2), because part 1 was probably the most cruel ending I've read in my life.

** For Dramione fans out there I like: Isolation: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/]]

He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

As for my favorite pairing: SS/HG (don't knock it until you've tried it!) Five Winters: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5775949/1/]] Seventh Year at Hogwarts. Voldemort's dead, and the Golden Trio are back at Hogwarts. Plans for the future are made, tricks and traps of vengeance are laid, and Snape deals with the repercussions of having survived the Second War.

And Looping of the Scales: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5061224/1/]] A potions accident gives Snape a new lease on life by taking part of it away.
