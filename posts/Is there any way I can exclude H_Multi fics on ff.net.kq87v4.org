I really hope there's a way because I'm trying to find more fics that don't have poly cause it's weird IMO.


** FFN doesn't really have a way to exclude things unless you're looking for very specific things -- i.e., pairing brackets, stories over a certain length, and etc. If a multi fic is still included in the parameters that you set, then you're SOL.
