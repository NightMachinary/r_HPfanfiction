The story does say he used to be handsome prior to his time in Azkaban but there is absolutely nothing indicating that his handsomeness correlated with him being a savvy seducer. We only see him interact with three women: Hermione, Mrs. Weasley and Bellatrix. One of them likes him because of Harry, one is not that fond of him either and the other one kills him. So then I wonder, what prompted people to think that he was such a great Don Juan? Sure, in his teenage years he liked posters of hot girls... but that just makes him a regular teenager (or a normal heterosexual guy for that matter).


** In addition to what other comments have said about the bikini posters and line in Pottermore about him getting the girls, JKR wrote the series for a child audience and very carefully avoided sex and sexuality through the books, so we have to read strongly between the lines for Sirius.

So the text doesn't say anything about dating or Sirius being a ladies man, but that's the constraints that she had placed over the work itself. We get no insight into anyone's sex and sexuality, but we do get very secondary hints. Sirius being described as handsome, having bikini art on the walls, being tall and attracting the attention of his lady peers while he ignores them - these are all signs of a player, basically, in JKR's time (so, the 70s and 80s when Sirius would have been getting some, before Azkaban).

If JKR included the fact that Sirius was popular with the ladies, it would have stood out. She knew 11 year olds would be reading the last book, and intentionally kept it empty of references to sex - she only coded it so that older readers would fill in blanks, and even then we can choose to do so in different ways. See for example peoples headcanon that he's gay, asexual, or just likes posters and is handsome. All of these things are valid. JKR coded him in a particular way according to tropes at the time but we have no obligation to interpret it along her stereotyping, and I like that.

But the trope for tall, handsome teenage boys with motorbikes and good looks with bikini art on the walls in the 70s and 80s? Yeah, it's my earnest belief that she coded him as a ho üòÇbless him

Add the fact that Rowling herself is a Christian (Church of Scotland, i believe?) and it adds an extra layer to the "no sex" part.

** It's Pottermore canon. [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin][Remus]] mentions to Tonks that ‚ÄúHe always got the women.‚Äù

They were discussing Remus's old friend who had spent time in Azkaban, so they could have meant Hagrid if you prefer that interpretation.

*** the get the girl thing could actually be people approaching their friend group to ask Sirius out over the other who might have crush on the same girl. Harry saw young Sirius in pensieve memory where he was not aware that girls were looking at him

**** We never see the limits of her metamorpmagus ability, so it could work. Personality-wise, Hagrid has at least as much in common with Tonks as with Olympe. And Hagrid is Tonks's type: kind, poor, excessively loyal to Dumbledore, not quite human...

** I mean, when we see him, he's spent a decade in a prison surrounded by creatures that suck all your good memories away and make you constantly relive your worst memories over and over. Frankly, it's a miracle he could even pull himself together long enough to make the decision to go after Harry/Wormtail at all. But really, that experience means there's no way in hell the Sirius we saw was anything like the Pre-Azkaban one was. That level of mental trauma would create dramatic change in anyone.

So, at the end of the day, he could literally be like anything without Azkaban, we just don't know. Remus' comment is as good a foundation as any for making up that character. Probably an idea propagated by A Black Comedy and the like.

** Possibly because there is no mention of a girlfriend and the attractiveness he has that people assume he was a flirt and into one-night-stands. the whole rebel-motorbike aspect contributes to that as well. I always headcanon him as asexual though, probably self-projection but for him his friends seem to be more important than any romance aspect.

*** You left out the bigger clue. Muggle woman's in bikini in his room. I mean he could have done that to spite his family but there plenty of other ways to do it.

It is for those posters that I don't buy the gay Sirius fics. He could still be bi, but odds are heavy on him being a straight guy with certain openness to the opposite gender. I don't see him as a womanizer, as no one ever mentions that or no exgirlfriend has been mentioned. But certainly flirty and catching girls' eyes for sure.

**** I generally go for bi Sirius, but it is worth noting that lots of people who either aren't conscious of or actively deny their identity end up going really hard in the opposite direction. Different headcanons fit different people, but I personally wouldn't say that bit of canon invalidates gay Sirius.

+JK would probably nix that idea in a heartbeat tho lol+ I have no delusion of my headcanons being canon
