** For those of us who don't know what this is, can you explain? What's the site, why'd you post it, why should I go there, etc.

*** It's a podcast for Fanfiction and in particular Harry Potter fanfiction. It's been around for the better part of 10 years and it has a forum with some friendly and quirky folk in it. That's why I am surprised it hasn't shown up in the couple of years I've been in [[/r/HPFanfiction]]

There's a /LOT/ of podcast content there for those that like that sort of thing. And by a lot, I mean several hundred hours.

**** I've mentioned it a few times in my posts in this sub. In addition to the weekly podcasts, they have one of the few active (as in folks still posting there daily) forums not named Dark Lord Potter.

**** Are there recaps of the podcasts with lists of what fics they talk about, and when in the Podcast the discussion happens?

What would you say their tastes are, as a community? What is the size of the community and how active is it?

***** Absolutely there are recaps, and a full list of all the podcasts are there. The first podcast they ever do is Melindaleo's Seventh Horcrux, if memory serves. I listened along to it as I read through it ages ago. Later, that author and many others are guests in the podcasts. Melindaleo, Lupine Moon, Bobmin, Lady Chi, Robst (iirc) and others.

I haven't had time to listen to even a fraction of them, so I picked out ones that talked about fics I've read or was reading. They also cover a lot of other fanfiction genres. Guide here:

A number of them also do at least one other podcast called "Potterfic Weekly."

** Topics From 'Bad Fanfic' Special Edition:

- Non-canon nicknames like Mione, Siri, Sevy, Lucky, and so on, as well as the stupidity of “Harry” being a nickname.

- Ron being Ron.

- Peter is always evil.

- AU do's and don'ts.

- Next-Gen is seldom more than a clone of our heroes and villains.

- Fanfiction of fanfiction.

- Slash warnings and Het warnings. Explosions, chases, and action warnings.

- Mary Sues.

- Dragging external stuff into HP when it blatantly contradicts canon.

- Martial arts.

- Shopping.

- Localized speech patterns and Briticisms.

- Unhealthy fascination with Muggle stuff.

- Snape and house points.

- Houses other than Slytherin are also evil.

- Harry adoption.

- Crossovers.

- *Cassie Claire.*

Sounds tempting just to hear some opinions about that last item on the list.
