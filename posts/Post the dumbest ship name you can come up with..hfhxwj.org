** Ron/Snape. I'll leave the fused shipname as an exercise to the reader.

The first time I saw "Snily", I was really bothered by the last name/first name thing and kept referring to it as Sevily. After confusing a bunch of people, I gave in to the common name for it, but it still bothers me a bit. Besides that, here's some shipnames I always found amusing.

- Tomarry: Harry/Voldemort
- Honks: Harry/Nymphadora

"Well, Mr Black, I'm sure I could forgo punishment if you agree to /submit to my authority./" She glanced up from her work with a coy smile.

Quick as a flash, he had her pinned to the desk with her arms under his.

A hinny is the offspring of a male horse and a female donkey - not exactly flattering.\\
In a way, Hinny as a ship name could be construed as an insult to Ginny, putting her in the role of the female donkey.

** I've seen Draco/Pansy as Dransy before. The fic was awful. I imagine Harry/Sinistra is a weird one (Sinarry?Harristra?Harrora?) Fumbridge is another awful one that no one ever needed. Croyle/Grabbe is a bit odd too. I could list thousands from ao3 etc but I wont bore you. Snotkirk was the worst i think I've ever found. That's Snape/Potter/mafalda Hopkirk (hofkirk? Idk)
