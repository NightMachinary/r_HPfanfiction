*** Or the one where he was sorted into a house and kept making up different names to trick Snape into taking points off Slytherin. I think that was Time Warp but I'm not sure

** I read a fic ten years ago where he was sorted into both Slytherin and Gryffindor. He was friends with Draco and with Ron and he had a room that fit his bed and on one side there is a door to the Slytherin common room and a door to the Gryffindor. That's all I remember!

** I have read one where several students were sorted "provisionally" into a house. That meaning that they could go into more than one and they had the option of switching if it didn't work out.
