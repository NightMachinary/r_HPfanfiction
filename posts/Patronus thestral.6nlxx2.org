Okay, a person can't see a thestral if (s)he hasn't witnessed death. But what about a patronus thestral? Can a person see it?


** I think so. A patronus is a guardian that takes the form of an animal and has its own magical abilities(sending messages,defending against dark creatures) it doesn't really turn into the animal it only looks like it

** I would say yes. The Patronus isn't actually a thestral, but takes the form of one. That is, it doesn't have the properties of the animal, but just the shape.

** Wow, imagine a patronus thestral, though. How that person must relate to it and also their feelings and heart. An interesting topic to explore, for sure.

*** In my head after his second Avada Harry is recruited by Lord Death and can't die after that and immediately resurrects after any deaths as good as new. He hates his immortality and so the happiest memory becomes the memory of being dead, his patronus is thestral.
