There are so many stories where Dumbledore is absurdly evil and incompetent, where Ron is a brain-dead, food-munching monster; where Hermione is an encyclopedia with no actual talent; and so on and so forth.

Now, without questioning whether Dumbledore is good or bad or any of that sort of thing I'd just like to ask this: is it possible for bashing to be well done. Give me your best shots at convincing me it's an entertaining or well thought out device within fanfiction. What is the best bashing fanfiction you know, and why do you enjoy it as a device?

Edit: I have to say, given the number of bashing fics out there I thought there might be one person who'd defend them as a general thing. Still, good to know that no-one believe's un-ironic bashing is a good thing.


** The only (/only/) way that bashing as such can be of any interest is in a self-aware crackfiction. linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild)'s Voldemort is cretinous to an absurd extreme, but it's clear it's not /intended/ to be the author's honest feelings about the canon Voldemort, more of an exaggerated parody that's as much a parody /of/ Voldemort-bashing as of the actual flaws of how Voldemort is written in canon. In a slightly different way, linkffn(Core Threads) had a brief "dimension-travel" adventure where Harry ended up in the world of a typical Manipulative!Dumbledore Fem!Harry story, and again, that Manipulative!Dumbledore was hilarious, but only in a self-referential way because the reader already knows about the actual bad Manipulative!Dumbledore fanfictions that it's making fun of.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

*** I have to admit that I'm inclined to agree with you, and even then it can just become boring if it isn't done with a sufficiently self-concious sense of humour. I did, generally, enjoy 'Like a Red-Headed Stepchild', though I'll have to go and read Core Threads (thank you for the recommendation).

** Is it really "bashing" if it is true? I mean IMHO Dumbledore really is the root of all the bad things that happen in Harry's life (ok: Not all, he didn't kill Harry's parents - unless it's and AU-Fiction where he did or you are making the case that the order should have regularly questioned the members under veritaserum to route out all traitors (which I think they truly should have done at random intervalls!)) from having him placed at the Dursleys to having Snape "teach" (what this guy is doing is anything but teaching IMHO! I mean in every chemistry or physiks class you get a savety "briefing" before doing any experiments and making potions is more delicate and dangerous than most experiments! "The recipe is on the blackboard, get started!" is NOT teaching, that is endangering of students and would get you fired IMHO!), to keeping secrets (Sirius should not have died for example!), to not trying to remove the 'crux (he simply stashed Harry like a weapon! You might be able to make the case that at first he didn't know, but even when he did Dumbledore never tried anything!), to not letting Harry have grief-counseling (Harry has survivor's guilt after both Cedric's and Sirius' deaths!) etc. etc.

So yes, I "bashing" (as in: Dislike/Hatred for a character!) can be used well...hell, it could be the driving force that makes a story AU ("I want my revenge on Dumbledore, Snape and Voldemort, so I guess I will have to learn magic well and I will have to network with my peers to get access to the influence of their parents, so I might strike a blow against them!")

ps: I am still baffled how Harry could forgive Dumbledore and Snape! I frankly would have probably endorsed Skeeter's book "The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore" and given her an exclusive interview to add my story to that book :) and I would have talked about Severus "I am totally a bully and an asshole and love holding childish grudges" Snape, too!

pps: Don't get me wrong I love Snape as a character, but I still hate him, too - Same for Dumbledore! I love to hate the old goat!

*** Even if you assume that Dumbledore is the root of all evil that doesn't mean that a story which plays up whichever bad features you believe he has, whilst combining that with a complete uselessness which leaves him as the butt-monkey for the heroes to beat up repeatedly, or humiliate isn't bashing. You can try to spin character interpretations, but bashing (I would argue) strips the character of all nuance and leaves him, her, or ze as a pale imitation of a human being. Does the bashed Dumbledore in fanfiction actually behave in any way which really resembles the original, or any human being?

Even accounting for the examples you give (some of which people might suggest are perhaps a little open to interpretation) it doesn't mean that Dumbledore wasn't acting according to the social norms of his society, and wasn't trying to prevent a genocidal maniac from taking power. Flawed, without a doubt, but he wasn't without virtues either. Does taking that away really improve a story?

I would argue it might result in rather unnatural interactions. 'I will have to learn magic well and I will have to network with my peers ...' Neither of those are things which people are actually necessarily going to naturally do, and in fanfiction they often appear as an unpleasant volte-face.

Ignoring other reasons, Harry is basically a Christ figure. Forgiveness is practically his middle name. Also, you would have a pretty good reason not to give an interview to a woman who is suggesting that you murdered him and will continue to do so. Possibly find another outlet. Don't you think it might be a little ironic to take out a grudge against people for taking out grudges on people?

Snape is an intensely flawed individual, and I can't pretend to like him as a person. However, attacking him or removing him from play could easily have made matters turn from bad to worse.

**** Never said that Dumbledore is incompetent (ok, he partially is! Because he truly should have checked the stone/ring for curses and he should have never relied on only an age-line for the tournament etc. - not that mistakes don't make him human, but he makes too many of them (unless they aren't mistakes and he wanted things that way?))

No, kids don't network unless they are shown (I myself shared class with dozens of well connected kids but nobody showed me how to network, so I never did and now I am REGRETTING IT every god damned day! I could have a damn cushy and well payed job if I did, but no I didn't! Thanks parents for not showing me...then again: My dad wasn't raised knowing this and thus didn't do it himself!) or are more intelligent than then is the norm (sadly for me: Nope, not Einstein, so as I said I didn't and now I regret it)

Yeah and that makes the story this bad, this messiah-complex of Harry (and that society agrees with him, when they aren't villyfying him!) and his un-earned forgiveness! Frankly deleting this would make the story more intersesting and realistic (it would mean that Dumbledore has to make it up to Harry somehow and that Ron and Hermione both can't walk all over Harry because of course he will forgive them if they just say that they are sorry (they don't even have to mean it!))

HP canon isn't great, IMHO it's the world that draws people in (at least it was for me!)!

Does Harry truly hold a childish grudge if he doesn't like a headmaster who condemned him to abuse? I think that is a better reason to dislike somebody than being bullied by that guy's father! Same for being pissed off about being treated like shit by the guy with the childish grudge (I myself would have probably made them drag me to potions after that first lesson! Damned, I got a whole class of people (well: Half, all the boys!) to stand up and leave the classroom once because the teacher was teaching stuff that was not on the curriculum that the girls liked but the boys hated! We banded together, organized that and even did it! Damned, I was bullied by many of those very same boys, but in this instance we came together! But Harry just lets Snape walk all over him!)

Not really! Remove Snape from teaching, but keep him on as the resident potionsmaster! Brewing for the hospital-wing and doing research on the side (I bet he would be more friendly if he didn't have to teach "dunderheads")...hell, maybe even keep him as head of house (those should IMHO not be teachers anyway and neither should they be deputy headmistress!)

***** Children I knew had networks, but they didn't do it consciously. Not until much later. Nor do they necessarily respond well to networks. The average, or even the exceptional eleven year old, doesn't go and create political or social networks. You would need an exceptional prodigy and if we're honest that sort of level of ability tends to isolate people rather than making it easier for them to interact with people. If you have an adult in a child's body the likely result is not that t the other children will like them, but that they will be shunned as weird. Personally I find networking a bit distasteful, rather too much of an old boys'/old girls' network going on anyway.

I'm not sure that's actually a flaw to the story, its an aspect, but only a flaw if you don't believe in the virtues and values of unconditional forgiveness. I would prefer to aspire to act like that, rather than behaving as a vengeful god. People who spend their lives obsessing over the faults are normally the ones we'd consider villains. Do you want to live with bitterness and hatred forever? If so Snape might just have found a friend. I'm not sure it would make it more realistic either, because there really are people like that out there, look to the examples of numerous people who were almost insanely self-sacrificing in the concentration camps. Yes, there are people who took other paths, and yes they can have compelling stories, but it doesn't mean that one is necessarily more realistic than another. The beauty of humanity is in its infinite variety and insanity. Also, Harry does behave pretty poorly to Hermione and Ron in turn, most friends have faults, the principal of friendship is (I would argue) that we find the people whose flaws we can tolerate and forgive those faults.

How many teachers who annoyed you at school, or adults in your life have ever had to make it up to you? You mentioned your Dad didn't give you coaching in networking. How did he make that up to you? How many people do you know who operate like that? What do you do to make it up to people who you've hurt?

I'm inclined to agree that HP Canon isn't perfect, but I think the fact that it creates flawed people who forgive, hurt and make mistakes is one of its stronger points, not one of its weaker points.

How deeply did say Victorian children hold vendettas against their parents? Harry may have been abused by some criteria (and I'm not going to touch on the debates which rage over his treatment), but given the circumstances he's raised in he's more likely to see it as fairly normal. I'm not very surprised he doesn't hold much of a grudge given that there's a lack of alternate experiences for him to draw on. I think it would also be fair to say that he does hold a pretty big grudge against Snape for years, but he decides in the end that he won't be defined by it. Harry's ability to move forwards is one of his greatest strengths. Harry smashed Snape into desks, knocked him out, insulted him, and repeatedly opposed him. I think you may also be forgetting that to some degree Snape represents an institution which (were he removed from it) could see him thrown out of the wizarding world permanently.

If you feel that Dumbledore might protect him, well consider that Dumbledore in the books says that the prophecy is not binding. If you want to believe in evil Dumbledore then his logical solution once he knows Harry is a horcrux would be to kill Harry and then finish off Voldemort efficiently, if Harry is too much trouble.

Heads of Houses traditionally are teachers in my experience. We have no evidence to suggest that's even a remote possibility anyway, you're imposing a lot of fanon ideas there. I'm not particularly sure Snape would be nice under those circumstances, he would just have a smaller range of people to take out his bile on. He is a twisted man who was broken by events which he'll never forget. He shouldn't be a teacher if we're applying modern muggle standards, but on the other hand ... have you ever read 'Decline and Fall'?

** Ok, I'll give a "yes" example. Bashing is a comedic art. When placed in a non comedic story it breaks the tone and takes the reader out of the story, unless it's done very subtley. And even in comedies it can move past the point of comedy and into the realm of "ok, I get it already."

linkffn(Triwizard Tales) is a comedy where Ron's eating habits are so bad a dragon gets named after him. I don't recall us ever seeing Ron eat in the story itself so the bashing, while subtle, is there. A much less subtle bashing is performed on Draco and is arguably over done.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) is also Ron bashing, but, while amusing, was just massively over done.
