I don't think there is much doubt that the purebloods a always held a significant amount of power in Wizarding Britain, and muggleborns were always lower-class citizens, in practice of not legally. The death eaters weren't like the KKK, some sort of group exercising their power over just the lower class citizens, they waged a civil war using guerilla tactics against purebloods of a differing ideology.

Civil wars have been waged when two or more groups have strongly conflicting interests or when the actions of one group cause great harm to another. The purebloods were not set to lose anything concrete, their rights, money, and power were not in question.

Terrorism is a tool of the desperate; these people were rich and powerful. I'd understand them going out to hunt helpless muggles for their sick pleasure but why take on the whole country and invite the displeasure of people with actual power? They weren't going to get (much) more power or money by risking life and limb.

So how do you think Voldemort got people with a lot to lose but not much to gain to fight and potentially be killed?


** The same way anyone persuades a group to persecute others. Persuade them that they could lose what they have to them. Persuade them that they're less than human, maybe not even human at all. Persuade them that this 'enemy group' is a rot or a 'cancer' in their society, a threat to their values, their families, their stuff. That's how most bigotry begins and maintains.

I don't know if it was just a convenient excuse to round up Muggleborns or an actual sincerely held belief, but the Muggleborn Camp thing Umbridge was running supposedly held that Muggleborns were stealing magic. So, that doubles as Muggles being positioned as a threat to a Magical Person's identity, especially for Purebloods with all their 'magic blood is superior' nonsense.

Hell, could just be a mix of unchecked power and his personal authority. Check out the Stanford Prison Experiment, or the Milgram Shock Experiment, or the Asch Line Experiment. People will follow the crowd to fit in, will follow orders to the point of electrocuting a person to death. And give them unchecked power over others and they'll fall into barbarism in a matter of days. So, yeah. Voldemort comes in, says "I'm powerful, do what I say." and enough people obey that the rest of the Pureblood Social Group conforms too, then they get a taste of that power over others that violence and intimidation give, and fall further into it from there.

Plus, all that comes on top of their pre-existing beliefs as well. If they've always felt superior, or they've always felt hatred, or whatever else, they're more likely to accept a powerful person coming in and telling them that he'll lead them to victory, that they can finally do something about it.

And remember, it was a 'KKK' type thing as well as the civil war. They were framing muggles and muggleborns as the enemy while attacking the people in power so they could better do that. If you're a terrorist group, all you can really do is kill people and destroy things. If you're a government, you can control and regulate them too. So, destroying the government they see as enabling the Muggleborn Rot would get them more power and destroy something that isn't kowtowing to their beliefs.

Do we really know this, though? I mean, sure there were rich and powerful pureblood families like the Blacks or the Malfoys, but there were also families like the Gaunts - and I don't remember anything about the Notts or the Parkinsons or basically any Death Eater families except Blacks/Malfoys being wealthy or powerful. In fact, I believe that equating pureblood families with aristocracy is mostly a fandom invention.

(People sometimes bring up things like the Sacred 28, but it was in fact an /anonymously published political pamphlet/, not any sort of a nobility list or a social register)

In fact, I think this might be a good explanation: even if the purebloods held any power, by the time of Voldemort's rise to power it had already begun to wane, and many people joined him because of fear of losing what little influence they had, or a wish to "reclaim" their "rightful place" in society.

So, the majority of those who became Death Eaters were probably not too rich or powerful, but they thought that they deserved to be, and were even willing to follow a half-blood orphan if it gets them what they want*.

Oh, and the really rich purebloods who followed him probably intended to use him in order to cement their control over the Magical Britain, and stop those annoying reformers with ridiculous ideas such as "maybe we should pass some legislation about all this Dark magic stuff?" or "how about we don't discriminate against wizards** on the basis of something they had no control over?"

Of course, we all know how that worked out.

​

* though I wonder how many people knew about Voldemort's origins, even among the original Death Eaters. I mean, before founding the DEs he pretty much dropped off the radar for a decade or so, and then showed up with a new name and changed appearance.

** not discriminating against Muggles or Magical creatures seems to be way too progressive for just about everyone in the Wizarding world.

In an interview, Rowling said that she had worked on a scene where Draco was talking with Theodore where, where she wanted to show how he interacted with his "perceived equals". So even if she dropped this idea in the end, we can at least gather that the Nott were though as a wealthy/ influencial family.

During both the Blood Wars, Tom Riddle being behind the name of Voldemort was pretty much an open secret. The run-of-the-mill Witch or Wizard (like some Ministry Worker or a Snatcher) may not know about it, but the information was know by absolutely everyone "who mattered".\\
In GoF, Voldemort has no problem talking about his "Muggle father" in front of the Death Eater, and since the "original crew" is thought to have followed him since school, they probably knew about this.

Nobody ever tried to use this information against him because it would be useless. It's not like knowing his identity would uncover any weakness (his only connections to the Muggle world were a manor he left in ruin and an orphanage he hated), and, unlike you are Dumbledore, talking about it would just greatly increase your chance of dying a violent death in the following night.

** There were muggleborn ministers of magic. Mudblood was a slur that astounded the people around when Draco said it. Purebloods like Gaunt were poor and had died out. Being pureblood came with benefits but it wasn't an automatic mark of superiority and power.

** Being a Death Eater comes with a really high risk of injury, death or imprisonment. Why would people do it? Yes those who want to hurt others, I can see that, but I've often thought that people like Lucius Malfoy - who probably thinks he's a pretty important person - haven't enough reason to seek out a subservient role to another wizard. Easier to move abroad and keep a low profile far away if they think V is a genuine threat.

** Because contrary to popular belief, *purebloods never held a significant amount of power in Wizarding Britain, nor were muggleborns always lower-class citizens.* The idea that pure-bloods run the wizarding world or that they hold a significant power base is complete fanon. The whole reason Voldemort had such a strong backing is because purebloods were always average wizards like halfbloods and muggleborns. *If purebloods had even a quarter of the institutional power that they do in fanon, they wouldn't have needed Voldemort in the first place.*

In fact, there wasn't actually any discrimination against muggleborns until the Death Eaters took over the Ministry by brute force in DH. They killed people like Amelia Bones and replaced them with Death Eaters, and put most of the Ministry under the Imperius Curse. The only people who weren't killed or replaced were the few who supported them (Umbridge and Runcorn), or those too weak to oppose them (Arthur, Cattermole, etc). As shown with Bones and Scrimgeour, the Death Eaters would just kill anyone who opposes them that can pose a threat. IIRC, Arthur was being monitored by the Ministry and the moment the Death Eaters confirmed Ron was travelling with Harry, he was forced to go into hiding.

Nothing suggests purebloods are richer than the average wizard, either. In fact, you can count the rich pure-blood families on one-hand: Malfoy, Black, Lestrange, Nott, and Potter. That's literally it, and even then, those families are so interrelated that its basically just one massive family tree. Again, the idea that pure-bloods are rich or more likely to be rich is nowhere in the books.

Meanwhile, look at all the purebloods who aren't rich: The Weasleys were working-class up until HBP/DH (post-DH, they became new money). The Gaunts were dirt poor to an extent that even the Weasleys look rich by comparison. The Crabbes and Goyles are both implied to be working-class since they're treated as Draco's inferiors and are below-average wizards. The Carrows are implied to be working-class due to their dialect (similar to Hagrid, Stan Shunpike, or Mundungus). Even the Prewitts were probably only upper-working class at best, or maybe lower-middle class---in other words, just average families. Not even Neville is shown to be from a rich family whatsoever, but just an ordinary family.

The idea that purebloods are more likely to be rich is born entirely from fanon's inability to realise that purebloods don't actually control the wizarding world. They forget that Hermione came from a solidly upper-middle class family, and to a much larger extent, so did Justin Finch-Fletchley---he was a muggleborn whose family was rich enough to put his name down for Eton. Why do people think muggleborns are going to be poor or merely average when there are many upper-middle class Muggle families in the UK? Muggleborns are just as likely to be middle-class as any other person in the UK.

They forget that the vast majority of wizards aren't purebloods at all since they have at least one parent or grandparent who is a non-wizard. Most of wizarding Britain (and thus the Ministry) would be mostly halfbloods. If I had to make a guess at the demographics of the wizarding world, I reckon they could be something like this: 65% halfbloods, 30% purebloods, and 5% muggleborns. I expect most wizards are halfbloods, muggleborns would be a very small minority, and purebloods would be a large minority since most wizards would have a Muggle parent or grandparent.

*TL;DR: Pureblood aren't any richer than the average wizard. There was no oppression against muggleborns until the Death Eaters took over the Ministry in DH with assassinations and the Imperius Curse---it all ended when Voldemort was killed. The only actual oppressed groups in the series were non-humans, part-human wizards, and Werewolves.*

I really do not agree with that. The oppression against non-humans, part-human wizards and Werewolves was written in the law but that doesn't mean that oppression against muggleborns didn't exist.

There was only one Muggleborn Minister of Magic and he was forced to leave the office. I think it's similar to People of Colour in the real world. In most countries there aren't any longer laws that oppress PoC but that doesn't mean there isn't any oppression left: Police violence is a much bigger problem for black people than for white people, PoC are more likley to live in poverty, held less seats in politics etc...
