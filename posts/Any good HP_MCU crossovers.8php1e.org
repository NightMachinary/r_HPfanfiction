Anything will do. I'd prefer it to be complete (in-progress is alright if none are complete) and have half-decent writing.

Thanks, everyone!


** linkff(Wand and Shield) - Decent, starts off nicely anyway (I stopped a dozen or two chapters in, got busy with other stuff).

*** It's really good. The best one by far and just one of the best HP crossovers in general.

***** Well that's a great opinion man, didn't realize I was obligated to agree with whatever someone thinks...

It wasn't a slight against the story, I just had issues with it that diminished my enjoyment.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

** I'm following linkffn(Heroes Assemble!) Which is a nearly 300k word crossover that pulls primarily from the movies, but has a splash of comics in there too

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

** Try Child of The Storm. It starts out fairly rough but quickly grows into its own. The basic idea behind the fic is that Thor was incarnated as a mortal before his glorified sight seeing trip to New Mexico. He was born as James Potter. He lived the Canon life. But upon his death his spirit returned to Asgard. He had his memory sealed by Odin and Harry grew up with the Dursleys. The action scenes and character development are top notch. As is the world building.

** Ff.net is down, so I'll try this. Try non-chronologicaly! It's more fun.
