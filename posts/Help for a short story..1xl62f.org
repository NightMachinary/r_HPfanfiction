I remember reading it ages ago, but it is basically a 1-shot of the summer after 4th year wear Dumbledore puts a warning charm on Harry to detect strong emotions. It is triggered and he is currious as to what set it off only to find that Harry is a very ice skater that practices with a friend (a girl) over the summer. He ends up showing a recording to the rest of the occupants of Grimmauld Place of Harry performing during a practice with her, culminating with a very good dance on the ice. This would have been about approx. 3 years ago and I am pretty sure it is on ff.net. I have been looking for a year off and on. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
