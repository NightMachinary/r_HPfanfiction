:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was looking for a year for a fanfic like that, couldn't find one. I really hate bashing, it just destroys how the characters were intended. For example, I just wouldn't believe Lily and James would abuse their child, just because the other on one famous.

I would really appreciate if someone could help me out.


** Let me introduce you to [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start from “Tales of the Battle” and go on, you can return to the beginning later). One of his many very fine qualities is that there is no bashing at all, because he doesn't need it, he can make real storyline which works.

** linkffn(Potters Stand United (repost) by Fairywm) doesn't particularly bash anyone, though the Potters are understandably mad at Dumbledore when they find out he wanted to separate the twins or something.

  Completely AU. A fierce Lily protects her twins from a meddling Headmaster. This time the adults take action. A different WBWL fic. Good Potters. Powerful Harry and twin. Goes through 4th year. Very minor bashing, kind of, sort of, well read A/N in first chapter. Some romance towards the middle, when the boys are older. OC (Gary Potter)/Susan Bones.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined. Minimal bashing, rated M for violence etc. Harry/Tonks, James/Lily Main plot begins GOF
