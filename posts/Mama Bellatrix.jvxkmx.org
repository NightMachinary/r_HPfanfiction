Are there any storys out there where bellatrix starts to mother harry for some reason or another. Like she finds beaten harry at the park or something and takes him in to the dark side and becomes like a mother figure. I'm in the middle of reading "bone man" (a REALLY long ass fiction that's only 3 chapters) and bellatrix just picked up mom role so I'm wondering if theres any more like that.

I know a lot of people make her the mom of Neville in fanfictions in baby theft storys but I dont want her to be Harry's actual blood mom just a mom figure


** There is a short story that has Bellatrix finding harry when he is first placed at the Dursleys. She takes steps to protect him.

The story Watching over Harry by Jerrway69 has Bellatrix follow Sirius' request to protect Harry. It switches over to romance further on.

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.
