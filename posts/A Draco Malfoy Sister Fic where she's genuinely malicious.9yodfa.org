I hate reading sis fics where she's either super nice or is evil but then has her mind completely changed the second she meets the Golden Trio. It's unrealistic that sometime raised by and with the values of a Malfoy would turn out any way decent, as their views would be influenced from the second they're born.

It's also unrealistic that someone's moral beliefs and values would get completely skewed the second they meet a decent person they should hate. I'm all for a slow turn to good, but it can't be anything immediate


** So I'm guessing you are NOT a fan of fics were Hermione decides that books can be wrong after all, mere moments after meeting Harry for the first time?

I totally agree though, a childhood being raised in one way isn't going to be overpowered by a conversation or two with people who believe differently. Or even a few years of school, especially when surrounded in that school by people who still support the original frame of thought.

Not many (any) fics I've seen that know how to handle stuff like that though. It's pretty much Harry and Girl meet, one of them instantly jumps boat onto the others philosophy. Usually the girl going light, but at times it becomes a pureblood redemption fic instead, with Harry realizing the purebloods had it right all along.

*** I don't really mind fics where Hermione realizes books can be deceiving, but again, she went her whole life studying the books, and I don't think she can just up and forget them all when they're what she's been dependant on for a long time

**** Exactly. Hermione realizing books can be deceiving is fine, character growth or what have you. Doing so because she just met Harry literally 15 seconds ago, and he gave her some line about it... no.

** This is my fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9738656/1/You-ll-Be-The-Death-of-Me][You'll be the Death of Me]]

It's Neville/OC the OC being Draco's twin sister. Still a WIP over 600,000 words later and I can say Draco's twin is still not at the point where she's given up her racist ideals. It's a question to her now, so there is progress, but I agree with you it shouldn't be an over night thing and she isn't a well adjusted individual. Spoiled and exceptionally flawed. Also, excuse the first few chapters before I got a decent beta.

**** I'll check it out, though it seems to be an eighth year fic, so I might not like it. I prefer to know everything that's happened, so I can better understand what's currently happening

Edit lol the first chapter is before Hogwarts so nvm

** People can, and often do, overcome the circumstances of their upbringing. My family is religious, and yet at a young age I began questioning the belief system that I was taught, and am now an atheist. There are also several other things that differentiate myself from my family that is now causing a strain in my relationship with them.

​

So I don't see it as being unrealistic that Draco's hypothetical sister could also overcome the Malfoy family's beliefs. It's how the author writes it. It would be more realistic to see an 11-year old sister who still has some misguided beliefs but that also disagrees with her family on several key points and is willing to listen to and consider other perspectives. This would be a great starting point to see some real character development during the course of her Hogwarts years.

*** Yes, I see where you're coming from. But I also believe that when a certain belief system is engrained into a child from basically since they could walk, that it would be very hard for them to go against that in such a short time.

It's like the frog in boiling water. If you plop a frog into boiling water, it'll jump out. But if you place it into regular water and slowly turn the heat up, it'll remain there until it dies. So if the girl were to go 'hey I don't think mudbloods are that bad' and Lucius backhands her, she's not gonna be too willing to follow them. But if he were to slowly over time get more violent, she'd be more likely to follow them.

** Being born into a corrupt or abusive family does not make you doomed to be the same as them. I hated how my mother treated me for as long as I could remember, and although admittedly it did influence me - caused me to act to others the same way she acted toward me, even if I hated it and had empathy enough to know I didn't WANT to do it to others - with years of therapy and help I have been able to manage myself, to cope and to restrain and to change, and alter my views and beliefs about people and how they are supposed to behave toward each other. Now I am not the girl who, on being "rescued" from the abuse by her older sister attempted to abuse that same sister herself despite it. The girl who hit her and yelled at her and actually BEGGED HER to be returned to the woman who molested her because she MISSED IT and LIKED IT. That girl is not me, that twisted and hurt teenager.

No, now I am the adult woman who is positive, and optimistic, and helpful and kind as I can be most of the time. And I am very much not like the mother who raised me. When I have the anger, and the urge to yell and to hit the person in front of me, I do not do so. I will not do so.

Believe me it is NOT unrealistic for a child to realize, even very early on, that what they live with is wrong and that they do not want to live with it. Even if they cannot fully commit to leaving it, changing themselves, or seeing the full scope of it all. But if they do they can become so much better than they were.

*** Difference: Being treated in a negative manner is VERY different then being thought other's should be treated in a negative manner. Yes yes, even a rather dimwitted child can realize that no, it does not like being beat and abused and what have you. Considering another category of humans as "Inferior", "Sub-Human", or "Not really people", that is a lot harder to observe and decide is wrong when raised with. If it wasn't, racism would never have become a thing, having been wiped out within the very first generation of humanity, and any subsequent generation that decided "That tribe over there is little better then animals really."

**** Yes, racism, while extremely horrible, is something easily influenced upon a small impressionable child. Which is why I don't care for many Draco-sibling fics, as the child tends to be an absolute angel who loves everyone, which is very unlikely for a Malfoy child, given how they're raised

***** Yeah, the best way I can imagine a malfoy raised child being an angel that loves everybody is kinda in the way everyone loves a puppy. "Oh it's so cute, look at what it's doing. It thinks it's people, here have some of my table scraps." A kind personality, but weighed down by the fact that muggles just aren't "people" in the same way wizards and witches are.

I think it could be swung into a character that even seems good, does more or less the good thing, but for all the wrong reasons. But even that is an extreme, much more likely to be somewhere between malicious and just negligent really. ("Muggle? I've never thought about them. Savage brutes I'm told. Muggle-borns? Well I suppose somebody has to do the menial jobs right?")

*** And that's absolutely horrible what you had to go through, but I meant a slow burn (is that weird to use normally?) of abuse, like the frog in boiling water, which I referenced in a previous comment. I'm just saying, if raised under the "right" circumstances, the child could turn out just like or even worse than the Malfoys. I just meant that it was a tad unrealistic that a child raised like that would become the polar opposite to them, though of course it's different for every person
