Hey guys I was wondering if you could help me find some fics that are similar to Harry Potter and the Hidden Truth. Stories where Harry is the 'missing' twin of the boy who lived or something along those lines. Any and all help is appreciated.

Edit: Or stories where he is taught by the founders.


** Well he's not missing in this, but the Sacrifices Arc (a huge series AU of all seven books) by Lightning on the Wave has Harry as a twin. It's rather angsty but the world-building is phenomenal. I can't really link because I'm on mobile, but the first story is called Saving Connor and all of them are on Fnet.

I came here to recommend the sacrifices arc series as well. I'm telling you it's the best! Listen to Mel966, it really is just that great.
