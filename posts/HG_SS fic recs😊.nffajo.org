Hi fellow HP-nerdsðŸ˜˜

I have read Hermione/Snape fics on and off for about.... 16 years or so and yet i am looking for recommendations!

The thing is, i reaaaaaly love the fics in which Hermione and Severus are connected, somehow, by a magical bond, soulmates or anything where they need eachother and or can feel the others feelings or the like. BUT the best is when severus, hermione or both try to ignore or fight the bond, which results in Hermione being very sick, suicidal or something alike. And then severus is very sorry that he indirectly caused her harm, cause he was doing what he thought was the best for her/him

Same scenario with Remus/Hermione is welcome as well

Something along the line of Longing by ??? Cant remember
