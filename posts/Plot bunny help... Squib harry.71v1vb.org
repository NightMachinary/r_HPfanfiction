*lengthy post sry* I wrote a story where Harry's a squib and Lily runs off with him. Almost like a drabble. That's where it ends. I want to expand on it but I want it different. All squib Harry fics winde up Harry secretly a wizard, a seer, ect, something magical where Harry is... Gifted. I don't want that. A plot bunny with pure Squib Harry is biting me in the ass. I got a Harry/Voldemort concept buuuut it involves Harry as a seer. Kidnapped by James, used by Dumbledore (blah blah blah)

Is there a job Harry could do that's magical but not? I was thinking something with Runes? I'll presume you don't need magic for them. 100% Squib Harry but there's something abt him... Maybe crossover. Sry just lost, need some ideas. ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜« Help lol


** Technically he could study arithmancy (which, I believe, is mathematics?) and theorize Ancient Runes (but wouldn't be able to channel power through them). He could maybe work with magical creatures, but it would be dangerous (Hagrid has limited magical access AND the benefit of being half giant to keep him relatively safe). He's also capable of studying astronomy. Potions is mostly wandless (I believe there are a few potions that require incantations).

As for JOBS (which I'm guessing you mean career?) he could be a shop keeper, librarian/book collector, or apothecaryist or a potion maker (either at a shop or for a healer). He could collect materials for potions. He could study muggle artifacts. He could translate ancient texts. He could be an author.

My questions for your plot bunny would be (a) how would Lily know Harry is a Squib if he was a baby (I was under the impression that information became suspected later if no magical ability was shown through the childhood years but only confirmed after an attempt at schooling), (b) where does she take Harry, why, and how does Harry then proceed to grow up, and (c) what does that ultimate showdown between Voldemort and Harry look like if Harry is a true Squib?

Being that Runes channeling power is pure fanon, that's alright.

But you're right that Lily couldn't know for sure Harry was a Squib until he turned 11.

**** I was basing rune power off how Runes are done in a lot of other magic systems that are similar to JK Rowling's, since we don't actually see Runes at work in the HP Universe (which is kind of annoying...I hope it's one of those questions that eventually gets an answer). You could, of course, use a rune system that doesn't require magical abilities.

***** Well, word of god is that Ancient Runes is just a language and alphabet and has no inherent magical capacities --- it is merely the scholarly language for wizards, similar to what Latin was for scientists up to the 19th century. The Runic copy of /Beedle the Bard/ bequeathed by Dumbledore is a good example.

*** Well I wrote the one shot before I REALLY googled much on what a Squib was. I based a theory that the magicals would know at birth with a 'ritual'/spell - because of fanwork. Lol. Apparently Squibs are muggles with the ability to see the magical world. In my one shot it's solely Lil with Harry and her internal struggle how her husband could disown their son and essentially James wasn't as different as other purebloods. /You can accept a werewolf best friend but not a Squib/ It's a short one shot. She simply bundles Harry up and out into the muggle works awaiting a cab. I didn't get farther than that. I have many plot bunnies jumping around as to how to proceed. In the end... The only reason WHY there was a 'showdown' was because Voldemort killed the Potter's before turning his wand to Harry. Let's just say Trelawney still made her prophecy, Snape did tell his master... But what if Lily had taken her son away from all that she knew before said attack. Before Pettigrew could betray the Potter's. What if Lily escaped with her son before he could toddle about? Cannon says the Potter's were attacked when he was 15 months old... So... What world would it be if Voldemort never attacked the Potter's, if James had come out of hiding because he no longer had reason to hide under the fidelius charm, who would Voldemort then attack or would he this time be defeated by Neville Longbottom in the same manner? Would he just send his Death Eaters to do it? There's an endless possibility and theories. Where would Lily go? How would she truly escape a marriage? Can she live on the run with her infant son - muggle style? She has no formal education (as a muggle) can she find refuge as a witch elsewhere without being found? Where would they go? How would Harry be raised... There's many questions I'm keeping and tossing because in the end... Would Voldemort bother to hunt his 'vanquisher' if said child of the prophecy was proven to be a Squib? What worth is a Squib? Should I keep the muggle-ish Harry working a magical profession OR have Harry be somehow 'special' to catch Voldemorts eye? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
