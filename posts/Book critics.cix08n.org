Hello, I am planning on writing a book based in by the world of Harry Potter but set in the modern day, please can people give me things they liked/disliked about the original books and give me any tips on writing. Thank you!


** Of first, not a book thing but rather a fanfiction thing : Why do you want to put the setting in the modern day? I mean, one of the best point of the book (and the reason why it aged so well) is that the story is not really set into time. Sure compared to today we know it's in the past, but the story would easily happen during the 60's or the 70's with just some minor adjustment. And I have yet to see a fanfic that put the story in modern day, but do it "well". Most of the time it's just an excuse so Harry could listen to whatever group, or cite whatever movie . . .

​

As for what I like with the books, it's the fact that the characters are complex and flawed (well outside of Voldemort I guess). It's something that is often changed in fic : I have some "Harmony" fics in mind with perfect Harry/ Hermione, and a Ron so bad it's a miracle he survived his childhood (both because he seems to stupid to breath, and even his parents should have seen he was evil and drown him).

Another thing that is really great with the book is that the universe really is magic. Sometimes when you are not really sure about what happen, you can say "magic" and it's work. You can't "explain" Harry Potter thanks to it and I think it's great.

** Things I like about HP: complex, flawed characters

Things I don't like: villain is two dimensional bad guy who just stops short of twirling his mustache while tying the hero's girlfriend to train tracks

**** It's an allusion to a genre known as melodrama in which the characters are very broad and cartoonish. The villains stereotypically indulge in dramatics like typing the ingenue to the train tracks. I was suggesting Voldemort was a flat character.

******* Okay I can try, my idea is that the child is a juvenile (his father was a death eat, I'm might tie him in with Voldemort's army but I am not sure) and the villains are going to be death eaters that attempt to turn him

******** Very few people think that they themselves are evil. People can do the most appalling, horrific things and still be very sure that they are making hard choices. It's a cliche that everyone is the hero of his own story, but it's pretty much true.
