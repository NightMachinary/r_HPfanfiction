I just came off of a reread of The Muddy Princess my Colubrina. I really enjoy having a post war fic with no big bad, and no action. Just people putting their lives together after the war. I especially like how the Slytherins are portrayed. I know many fans are willing to burn Draco in effigy, but he and the other Slytherins really were brainwashed into their ideology from birth and conscripted as child soldiers in a fight that shouldn't have been theirs. I know I've read a couple of other fics that involve this sort of thing, but they are usually a build up to some sort of conflict and it was nice to not have that.


** I really liked most of Colubrina's other stuff. The Green Girl I feel is very under appreciated. The First Day by little0bird is good too.
