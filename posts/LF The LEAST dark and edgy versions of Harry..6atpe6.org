I want cheerful Harry, optimistic Harry, pervert Harry, chill-as-fuck Harry or whatever else you can think of that /isn't/ Harry being moody (unless he's /Mad-Eye/ Moody). I'd also like it if romance /isn't/ the main genre (but it's ok if it's there as a sub-plot). And anything from Harry being wimpy as fuck to literally being a god is fine with me.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

*** Almost finished the sequels (I wish I could have read an entire 7 years of lazy Harry) and I think this is actually the smartest and most clever Harry I have ever read. There are tons of stories where Harry is supposed to be smart but that usually means they say he's just picks up spells easily or has read a ton of books or something... The smart in this fic is the kind of cleverness that requires the author to actually be clever him/herself and come up with creative solutions.

** The Harry is pretty true to character in this one, but he's seen through the eyes of an adult (who he isn't feuding with) - so it's a little different ...the angst is less visible. And he definitely starts getting optimistic! It isn't a romance. Canon pairings are there, but not the focus.
