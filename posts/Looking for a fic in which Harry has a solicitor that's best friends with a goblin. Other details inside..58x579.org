** Hmm, let me guess... best friends with Gringotts goblins, right? Manipulative bastard named Dumbledore? Lots of stupidity? Incompetence?

I know just the fic for you, good sir (or ma'am!)! I believe it is called [[https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on#q=lord%20potter%20fanfiction&safe=active&ssui=on][Every Lord Potter fanfiction ever!]]

*** You'd think so, right? But no, it wasn't quite so generic. Not a lot of stupidity and incompetence and it had at least a few decent twists. If it was that generic, I wouldn't be as interested in finding a specific fic, would I?

*** Believe it or not, I know of a Lord Potter fic that doesn't have nice Gringotts goblins, no manipulative!bastard!Dumbledore, rampant stupidity or general incompetence but rather completely nuts Goblins that helped only so they could charge incredibly large amounts of money, a good Dumbledore who let Harry keep the scare because he thought Harry would have liked the memento (and if you recall the beginning of PS, Harry actually liked his scar), people who generally aren't complete idiots and overall increased competency of many, many, many people in the Wizarding World.

***** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Origin War). It has /slightly/ helpful goblins, but that's only because he paid them to check out his scar because he thought it was impeding his ability to learn, and then he was going to consult with Sirius on how to fix it (because goblins literally crazy), but the horcrux pulled some shenanigans, killed a few goblins so then the goblins took care of it, and charged Harry ridiculous amounts of money.

When Dumbledore found out about how the scar was affecting Harry, he felt regret at deciding to let Harry keep it as a memento.

Basically all adults are significantly more competent at what they do. Bill and Charlie are basically amongst the best at their fields, Sirius and Remus are terrifyingly skilled (and so was basically everyone the years they went to Hogwarts, to the point that an actually average wizard (Peter) was considered substandard). Hagrid had a valid reason for trying to breed fire crabs and manticores together (manticore quills degrade at high temperatures, and Hagrid was trying to create heat resistant manticore quills for potions purposes).

It's not the best fic, but the issues aren't related to Lord Potter clich√© bullshit.

And now that I think of it, linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) is a fic where Harry (once he turns 17) is a Lord that doesn't have the overly helpful goblins, rampant stupidity and incompetence or a manipulative!bastard!Dumbledore.

***** Yeah I wasn't a massive fan of it myself either, at least after a point. But it's just that one argument scene between Dumbledore, Molly and Harry with a couple of the other Weasleys looking on that I quite like. It's written well and you just never see Molly actually standing up to DUmbledore so it was pretty refreshing.
