So I watched the amazing series Peaky Blinders recently, and have been wondering if there are any good HP fanfics out there where the MC is the leader of a traditional Gang or Maffia.

Also any crossovers with Peaky Blinders would be great, but I only found like 2-3 on FFN and AO3 combined. :/

  Remus had the Dursleys whacked. Tactfully, of course, and well after Harry left the house.

** linkffn(6699398) This may interest you, it's not very long (only about 40k words) and has been seemingly abandoned since 2011 but it does have a gangster Harry in it. It's also a Wrong BWL so that may turn you off if you're not a fan of that particular trope.

  The city of Stilwater is a perfect haven of vice and crime; home to gangsters, businessmen, villains, psychopaths...and the Boss. A place where few wizards would thrive -- yet destiny must have a sense of humor, for where else would it strand Harry Potter, one-time hero to Wizarding Britain?

**** I have always liked this fic and hated it at the same time... It is quite well written and I love the plot. BUT I hate the way Harry acts and how everyone is portrayed. Everything Japanese is always portrayed to be right, and the only way to act. At the same time anything british is treated as rude... Harry is offended and finds it pathetic that british children and people don't know japanese customs... All of his friends adopt this way of thinking almost immidiately aswell...
