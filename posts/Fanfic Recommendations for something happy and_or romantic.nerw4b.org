Hey guys! I need something sweet and uplifting. I would prefer a lighter story, something that can help me keep a smile on my face. I would also prefer something romantic and I don't mind if it has smut or not. I know it's kinda vague, but so much is keeping me down. I need something happy and I also want some romance on the side haha

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][House Proud]] is a favourite of mine and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1157217][Matchmaker, matchmaker]] is really cute as well with a similar premise. If you really can't stand Drarry (even then I'd suggest giving these fics a try), fics like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24204940/chapters/58307161][Percy Weasley and the Prefect Job That Isn't a Vanity Role]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1748005][these two one-shots]] never fail to make me smile.

** If I'm not too late, and you don't mind post-war EWE SSHG, then here are...

My #1 go-to comfort fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/641517/chapters/1163321][The Marriage Benefit]] by miamadwyn which is short and sweet and /hilarious/.

I've also /written/ some that might fit the bill:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27293059][Constellations Above the Bonfires]] at 3300 words alternating POV described in reviews as "bewitching" and "like a warm hug in story form"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26580946][So You Think That's an Age Gap?]] at 1900 words Hermione's POV described by multiple reviews as very fluffy.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29359479][Letters by Candlelight]] at 10k words alternating POV described in reviews as "beautiful" and "enchanting"

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28292328/chapters/69327945][Fridays I'm In Love]] at 27k words alternating POV is a little bit more serious and while it is definitely an HEA please check the tags and consider how you feel about love potions as that can make the difference between seeing this fic as light and fluffy versus a very serious commentary on the problematic nature of love potions in the HP universe.

Also thank you for asking this, as I may have to check out some of the other rec's people are giving :) :) :)
