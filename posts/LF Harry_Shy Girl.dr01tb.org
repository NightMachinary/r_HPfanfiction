I'm looking for any fics with Harry paired with a shy and slightly clingy girl. Preferably not H/G and longer than 30k+ would be great. OC or established character doesn't matter, same with AU or Canon-ish.

An example might be Natalia in the early stages of linkffn(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament)

*** If you're talking variety, there's always the Hansy pairing. Pansy isn't exactly shy, at least not as portrayed in the fandom, she's more of a rebellious Slytherin, especially after the war since she's still public enemy number 1 due to trying to sell Harry out right before the battle of Hogwarts. Anyway, she's a social pariah, so she acts like it; she's loud, vulgar and un-apologetically honest. She's also hot, and she knows it. I feel like Harry is */somewhat/* the shy, clingy one in that relationship. He can be just as much of an ass too.

A good fic I'd recommend here would be:

linkffn(Touch by turbulenthandholding)

I'll find the rest for you once I get my phone fixed, since they're all downloaded on the app and I don't have them favorited or followed on my on-site account.

  A Hansy Advent Story. Not all of us handle the past the same way: some of us embrace it, reject it, grow with it, or relive it in recurring nightmares. Harry has saved the wizarding world before; now it's his turn to be saved. Rated M for substance abuse, PTSD, language and sexual situations in later chapters.

***** Why does everyone hate on Draco and Pansy? For God's sake, they were raised as rich and spoiled only children, of course they'd turn out to be annoying arrogant selfish prats in their teenage years. And remember, in canon, we only saw them in their TEENAGE BLOODY YEARS. The human mind isn't finished developing til the age of 25! People change late in their adulthood, let alone their late teens/early twenties. Draco and Pansy were scared shitless during Voldemort's reign. She, because she wasn't an academic genius like Hermione, a tactical mastermind like Ron or a a magically gifted and brave soul literally destined to kick the bad guy's ass like Harry. She was just a schoolgirl already having to deal with the "All Slytherins are evil" stigma. And Draco literally had the fucking bastard in his home, eating at the head of his table. He was obligated to do whetever he had to for his mother's sake, and on top of that, he was a stupid kid, and as most stupid kids are prone to do, he refused the out that Dumbledore gave him in HBP, thinking he could protect his mother by serving Voldemort. Stop hating on those who don''t deserve your hate. And read the fic I linked above, It'll open your eyes a bit I imagine.

EDIT: Yes, I realize that in the post-war fics, Draco and Pansy are still mostly assholes and arrogant meanies, but everyone has character flaws, and everyone has a way to deal and cope with the aftermaths of war and societal hate.

******* Racist bullies who had that racist-ness (is that even a word?) drilled into them since before they learned to manage their bowel movements and who got used to bullying because that's what spoiled only children get used to. They were pre-teens in a boarding school, what did you expect? You all expect everyone to be slight variations of Harry, Ron, Hermione or an of the good guys. In reality, everyone has their flaws. Ron's an attention seeking jealous buffoon, Hermione's an annoyingly annoying booksmart genius with little respect for others' sense of self-respect (she interrupts teachers mid-sentence just to answer their still unfinished questions) and Harry's afraid of confrontation to the point of cowardliness (he only does what he does because he has to, not because he chooses to.) Why are you all so dead-set on hating these two kids? As I see it, sure, they're bullies and they're assholes to the marrow, but that's what the wrong upbringing can do to ANY child. If Harry, Ron and Hermione were still the heroes and heroine of this story, but were complete dickheads about it, would you still root for them?

********** Forgiveness is all well and good, but there's a world of difference between forgiving someone for past behavior which they regret and for which they've tried to make amends and forgiving someone for ongoing behavior which they've no interest in changing and genuinely believe to be, at worst, morally neutral.

Can you point to any passage across all seven books that indicates Parkinson might feel one iota of regret or remorse for how she treated Hermione? And for all people talk about Malfoy's supposed redemption, he says not one word and takes not one action which indicate he's rethought his views on blood purity.

edit, because I belatedly realised that I'd responded to very little of what you actually said:

- nobody is refusing to look at Malfoy and Parkinson as human beings, at least not on the grounds that they "make mistakes." Though plenty of people don't look at them as human beings because they aren't: they're fictional characters. Furthermore, years of ongoing, racially-motivated bullying is not a "mistake." It is the result of a series of decisions, and it's perfectly reasonable to judge both real people and fictional characters on their decisions, the latter doubly so in a series where one of the main thematic conceits is that people are defined by their decisions.

- I know King was real big on compassion and general cheek-turning, but using the words of a civil rights leader, even one as determinedly forgiving as he, to excuse, again, /ongoing/ racism is not a good look.

- Malfoy and Parkinson are nowhere near as scarred by the war as is "the other side," which I remind you is comprised of the victims of a terrorist organisation of which at least one of their parents was a willing member. Harry and Neville both grew up abused after being orphaned (more or less) by Voldemort and his followers. Malfoy, at least, grew up in the lap of luxury, and the worst thing that can be said for his and Parkinson's respective childhoods was that they were raised to believe in racist rhetoric. Alexa, play Despacito.

- at no point did I call you anything resembling a "death eater sympathising cunt." I wasn't trying to indict you for sympathising with, again, /fictional characters/; I was merely pointing out, again, in response to a question /you asked/, why many others don't.

- I stand by what I said: I believe your attitude is a problem, but I don't believe it's /mine/; your apparent insistence on foisting it on me notwithstanding.

****** Well I hate Draco because he tried to literally murder multiple students in his SCHOOL, all while trying to murder his principal, and mind controlled two innocent people for an entire YEAR to carry out these plots FOR HIM. He is literally a school shooter type. If you look at it in real world law and morality he is absolutely horrible and disgusting.

I do not HATE Pansy though, because in canon I know nothing about her except she was Slytherin and had a crush on Draco. He wouldn't even tell her his secret Death Eater mission. So she never did anything horrible. The worst she did on screen in the books was bullying Neville or Hermione and Harry a few times I think.

So I strongly DISLIKE HER for that, because I don't like bullies at all on principle.

And as a story perspective, I am sorry I cannot stand arrogant jerk characters. They are not FUN to read, and it is NOT believable when people put them with nice, good characters for romances or anything.

Do not say "FOR GODS SAKE WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE THIS SCHOOL SHOOTER AND HIS BULLYING GIRLFRIEND?!?!?" like they were innocent sweet peas. We all KNOW what they did. And it is every reason enough to dislike or hate their characters.

******* Understandable, but do try to put yourself in Draco's shoes. How would you feel if you had a sadistic, psychotic terrorist living as a guest of honor in your house, and your life, along with your parents' depended on you being that school shooter. There's a reason why we say "Water's sweet, but blood is thicker." and it ain't just about water of the womb and blood of brothers in arms. Most of us would almost always choose our families over anybody else. I know for certain that I'd commit genocide just to spare my mom the pain of a single punch. And by the way, HE WAS A FUCKING TEENAGER. When have you ever seen a 15/16/17 year old make anything close to resembling sensible decisions. Sure, the ends don't always justify the means, and some of the things Draco did in canon are ARGUABLY inexcusable, but he was a stupid scared kid, used to a life of money and having whatever he wanted only to be told "No no, if you want your life back, you have to become a terrorist and a mass murderer." We're all human. We all make mistakes, and we all answer to the duty of being human to other humans, which means forgiveness and second chances. Try reading some good and well-written Dramione fics while keeping an open mind, and maybe you'll see what I mean, one day.
