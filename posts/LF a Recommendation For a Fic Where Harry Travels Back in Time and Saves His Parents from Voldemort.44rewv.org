I'm looking for some kind of time travel fic where Harry saves his parents lived but has to help them fake their deaths the way we all know it so that the time line is kept intact. Either they go into hiding or they are but in some kind of stasis / enchanted sleep for however many years. Are there any fics out there like that. Most of them just seem to be Harry traveling back to his first year from some point on the future.

  Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.

** Im a time travel junky, and while most are harry (and co.) Traveling back to 1st year, there are many that go to the maruaders era or beyond. If you havent found those yet, you may want To look into them. For some reason, hermione is a favorite to travel back to that era.

As for saving harry's parents AND preserving the timeline? I have never seen it. 2 reasons i think:

1) this plan would need to be done without lily/james consent. No way will they let sirius rot in azkaban or let their child grow up abused and unloved

2) fics that completely preserve timelines tend to be be few and far between. Most try to make changes small to keep future knowledge for a year or 2 longer during harry's Hogwarts years, but the characters that would save lily/james wouldnt have knowledge of the next few years, and their presence will likely change enough to remove future knowlege of harry's hogwarts years anyway. In addition, big things dont happen in those years with regards to voldemort anyway, so its even less of an issue.

*** I actually read one or two stories about Harry going back to the mauraders era and the only reason I really asked about preserving the timeline is because both stories I read (can't remember them now) had Harry not revealing his true identity or not doing anything to change his parents fate because he had to preserve the time line. I really just want to read Harry meeting his parents and them finding out who he is and him saving their lives. Do you any recommendations based off that? I had trouble finding any and that's why I got into Dimension Hopping fics more than time travel because it seemed easier to find fics where he meets James/Lily.

**** Well in that case, in delenda est (the other reply), there is interaction, and the timeline is changed enough that they survive

Im gunna link a few with interactions between the traveller(s) and lily/james, though not all of them survive, and not all of then reveal their true identity. And most importantly, not all of them are great, some i read just because i love time travel.

EDIT: added spoilers pertaining to which have james/lily surviving, and whether the travelers identeties are revealed or hidden.

  What if Voldemort had not called for a cease-fire half-way through the final battle? What if the death toll had continued to mount until in the end, Harry stood victorious but alone? What if Harry decided that such an outcome was unacceptable and set out to change things, to re-write the prophesy that had always defined his life? WARNING: not JUST about time-travel.

***** Thank you! This is great! :D I just love stories where Harry gets to meet his parents. I usually don't like stories where his parents survive and raise him because I always love the drama of Harry who grew up without his parents getting to meet them somehow. Anyway, these recommendations look great! *EDIT:* Out these stories the only one I've read before is Harry Potter and the Balm of Time.
