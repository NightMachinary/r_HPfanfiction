the scarcrux merged with harry potter at a young age. Voldeharry belives he is the surviving remnants of Voldemort knowing he is much weaker and vulnerable in this child-form as well as missing large pieces of his own memory he decides its best to act like Harry would to avoid Dumbledore working out his true identity.

He befriends Ron and snubs Draco because Dumbledore would never expect the reborn Voldemort to do such a thing. He takes up qudditch to throw Dumbledore off his tracks

he is a very supportive and caring friend the old fool dumbledore will never expect him. he even lets Ron and Hermione call out the flaws in his plans. though honestly he wondered why the death eaters never did such things his plans succeeded way more now anyway. perhaps Ron and hermione where just more competent then his previous batch of followers. he even encourages Ron's talents even buying muggle books on strategy to foster him Ron will be one of his finest lieutenants one day. He also encourages hermione to go outside her comfort zone of the library and bought her a book on wizarding politics she will be his puppet minister one day. he gets Sirius black's named cleared because that is what harry potter would have done, Dumbledore will never suspect him now.

It is now the end of fourth year, Voldemort is back and Voldeharry is complete broken inside he thought he was Voldemort but the ritual can only be done on the main soul and now voldemort walks the earth again. so what does that make voldeharry ? who does that make Voldeharry ? Is he Just a broken Horcrux ? why is he spending so much of his day thinking about how to set Ron and Hermione up on a date. why is he so obsessed about winning at quidditch again why is he so keen on hearing stories about James and Lilly potter from remus.

Young Voldeharry gets ushered to Dumbledores office after the rebirth of Voldemort he sits in the headmasters office with all these thoughts racing in his mind.

Dumbledore looks at Voldeharry and asks him how is he feeling


** That's literally what [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]] is all about:

  "Well, I'm Draco Malfoy and I was hoping to speak to you" -- he glanced disdainfully at the Weasley -- "Privately."

  The Weasley bristled. I held out an arm. "Quiet, I know exactly how to handle this."

  I smirked. "So, you wish to join me. Your foresight is commendable, and I assure you that -- should you choose to be my minion -- I shall allow you a sliver of my eventual glory."

  Malfoy sputtered in indignation. "I'm a Malfoy. Malfoys are not minions."

  He stormed from the room. Lucius always was a drama queen. I suppose this might have been easier had the boy not been under the impression that I'd killed me.

  "That was brilliant, Harry. You really showed him," the Weasley said.

  "Yes, I suppose I did. Although it would have been nice to have a minion..."

  "I'll be your minion," he offered.

  I sighed. "No. That would be too easy.”

  She stared up at the professors with big, innocent eyes. I grinned. Not only was Ms. Granger clever, but she was apparently an adept liar and surprisingly loyal, considering our previous lack of a relationship. If she was as talented at dueling as she was the simpler magics, she would resemble a younger, saner Bellatrix. As we hurried to our dormitory -- dismissed by the professors -- I seized the chance to recruit a new minion.

  "Hermione," I said sweetly, "Do you want to be friends?"

  Merlin bless the simple interactions of children.”

  He said, "You seem nervous, Harry."

  "I, um, don't like being called into a teacher's office?" I said.

  If I started running now, I could probably catch him by surprise. Unless that was what he expected me to do. Curse him and his elaborate traps...

  "I think I understand what your greatest fear is," he said gravely. "You believe that you're like Voldemort. Don't you?"

  "Uh..." I wasn't sure what facial expression would be appropriate for the occasion, but I was fairly certain that the terror currently overwhelming my features was not a good choice.

  The old wizard chuckled. "Allow me to set your mind at ease. You are nothing like Lord Voldemort."

  I gaped. "Really?"

  "He was a cold, cruel child with no friends."

  In my defense, I was very devoted to my studies, and Dumbledore is exaggerating. Lots of people liked me. Except for him.

  Dumbledore continued, "He would never have gone to protect the Stone or set off into the Forbidden Forest to save his classmates from Slytherin's monster."

  Admittedly, I didn't do either of those things, but I certainly wasn't going to tell him that.

  "...Also" -- his twinkle intensified -- "I have it on good authority that he hated Quidditch.”

****** No, not even in early years. What do you think a Voldeharry is going to react to the PS and CoS being opened? He's going to steal PS for himself and ask the Basilisk who awakened it. There would be no canon plot progression whatsoever.

He knows the real deal about Sirius and Wormtail. He only has to decide who's better off as his minion. He will however have no scruple killing any of them to advance his purpose.

Unless wraith Voldemort dares to knock up other Death Eaters, as in Seventh Horcrux, I don't see how he could mess around TWT or come back in Year 4. Barty Jr should still break free, but he will not be able to find wraith Voldemort that soon.

I mean don't you get tired of this Graveyard Resurrection Scheme that has been repeated ad nauseam in fics? Why can't we see something different? We should Voldemort *always* return in Year 4?

******** Well, if you insist on that Graveyard thing happening, he and Voldemort are of course going to duel and most likely kill half of the Death Eaters present with their indiscriminating Avada Kedavras, like in "Seventh Horcrux".

Then this guy will decide to build a new power base and get rid of pesky competitions. One possible route he could take is like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9541467/1/The-Heir-Of][The Heir Of]]. He's not going to trust Dumbledore and his Order, but he will manipulate Sirius, Remus (powerful werewolf a great asset!), and Tonks (metamorph too useful!) for his own purpose. He's going to turn Hogwarts students into his private army.

But Voldeharry will differ from Voldemort. He will be a lot more keen in risking his own neck, he will be a lot more protective of his friends/followers, and he will be a lot more reliant on persuations/manipulations. I see this guy very much like the Tom Riddle in the [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/][There is nothing to fear]] series. Of course, he is still a scumbag, is still utterly merciless and ruthless, and will betray anyone should the need arise.

So yes, this prompt could lead to your perfect "Harry as the third faction" story. There would be no ridiculous teenager Harry power wank and progression, and it will be interesting to see how our canon good kids perform under a Voldemort's leadership.

A final word about [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/ivl38v/one_more_dig_at_movie_ginny/g5s33oj/][Ginny]] here, this girl has darkness in her heart, and is fanatically loyal to whoever she follows. Voldeharry will absolutely groom her to be his new Bellatrix.

********* My view, is voldeharry got far more changes from the harry aspects then he realises.

and over time realizes he doesn't need to justify the fact he cares for his friends.

** Huh this reminds me of one of my story ideas where Harry discovers the soul shard of Voldermort and his mother residing in his head before he goes to Hogwarts but with the scar mort having no memorys of being Voldermort and only knowing his name is Tom and for reasons unknown to him a anger towards Harry and Lilly which he quickly tosses aside with them constantly being nice to him only to become shocked and disgusted when he's introduced to his past life as Tom Riddle/Voldermort.

** Seems like a good read. I vaguely remember reading an one-shot in which Harry merged with the Horcrux and at first tried to carry on as Voldemort, but ended feeling guilty for everything Voldemort had done (since psychopathy is a biological trait that Harry didn't have) and devoted his life to make the world a better place.

P.S. How would Harrymort not notice Quirrelmort in first year (as the premise is that he only had the revel in fourth year)?
