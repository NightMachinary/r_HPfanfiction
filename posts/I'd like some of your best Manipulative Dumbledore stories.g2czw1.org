Here are some things i'd like to see in it, doesn't have to contain all BUT it NEEDS to be finished, AND over 20 chapters i dont want none of those 8-10 chapters. NO SLASH

now here is a list of things i like to see in the fan fiction (optional)

-Weasley bashing/evil weasleys

Im talking about weasleys who only want Harry for his money.

-Granger bashing/Evil Granger

-same as weasleys

-No support from classmates / housemates and other houses wont support him

-Harry is all alone

-Mentor Snape

-I NEED ONE THAT HAS HARRY COMPLAINING TO VOLDEMORT THAT DUMBLEDORE WAS USING HIM. (find as many as you can)

-Force marriage contract with Ginevra (if its Male!Harry) or Ron (if its Fem!Harry)

-Godlike Harry

Try this one. This is ff with EVIL EVIL Dumbledore. Harry is in Ravenclaw and it is a major AU.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18111758/chapters/42816263]]

in this fic Dumbledore is an enemy to the Black family. he is not the main focus of the story, a bit on the side, but I liked the idea of Black family runes and magic.

​

For Mentor Snape - try this one. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6782408/1/Digging-for-the-Bones]] It is very dark and centers on Harry being abused by Dursleys, so not sure if you would like it, but it is very well written and I liked the psychology in that.

**** one of the more recent chapters has Dumbledore really kicked and harry does have a relationship of a kind with Snape and manipulative Dumbledore isn't Dumbledore bashing there is a bit of Hermione and Ron in there but its more of a righteously angry moment
