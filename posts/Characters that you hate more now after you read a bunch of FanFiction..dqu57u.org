For me, it's a tie between Snape or Hermione. I didn't care for either of the characters beforehand but now I can't even look at them without being sick. My rationale for Snape is definitely more logical, he just seems obsessed with lily. But for Hermione, it is totally irrational. I hate how authors characterize her as some goody goody wizard prodigy---don't get me started on the “brightest witch of her age” nonsense---she's basically turned into a Mary Sue in most FanFictions I read. It's so annoying.


** The Dursleys. When I read the books the first time, it was just “evil stepparents” background noise. Fics, even though some exaggerate, really made me stop and think about the level of abuse that was happening. I never liked them to begin with, but they went from flat, static “bad guys” to genuinely evil people.

Technically they are. Simply bad step-parents don't put a kid in a cupboard for ten years until they are 'caught'. They don't treat a kid like a slave, they don't feed him through a cat-flap...I could go on. There's been lots of discussions about Harry's abuse, but honestly, if the audience had not been young teens for the books, if an author had depicted Harry's abuse seriously, Harry would have been a severely mentally damaged child. The Dursleys were absolutely despicable, even in canon. It just so happened that JKR 'softened' the portrayal of Harry's abuse for the target audience.

** For me, it's Molly Weasley.

Things like how Ron is lowkey written as having a rather troubled childhood, the twins bullying him so much, always being on the short end of the stick in terms of possession (secondhand everything), how she was cold to Hermione simply because of that Rita Skeeter article.

I dunno, after reading a lot of fanfictions that expand the Weasley children's childhood, just have a different take on her character.

Fate by TheTrueSpartan is probably the biggest contributor in this thinking.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

****** I do think that he got off too lightly for his crimes in canon (which however is not unrealistic when you compare it with the denazification in Germany after WW2 for example), but the question if someone is redeemable cannot be decided by consulting a law book. I don't think many people would disagree that he deserves jail time for what he did to Katie and for letting the Death Eaters into the school.

But just because someone commited a serious crime for which they deserve jail time doesn't mean that they're irredeemable. It's rather a question of if they're able to change, to become a better person and to take responsibility for their deeds.

I think that Draco is very much capable of the former. By the end of Deathly Hallows he is very much disillusioned with the Death Eater cause and only does whatever it takes to stay alive. Canon never goes far in a redemption arc though, if anything it is merely the very beginning of one. But considering how Scorpius turned out, it is very likely that Draco managed to leave his past beliefs and attitudes behind to become a better person. But is Draco capable of taking responsibility for his past deeds? I doubt it, he feels like the kind of person who would just blame everything he did on the influence of Lucius and Bellatrix.

Why should he be given the choice though? Ignoring the war crimes, attempted murder, treason and so on, there is this line from GoF: /The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban./

And Malfoy undoubtedly used the Imperius, on someone completely unrelated to his mission nonetheless, so even by magical standards he shouldn't get out.

******** If there's anything to take away from canon it is that the justice system in magical Britain is messed up and broken.

Does the Imperius Curse warrant lifelong imprisonment? There is no equivalent to the effects of the curse in the real world, but I would argue it shouldn't. To temporarily strip someone of their free will is certainly a heinous crime and well worth a jail sentence. But is it worse than permantly maiming someone? Is it worse than rape?

If you say that someone is irredeemable because they have commited a crime that warrants a life sentence, then you have it backwards. It's the other way round, someone is sentenced to a life sentence because the society they're living in considers their crime irredeemable.

Now, if you think that Draco's crimes are irredeemable and therefore he deserves life in prison, then we'll have to agree to disagree. Then you simply have a more rigid and strict sense of morality than I have and that's ok.

You have to consider what he did with that curse. He forced Katie, a civilian, to carry out what is basically a suicide attack. Now I am not sure about you, but forcing civilians to kill themselves for your war crimes has to be one of the worst things you can do in a (civil) war.

Before his attack on Katie yes, afterwards, he belongs behind bars for life.

Think about what he did there. He mind-controlled a civilian to make another civilian walk into a school with what's basically a bomb vest to kill someone. He nearly killed Katie there. And he did so without openly distinguishing himself as a combatant but continued to hide his plots under the cover of being a student. That's a long list of war crimes, just from that one attack.

He could have made an attempt on Dumbledore directly, but he chose to attack civilians and force them into his plots.

IIRC the only thing that the muggles in that fic are perhaps self-righteous about and where one could call it muggle wank was when it came to the Wizarding World's politics and judiciary. And let's be honest, the Wizarding World is objectively Bad in that regard. This is not "guns are way better than wands" or "haha wizards don't know any tactics" or anything like that, it's more like "So you don't have separation of powers, your ceremonial head of government is also the leader of your equivalent of the UN and for some reason headmaster of your only school and your trials basically boil down to a vote between the representatives of the established families if you even have a trial at all before stuffing the accused into a prison full of soul-sucking monsters.

I didn't really have that feeling at all. In fact everyone seemed quite a bit more competent than in canon. But there is a point of divergence from canon and everything before that is obviously the same, including people being idiots just like in canon.

  There's also a Hermione who was good at flying, learning to become an Animagus and a parselmouth lmfao, and could beat Harry and other kids at dueling all the while keeping up with her studies.

Yes, which is why it's an issue that Harry isn't all that different while Hermione has a steady power creep. If JKR says he's better than her at defense after having a competent teacher logic dictates he's better than her at it before then if he's actually taking time to study.

And if Harry finds himself at the Grangers when he's 5/6, he's faced 4/5 years of abuse with not a muggle saying a word. They have their own porch to sweep.

The muggle world not being perfect in regards to child abuse is not an excuse for the wizarding world's political system. And if we are talking about child abuse, the Wizarding World is /hardly/ any better in that regard. Apparently /nobody/ thought it problematic that Neville's uncle threw him out of a window, which he only survived because he was a wizard, of which said uncle was not convinced at that point.

*** Hates for certain characters in this fandom are often based on ridiculous double standards:

- It's totally ok to powerwank Harry who beats Voldemort in a straight fight at age 15, who navigates Wizengamot politics at age 14, who collects his harem at age 13, and who inherits gazillions of Galleons at age 12. But if Hermione shows a little more competence than in canon, she's a bloody MARY SUE!!!
- It's really fun to see Hermione physically assaulting Ron with birds and fists. But if Ron complains a little bit too much, he is an ABUSER!!!
- The Hogwarts resident Hitler Youth espouses magical Nazi ideology and actually carries out terrorist activities at the school, but doesn't have the courage to torture and murder his victims personally. "Oh, he must have a heart of gold. He's just misunderstood. Hermione should totally marry this guy!" Their best friend routinely risks his life and stands by them even in direst situations, but has gotten into arguments a few times. "What a traitor! This guy is a filthy devil incarnate!!!"
- This girl has only appeared once, and only because her last name is the next to Granger alphabetically. "But of course, Ice Queen of Slytherin must be the epitome of beauty and Slytherin cunning, the perfect mate for Harry!" Several other girls are depicted as physically very attractive, stand out in certain subjects, but are somewhat emotional as teenage girls should be. They also risked their lives for Harry's cause and fought against overwhelming enemy odds. "Meh, who are those annoying whiny bints???"

Lol.

Surely Hermione is more competent in Starfox5's stories, but so are Harry, Ron, Dumbledore, and Voldemort. Especially his Voldemort would have squashed canon good guys like bugs, and canon Horcrux Hunt would have certainly failed in half of his fics.

The biggest change in Starfox5's fics is not Hermione, but Dumbledore. If you guys are interested in a really competent manipulative Dumbledore, check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877).

I make exceptions for something like the Meaning of Flowers series where Snape takes responsibility for his terrible decisions and seeks redemption while still being himself: hard-edged, snarky, and dangerous. But those are few and far between.

** I guess I am the exception here but there aren't any characters that I started hating after reading their fanon versions. The only thing reading those types of fics does for me is make me hate the author for portraying a character unfairly rather than dislike the character. It also makes me appreciate JK Rowlings more nuanced characterization of them. I find fanon overly abusive Dursleys, manipulative Dumbledore, evil Snape, death eater Ron and love potion Molly/Ginny to be ridiculous and fics portraying them like that are not worth reading or taking seriously.

Although if I had to pick one I am more critical of Dumbledore now that I have read fics overanalyzing his every action and inaction. Harry Potter books did start as children's stories and were never written to be super realistic so I can forgive a lot of inconsistencies in his behavior.

There are a couple of characters for whom I have much better appreciation for after reading fanfiction though. I really didn't care for Tom Riddle or Ginny but after reading fics that expand their character I have started to really like them in certain instances.

** my characters I hate more

​

Lupin. - just how he never reached out, best friend of his father's, never checks on a kid after his parent dies. and the way he reacted to his wife's pregnancy and the whole overuse of his curse.

.Tonks (not a favorite one I am sure to here). I still LOVE the character, but after reading a lot of fanfic. I hate how easy she is and how easily she was a mary sue in the canon. Badass auror who shapeshifts. I feel she was another self insert for JKR. I love the character when shes did right but not the canon version as much feels flat mary sue at times. i feel the fanfiction versions of her depth are so much better.

​

Molly weasely. - the love potion scandal, the smothering mother, the way she never noticed rons own issues to deal with it, how she treated Hermione and fluer. I wish she would have been dealt with more and had more done with her character, she seems a positive influence and could have been more )( got told the potion thing was from fanon and i remmebered wrong. can admit i am a mistake).

.Ron - cause 95% of the writers of fan fiction write such a shitty or bad Ron it's hard to remember a great friendly ron. I only seen a few good fictions were Ron is in a positive light

​

Snape - looking back.. a man who basically never got over a crush and lost a war over it, and even sought to make it better.. he never moved on. that's not loving, that's creepy.

​

Hermione - just looking back espcially the movie Hermione was so mary sue. its like tonks above, in the fan fiction she can be written so much better.. or so much worse like ron lol. like tonks. feel the fan fiction versions often better.

and I like more.

Lavender brown. the Patil sisters - these just got fleshed out more and though at time's portrayed bad, you can see more to them.

most Slytherin kids - you realize their kids and most likely have a side we don't hear about

Cho - your views limited, but it's from harry so meh

​

relationships

Harry/ginny - never seemed right to begin with but so many evil ginny fics, i love a good hinny < only seen a few> but they are so rare. this pairing is rough on me

Ron/Hermione - even the author says shit looking back. they were never going work out much. it can be done well, but as fanon and JKR even says. yeah.

tonks/Remus - she was too young for him in ways, 13 yrs is a lot when you in your 20s to 30s. maybe not 30s to fourts or late twenties to 40s, but their age group didn't work. as well as fact.. he never dealt with alot so was shit to her.I

No, JKR dislikes attractive/feminine women, just look at how Fleur is written. Tonks is certainly no self-insert in that regard. Just look at the scene where Ron is like "she is alright I guess, but nothing special" when talking about a shapeshifter who can literally look like anyone on this planet. Although JKR admitted that her choice of relationships in the last book was influenced by her pining after her ex. She said that in regards to Ron/Hermione, but I feel like it spilled over.

******* It's legal in the entire UK, the marriage without parental consent is a Scottish thing. It's even a pretty common theme in older fanfics.

I mean, I guess it really depends on how you get to the relationship. If you base it on looks and bad pick up lines, yeah, that's weird. But if you base it on character, you should be able to get something non creepy. And if you don't bring up the age at all, it doesn't really factor in. I mean, A boy and his cloak is one of the best smut fics around despite the fact that it's set at the start of OotP. Meanwhile a lot of fics get weird if they bring up how hot someone is for their age, without getting into explicit territory.

I also remember a school lecture (Der Vorleser) we had to read where a 16 yo has a fling with a woman twice his age, and no one, not even the female teacher, raised an eyebrow at the age gap.

Well, just write. I started out writing because I was annoyed by the lack of certain story themes, so I said "I'll write my own, with blackjack and hookers". And those first few attempts sucked. A lot. I cringed when I went over my old stuff while editing it again. But I got better because I kept writing.

I feel like that's due to the authors being too, well, I'm hesitant to say romantic, but that's kinda the issue. Just look at "Rune Stone Path". I like that fic, it has the best mentor/student bonding I have ever read, but the relationships in there were an utter trainwreck because the author used a lot of pureblood culture BS to justify and equalise the relationships when a "normal" poly relationship would have worked much better.

My main problem with Harry/ginny is that it came out of nowhere. Pre book five Ginny is known just as Ron's little sister, she's a nonentity. In book five we get interactions with her but they are few and far between. Yet in book six Harry is pining after her, a roaring monster in his chest, yadda yadda. There is a reason it's so easy to write ginny as love potioning Harry, from what I can tell they barely know each other.

Yeah, Ron and Hermione really only ever agree on one thing in the books, helping Harry. Once he moves out and isnt as big a part of their lives, they would probably start fighting, constantly, like third or sixth year. They dont work as a couple because they always needed someone as a mediator between them. Plus, Ron has his inferiority complex, and Hermione is kinda known for her "holier than thou" attitude. The less said about the whole Lavender debacle in Half-Blood Prince, the better.

Agreed. Remus was also kind of a dick in book seven, and so heavily fixated on his curse that he kept pushing her away. They need to work out several major issues.

Ffs really shine a new light onto books/shows and most of the time gets me thinking a bunch deeper into how bad incidents are that are just brushed over (such as Harry sleeping in a cupboard for eleven years and Marge's dog chasing him up a tree and him staying there all night).

Not even Harry's teachers and fellow students knew and they seen him almost everyday. And Harry never told anyone, not even at school to Ron and Hermione his best friends I don't ever remember hearing him say anything about the cupboard. Which is actually realistic because most abused kids don't tell, unless someone asks.

I honestly don't think Dumbledore did know Harry was being abused, he was a lot of things but being in touch with the day to day he was not.

In cannon he bullied Hermione first year purely because she was smarter than him and tried to help him cast the levitation spell properly, shunned Hermione for a couple weeks in third year because she told McGonagall about the */potentially cursed/* broomstick, spent several months of fourth year not talking to Harry because he wouldn't believe that Harry didn't put his name in the goblet, walked out on the trio 7th year because he was hungry and tired, and was overall a lazy piece of crap. But I guess we should like him cuz he's good at chess or something.

In fanfiction he rarely contributes anything positive to the story, is often included in the "bash everyone" genre of fics because he's easy to hate, is almost always a judgemental ass who automatically thinks Slytherins are evil simply because a hat sat on their head and said a word, and is almost always a poorly constructed character with little to no development in most fics.
