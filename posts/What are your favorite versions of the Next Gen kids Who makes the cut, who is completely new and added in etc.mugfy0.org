What houses are they put in, what are their personalities, do you have the people have as many children as they do in canon? Do some of them not get born in your version? Is anyone replaced? etc.

2003 - James Severus Potter - Gryffindor - beater I Quidditch - shy and reserved - wants to work with creatures like mum

2005 - Regulus Alastor Potter - Slytherin - Seeker - loves reading and drawing - wants to be an Auror like his dad

2006 - Lily Minerva Potter - Hufflepuff - wants to be a Potions mistress

2006 - Pandora Xini Potter - Ravenclaw - wants to travel the world and teach about the dangers of spell creation

Ron Weasley + Hermione Granger

2003 - Rose Violet Granger-Weasley - Ravenclaw - a know it all and little dorky - has a quick temper

*** I love this so much. I always thought Harry should have used Sirius as a first name for one of his kids, not just a middle name. Extra kudos for Regulus Alastor!

**** Thank you! I've always loved the idea of Sirius and Regulus getting to be proper brothers this time around. Also, Harry got to give Sirius as a first name in mine because he already had two boys (since they are twins). I always reason that he wanted to make sure both got honored in canon but wasn't sure he would have another boy.

** Either “Raindrops on Roses” by backinyourbox linkao3(373224), or “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]” series by Forrest_of_Holly (starting with linkao3(1048010)). Both of have them canonical names, but I really cannot care less about those names, it is just convenient that I know who we are talking about (“Rosemary Weasley, yeah, that's what Rose is called, ...”). And yes, Albus Severus is an unfortunate name.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
