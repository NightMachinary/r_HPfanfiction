OK , so I was watching the Half blood Prince, and when i saw the part where Dumbledore visits Tom, and he tells him that he can consciously use magic it got me thinking.

So we know that Tom is not using accidental magic because as you known: accidental magic is when a wizard or a witch uses magic without meaning to, due to a strong emotions. But wandless magic is: intentional magic (maybe not specific spells in the case of children).

Now we also, know that Tom is fully and concisely aware of how he is using magic, even if he doesn't know that it is fact magic what he is using. And we also, know that when a child no matter the age uses magic, it can be traced back to them- and since Tom was probably the only magical child at the orphanage, it would be fairly easy to determine that he had been the one to use magic.

Furthermore, we know that Lily Evans used wandles magic when she manipulated the flower pedals in front of Petunia, and not only that, but also, got a few warning for it. And there is also, the matter Of McGonagall who used wandless magic when she was a child, but we do not know if she did get a warning or the ministry left it to her parents to discipline her.

So if Lily, got a Warning how come Tom didn't? specially, since the magic he was using was rather dangerous, and he used it in the presence of muggles. Heck how come Harry never got a warning, but his mother did? I guess in Harry's case you could say it was due to his aunt's protection, but then again how come he did get caught when he used accidental magic on Marge?

So what do you think? did Tom get away with it because it was a different time, and they didn't care as much? Or he was simply lucky?

I figure there is something i'm missing, so if anyone could tell me what that is that would be great


** Lily never got a warning before school, and neither did Riddle. The Ministry doesn't punish kids who they presume cannot control what they're doing (and besides which, they're really too young to prosecute). Because in 99% of cases, consciously controlling one's magic without a wand and as a kid, the way Riddle and Lily could, is impossible.

** I'm pretty sure Lily's warnings were after starting Hogwarts. They don't have the Trace before then. Hermione did intentional magic before getting to Hogwarts and there was no mention of her getting a warning, either.

*** There's a theory that the Trace is applied on the First Year's boat ride up to the school, when they pass under the ivy-draped archway.

*** We don't really know if the Trace is a piece of magic on the person or if it's a spell at the Ministry. If the latter, there is some quality about underage magic which makes it trackable which changes when you turn 17, breaking the Trace's ability to detect you. If the former and the spell is on the person, we don't know when it is applied.

Lack of prosecution of pre-Hogwarts magic can equally be explained as a lack of enforcement as a lack of detection.

**** Not quite; if the Ministry constantly got readings of magic being performed at Wool's Orphanage, day after day, wouldn't they send in some Obliviators just in case? Which they clearly didn't.

***** They might have done usually, but they were dealing with problems like Grindelwald, so maybe their manpower was stretched?

I'm not suggesting that this was definitely the case, I'm merely suggesting it as one possibility.

***** While Tom developed control of magic early in life, I never got the impression that he was actually using it all that often.

In any case, from what we can see, enforcement follows a very limited procedure. There isn't anyone sitting around next to the Trace "input feed", monitoring it for general items of interest. It's literally:

1. Information comes in: X magic performed at Y location.

2. Y location is checked against list of known underage wizards who have completed first year of Hogwarts and live in Muggle areas.

3. If step 2 returns no results, do nothing.

4. If step 2 returns a result, AND the date during school holidays, AND no notice has been received of an adult wizard in the area, send a warning letter.

****** Good point --- but wait now, is there /nothing/ Trace-like to detect large amounts of magic? How /do/ the Obliviators know when to drop in?

** Given his situation, it's quite possible that the orphanage simply wasn't being monitored by the ministry. This may have been because they didn't monitor everywhere and the orphanage wasn't seen as important, or because of the aftermath of the war (remember the state Britain was in after the absurd amount of nazi bombing).

** Doesn't the trace kick in when they are issued a wand? Prior to that it is considered accidental? We only know for sure Hermione was doing magic on the Hogwarts express (no concrete textual evidence of deliberate mahic earlier) and as there were plenty of people on the train over 17 I'm guessing it gets lost in the "noise". Like the twins doing magic at home working on things before they cime of age doesn't attract attention because magic at the residence is expected with several older wizards living there.
