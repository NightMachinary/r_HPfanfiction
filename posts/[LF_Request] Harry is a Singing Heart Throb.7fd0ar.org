Looking for stories where Harry is a Singer/artist who is very popular with the ladies.

Please don't link me to the Honestly Harry series, I know Harry, Hermione and Ginny do sing in that but I am actually looking for just Harry or Harry and a Group of other Guys who are singers

It's a self-insert, but a fun one. The MC is Harry's sister and is the ultimate Mary Sue. Her lies become truth and her whims butterfly away the entire Vorgon Invasion (Ron becomes a firm believer in towels and Hermione answers the Ultimate Question), and she and Harry start the greatest band in Rock History (and along the way, teach Wyld Stallyns how to play guitar with the Force).
