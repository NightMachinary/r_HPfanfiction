:END:
I'm looking for a HPxNaruto fanfic where Harry ends up in Naruto seal (but outside Kurama's cage). Harry becomes Naruros brother/father figure, despite having being only in his head kinda. Though, eventually Harry can 'get out' via shadow clone...I think one of the plot points involves Jirarya finding out about Harry and thinks he's the Kyuubi...And for some reason I want to say Iruka learned about Harry and they grow close via their connection to Naruto. I don't think it was every completed, but I'd love to re-read what was there anyhow.
