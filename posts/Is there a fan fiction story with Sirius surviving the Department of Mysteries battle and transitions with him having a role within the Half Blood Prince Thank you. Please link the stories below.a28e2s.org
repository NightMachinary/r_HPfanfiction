  Post-OotP --- Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. Rebuilding his life with a war brewing in their world isn't simple. It's a good thing he has a family that he can fall back on this time. OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? Harry & Sirius family fic. Canon divergence after OotP to DH but compliant. No Slash.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290): Super!Hermione was activated there and crashed the Death Eater party. There is no further need to repeat the HBP and DH plot.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
