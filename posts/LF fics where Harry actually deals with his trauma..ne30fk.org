not limited to any particular parings or characters, but I do love some Drarry content lol. I just want to read something done well and not where he deals with it for one chapter and then moves on perfectly fine..


** In Dobby's Deceit he spends a lot of time talking to a therapist linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17452775/chapters/41095088]]) but he's still very young because it's just after second year

In linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637]]) he is also dealing with trauma but I can't remember if there's any therapy

Those first two are major bashing though.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8517286/chapters/19522336]]) lullabyknell tends to have a Harry that deals with ptsd a lot. There's also a really interesting thread in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]]) about the pensive and snape's memories that really fucked Harry up and how he deals with it and also meeting his parents literally just after he's killed Voldemort

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25323505]]) Harry is a mess

Those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head, so I hope they have something you will like!

  What if Dobby bound himself to Harry without Harry knowing about it? How would that influence the story?

  Prisoner of Azkaban AU: After the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match, Harry finds himself striking up two unlikely friendships. The first is with Hufflepuff's captain, Cedric Diggory. The second is with the Grim. You know, that canine specter of Death that's been trying to kill him. Between that and learning the Patronus Charm, surviving Sirius Black, passing his classes, training for the Quidditch House Cup, trying to figure out why Professor Lupin treats him so strangely, helping Hermione fight for werewolf rights, and more, Harry seems to be in for yet another busy year at Hogwarts. (Tl;dr: an alternate canon for POA, featuring crushes on handsome Hufflepuffs and canine Marauder dads.)

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Harry's life's a mess, his flat is a disaster, and he can't make it to an appointment on time to save his life. Draco's job is to help people get organised. Add in some cooking lessons, cute kiddo-time, and heart-to-heart conversations, mix it up and see what happens.

** You might enjoy my fic (sorry for the shameless self-promo). It picks up at the beginning of OOTP and explores the effects of Cedric's death and the years of abuse/neglect at the Dursleys. Harry has a lot of ups and downs, but he has a really strong support system, so things always turn out alright in the end. I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for, but I hope it's on the right track!!

#+begin_quote
  Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts ended in tragedy. Now, as he faces a world darkened by Voldemort's return, he must cling to those he loves more than ever. Struggling with his guilt, Harry resolves to work harder so that he can protect others from Cedric's fate. Follow a slightly sadder Harry through a different fifth year at Hogwarts as he deals with an evil pink-clad professor, a mysterious connection to Voldemort, and the very real trauma of his past.
