So let me start this short post off with this:

  I am not trying to break either rule 2 or 3. If you want me to change it please ask, dont remove the post.

So recently I have noticed in my browsing on the new filter a rise in the amount of plagiarised work. Last time this stood out to me it was a person going by the name of "Hazel6" and basically all she did was steal work from other FF sites and post it as her own.

This new person is called "vllad". They have been stealing work for the past few days and it is just ridiculous. Hazel mostly just stole from other sites. This guy is just reposting work from FF.net with his name on it. No credit given or anything. The profile is empty and the person hasn't responded to any of my pms.

What can we do to these people? Again no witch hunting or forming a mob, but I would like this to stop. Unfortunately I cannot seem to find a way to report the person and all I can think of is spamming the forums until someone from FF.net does something.

*** I have messaged the admins on several dozen issues over the last four years ranging from TOS violations to back end suggestions and while some of them were eventually taken care of, I have never once received a response from them. Don't get your hopes up.

**** I think in ten years I've sent about 20 emails. Esp during the outage period in 07-08? Two responses.

** Let the original writer know. They most likely did not give permission, but there is always a possibility that they did. Let the author decide on action. If the author doesn't respond, tell the admin. It's not being a mob of it's plagiarism. If you were going around specifically looking for people violating minor infractions and reporting, then it's a mob...

** It's the same person that has been responsible for all the plagiarism for the last several months. They've probably been reported hundreds of times by now, but the worst that happens seems that the stories get taken down and the dude changes his account name. The problem is that the FFN mods are severely understaffed and they don't seem to do enough to combat this.

** You can't really do much about it. Either get the admins involved or, if you're feeling really passionate about this, post the original authors in the reviews... or something.

** This guy/gal has lifted one of my stories a few times in the last week or so and I've gotten tired of filing with the admins.

Any more, I tend to just post a "review" saying "Not cool" and leave it at that. At some level, these people are their own punishments.

** Yep, there isn't really much you can do. People already know about Vlad, and the multitude of other account names he has appeared under. He has some vendetta against DLP members, IIRC, and is mainly copying their work.

** Review letting everyone know the original is elsewhere, PM the author who's plagiarising, PM the original author, report them to fanfiction.net and mention it if the fic is ever brought up here.

** They may have been taken down. I checked yesterday to see if any of my friends had ended up on his list, and vllad had something like 27 plagiarized fics posted to his account. Today the search field doesn't even recognize his name, so maybe he's been banned. Here's hoping.
