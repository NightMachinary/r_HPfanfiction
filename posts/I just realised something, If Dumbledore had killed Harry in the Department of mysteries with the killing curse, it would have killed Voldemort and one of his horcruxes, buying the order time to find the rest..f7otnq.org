Just thinking about it, Harry would have been fine and the Horcrux hunt could have gone alot differently. for context I am talking about when Voldemort Possessed Harry.


** He'd have won the battle but lost the war. Yes, he'd gain a short term advantage, but - if we are to believe the prophecy - Harry is the one who can defeat Voldemort. With Harry dead, Voldemort will win in the long run.

*** But would Harry be able to return like he did against Voldemort? is their anything preventing the killing curse from doing what it did in Deathly Hallows, where it kills the scarcrux and Harry is given the option to go back?

**** There was a reason why Dumbledore insisted not only that Harry must die, but Voldemort must be the one to kill him. Harry's survival was highly situational. Per JKR:

#+begin_quote
  *What exactly happened when Voldemort used the Avada Kedavra curse on Harry in the forest?*

  Again, Voldemort violated deep laws of magic he did not understand, but there is more to it than that.

  Having taken Harry's blood into himself, Voldemort is keeping alive Lily's protective power over Harry. So Voldemort himself acts almost like a Horcrux for Harry -- except that the power of Lily's sacrifice is a positive force that not only continues to tether Harry to life, but gives Voldemort himself one last chance (Dumbledore refers to this last hope in chapter 35). Voldemort has unwittingly put a few drops of goodness back inside himself; if he had repented, he could have been healed more deeply than anyone would have supposed. But, of course, he refused to feel remorse.

  Voldemort is also using the Elder Wand - the wand that is really Harry's. It does not work properly against its true owner; no curse Voldemort casts on Harry functions properly; neither the Cruciatus curse nor the Killing Curse. The Avada Kedavra curse, however, is so powerful that it does hurt Harry, and also succeeds in killing the part of him that is not truly him, in other words, the fragment of Voldemort's own soul still clinging to his. The curse also disables Harry severely enough that he could have succumbed to death if he had chosen that path (again, Dumbledore says he has a choice whether or not to wake up). But Harry does decide to struggle back to consciousness, capitalises on Lily's ‘escape route', and pulls himself back to the realm of the living.

  It is important to state that I always saw these kinds of magic (the very deepest life and death issues) as essentially un-scientific; in other words, there is no “Elder Wand + Lily's Blood = Assured Survival” formula. What count, ultimately, are Harry and Voldemort's own choices. They have each been given certain weapons and safeguards, but the power of these objects and past happenings lie in how they are understood, and how they are used or enacted upon. Harry has a deeper and truer understanding of the meaning of the objects and past events, but his greatest powers, those that save him, are free will, courage and moral certainty.

****** Either way, IMO the killing curse seems to remove the soul. In which I would say it should also remove horcruxes as they are part of the soul.

Well, I don't really see this, but it probably ties into Harry's mention remorse in their final confrontation. True remorse does /whatever/ and Harry wins.

Unfortunately, it pivots from that directly into Deathstick and wand lore and nothing comes of it.

*** Voldemort would have lost his body and become a wraith is basically what i meant, he would be "killed" like he was when Lilly's Sacrifice killed him originally and he'd have to find a way to get a new body once again.

**** Maybe, maybe not. His original body was completely obliterated- presumably due to his AK rebounding. So he needed a way to get a new one. But would his body be destroyed if he was killed by other means? That is, would his spirit just be able to re-inhabit it, if it was mostly intact, or repaired enough to be viable?

**** If Voldemort lost his body a second time it wouldn't take long for him to be back. The reason it took so long the first time was because his followers all believed him to be dead. Now they know he can come back so they'll be more likely to find and help his spirit.

Not to mention Pettigrew knows exactly what to do to get his master back.

** But Harry would have just been dead, not fine. The only reason he survived Voldemort's killing curse in the deathly hallows was because he was still tethered to life through Voldemort himself (who was still tethered by his connection to horocrux in Nagini). He had to sacrifice himself... it wasn't just Harry's death that fulfilled the prophecy... it was the martyrdom. He died so others could live. His sacrifice to save his friends had the same effect on them that his mother's death had on him; it formed a magical protection around them protecting them from Voldemort.
