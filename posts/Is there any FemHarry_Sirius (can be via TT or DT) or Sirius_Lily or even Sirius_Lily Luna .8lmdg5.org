There's only 1 Sirius/Lily I've seen "I'm not the Only one" and it isn't a focus whatsoever. Sirius/Lily Luna was another one that I've seen once, but wasn't enjoyable imo. Don't remember the name. I'd really like to read a FemHarry/Sirius though. Either original timeline or TT, DT, doesn't really matter, though I'm inclined to an older Sirius with a young fHarry.

  Harry has won the war and lost everything he held near and dear. In desperation he gambles everything on a dimensional jump. HPHG Bad Weasleys good Dumbledore. Rated for language and implied sex

I feel like anything involving a guy and his best friend's granddaughter wouldn't be enjoyable. Yikes.
