Sort by length of fic? No, you'll just end up with extra-long rubbish. Sort by review? You'll see a lot of crap with a LOT of angry reviews. Sort by favorites? Turns out that a lot of people have shit taste. Look at the Favorites of your favorite authors? They haven't favorited anything.


** First, figure out what you like and what you don't, then avoid the genres you don't. No sense reading crackfic if you just facepalm the whole way through, right?

Figure out what you're okay with in terms of completion. I tend to avoid abandoned fics. Drives me mad when I'm 3/4 through and it just stops. Is there a particular thing you have to have in the fic (e.g, horcruxes)? Only read fics written after the book that contains them came out. This is why I usually dont touch anything written before 2007. Finally, make TV Tropes your friend. Learn the tropes and watch for the ones you like.

In the end, the only way I know is reading. When you find a winner, you may not know it for a while. But when you've found a stinker, a few chapters is usually all you need.

This is really a problem for me since quite a few of the ships I would be interested (for example a not insane Bellatrix/Hermione) tend to be angsty as hell and I hate angst (which is a trouble if you want to read femslash in general). Due to the stories available, I have to choose a "necessary evil" and therefore don't particularly enjoy them, even if I think that the premise has a lot of potential if executed differently. Harry/Ginny has the same problem for me, interesting premise, but lacklustre execution (IMO).

  Hermione Granger is still the same person, still the same Gryffindor, only that she was born 28 years before. Exactly in 1951, the same year as Sirius, James, Lily and Bellatrix. What will happen when Hermione discovers her feelings toward a certain Slytherin witch? Read inside to find out! Warning: english isn't my first language, and this is a femmslash. Bellamione.

** Sorting by favorites can be ok if you're willing to work through the long list. There's usually still good stuff in the middle. But there's no way around manual work: Usually I click on stories that sound interesting and just *look* at the text. I can recognize shit writing without reading a single word. If it looks okay I'll usually jump to a chapter somewhere in the middle and just read 2-3 paragraphs. Very few fics survive that step. Those that do get put on a list and I'll just start reading from the beginning. But unless I'm /super/ interested in the premise of the fic it might get dropped quickly.

** You'll not likely solve this algorithmically, so to the heuristics we go!

If I want to find something quick and short, I just pop in the pairing I want and sort by favorites since shorter stories on FF tend to have higher favorites than follows. Flip that if I want to dig into something meatier.

Quality and personaly enjoyment can usually be determined within a few chapters (or in the case of long chapters, around halfway through). I'm somewhat generous and will wait it out /a little/ if the premise hooks me. But soon enough, I expect the writing quality and story logic to carry the day. If the author uses too much narrative where dramatics would work better, it diminishes the readability. Same for if they use dramatics inappropriately, because the story ends up much longer than necessary.

I look for stories where I feel the author quickly establishes the sort of pacing that keeps me interested. I tried to get into "Prince of the Dark Kingdom" recently and I dropped it in the first couple of chapters because, while the writing quality was pretty nice, something about the pacing didn't work for me. I'll probably give it another chance someday soon. Another example is the top Lockhart fic. "Amalgum". Pretty much only the first chapter (which I think was adopted from another author) was good, it quickly devolved into a tropey, repetitive mess.

I hold it against stories which rely on several HP fanon tropes. They're used the same ways so often that I start with the assumption that they will be used poorly and expect a stories I that I see use them to convince me otherwise very quickly.

That's my general approach.

** I mostly just read within my favorite genre, which is dark!Harry fics, or gray!Harry, or Slytherin!Harry. Within this realm, I look for red flags in pairing and descriptions and opening chapters. If it's got Harry paired with multiple girls, chances are it's power fantasy trash. If Harry's name is changed, there'd better be a damn good reason in chapter one, or I will dismiss it as Lord Kitchen Sink trash. And this is just me, but if there's a Harry/Voldemort or Tom pairing, I will be much more patient with giving it a chance. If I get sucked in after the first chapter, I will read it to the end even if it starts to suck halfway through or the pacing is horrible. I've found so few excellent fics like this that I can't afford to be super picky when I'm looking for a new one. I've read most of the well-known ones.

I'd figured if hits meant the story was good at drawing people into it, and kudos meant they'd enjoyed it enough to stay, then paying attention to both of them instead of one of the other could be a good way to sort fics by without wasting too much time. Its definitely at the expense of a lot of hidden gems, but its been reliable so far!
