What are the best fanfics that are currently and regularly updated? I'm looking for stories that are well written and have believable and consistent characterisations. Would be nice to have a list of more current stories, when people ask for fanfics, the good ones recommended are usually old or abandoned.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] by Newcomb

The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthology, or How I Learnt to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]] by Jacobk

... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

Are the best ones that have updated in the past month. Honorary mentions are Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian (updated, but not fully/off DLP), The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb (too early to really count), Hogwarts Battle School by KwanLi (been losing my interest a tad lately, so I haven't read the past few) and My Dark Passenger by Malevolent Mind (which started, but only posted a prologue on DLP).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061/1/Identity][Identity]]: Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy, even among wizards. The most noteworthy thing about him, however, was his talent for getting himself into trouble, which surpassed even that of his godfather. Sequel to "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]]" and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10093402/1/Initiate][Initiate]]".

--------------

Innocent: Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** My favorite right now is:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718/1/The-Hogwarts-Strike-Team][The Hogwarts Strike Team]]

An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]]

Everybody has a Wrong Boy Who Lived story in them, and everybody has a Slytherin!Harry story. This is mine for both. AU, currently in First Year. NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs][The Cupboard Under the Stairs]]

A mysterious green inked letter banished Harry from his cupboard. But does taking the boy out of the cupboard also mean that you've taken the cupboard out of the boy? A first year fic. This is a series and is up to Harry's fourth year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]]

In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10901705/1/Out-of-the-Dark-and-into-the-Green][Out of the Dark and into the Green]]

Shortly before his 11th birthday, Harry Potter disappears from Privet Drive. Accidental Magic takes him halfway through the country, and while Harry tries to find his place in his new life of magic and mystery, the Wizarding World is left to deal with the consequences of his disappearance.

  AU CoS. Stranded in a mysterious new location with no one to aid them, Harry and Hermione must make their own way in an unfamiliar environment armed with only a handful of spells and a desperate desire to survive. Snape hatches plots, Sirius lends a hand and the goblins complicate everything.

It's just so different from the Harry goes to Hogwarts and stuff happens there idea that is a staple (rightfully so) of the Harry Potter Universe that it is a breath of fresh air.

This might seem slow while waiting for a new chapter, but in truth its hundreds of times faster than any other "update once in a blue moon" fanfic.

** There are four stories that I am following that receive updates regularly:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] by White Squirrel. Posts every saturday like clockwork. I believe she has another story, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]] that is also regularly updated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11139302/1/The-Fourth-School][The Fourth School]] by Stargon1. Author seems to be losing a bit of steam on this, the 4th book, in the series. When I first started following, he seemed to post several times a week, but now is slower. (Edit: The first book in the series is "The Cupboard Under the Stairs, also posted elsewhere on this thread.)

** These are the stories I'm currently following, as of 12 June, that have been updating with decent regularity:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10947156/1/Oblivion][Oblivion]] : Last updated 4 June. Part 3 in the Stygian Trilogy, which follows Albus, Rose, Scorpius, and a handful of EXCELLENT OC friends as they battle their way through the rise of a powerful network of dark wizards. Starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]] I recommend you read all three!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10858061/1/Identity][Identity]] : Last updated 1 June. Like Oblivion, is the third part of a series - starts with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]]. Premise is that Sirius escapes early and takes Harry away from the Dursleys. A nice sort of AU take on Harry's upbringing and, in Identity, first year at Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10982480/1/A-Simple-Case-of-Death][A Simple Case of Death]]: Last updated 30 May. Crossover with House MD - sounds dumb but somehow it works. House is basically abducted and taken to Hogwarts to cure a mysterious illness that the best magical minds can't figure out. A decent amount of years Post-Hogwarts. Has a Hermione/Snape pairing, which I usually find horribly off-putting, but it's actually pretty good.

These next two haven't updated for a while, but have been decently regular, if a bit slow.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] : Last updated 18 March. Harry goes blind as a baby when Voldemort curses him, but has the ability to essentially "see" some shapes and so forth. He and Hermione take on the world with their wits.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][The Reign of the Serpent]] : Last updated 20 March. Author's description: "AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze." Really cool and well-developed AU with a neat take on JKR's characters.

***** It is enjoyable but the writing is cold, and the errors are offputing. Compare it to the writing in Salvation in Shadow, Wizard Runemaster, An Unfound Door, and the Travel Secrets series. Those stories get into the mind of the characters and not merely reporting what the character is doing in a particular scene.

Blood Runes could be a novel take on a somewhat rare line of thinking. However, to be truly great, it should be polished.

edit: I already left my thoughts on the fic too via a review. I lasted until chapter 6 because of the style and errors.

Bellatrix's torture of Hermione uncovers a long-kept secret. The young witch learns her true origins in a story that shows the beginning and end of the Wizarding wars as Hermione learns about her biological father and the blood magic he dabbled in that will control her future (Slight AU OotP---DH) Dramione - Pureblood!Hermione - Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.

Shealone has 2 other WIP stories that are also both promising, but this is my favourite. She updates on a regular schedule that's described on her profile.

If you check her favs, you'll find other WIP stories that are updated regularly, I like a lot of Colubrina's stories in particular (One of which just got another chapter while I was writing this comment).
