In an alternate universe, The Joker tricked superman into killing his own wife and child, after which Superman lost it, and killed the Joker. Thereafter he slowly morphed into a ruthless dictator with Batman against him. The heroes of the world were pitted against each other in an unending battle. Superman believed he was doing the right thing. But what happens, when by Superman's own actions, one of the most powerful wizards (in my world lmao) loses his family in the same way he did. Their death has set Harry Potter off the edge in the same way as Superman.

In my world, Harry has the full power of the Hallows behind him.
