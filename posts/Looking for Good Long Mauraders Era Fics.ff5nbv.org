My very favorite fic of all time is Against the Moon by Stoplight Delight, I just finished re-reading it for the 3rd time and am looking for more fics like that. Really long fics that explore the Mauraders time at school with lots of feelings. I've already read "the life and times" and "the shoebox project" so I'm looking for more stuff like that. Thank you so much in advance. Sorry for any formatting issues I'm.on mobile.

** My absolute favorite marauders era fic is All the Young Dudes. It spans from the marauders' first year all the way up until Sirius dies. Eventual James/Lily and Wolfstar, but it's still cannon compliant, so I apologize in advance. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]])

*** Ugh, I love that story so much but realizing it's canon compliant towards the end was just the biggest gut punch.

**** It was so heart wrenching. I love that the author didn't make Sirius and Remus anything other than humans who had been beat down by life, but god did it hurt.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** This one is funny and well-written and really explores all four marauders personalities and friendships. It feels very British as well (at least to me). WIP, both het and slash and with some more mature content.

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from December 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.

**** Haha very possible :) I've noticed it uses trousers and flat and lots of British foods, but those are easy to look up I suppose
