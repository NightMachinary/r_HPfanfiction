One of the most interesting ongoing fics in my opinion, it just got updated a few hours ago.


** A very good update. Felt like I read it in 5 minutes, turns out it was 14,000 words (!).

It's so... ugh. I was totally absorbed, again!

** Awesome! Does anyone know another fic that looks like this? Good written romance, preferably Harry in the muggle world.

*** linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh)

It's not romance but beautifully captures the interaction of wizards and muggles.

*** linkffn(Days to Come) Is the closest. The epilogue in the Pureblood Princess comes to mind also.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

**** little0bird and Northumbrian have a few I believe that involve dates and other general muggle interaction in the muggle world. They are spread between one shots and larger stories though.
