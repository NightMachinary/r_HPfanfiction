Since I've had some time off to actually do some reading, a few things have been front of mind within my favorite fiction category.

What are the things you hate most in romance fics?

A few things on my list--- - canon pairings for the main pairing. This might be controversial but ...why read this? There's no build up, no anticipation, no uncertainty. The one exception is, sometimes, slice of life stories, which can be well done but I don't really consider romance. - when the main characters already like each other before the start of the story. This seems like lazy writing to me. Isn't the point of a romance to show how the relationship of two characters develops? - zero actual drama within the relationship. The characters get together after a few chapters of anticipation and then...everything is great. It basically becomes a slice of life fic with some weak plot in the background. I'm not saying all relationships have to be full of drama but pacing is critical in romance fiction. No one wants to see what happens after the wedding, so to speak.

Honorable mention: authors who write in the summary that they only write specific OTP. Somehow I just know if all you read/write is OTP, it's going to be full of weird tropes.

What bothers you? It would be easier to provide specific examples from stories I've read lately but didn't want this to devolve into “gross, that pairing??” So these are a few general thoughts.


** - married at 11 and having their own living space

- also having young characters act so mature in their relationships

- characters fighting and/or breaking up because of a dumb misunderstanding that could've been avoided if they just talked it out

- full of sex

- accidental pregnancy

- breaking up because of a dumb reason. Like something to a parent/friend so A breaks up with B

- every ex is a bad person. And maybe it's just in the fics I read but the bad ex is almost always the guy and not the girl. She's almost always the one that's hurt

- rushing to get them together

*** I am afraid Ginny in many Harmony stories and either her or Hermione in other pairings gets quite often bashed as well. From frustration over this my-ex-is-as-bad-as-Death-Eater trend I wrote “Late Morning Talks by mcepl” linkao3(20141410) as an exercise on the theme of civilized break up.

*** Soul bonds are a mixed bag IMO. It can be laziness, but a skilled writer can turn them into an engaging plot. (The Meaning of One bonds Ginny and Harry at the start, they share all their thoughts and senses, so there's no real conflict within their relationship. But they face lots of external challenges; Molly is freaked out about her baby girl being effectively married and tries to control their access to each other, Percy is disturbed, Bill tries to sever the bond without knowing what that will do to them, they get framed for compromising behaviour, and incapacitating one of them traumatises the other - not to mention that they share pain. They're still happy to have each other, but it's certainly not all sunshine and daisies.)

** First of all, I can't express how much I agree with you. I would also say canon couples were done incredibly bad so I see why they are far from the most popular ships on ffn and ao3.

- Adult and serious relationships between anyone that is under 16 (and it's a stretch), especially 12-year-olds!
- Clichès everywhere
- Unoriginal plots that have been seen 20 times in every rom-com movie ever
- Adult/Minor relationships portrayed as okay or the best romantic story ever
- Soul Bonds scream lazy writer to me
- Instant love, no build-up to the romance

** I agree with you on these points. I guess with a pairing like, say, Ron/Hermione you see the next stage of their romance after their kiss in the Hogwarts Battle. But I get bored with Ronmione and Hinny too.

Marriage-of-convenience or dating-of-convenience stories when you know what's going to happen, the pairing will fall in love if they aren't already. I started a marriage of convenience with Hermione and one of the twins (forget which one, think it was George) and it goes from 'oh, well glad it was someone I know' to 'hey we're getting married so let's have a first date' to 'hey I think I like George now'...you get the idea. I abandoned it because as you said you already know what will happen. Or 'Draco has to pretend to date Hermione in public to rehab his image'....gee, wonder how that story will turn out?

** Bashing a person the main character would have had a relationship with if it was canon. Just finished reading a story that out of the blue, has Ginny deciding to try giving Harry something worse than just love potion and then she was punished so severely for it that she never recovered. Of course, what the character did was very evil but earlier in the story, there was no indication of this being a thing. I've seen Ginny, Hermione and Ron all to be treated this way in one story or other.

Pregnancies are more likely to end with twins or miscarriage than one baby being born.

** Eh, I don't object in principle to canon pairings. I do object to attraction that just springs up out of nowhere.

Harry suddenly realises at the start of fourth or fifth year that he's been in love with Hermione all along? That's lazy writing IMO.

Ron doesn't apologise after the first Triwizard Task, leaving Hermione as Harry's only support, and he gradually comes around to her better study and work ethic, which removes their major source of conflict and allows them to be more helpful to each other, laying the groundwork for them to start going on dates to Hogsmeade etc? That sounds like a good read.

Canon Harry/Ginny is... Mixed. His sudden awareness of her is clearly driven by hormones, which is realistic enough. It's not really enough for a lasting relationship by itself, but there /are/ hints that he genuinely respects her and they get along well. It's just... They're hints. She's always a background character, even when they're dating. I think the ship has potential, but canon didn't develop it.

** I agree about canon ships, mostly since I don't like them. But here's the thing, Rowling is bad at romance. So there is so much to develop in the canon pairings that if you don't just placeholder them in, you could make them legitimate pairings. I disagree with the after the wedding thing, as it's bad due to the common writing tropes rather than the basic concept. Too much drama is bad, too little is also bad. It's like writing good friendship. I also have a hard time picturing specifically Harry in these kinds of relationships. He doesn't get humans to an unreal level. His and Ginny's marriage must be more therapy session than marriage, cause right, no therapy for her, or characterization for that matter. Sorry, bit off topic

*** Fair point. It probably says more about my preferences for slow burn stories but I feel if it's too easy for characters to get together then why bother? Doesn't it just become, as someone else alluded to, a story of “oh they didn't like each other and then they went on a date and maybe they kind of did!”.

And, I agree that too much drama is bad. It's of course a delicate balance. I'm breaking my own premise and would like to solicit an “after the wedding” romance plot. Any pairing. I'm just struggling to think of a fic I've ever read where reading about characters going to the Yule ball and buying each other thoughtful Christmas gifts was very engaging (or, later in life, having babies together and fixing up gardens, etc).

**** Mariage are hard work. It's a lot of compromise, need great communication.

You're mashing two lives together. Two people with different upbringing, lifestyles, opinions, tastes, habits and some values that differs.

That can bring the needed conflict for a good story. How you as a couple resolve those things.

Then kids come in, and you and your spouse does not agree 100% on parenting techniques. Against conflicts.

**** Fair enough. I think something that bothers me just a bit is the idea that ships need to be this transcendent romantic experiences to get two characters together. When there's that much build up, and then after the wedding comes, and the characters settle into a comfortable silence, it's so weird. I'm sure you'll agree with me that ships tend to have characters being in love, and us seeing them get into a relationship, but what's really missing is the development of romantic feelings. Friendship doesn't manfiest when you see someone, so why should a desire to spend the rest of your life together? True love is cool and all, but it's a copout used by hallmark writers. We write fanfiction, we have standards.

** - Ron the Death Eater, especially in slashfic. It really turns me off when an author demonizes the canon partner (or the opposite sex in general) to make the new guy look better.

- Canon ships. I don't hate them, I just don't want to read about what's already covered in canon.

- Powerful!Harry, Political!Harry or Dark!Harry, because they usually turn him into a Batman-style Gary Stu.

- Hermione has secret special powers. I see this one every so often in femslash where she's the main character. Same problem as Powerful!Harry, I don't like it because it makes her less relatable.
