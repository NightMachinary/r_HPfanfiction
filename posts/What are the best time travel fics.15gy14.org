** Astonished this one isn't up yet. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/39/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]] is a great story that's still in progress. I like the way that the author really takes the story out in widening ripples, but some events still seem bound to happen, causing some issues in the mind of Harry. Overall it's really good, A+.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][/Backwards with Purpose/]] and it's sequel [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4337434/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-II-The-Book-of-Albus][/The Book of Albus/]].

The problem with most time travel fanfiction is that the time traveler often has too much knowledge. They have a huge advantage, and it's too predictable.

That doesn't happen in BWP, in fact shit really hits the fan at times, especially in the later chapters, and the sequel.

Also, events often play out very differently. At first they try to stick to the original timeline as closely as possible, to prevent a ripple effect, but that doesn't work out so well, especially after Voldemort's resurrection.

*** I loved these, but the Third one got started and seems to be hanging in the wind.

It really does pick up after 3rd year. And I like how they approach most of the characters.

I'm still laughing at Elvendork. I forgot about that until this story.

*** u/Bulwersator:

  The story falls into a trap common to many Peggy Sue fics, and that is to have the protagonists become much more pro-active, with the antagonists becoming reactive. Despite the fact that Death Eaters are dropping left and right, the yearly storylines proceed mostly on schedule with little adaptation.

  So let me get this straight, your great plan was to let the glance=kill basilisk run around the school with all the people you've loved and come back to save? And you think that every person this basilisk encounters is going to be just as lucky as last time and only ever see the filtered/reflected image of the eyes? And you're willing to risk their deaths, their deaths, when there are alternatives? I would call it lazy writing but the author is not lazy. Harry went along with this decision, nay, only contested it for Ginny's sake as if she were the only one at risk.

** All of them? LOL Gimme a bit and I'll edit with a good amount of them. Do you prefer in-progress, complete? Long stories? Short? Who as the main? Slash? Het? If you say all of the above, you might end up with 50-60 links...Time-travel is my favorite.

I have had to store/bookmark ones I've already read because I've re-read a few a second time on accident. I'm always desperate for new TTfics.

I didn't care for it when I first started reading it, but now I count it as one of my favorites.

**** Ron (post DH) travels backwards and forwards in time but doesn't have control over it. Gets a job the makes use of the ability. Goes through his life as he tries to adjust to the problems it causes and make the best out it. Bittersweet tear jerking ending.

I'm bad at summaries (I'm a reader not a writer.)

****** I've never read that but after reading that link I'm certain that the author took that story and rewrote it as a HP fic. Way too many similarities.

Now I've got a new book to read.It doesn't seem to be on Kindle though. :(

*** This is the first time I've commented in this subreddit instead of just lurking, because I loved this one. This is one of the few fics I can actually remember reading years ago because it left such an impact, and it was also before I knew of The Time Traveler's Wife (also a great book). Love it, and highly recommend.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player][Past's Player]] is one that I truly loved. Harry gets kicked to the past-but all the way to 1942. Instead of the usual hanging about with the Marauders, he's in Slytherin with Tom Riddle and some of the original Death Eaters. The author has a couple of other time travel fics including Fate's Favourite (Harry is back in the present, but Tom Riddle follows him) and sequels. The author's grip on Tom as someone who is still developing as a Dark Lord is /incredible/.

I would also suggest [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]]. Not *exactly* time travel, more of a time loop for Harry, but it's decently well-written and completed. The author does a LOT of deviation though.

** Altered Destinies is one of my absolute favorites. It's how I came across all the HPFanFics. Couldn't figure how to link it so I just put the URL in. There's also a sequel in the works, but its been in the works for awhile now.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5698899/1/Shiny-and-Blue][Shiny and Blue]] Harry finds himself in 1957 with new powers. With a job at Hogwarts, he makes friends the with adults from his youth like Albus and Minerva, and deals with old enemies. This story has action, adventure, humor and romance! Slash scenes are well marked.
