*** Because the bashing derives from the interpretation that Dumbledore's grooming Harry for his final battle. As the books are portrayed from Harry's POV of course we don't see/hear the full explanations for Dumbledore's actions. A classic bashing case is the First Year's defenses for the Stone - more like an obstacle course (that three first years were able to go through) rather than an attempt to defend a magical artifact from Voldemort

**** It's more than that - IMO, it's mostly due to the disconnect as the series evolved. Dumbledore's actions in the earlier books are completely fine... if viewed through the light of a children's book, where things get exaggerated, the adults are made to be incompetent so that our plucky heroes can save the day despite being 12, and certain actions (eg, what the Dursleys do) is played more for laughs than seriously.

So, if the series had continued as it had for the first 3-3.5 books, Dumbledore would have fit right in.

The disconnect comes when the books become more young adult, and have to grapple with the previous years. Years and actions that were not meant to be taken more seriously, or fit in a 'grittier'/more adult oriented universe suddenly have to be explained. So instead of being able to say that the obstacle course was easy enough for 1st years so that Harry could be the hero in a children's book, we need to try to reconcile it with a serious Dumbledore. The decision to leave Harry at the Dursleys - and with more seriously treated abuse - is similar.

I think that's where most of the disconnect comes from - looking back at his early actions through the lens of a changing book series, instead of realizing that if it were written at that level the whole time, it'd have to be different.

******** Can you please explain how Voldemorts intelligence matters here?

He is faced with a problem he doesn't know the solution off, and even if he did he would only have minutes before Dumbledore arrived, there is nothing suggesting that he would have the ability to somehow obtain the stone. Just for comparison it took him months to find out how to get past fluffy and even that process required preparation.

********* It also becomes a matter of magic. Is the “obtain but not use” piece of magic an integral part of the Mirror's magic when used to store objects? Or was it an enchantment set up by Dumbledore in order to use the Mirror as storage?

Voldemort is described as a highly intelligent and powerful wizard, it is not so inconceivable that he could have obtained the stone, if not by “solving” Dumbledore's puzzle, by breaking/dismantling the enchantments.

Of course if it is the first option then probably he wouldn't have been able to break down a magical artifact in little time.

*** It's a toss up.

Some people cannot stand characters that aren't black or white. They want to be able to fit characters in a nice little box and throw away the key.

Some people on the other hand, can relate deeply to a character. Some saw Dumbledore as fatherly figure. His actions, knowing of the ten dark years Harry suffered felt like a betrayal.

Especially if they too were abused as children. It hits too close to home in the sense that "nobody believed me when I said I was abused." "Nobody came to rescue me, they saw my suffering and looked the other way."

I have read bashing fics that clearly felt like a stand in for someone else. The way Dumbledore was portrayed felt like it was a personal issue and it was the only way the author could vent their frustrations.

In other cases, it's just bad writing. The Indy Harry has to shine because a competent Dumbledore renders the independent Harry trope unless.

Edit: grammar.

#+end_quote

The key to understanding bashing is to look at how characters are being bashed. If you look closely, you'll notice that fics which emphasize Ron's laziness have a diligent Harry or that Harry in "greater good" Dumbledore fics cares deeply about individuals, and so on and so forth.

This, in my opinion, is not a coincidence. The authors of these stories are attempting to write a story where their protagonist exhibits more of character trait X. To highlight their protagonist's X, they select a character which they perceive as lacking X in canon (book or movie) and emphasizing this deficit. In effect they are attempting to use the bashed character as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(literature][foil]]).

*** Because writing a nuanced, flawed but ultimately good character is difficult, and reducing them to a two-dimensional caricature is easier?

I always think the mark of a good fanfic is how well Dumbledore is written. He has to capture that kindliness and that power. He has to exude that sense of regret for the past, while also having come to terms with himself.

Angry or angsty (or even alcoholic in one fic I read!) Dumbledore misses the mark, badly.

Agreed, I normally find that how well Dumbledore is written normally reflects on the writing of the whole fic, it's always a turn off when people just make him a two dimensional evil old man.

Many fics do quite interesting character studies of him though, making for quite an interesting character.
