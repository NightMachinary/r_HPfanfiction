** I'm so relieved when fics like this just skip over the stupid Ollivander scene and only mention Harry's wand in the first class or whatever. There's no need for gratuitous scenes like this if the only reason to include them is to emulate canon.

*** I agree. Obviously people can write what they want, and teenagers writing their first self-insert wish-fulfillment fic can be expected to wallow in detailed special wands and trunks with entire mansions inside them and give Harry magical contact lenses, but...

I don't really see why current older writers who are familiar with existing fanfic would bother to write an entire Olivander's scene, or include special significant wands. The ‘just for the sake of rehashing canon' stuff has always been annoying, but it used to feel like there were new ways to play it, new things to say. Now, I either skip or backbutton if I realise we're going to get the whole Olivander's schtick.

That's separate from wanting to include Olivander as a character, of course, or other plot-significant things.

  or include special significant wands.
#+end_quote

You can do that to emphasise differences in wand crafting or Harry's lack of knowledge about the magical world, as long as you don't make it a prestige tool.

I have two stories where he gets a new wand, one is (unknowingly) Lily's wand replicated by Gregorowich and the other one has a common snake which lived in a magical grove as a core.

** I'll go into pottermore for a new wand and that's about it. It's a lot of work for a detail that doesn't pay off or recur later. I mean, maybe in this one I'm playing with that is super detailed about materials, or if I wanted to play with everything being symbolic, I would. There's an over-described one where it would fit, but no Ollivander's scene in that.

**** You mean the Celtic lore for trees? I've used that one for the wand Harry actually picked, but I don't see the point in rehashing the whole "Harry tries twenty wands" thing. Just write something along the lines of "Half an hour later, Harry felt like he had tried every wand in the store".

** I think it doesn't add much to your story if he tries out 5 wands and you give huge background on each failed wand attempt unless wandlore and those explanations are going to have more meaning later in your story. Maybe have him talk more in-depth about the first wand he tries, give a bit more background in how a wand is comprised, maybe an interesting factoid or two that you know from canon or that you want to invent, then the failed wands after that are given no more than their physical descriptions.

If you want to get in-depth about any wand description, it's best to just save it for the wand eventually picked.

*** Why would any of that be relevant at all unless wand crafting becomes important later on? I mean, don't get me wrong, world building is fine, but magic is magic because it is mysterious. If you break it down in great detail, you take away the magic and turn it into a science.

**** I would love a fic where the Wands “choose the Wizards” because each combination of length, core and length channels magic slightly differently and a match will be when the wand and the wizards magical needs match, if that makes sense. Hell maybe include something like the wand is never perfect at first but over time it adapts slightly to better suit the wizard. That would explain why a properly matched wand is important and help explain the bond wizards have with their wands. Maybe have wands constantly change with their owner which is why an exact replica isn't always right if the original breaks.

** The one time I wrote an Ollivander scene, it involved Sirius getting a new wand after Azkaban. I did check Pottermore for wandlore because I wanted the scene to be a chance for Sirius to think about what had changed since he'd first gotten a wand and why what worked then might not work now. So yes, each wand had a meaning--- it touched on a part of his identity that was less important to him as an adult than it had been as a child.

** In my current story, I have two OC characters who obtain wands, one with an Ollivander scene, and one without. The two wands I selected have meaning for both. The first being relevant to the plot with its composition. As for the second, I looked up wand wood, length, and core properties from the list JKR provided and selected the ones I thought most appropriate to my character based on her personality. It was quite fun to try and build the wand. Then I compared the list of wand properties to wands owned by some of the characters in canon to try and sort out how JKR assigned them their wands, and they all totally make sense.

** What I'm not sure about is why people keep writing the same wand choosing scene if they're going to give Harry the same holly wand over and over again. I mean...what's the point?

There was another thread here yesterday which talked about how writing Voldemort's attack on Godric's Hollow is pointless and doesn't add anything to the story. This is similar. If you're writing the wand choosing scene, give Harry another wand. Make the scene count. I'm not saying that filler is to be avoided at all costs, but a lot of fics that start from the first year have too much filler anyway.
