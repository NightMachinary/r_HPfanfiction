Whatever I think about “Animagus at War” by [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]] linkao3(14270739) (and [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/another-comments-on-the-accidental-animagus-al.html][I am not completely enamoured]]), I just reread the beginning of “The Accidental Animagus” linkao3(14078862) and I was surprised how delighted I was. Thank you!


** Yes, it started out great, but still way too much canon rehash for me

** Been awhile since I read the Accidental Animagus. I remember loving the beginning, but the later chapters have too much politics. I couldn't finish it.
