So we're all stuck in quarantine and probably getting bored. I have seen a bunch of post asking for recommendations so I thought why not just share all the stories I've read and enjoyed. I have them all organized be length in a Google drive folder which I am sharing the link with. There are many paring(Darry,Dramione,Harmony,Ron/Harmonie, Blaise/ginny, Neville/Hannah) to name the most common but there are other) Not always from Harry or Draco perspective There are different ratings AU both in wizard world and no magic, and kid fics There are not gender swap of any character, Voldemort never wins, the trio is always Gryffindor Most are from AO3 but there are alot from fnnet that have been converted to pdfs(if you want the website just google author and title) [[https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=119NmiM9p1RPl5PM3jFcFxtR9vyr4lA2z]]
