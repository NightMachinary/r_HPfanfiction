I really cba to skim through another 300k epic. Any great stories roughly 30k and under?

Pls. Help. I need the sleep.


** I'd like to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/White-Squirrel][White Squirrel's]] ALL medium length (~30k) fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading]], linkffn(12324284), is hilarious take on 'read the books' trope.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), has Hermione sending her memories and powers back to her 2 years self, or 42 days before Halloween 1981. Hilarity ensued, but also several heart-breaking moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10132530/1/His-Mother-s-Love][HIs Mother's Love]], linkffn(10132530), is AU Year 6. A more assertive Harry bullied the Answers from Dumbledore in one 'private lesson' instead of the entire year. Things went much better afterwards.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978), has the UK government taking a more concerned approach to what went on in magical Britain. Chapters 5 and 6 are especially good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467), has Dumbledore taking the aftermath of CoS a little more seriously. Enjoy the subsequent fallout!

--------------

Other noteworthy medium length fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10516162/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Metamorph][Harry Potter and the Metamorph]], linkffn(10516162), has 40k words, pairs Harry with Tonks, and is very entertaining.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl][Harry Potter and the Spygirl]], linkffn(10959290): Grangers were not what they appeared to be, and Hermione was 'the power he knows not'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6049450/1/Harry-Potter-s-Reaction-to-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law]], linkffn(6049450), has Harry organizing a mass exodus to fight a tyrannical marriage law.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717), is a great Hermione time travel to Marauder Era, but from James Potter's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345), has a powerful Harry/Ginny beating up Death Eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), has 40k words, and is one of my top H/Hr fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), has a romantic Trio Harry/Hermione/Theo Nott. It's just brilliant and my favorite among medium length fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm][Thunderstorm]], linkffn(7186430), has 40k words, and features Harry/fem!Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either.

  Fred and George are so inseparable that most people say their names as some kind of a set. Fred&George. Twins, brothers, business partners. Then the War strikes and nothing is ever the same again. Just when George is finally coming to terms with all that has happened, can it be that Fred is back? Or is it just another loose end come back to haunt him?

** Upon a second perusual, I found you a couple more to try:

linkffn(In Care Of by Fang's Fawn) -- read this a while go; liked it enough to favorite it

linkao3(The King's Indian Attack by Nectare) -- slow updates, but fabulously written! for some reason the bot didn't want to upload the link, but the fic should pop up if you google search it

linkao3(Nobility by olivieblake) -- closer to the 50k mark, not sure if that's too long for you or not. It's a WIP with regular-ish updates, and a really interesting AU

linkffn(Mudsnake by Flye Autumne) -- because what sort of writer would I be without promoting my own work :) it's a Slytherin!Hermione fic, and it can also be found on ao3 if you prefer to read there

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** linkffn(A Sorting Like No Other by Stargon1) is a fairly humorous one-shot.

linkao3(A History of Magic by PrinceEdwin) is a short-ish (8 chapters, 40k words) Snarry -- imo, one of the only good Snarry fics out there

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpoint) is hands-down one of the best short fics I've read.

Hopefully some of these are new to you!
