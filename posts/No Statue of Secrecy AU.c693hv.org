** I only know of one, and that is Harry Potter and the Energumen of the Elchee, but based on the tags it is packed full of smut and based on some reviews its not very good so ehh.

I do have one that has the statue failing, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6765496/chapters/15463549][Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach]]

Harry's flight at the beginning of the fifth movie gets recorded in a Superbowl commercial. However I found it a bit dry.

*** I notice that Super Bowl Breach was completed years ago, and has over a million words, but very few kudos...not sure I want to commit to such a long read with so few recommendations.

**** Its a very unique story, I've read about 100 or so chapters. It's not bad, but there are a lot of POV switches and world-wide factors and decisions to cover.

*** The first one is truly horrible. Author says he's sick of the same old shit but then writes the same old shit.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
