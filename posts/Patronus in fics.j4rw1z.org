Does anyone else get a little annoyed when a fic makes any girl Harry's in love with's patronus a doe? It just feels like lazy writting to me.


** Lazy writing is what is most popular in HP fanfics, always the same heap of repetitive rubbish. it is a gigantic world with different perspectives to be explored and yet.. there is rare authors who put some genuine effort there. Even those who change the gender, they don't even bother to investigate what kind of appearance the girl would have or what different experiences would happen. Shame...

*** I dont mind tropes and cliche for the most part but for example I can sorta understand if harry if paired with someone say an oc or a blank slate like lisa turpin to have her patronus be the compliment to Harry's but changing hermiones or ginnys to a doe just feels forced. At least in one harem fic I think it was Hermiones furry little problem all the girls and harry had various felines patroni which made sense within the narrative.

***** I think in the price of being noble hilary taught hermione fleur and gabrielle the spell and while hermione and fleurs were unique to them gabby's was a doe because she was more of a dependent personality which again is a decent explanation withing the setting

** Somebody's Patronus should be reminiscent of their personality and/or their source of happy thoughts. Snape's was a doe because Lily was basically the only happy thing in his life, while Tonks's probably changed to a wolf because she started powering it with thoughts of (and love for) Remus. Harry's is a stag because his source of happiness and comfort is thoughts of family (though I've also seen one fic point out that a white stag is seen as a harbinger of destruction for evildoers or some such).

Making the Patronus of Harry's love interest a doe can be an indication that the writer is making their character primarily built around their love for Harry rather than giving them a more complete personality. Like most things, it /could/ be done well - perhaps their life is so miserable, or at least devoid of real happiness, otherwise that their relationship with Harry is the only thing that truly brings them any joy - but something like that would need to be made apparent in the story, and wouldn't work for most of the more popular ships (Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Fleur, probably Susan) without changing those characters' backgrounds.

** A partial subversion of this trope is in Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift) where Harry's patronus changes to a male otter.

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

** I'm tired of matching patronus (what's the plural ?) as well. It's not that it's a requirement to determine if someone is in love. I think Rowling used this to showcase extreme circumstances, not "standard" love for someone.

Imagine your patronus were to change every time you're in love with someone... no thanks.

Imagine being in a relationship with someone and having matching patroni with them and then one day your Patronus changes.

"John, why is your Patronus a lion? Wait, isn't Jane's Patronus a lioness?!"
