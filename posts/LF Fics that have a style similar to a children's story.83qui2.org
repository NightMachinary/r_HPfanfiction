  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

I think BrilliantLady's /Perfectly Normal/ series fits this. Normally, I'm not one to read stories covering Dursleys' emotional abuse affecting Harry in any way or "the pureblood culture", but the stories are so well written I didn't regret a second while reading this.
