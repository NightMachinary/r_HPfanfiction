A good character attempts to redeem say Draco or Voldermort but slowly comes to realise they are beyond help and cant be redeemed ?


** Oh yeah, I found a very creepy one. It's Snarry and dub con DracoXVoldemort. It's too complicated to explain, but one main point is, that Draco is obsessed with Snape, but because he is with Harry, unites ( in body too) with Voldemorts to kill them. The redeeming part is at the beginning where Snape tries to get Draco away from Voldemort, without knowing of his true feelings.

*** That might be good

I'm not a snarry fan but it sounds interesting
