I am looking for a HP fanfic about where harry shares a body/mind with another boy who is the mate of a vampire. I want to say that the boy's name started with a Q (Qu'e or Quay maybe?). I do remember at the end of the story, both Harry and other boy were able to separate from each other and they looked like identical twins when they did. There was a sequel started, but it was never finished. If anyone could help me, I will greatly appreciate it!
