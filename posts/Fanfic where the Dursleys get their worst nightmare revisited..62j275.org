** Well, my critique is this:

First, apostrophes and their usage. “Dursley's” as a way of writing the plural form, in the synopsis no less, is a very effective way of making people think that the story will suck and getting out of there; it's either “Dursleys” or, if it is a possessive form, “Dursleys'”. Going a bit further, the second paragraph has “parent's” as a word that is supposed to be a possessive form of a plural word; when you are doing that, you first get the plural form from the singular one (“parent” -> “parents”), and then you make a possessive form out of /that/ (“parents” -> “parents'”, note the apostrophe after the last letter of the word, this is because that last letter is an “s” and you would only add another “s” after the apostrophe if the word was singular). And on the other side of it, “dont” should really have an apostrophe.

Second, the paragraph length. The very second paragraph is a monstrosity of a wall, and stuff like that +makes+might make people think worse of your story too. It could be split when you started talking about the Dementor and then again afterwards.

Third is the occasional eaten word, such as the sentence “[...] would remind everyone at the dinner parties.” in which there should be an “of” between “everyone” and “at”. Likewise, there are some occasional eaten commas, such as in sentence “He had never seen the Dementor, a nasty creature that would guard the prison of Azkaban but the effects of the Dementor still lingered to this day.” which is missing a comma after “Azkaban” and which without it is pretty much nonsense.

Fourth, I'm not sure why are Dudley's wife's physical features described in the first paragraph when they ultimately don't matter and we only “meet” her two pages of text later. It seems to me similar to what people are doing when they waste a paragraph on describing a character's clothing choices in-depth when there is really no need to do that, even if what you have is relatively minor in comparison.

Fifth, no, you do not capitalise “godfather”. You really do not. It is a fairly ... bothersome mistake, as it stems from people capitalising the word “god” and any and all of its derivative words just because one of the uses of the word has it capitalised. The title also isn't split into two words with a hyphen, but that one is fairly understandable and as such forgiveable as a lot of words made by combining two other words are written like that at some stage of their existence. Likewise, you do not capitalise the word “cousin”, nor “mother”, nor “aunt”, nor “reporters”, nor “living room”, nor “witch”, nor anything like that; leave capitalisation for proper names and actual titles (for example, “Boy-Who-Lived” is capitalised because it is a title, whereas neither “boy”, “who”, nor “lived” are capitalised on their own; likewise, “Lord Gryffindor” is capitalised for the same reason, whereas just “gryffindor”, as used in the sentence “Harry is a gryffindor”, isn't). Mind you, I do know that “Cousin Harry” could be capitalised, but that is only if you use it as someone's actual title rather than just to mean that the person is your cousin and his name is Harry.

Sixth, dialogue punctuation. When you end a dialogue and there is non-dialogue text following it without a paragraph change, unless you have a reason to use something like a question mark or an ellipsis (which should not be overused, by the way) you do it with a comma. The use of full stops is possible but it is only when the sentence that follows the dialogue is completely unrelated to it and yet for some reason actually has to be in the same paragraph, which means that it generally isn't done often. Expanding on that, if you have the same person speak for the second time without anyone speaking in-between and there isn't a lot happening in the meantime the proper thing to do is not to add another paragraph but to simply add it to the one in which the person spoke; as an example, you would get «“Sorry,” Dudley mumbled, “desperate.”».

Seventh, though it is a minor thing, I'm not sure how Dudley is “the” manager instead of “a” manager if there is someone higher up the managerial chain who orders him around.

Eight, naming consistency. You have the name of Dudley's son spelled both “Emmerson” and “Emerson” throughout the story. Also, “Dadley”.

Ninth, the story makes note of Veronica being cultured and mindful of how she spoke (at least with the profanities, but one would think it to extend to other areas of speech too), so the use of the word “cos” by her is a bit jarring.

Tenth, well ... the fact that Dudley could just call someplace and have them send a camera crew on his word that “wizards are real” when we have no reason to believe that he has any in with anyone who could send a camera crew and when anyone would just laugh at him, no, it just wouldn't happen. If you need that then at least have Dudley mention that he knows someone who can help him with that, foreshadowing is key when you do things that are normally hard to believe.

Eleventh, I'm not sure if you are trying to strive for anything close to canon or not but I will note that in canon nobody would send an underage magic warning to a child below Hogwarts age, and sending it to a kid aged 2 is just inane.

I would go on about the fact that your choice of tenses does seem a tad ... hmm, let's say “out”, but I am not an expert on tenses in English so I will only note that it feels weird to me and leave it to someone better suited to decide whether it indeed it or if it's just me.

And yes, I know I might sound a tad harsh there. I will note, though, that quite some of those are things that could be solved with a basic spell-checker and some others are things that are pretty much about your choices as a writer, so I felt it better to point that stuff out than to not do it and deliver a half-arsed critique.

*** Thank you for your critique, I will go through it and edit the chapter.

There is a lot of errors in it besides grammar, errors with timelines, attitudes, tenses and lack of explanations.

Keep in mind I wrote the whole thing in one go and didn't have the energy to edit it afterwards. I may have posted it prematurely but I wanted it to be seen first so I could gauge peoples responses.

The world I am writing is the same as the original but in the future so it is entirely plausible that rules have changed but there will be necessary explanations. Mostly that the ministry has somewhat lessened the role of aurors as there is a lacking of dark wizards and instead have increased monitoring of magic around muggles. The increase of cameras and population means that there is a lot more of a chance for muggles to see something they should not have.

The whole concept started with Dudley NEEDING to get a hold of Harry but having no way to do it so had to find a way for the wizards to get to him, in this case to stop him from spilling the beans.

I want to write the whole story from this intro to Emerson going to school but unfortunately have had to start Uni again and my workload has increased so the edits and additions wont be as quick as I had hoped. Hearing a lot of positive comments has been really helpful tho and I will make an effort to at least get some of the story down.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.
