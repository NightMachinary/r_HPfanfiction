**** Any fic where Harry's age is changed to make that pairing seem less awkward can't possibly be the ultimate.

** i havent read the story, but the thing about the national quidditch team doesent seem bad considering that harry in canon at the age of eleven is the best seeker under the age of 18 in all of great britian (if you dont consider those not iterested playing in a quidditch team)

******* Okay, but doesn't an under-18 team imply that the players are minors--a youth league? Witches and wizards come of age, adulthood, at 17.

Hermione turns 18 in September of her 7th year. Ron doesn't turn 18 until March of his 7th year. Malfoy turned 18 in June of/after his 7th year.

***** Because he is 11. The youngest players on U18 soccer are 15 and they don't do well. Age is a decisive factor in skill on these young teams and not just because of the physical factor. A 16-17 year old will have up to 2 more years of pro instruction of a 15 year old, which is why anyone younger than 16 is rare on a u18 team.

The idea that Potter is so talented as to overcome a gap of several year of training plus the physical factor is so absurd as to be detached from any semblance of reality. The Fic is childish and written by a person living out their nonsensical daydreams rather than attempt at a literary work.

****** fair enough, but its still canon and nothing I would judge a fic for(i havent read it, so it could still suck for other reasons)

****** First, I agree with the sentiment--I also find an eleven year-old near any kind of professional play a little dumb, and it's part of the reason I almost never read pre-fourth year fics. That said, Harry is portrayed in canon as the best seeker in the only school of wizarding Britain, so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to consider him the seeker for the U18 national team, as the only people left to consider are those who are homeschooled or left after their OWLs. It wouldn't be realistic, but it wouldn't be /unlikely/ given what we know (Harry's record in the sport without even knowing about it before his time at Hogwarts and the fact that wizarding Britain has only a few thousand people overall).

As a seeker, physical factor could go both ways: either it makes it easier to maneuver or lighter so he can accelerate more quickly. Quidditch is not soccer.

Again, I'm far from being a fan of Harry being a Quidditch professional player at the tender age of eleven(or all the other stupid shit authors let eleven year-olds get away with in these fics), but that doesn't mean that's too far from what canon shows.
