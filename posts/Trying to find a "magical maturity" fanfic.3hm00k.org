Hello!

I've googled around to no good results. I'm trying to find a fic that involved Harry going through an ordeal with magical maturity, which entails high fever and being sick. IIRC he spent the time at Hermione's, though I'm probably wrong. The magical maturity part isn't even a definite. He comes out of it, makes a sort of "village"? -- if I remember correctly, it was referenced as a haven, where most of the Britain wizarding community evacuated to. Most of the story is centered around there.

I know this post is rather hazy, but anyone who knows what I'm talking about?

Thanks!

*** At a million-plus words between story and sequel, it has a pretty big cross section.
