As the title says I'm looking for fics where the wizarding world discovers how powerful the muggles are with all their technology and weapon


** Not superior, but the Muggles in *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650) really put a serious number on the Magicals. If it were not for the super Harry/Ginny, the Magicals would have lost.

This story is by no means Muggle wank, but serious Muggle bashing, especially [[/spoiler][Hermione's parents]]. The ending is extremely dark, with just a little consolation.

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  Begins summer after fifth year. Harry is stuck at the Dursleys until a phone call changes his life. With goblins, the muggle government, and one Hermione Granger at his back Harry is ready for change and eager to leave an unjust, cruel, and stupid magical world behind. AU, summary not as good as it probably could be, H/Hr
