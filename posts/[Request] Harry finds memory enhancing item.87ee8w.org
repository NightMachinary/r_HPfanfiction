I wanted to read another good fic where Harry finds and uses an item that increases:

- his capacity to memorize facts

- his ability to learn extremely fast, or absorb knowledge quickly (i.e. read a 1000 page book in ten minutes)

- his wisdom, or ability to USE knowledge in more unique ways (i.e. aguamenti spell chained into a lightning spell, or transfiguring the water pool into acid/quicksand.. you get it)

It can be from de-horcruxing the diadem, finding "Ravenclaw's Glasses", or even something like being Ravenclaw's heir.

I just finished all of the Eidetic Memory fics, and I'm kind of on a SmartHarry! romp... help a fic-brotha out?

And yes, I've read Methods of Rationality.

Also!

I read a fic a couple years back where Hermione makes up a water spell on the spot to Harry to test a theory of hers that he can learn any spell just by being given the intent and words, and it turns out true and she follows that up with telling McGonagall.... LSS, it was pretty cool, and if it rings a bell lemme know

** linkffn(Forging The Sword) featured the Diadem. But sadly the fic got abandoned before the trio could "break Voldemort's curse" on the Diadem.

** Chapter 5 of linkffn(4966520) has a Daniel Keyes /Flowers for Algernon/ thing going on with the diadem. While not precisely the same, it's pretty close to the spirit of what's asked for.

The "I did it because I didn't know it couldn't be done" motif is pretty common in faction. Jeconais's [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/][This Means War]] was one of the first. Another notable one is Lord Dwar's [[https://lorddwar.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_And_The_Summer_Of_Change/index/][Harry Potter and the Summer of Change]].
