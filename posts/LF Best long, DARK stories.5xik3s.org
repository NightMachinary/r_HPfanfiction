I just read No one Would Blame Him by hpdarkarts_mod and JosephineStone and Finding Scorpius, also by JosephineStone, both extremely dark and creepy. Looking for similar, not necessarily dark!Harry. Any suggestions? linkao3(3223580; 5231267)

  Harry and Ginny's marriage has been in trouble since the beginning, but they had the kids to raise and careers to keep them busy. Now the kids are all at school, except James who's starting his own career, Harry is at a desk as the Head Auror and so is Ginny while working for the Daily Prophet. They're working on problems they've been brushing aside for years, when Scorpius Malfoy, their son Albus' best mate, goes missing from Hogwarts. Harry is torn between finding Scorpius before it's too late, and keeping his falling-apart family together.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
