I really want to reread this werewolf Dudley story I found a few years ago. Two dozen google searches later, with all sorts of keywords, and I'm still no closer to finding it. I really hope some of you can help me out.

What I remember of the plot is that the Dursleys are attacked in their home, and Vernon and Petunia are killed, while Dudley is bitten. Dudley is stuck inside the house for some reason, and I think that when he transforms he ends up gnawing on his parents' corpses. Dudley lives off the canned food in the house and nearly starves before aurors (?) discover the attack. Then he is told about some kind of facility for muggle werewolves, goes there, and meets some other werewolves and gets his life sorta back on track. I'm not sure what happens next.

He also meets Harry, I think, and they're both adults in this story, so they have a serious and calm conversation about their lives. Also, Harry is most certainly not a werewolf.

Thanks in advance for your help!


** "Dudley Dursley and the new normal" It disappeared from FFnet, but I found [[http://fanfics.me/read2.php?id=81213&chapter=0][a link on Google]] that works.

*** Wow! Thanks so much! No wonder it wasn't on my favourites list anymore.
