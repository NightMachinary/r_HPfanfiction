Harry Potter was thinking about Argus Filch again. Argus was a smelly custodian with tall hands and pretty abs.

Harry walked over to the window and reflected on his cold surroundings. He had always loved dark Hogwart hallways with its wooden, worried walls. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel happy.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather some/one/. It was the a smelly figure of Argus Filch.

Harry gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a charming, energetic, tea drinker with solid hands and sticky abs. His friends saw him as a dry, decomposing dolphin. Once, he had even brought an alert old lady back from the brink of death.

But not even a charming person who had once brought an alert old lady back from the brink of death, was prepared for what Argus had in store today.

The rain hammered like hopping cats, making Harry worried. Harry grabbed a cursed hat that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Harry stepped outside and Argus came closer, he could see the inexpensive glint in his eye.

Argus gazed with the affection of 3686 caring sweaty spiders. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a relationship."

Harry looked back, even more worried and still fingering the cursed hat. "Argus, I love you," he replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two blushing, brainy bats chatting at a very arrogant dinner, which had harp music playing in the background and two brave uncles jogging to the beat.

Harry regarded Argus's tall hands and pretty abs. "I feel the same way!" revealed Harry with a delighted grin.

Argus looked surprised, his emotions blushing like a rotten, raw rock.

Then Argus came inside for a nice cup of tea.

THE END


** I love it.
