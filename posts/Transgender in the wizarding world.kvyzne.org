I woke up today, and just /really/ wanted JKR to suffer. As most people know she is a TERF, that being a Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism. I also just got finished reading a rather enjoyable story where Harry was trans. So in the spirit of her suffering, I would like aid in turning the Wizarding World into an accepting place, where they got the gender shit figured out. Potions making it easier to transition, general cultural acceptance, etc. really give the Wizarding World that happy shine!

Edit: Translation: I woke up in a bad mood, after reading two good stories about a trans Harry. JK Rowling is a TERF, I don't approve of this political view. So why not turn the Wizarding World into an accepting place /for this particular issue/.

** I don't think being trans would really be a thing in the wizarding world. If someone was born in the wrong body, they could probably fix it relatively quickly, and nobody would make a big deal out of it. The trans people would just be people like anyone else. No need for a community or a political issue. People wouldn't call themselves trans because there'd be no reason to tell anyone that they had a ten minute medical procedure when they were five. Apart from healers and close family of someone who transitioned, the majority of people probably wouldn't even know it's a thing. And if people find out they'd be "huh, neat" and move on to more important things.

Really, for most people a world where perfect quick body changing methods are readily available would be indistinguishable from a world where trans people don't exist in the first place. Solved problems don't need mentioning.

** This entire hate against JKR for her views is overblown. Yeah, sure, you don't have to agree. But she's not being hateful. She's not being deliberately malicious in her messages, from where I can see it anyway, unlike the death threats, rape threats and pictures with her head on her stake that she gets in return for voicing a concern about women's rights, that happens to conflict with trans interests. But I'm just a cis person, aren't I? What do I know? I think Rose of Dawn (a trans woman youtuber) has a good analysis of Rowling's "hate of trans people" though. Look her up.

*** I disagree /almost/ completely. JKR absolutely is being hateful and ignorant. At this point she is intentionally being ignorant of the real issues so she can clutch onto her terf worldview. By not even trying to learn about the issues, that's deliberate maliciousness. I'm cis, too, but I can recognize her speech is harmful and seeded in hatred.

I agree she shouldn't have the horrific backlash she's receiving. Backlash? Yes. Rape/death threats? Absolutely not, disgusting.

So we agree on something.

*** Oh yeah, she just doesn't really accept Trans people as a piece of her world view. She's a good person and she's done a lot for women's rights. Any hurt she's caused to the trans community was probably purely unintentional on her part. She doesn't really deserve hate, I just don't consider being maliciously ironic in the expansion of her world to be hate.

I'd rather be arguing about what level of acceptance the concept could expect from the Wizarding world then trying to to tear down the woman who's work defined my childhood.

*** Sure, but they're racist in a very specific way. It's magicals are better, those without should just die. We see a couple black people who are treated fine. Probably because they're magical. Magic would be the defining trait for those individuals. They might have an easier time accepting transgenders with the ability to change the gender at will, as well as magic being an equalizer for the genders. Just because the vibe I get from the wizarding world is that magic made some things better, but the racism against those without magic is tremendous. A story about the emotional conflict of finding yourself has plenty of conflict. See all coming-of-age novels

*** 1. Racism and transphobia are different.
2. It shouldn't have anything to do with pureblood supremacy
3. No story, this isn't about the story

Basically, the point here is that JKR doesn't really believe in trans people. So, we let the Wizarding World have a new point in its favor. The Wizarding World is now extremely accepting of transgenders. I mean they can turn into other people already, why couldn't they shift the gender? Hell, why wouldn't they be able to fix the problems that muggle methods have? Magically transitioned people can have biological children the normal way. I mean a perfect easy instant transition, so good that with patients who have severe gender dysphoria they can feel like they're in the right body that very day. This is less about the narrative that could be built and more about sticking it to Rowling in a "constructive" way. Instead of sending hate or something destructive, we'll make it so the world she made accepts those she doesn't

***** We also see charms that influence the body, those could allow for permanent transitions possibly?

Why assume someone's reasoning? He gave one. He's just a dick. He's probably not doing this to show how progressive he is. Not going to speculate beyond that.

I do have some issues connecting to a transgender character, but only when the story focuses on the transition. I've never gone through a change of that nature. Fanfiction exacerbates the problem a bit, so I get where you're coming from.

>"Those trans children are ruining their bodies and their magic by changing what they were meant to be

This is good. It fleshes out that idea really well. But Voldemort did all sorts of shit to his body, and they became his followers. There'd probably be a spectrum of individuals. Maybe the older Black family believes in that concept. Toujours pur and all that. It'd be cool to see fully fleshed out since there's so much of treating all of those families the exact same.

***** Real question ignoring our disagreements for a second, why do you think that people hijacking her world to write stuff she wouldn't like is a bad way to handle a political difference? I think it's significantly better than quite a few options. When it originally came out that she was a TERF people were abandoning the Harry Potter series left and right because they believed that to support her was directly detrimental to the trans rights movement. Like by still existing within the fandom they were contributing directly to her political causes. I don't agree with you but I appreciate you letting me fight you on this, and I respect that you aren't willing to back down. So before I continue with the debate, let me just say that I'm sorry, I've been rude to you just because you disagree and that wasn't right of me. I should've tried to be civil towards you rather than just ranting at you. So I'm sorry and thank you for continuing the fight. However, your opinion on the Pureblood, pure body has absolutely no basis in canon whatsoever. The only bit about purity they care about is magic, if you can use magic you deserve to exist. There is no indication within the canon that traditional Purebloods believe that, in fact Voldemort, someone they looked up to, used plenty of dark rituals to change himself. They didn't loath him, they revered him. So there isn't any reason to believe that they would be against it. As for the 90s bit, statute of secrecy, they're out of touch, besides why would they follow muggle beliefs on the subject? You aren't being forced to write any kind of character you don't want to, nor are you being asked to represent any view you don't believe or don't wish to cover. You are being asked to think about how the Wizarding World would react to the idea of transitioning genders. It's not changing a damn thing if there is nothing in the canon regarding it. It's making a choice on how you would wish to present it. I'm just asking that you consider a particular answer while you're at it.

****** Because I believe we need to disassociate the artist from its art. And shaping up her world how we want to is fine, it's why we have fanfics, but I strongly believe that trying to hurt someone by hijacking its work not only is dumb, but also plain mean. There's many more way to "hurt her for her beliefs", and they were already all used : promoting what she hates in front of her, cancelling her on twitter... But I dunno, I just don't like it.

And anyway, I haven't been civil at all myself, I kinda never am, so don't worry about it.

But for purity, if they only cared about magic, muggleborns wouldn't be called mudbloods. Pureblood extremists don't hate muggleborns because they're close to their parents, but because their family is "not old". Look at the camps in Book 7. And they don't look up to Voldemort himself, but his ideas, his willingness to bring them to newer heights, and his power. But they're scared of him, because he's, well, a garbage human being.

Also, since those old families believe in keeping blood pure, then do you trully believe they wouldn't fight their children on the subject? I can already hear it, "I raised a boy, not some failed female!" "How do you want to continue our line with this kind of thinking?"

I believe they wouldn't care about anything temporary ("everyone can try, as long as you know your place"), but permanent transition would not be that way. And once again, I'm not 100% against the idea of a trans-friendly wizarding world, but with every problems the purebloods can find? It better be marked as AU, because there's no chance of it being canon.

******* Yeah, in the Wizarding World continuing family definitely does matter. So if a transition through Magic had the same problems as a nonmagical transition, then yeah. But why wouldn't magic be able to change you from one perfectly functioning body to a new perfectly functioning body? If the biological function of fertility still works despite a transition I'd say that the "continue the family line" is mostly solved.

This raises interesting questions though, how does the wizarding world treat infertility. Do they have a medical way of handling it? Wizards can regrow bones from nothing, could they do the same for organs? If they can regrow organs, can they do it for the genitalia?

Sorry, that was slightly off-topic. Wizards don't seem to magically find problems everywhere, why can't we just let them have one thing that they don't discriminate on? There are no particular problems for it in the canon, as it was /never/ discussed in the canon. For fucks sake nobody batted an eye at Tonks, and she can be either gender. It was in fact considered an incredible gift, and she can explicitly change sexes at will. Why would anyone bat an eye at someone who isn't a metamorphmagus doing the same? It's still magic, changing the body into something else.

I have not in fact seen any stories that have expanded the concept of the Wizarding World being more accepting towards trans people than the muggle one, and having been improving the magical way of transitioning because of it. If these stories exist already and I have not seen them then that is a very good reason to try and increase awareness of them. If they do not exist then I hope to inspire people to write them. I'm concerned mostly by spreading the idea of JKR's baby being more accepting than she is.

******* Of course, it has to be woven in. Being trans is a struggle, and that struggle is not entirely defined by an unaccepting society. I'm not asking for an entirely perfect world, just one in which the majority of people would accept a transition. Why wouldn't it be normal? What reasons would the wizarding world have to be against it? The only reason that this would be a disservice to the HP universe is that a woman who doesn't believe in trans people wrote it.

On being a disservice to the real world, how so? Do you think it minimizes the struggles of trans people? Is that it? Why is it a disservice more than any other fiction.
