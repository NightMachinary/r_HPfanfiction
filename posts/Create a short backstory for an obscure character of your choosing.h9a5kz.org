*This comes directly from my fic (except some character names are changed for . . . reasons) but do share your own short bits!*

Randolph Spudmore finished etching the last runic array along the base of the broomstick, taking extra care for it not to coincide with the other array meant for regular flight. He kept one eye on the mess of notes beside him, seemingly drawing some semblance of knowledge from the heap of clutter.

He then bolted and screwed in the prototype steel metalwork that the goblins had been so /generous/ to send in advance and positively beamed at the finished prototype. He'd envisioned years of work, in all honesty, but with William's help and Alicia's contacts, he'd managed to get everything ready in just a few months.

Randolph took the time to clear the surrounding area of any possible hazards, before coating the floor and walls around him in Softening Charms, to make his more-than-likely fall somewhat less painful.

He picked up the new broomstick and was about to set it down when he remembered old Ellerby's suggestion. A brilliant one, at that.

With a steel-tipped quill and golden ink, he etched /Firebolt/ into the shaft, and set everything down again, taking the newly-named broomstick, the first of its kind, with him towards the designated testing area.

Setting the freshly-polished broom on the ground, he stood straight, extended his hand, and with almost practised poise, commanded.

“UP!”

A huge grin threatened to burst Randolph's cheeks as the broomstick sped into his hand, teeming and ready for action. Randolph allowed himself one full breath to calm himself. He was so close, so very close to fulfilling his father's dream, he just knew it. He knew that if he managed to fall off or do something equally stupid at this pivotal moment, he'd be making his father turn in his grave.

Slowly, he climbed onto the broomstick, and his hand and feet almost glided to the correct locations, where he tightened and curled respectively. Then, with a large whoop, he titled the broomstick forward. . .

Only to whizz of out the bunker, the wind blowing through his hair, his face alight with tears of happiness, and the largest smile plastered on his face. He sped up, edging the broom faster and faster, wiping the tears from his face with a gloved hand, and spun in circles, twisting, turning with joy.

He spent the next hour or so in the air before bringing the broom to a halt and descending slowly.

Holding the broom close to his heart, he walked towards his father's grave - on the outskirts of the forest - and stood in front of it, staring at his father's name.

“I did it, Dad. I actually did it. It works, and brilliantly,” he sighed.

Randolph would continue to stand there, recounting what he'd accomplished so far, how he hoped to follow in his footsteps, how he wanted to make him proud, and that he'd make the world know the Spudmore name. He promised all of this with a heavy hand on his heart. With a heart-wrenching sob, he promised he would see it done.


** Not as obscure a character as the others managed, but I did write a one-shot about Trelawney, and why she acts the way she does. Basically she hates her gift and does everything she can to suppress it. She also makes it her mission to discourage anybody with a true gift from taking her class so that they are not burdened like she was. linkao3(10051766)

** Time for John Dawlish redemption time.

*Auror Tactical Operations Centre. 2 days after the fall of Lord Voldemort.*

John Dawlish strode into the safehouse, casting a series of detection charms as he entered. Confident that he wasn't followed having done his surveillance detection run, he sat down, facing the large animated map of Britain riddled with dots. /Time to start hunting/, mused Dawlish.

In truth Dawlish was anything but incompetent. He reluctantly carried out his orders to trail Dumbledore after the Voldemort had been outed and let himself get hexed after explaining himself. After Dumbledore's death, Dawlish knew that the Ministry would soon be co-opted by Death Eaters. In response, he began sabotaging the Ministry from within.

Dawlish knew that by allowing himself to seem incompetent, the Death Eaters would in turn begin to underestimate him. /People believe what they want to believe/, was what Alastor Moody told him on the first day of Auror Selection. And when the wizarding world sees an Auror failing to perform even basic tasks such as escorting prisoners to Azkaban, they assume that he's been hit with the Confoundus too many times. Dawlish deliberately let Dirk Cresswell(and many others) escape. And after gathering intelligence on the majority of the Death Eaters, Dawlish let himself get hospitalized to begin hunting them down.

After trailing the majority of Voldemort's inner circle, he broke into many of their safehouses and began surveillance charms on various family heirlooms to keep track of their movement. Although Lucius Malfoy was set to testify about the whereabouts of the Death Eaters in exchange for a pardon, Dawlish didn't trust him to divulge all information on their whereabouts.

The day after Voldemort passed Dawlish began assassinating them. The Notts, Selwyns and Travers were killed, and he'd hoped that the Lestranges would retreat back to their ancestral manor. Dawlish had no plans to spare any of them. There was no reforming a group of genocidal maniacs hellbent on overthrowing the Ministry.

The radio in the study began to beep, prompting Dawlish to listen in.

"Lucius is planning to betray us," said Rodolphus.

Rabastan swore and began to pace back and forth in their study as Dawlish continued to listen in. "What's the plan then?"

"Kill him to send a message to any traitors within our ranks."

"The Aurors have the Ministry on lockdown," said Rabastan. "Haven't heard back from the Notts or Travers yet."

"Probably keeping a low profile," said Rodolphus.

"It's too risky to go after Lucius at the moment still. There's another way we can send a message. Go after the Weasleys, that'll send a message like it did with the Longbottoms. One of the blood traitors is dead and is set to have a funeral next week."

"Perfect. With the Ministry weakened as it is its the perfect time to strike. We'll have to move out of here by tonight since this place could be compromised. Avery has a place that Lucius doesn't know about in London."

/The Lestranges and Avery in one night is going to be one hell of an achievement/ mused Dawlish. He pointed his blackthorn wand to his watch, sending a message to Head Auror Gawain Robards.

/Positive ID on multiple Death Eaters. Requesting permission to engage/

Dawlish kept the message intentionally vague in case Robards was under the Imperious. It would be a mistake to assume anything given how the Death Eaters have co-opted the Ministry. He tuned out the conversation on what the Lestranges would do to blood traitors when Robards replied, a smile emerging as he read the message.

/You have execute authority/

** The Tale of Ignatius Prewett

The tale of this man is of one born to wealth. Wealth he never stood to inherit, as he was the second son. When he married Lucretia Black, it was to ensure his own future. That his wife came with a large dowry and a house made him swallow his reservations on blood-purity. He had snorted at the thought of the Blacks considering him a worthy husband for one of their daughters.

Lucretia, it turned out, was more sensible than her father and brother. She did not care much for blood purity, more so her family, and in time, they grew genuinely fond of eachother, though their marriage remained childless for now. With the Black Family behind him and his wife's dowry in hand, he opened several grocery stores in major wizarding villages, bringing a piece of the modern era to the wizarding community. Notably, these stores were magical-only, and sold far cheaper than many muggle stores, owing to magical assistance in production and transportation. Their rich assortment of magical odds and ends, including magical fruit, vegetables and other such things, helped sell the idea, and Prewett's Provenances, known more colloquially as Prov-stores, became a wizarding staple, making Ignatius a wealthy man of his own volition.

It was, of course, then, that his brother died, and his nephews soon followed. By testament laid down by distant ancestors, the Prewett family vault, holding a not insignificant inheritance, was to be held by a Prewett of the name until the line ran dry, and only then could it pass onto a daughter. Which is how he had ended up with it, as the younger brother. Upon his death, it would pass to Molly, his niece, and that would be that. He supported Molly and her ever growing brood of children with what he had inherited. She even named her thirdborn child for her, and he had been supremely humbled by that.

Not long after, Lucretia fell pregnant, and birthed their only child. A boy they had named Graham Arcturus, named for both his grandfathers. Which is when the dispute began. Molly still desired that the wealth go to her children, so they may live better lives, but Ignatius was torn. He had to obey his ancestor's will, and changed his own will accordingly. Graham would inherit everything.

That is how relations had soured between Molly and Ignatius Prewett. She did not talk of him any longer. So he became but a name on a Black Family Tree.

(The son is an OC, of course. Take this with a grain of salt, but this is what I was inspired to write.

Cheers,

Foadar )

** I'm not sure what you're asking for but...

I always pictured former Unspeakable Augustus Rookwood as being a Ravenclaw Hogwarts alumnai with no ethics whatsoever when it comes to new frontiers of magic. As for why he works with Voldemort. Well, he lost his mother to a tragic accident at the hands of muggles, and he's always wanted to resurrect her. Voldemort isn't disgusted by Rookwood's wish and doesn't view his work as taboo.

*** It wasn't so much headcanon, but more a bit of writing, kind of. But that's pretty interesting. I haven't seen anything done on Rookwood's past. Seems interesting.
