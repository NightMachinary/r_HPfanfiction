I'm trying to compile a list of magic and occult groups through history that might have existed in the past and present of the Harry Potter universe. These groups could be good or bad, and have had some influence on the development of Magic society, or the downfall.

So far, I know that the Thule Society is a likely one, probably composed of witches and wizards allied with the Nazis. We know the magic community took part in the first war, so it's fairly easy to accept that they were in the second. But what other groups do you think existed?


** You could say that the order of Jesuits was actually a trained cadre of Aurors deployed by the ICW to establish the Statute of Secrecy in every be-nighted corner of the world.

*** The same can also be said for the Inquisition itself. What better way would there have been for the magical world to remove any proof that magic actually existed than to secretly run the group meant to find and destroy any practitioner and source material using it? After all, there is no guarantee that magic was purely the domain of wizards and witches if the existence and the generally accepted techniques for actually using magic were more widely known. Having muggles tap into magical-seeming powers would have been a threat to the SoS, one the magical world would have trouble eradicating without tipping off the uninformed as to their existence. The inquisition would have been a boon to them, offering them both the means to quickly identify such practices alongside the authority to eradicate it as well as those that know about it.

** Huh. I was doing something similar to this a few days ago, but a narrower scope. Have you looked into Crowley's stuff? Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, something something Orient, and the A.A.? There's the Freemasons, of course, and I was looking specifically into University-based secret societies - one that looked promising was the 7 Society. I'm going to look up Thule now and I'll get back to you if I find anything else of interest :)

*** As much as I find the modern hermetic societies fascinating, I can't really see them working in HP, as they would be dealt with because of messing with ISOS.

** In the Middle Ages there was a heresy (well, there is currently debate about whether they existed or not) called the Heresy of the Free Spirit (condemned by Ad Nostrum from the Council of Lyons in 1245, I think, it's been a while). Also, there was a sub-Branch of the Franciscans called the Spiritual Franciscans who were declared heretical by the church, despite the fact they were following Francis' testament to the letter. While neither are magical or occult, heresy is always fun (well, not for heretics). The Cathars are also popular, or the beguines which got in trouble for letting women minister.

** I would assume Camelot was real, but Merlin existed post-Hogwarts, which historically doesn't match with the timelines unless you wanna add a couple headmasters to Hogwarts' history. I'd still make Camelot real if I was making a full AU story, but I would take Merlin out of Hogwarts, maybe one of the founders was a long lost apprentice of an apprentice?

Maybe there are also specialized Magical Cults? Like Pyromancers or specifically Dark Magicians that practice in Sorcery, etc... To increase the size of Magical Society, you must all increase the size and scope of Magic. The only reason Voldemort is considered the most powerful Dark Lord is because of how ambiguous history is for Rowling's world, but once you blow the lid open, everything gets scaled up.

I'd also assume that there is a 'Wandmakers Guild' or was at some point, just as there are 'Librarians' that probably cultivate Magical Knowledge in the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Wizards don't seem like ones for Book Burning, so you'd find just about anything in there, Old Magic, New Magic, Experimental Magic, Unfinished Spells, etc....

*** I like where you're going. And Merlin is not the original spelling for his name, so there very well could have been a Merlin as well as the original one.

** The Cambridge Apostles are secretly upper-class muggleborn wizards who have ventured back into the muggle world and chosen to continue their education at Cambridge. In addition to debates and talks, the Apostles meet to practice magic away from the watchful eyes of professors and obliviators alike. Their magical origin has been an open secret since the fifties, when they came to ministry attention after five of their former members were caught sharing intelligence with the Soviet war-wizards. During the reign of Margaret Thatcher, the left-leaning tendencies of the Apostles caused great deal of political friction between the Ministry of Magic and the national government.

Several of their members have achieved fame in both worlds -- John Maynard Keynes, who through the publication of his Theory of Magical Economics founded an entirely new field, and Bertrand Russel, who is credited with several of the greatest discoveries in modern arithmancy.

** The apostle Bartholomew, his name can be read as Bar Talmai = Son of Ptolemy (Not the only etymology, but it is a possible one)

Meaning you could have on of the 12 disciples of Jesus be a wizard (or squib). This opens up tons of possibilities for interactions between the wizarding world and religious societies.

** It would actually make sense for the most prominent magical societies of the time to have been window-dressed as religious in nature prior to the SoS becoming a thing. The druids, the first priests, the polytheistic temple attendants, all of them were essentially the go-to guys when it came to the storage, processing and dissemination of data at the time. If you wanted to learn how to read or write, you went to them (for a price, mind. Altruism is an incredibly modern concept by religious standards). You needed healing, you went to them. You wanted something recorded or copied, you went to them.

Ancient and not-so-ancient religions held a monopoly on knowledge, medical techniques and education in ancient times. That is an incredibly powerful position to be in, and qualifying for a post there would have been the ancient world's equivalent to getting a PHD in a STEM field given the sheer complexity and responsibility such a position would have commanded in societies where, despite the fact that said civilizations lived or died by the information they had, there were very, very few other knowledge bases available-and none the general public would have had easy access to at that.

In other words, it's almost perfect for a small magical community. The authority to gather information, an almost unequalled amount of freedom when compared to what the rest of the public had to put up with, a lavish lifestyle and the ability to pass off any potential accidents involving magic as either a sign of the gods or a miracle brought to Earth.

In a time before the obliviate spell became widespread, this particular subterfuge would have been vital in keeping a lid on the muggles' tendency towards discrimination/hatred/genocidal impulses when magic came into play.

And then Jesus happened and the wheels started coming off.Whether that was due to monotheism, Christianity, strife between religions, the evolution of human society as a whole or the Roman Empire (which tended to screw things up a lot anyway), something else or everything at once is up for debate.

*** Historically in some cultures magic was widely respected, between shaman, witch doctors, hedge witches, etc. The ISoS was fairly recent in history, and you could assume that the desire to cover up magic stemmed from the lessening of wizard numbers and the growth of muggle population, which led to distrust of those with magic to downright hostility, often caused by jealous individuals with power.
