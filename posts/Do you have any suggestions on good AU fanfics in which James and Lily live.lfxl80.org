I was trying to go for a lighter story. It doesn't need to be all fluffy, but I want to read a story in which they make it out alive somehow and raise Harry, possibly with Sirius and Remus still around, maybe with their own families as well?

That turned out to be very specific lol but you know, a story in which James, Lily, Sirius and Remus live a happy life and Harry has a happy childhood.


** There is that series on archieveofown which is basically the seven books re-written with the premise that Peter Pettigrew is overwhelmed by regret for his betrayal during his visit at the Potters and he ends up sacrificing himself for them thus initiating the protective love spell. I can't remember its name but I think it's fairly well-known so maybe someone here can help.

  What if Peter had decided to stop Voldemort at the last minute? How would the lives of Harry, James and Lily be different?

  What would happen if Harry Potter grew up with his parents and was raised in the wizarding world? What would happen in the original confrontations with Voldemort? Hopefully I will explore many of these Alternate Realities, so this story an AU. HARMONY
