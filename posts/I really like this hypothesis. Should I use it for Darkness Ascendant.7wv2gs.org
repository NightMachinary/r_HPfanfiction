****** Yeah, I thought it was weird, but I didn't feel like scouring canon to figure out if he wore glasses at such a young age, or not. I know in the movies he didn't have any when he was dropped off at the Dursleys, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

*** Sirius went through more than a decade of mind rape by the worst creatures on Earth. I'm not saying that I believe Rowling intended Crookshanks to be the Potter cat, but if you want to fix that potential plothole, Dementors are the answer. Also it would have been funny if Hermione's cat was closer to Harry than to her.

**** I planned to use both of those elements. Hermione would be complaining about crooks liking harry more than her and Sirius walks in and is like "cavendish, you mangy old man!" and Crookshanks jumps over to rub on his leg and then he explains that Crookshanks was originally named Cavendish when Lily bought him.

** It's a really cool Hypothesis, I like it better than the snake Harry freed as a child was Nagini and that's why it was able to talk back because only magical snakes can talk even a little.

I say use it, also you should include the Willy Wonka one as well. If you haven't heard it it's that...

A bit after Fred dies, George stricken with grief, leaves the wizarding world and become Willy Wonka in the original film. And the reason is the office scene where everything is cut in half. Because he slowly lost more and more of himself without his other half and represents that with the office.

** Heard the hypothesis. Don't like it. In fact, I kind of hate it.

If Crookshanks had been the Potters' cat, Sirius WOULD have mentioned it. I don't buy the "he forgot because Dementors" explanation; he shows no sign of memory loss in any other way.

I see nothing wrong with the stated canon explanation: Crookshanks, being part-Kneazle, is really smart, he can recognise an Animagus when he sees one, and he's good at knowing whether people are trustworthy or not.

Besides, and this is the main reason why I hate the theory... not EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE has to center around Harry and Harry's backstory. Just let Crookshanks be Hermione's, willya?

**** That's a somewhat flimsy justification, since he would plainly have seen that it was the same cat and realised that this wasn't the case. Crookshanks is so distinct-looking that it would be impossible not to recognise him.

*** I'm pretty much in agreement with you on this. It's a fun theory, but it doesn't quite hold up.

Actually, I think I would like it better if Crookshanks was not the Potter cat, but maybe was one of the kittens of the Potter cat. Maybe kneazle breeds are intelligent enough that they're capable of passing on knowledge to offspring. Maybe Crookshanks has been warned about sneaky rats that smell too human, and told how to get along with angry trees, but he's 100% Hermione's cat and has never met these people before.
