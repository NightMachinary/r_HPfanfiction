I've read a lot of HP fanfiction, unfortunately I can't make it past a chapter or two before giving up on most of what is out there. Here is a list of a few stories I am currently following.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging]]

I enjoy most anything that is AU and well written with a focus on Harry. I prefer stories with little to no romance, and avoid anything with slash in the main pairing.

If anyone has any stories they think I should check out please let me know, can't seem to find much on my own. Completed or WIP, I'd rather not read anything that is abandoned.

Thanks in advance!


** Well....I am actually following two out of your list. So....

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] by Mizuni-Sama is one that has little to no romance and is Harry-centric..in a way. It's an AU where Voldemort has control over wizarding britain and Harry was going to keep out of it until his parents were killed and he was sent to his relative's. Now Voldemort considers him an Apprentice and he keeps losing himself. The gap between updates are long but she puts out massive chapters so it's fine.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/21003][The Well Groomed Mind]] series is Harry centric with no romance I can see. Harry finds out Dumbledore has been manipulating his personality and does something about it. It's Harry's POV for the most part.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/441560][Name Confused]], though not exactly in your criteria, is a Sherlock/HP crossover with Harry [now in his thirties, post Battle of Hogwarts], works for Mycroft Holmes as his anonymous assistant/bodyguard/magic liasion. On that same note, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] is a very excellent HP/Sherlock crossover where Harry is raised by John and Sherlock. Super long and the sequel is still being updated. Very gen.

Everything else I like is slash/abandoned/really short. /shrug. [[http://fffn.darklordpotter.net/][This tool]] is super useful for filtering out ficts you like and don't like. Consider hunting through AO3 with their filters enabled and also look up archives outside of ffnet. There is a good list linked in the sidebar along with fict recs from tv tropes.

*** Thanks for the suggestions, I've read A Study in Magic before and really enjoyed it. I feel like I've seen a Well Groomed Mind, but I haven't read too much on Ao3, so I will give it a read for sure. I've passed up reading a Prince of the Dark Kingdom a few times, but I guess I should give it a try as I think it has been rec'ed several times on here.

**** A Well Groomed Mind is also on ffnet, under the same name I think. Prince is a bit of a heavy read so I don't think it's too bad that you passed it up a few times.

Someone else in this thread mentioned Death of Today and yes it does say slash in the summary but it's not really....sexual, if you know what I mean. Harry is mostly Asexual in it, to be honest. That's why I dropped it since that wasn't what I was into at the time but I am going to pick it up again eventually.

**** Give PoTDK a shot, but be prepared for some pretty horrible spelling/grammar for the first 50 chapters or so.

Don't get me wrong, I love the fic. Think it's the best FF in the HP world as far as world building and characterization goes. That said, the writing really is pretty bad early on.

******* I'm on chapter 52 right now. It isn't nearly as poorly written as you made me expect (which was a nice surprise). I noticed a few mistakes with there/their/they're and some other similar word or letter switches. I'm enjoying it so far, it was a good suggestion.

**** The Denarian series does a fantastic job of introducing the few elements of the Dresden Files that it utilizes (even though Shezza noticeably improves as an author throughout Denarian Renegade).

My favorite part about the story is that while it starts somewhat predictably with abuse and neglect that normally turns me off, Harry goes on not to be the typical Dark!Harry, but a character who struggles to define and deny his own humanity. Definitely on my list of "must reads".

*** Just a general warning to people on "Innocent", it's super slow. Suuuuper fucking slow. Like I was reading the fic, 200k words in, and I was wondering when the fuck Harry would get to Hogwarts. Not really Harry centric, it goes deep into other characters, changing viewpoints often.

If you don't mind slow fics that center on raising a young Harry, I would definitely recommend it. I personally couldn't get past 250k words unfortunately.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/1/Weres-Harry][Weres Harry?]] is pretty good. WIP that updates pretty infrequently, unfortunately. Pairings are mentioned but not major plot points.

#+begin_quote
  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
