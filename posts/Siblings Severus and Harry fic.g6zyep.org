** The only sibling fic I know is this one: [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewseries.php?seriesid=45]]

They are briefly deaged but it's to preHogwarts age. Snape is pretty OOC too but it was enjoyable when I read it.

** There's a time-travel + aging potion + blood adoption story, in which Harry, Severus, and Hermione become the McGonagall triplets. They go to Hogwarts but as adult instructors. Sounds like trope salad but it's a fun read.
