All his life, James blamed Harry for Lily's death. On the 27th of July 1983, Remus Lupin died protecting Solomon and Harry. When Voldemort tried to kill Solomon, the Killing Curse rebounded and hit him. James blamed Harry for that as well and neglected him, while Solomon was raised with whatever he wanted, as the Boy-Who-Lived.

Edit: title should be that Solomon was born in 1981


** Title says 1881, so I thought Solomon would be an ancestor, but based on the prompt, sounds like a WBWL. Is that right?

*** Solomon is his brother, I made a mistake in the title. However, Solomon is actually the BWL

***** That's a really good idea! Maybe Sirius/Remus were initially unable to visit because they were busy, and they find out about his treatment.

****** Or maybe Solomon is cursed so he can never age older than ten or so (kinda like Eli in Let the Right One In)? He can never age or mature. He is the eternal boy who won't die

*** Solomon is actually the BWL in this prompt, and I'm visualising the treatment of Harry to be like how the Dursley's treat Harry in canon.

*** I based it slightly of "/A Christmas Carol/" where Scrooge blames his nephew for the death of his sister during childbirth. As for Solomon being born in 1881, that was a mistake in the title, he was actually born in 1991
