So basically for fics where Harry and Hermione have a strong friendship. They may or may not be paired with each other. Like I don't know how to describe. Fics like those where Hermione is there for Harry in the after war fics, or where the trio has a strong friendship.

Any time period / NSFW / SFW / Anything

**/I'm sorry I'm not really good at this./**


** Self-promotion time. I wrote a one-shot in which Hermione is trying to get Harry a date for the Yule Ball. Just a Harry&Hermione friendship, no weird harem setup or something like that.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
