Fairly simple really anyone know any good fics exploring the three black sisters while they are at hogwarts? Anything that showcases their relationships any form of sibling rivalry, bickering, fighting or maybe they are rather close and don't drift apart till later.

Can have any of the three sisters as the main character though I'm leaning toward Bellatrix being the focus. also would prefer something where Bellatrix isn't in love with Narcissa so no Blackcest ( though minor allusions to Bellatrix maybe harbouring certain feelings for her 'Cissy' are okay as long as it sort of background-ish stuff) cheers in advance :)


** I know quite a few Narcissa ones, with Bella and Andie as side characters, but due to Reddit rules I can't post them here. Look for Early Days and Forsaken Love by fairmaidofkent, which are two very different Lucissa fics (though Lucius is in character as being sort of a jerk in both). Forsaken Love though extends into their marriage and gets quite depressing. If Only Your Father Knew by TechnicolourGrey is an AU with Lucius's as Narcissa's (and Bella's) DACA teacher. I tend not to like fics that treat the pureblood families as so old-fashioned they start marrying off their kids as soon as they hit puberty, so there haven't been many memorable fics for me, but I'm sure there are tons.

**** Well, Lucius and Narcissa have sex while he's an adult and she's a minor in If Your Father Knew, and I do remember there's lots if sex in Early Days; can't recall if Narcissa is actually seventeen at the time, but I think she's a 5th year. I wanted to be on the safe side as far the rule about minors having sex goes.

I really do love Early Days, though I wished it was a bit longer and that the resolution hadn't been so easy. I felt like Lucius needed to earn it more. But I loved his parents in it! Forsaken Love is a good story, but it's also pretty miserable. I don't know if I could read it again without becoming depressed. I much prefer Early Days. Because I haven't read it in a long time, I honestly can't remember if Narcissa was a minor when she marries Lucius, so I played it safe.

Yeah Forsaken Love is really depressing but the ending is a lot more satisfying. I also like linkffn(Yarrow) because of the different premise.

Did you know that Early Days has an alternate ending? Where Narcissa doesn't immediately forgive him?

****** I skipped Yarrow. Is it any good? I was afraid that it was going to be as depressing as Forsaken Love, with Lucius perhaps still in love with his dead wife.

I think I did read that alternative ending. I guess I just wanted to fic to be longer and more developed. That conflict was so good and it rang so true that Lucius would do something that selfish, but I wanted him to grow up a little and truly earn her forgiveness, even if he did so during the relationship. I think it was okay that she went back to him, but maybe he should have also had to show her that she could truly trust him before they got married.

If you love Lucissa, you should check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17220164][charcoal and salt]]. It's a quick one-shot, but it does have a Narcissa that is closer to my head-cannon than anything else I've ever read.

******* Yarrow isn't that depressing in comparison. The dead wife story has more to it, but Lucius isn't pining after her or anything. He's moved on to some extent already. I like the set up of the story because Lucius and Narcissa live together in the manor without actually being together and that leads to interesting situations.

charcoal and salt is very self aware! I really liked it!

** There is an ongoing fic called Broken Reflections that has Harry back in time , falling in love with Andromeda and getting all chummy with Narcissa- Bella has not made an appearance yet, but Harry is planning to save her from becoming mad and it is promising:

​

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12977048/1/Broken-Reflections]])

​

The author has other fics with Andromeda and Harry, so check out their summaries to see if you are interested_ usually, there is a fair amount of Andromeda-Narcissa interactions, and reminescences of Bella.

​

I also like A true daughter of the Black, mostly Andromeda-Harry and you get Narcissa as well:

**** Well, I don't think she might have disliked him exactly (though in my head-cannon she sometimes has a little disdain for that side of the family), but that the age difference was too huge for Sirius and Regulus to be anything but the babies in the family. Narcissa is five years older than Sirius---she would have been in NEWTs classes by the time he got to Hogwarts, and probably married and running her own life by the time his opinions solidified and he left the family. I can't imagine they hung out in any real way. I find that fics that change everyone's age so they are all age-peers can be a bit of a cop out. Either the author can make it so Narcissa is friends with Severus and/or rival to Lilian and not really bother creating OC characters that are meaningful, or they insert Sirius into Narcissa's and Andromeda's lives in way that seem to be more about the author liking Sirius than anything. I believe they might have been protective of him, but I doubt they saw him as a fried or someone Andromeda could talk to about Ted. I'm sure there are all sorts of good reasons to make those changes and good plots that can come from the family being closer, I just haven't come across any that was really strong. Mostly, it just feels like people want to write Sirius as a significant character when they do Black Family fics and it's hard to do that when he's ten.
