In the Harry Potter series, it says that the Quill of Acceptance's job is "to record magical births in Great Britain and Ireland". So, if a child were to be born in another country (let's say as a Muggleborn) and they immigrated to Britain at a young age, would they be able to attend Hogwarts or would they have to go the magical school corresponding to their birth country? Would the Quill be able to detect that magic and go back and record them for admittance?

On Pottermore, actually. First, it's not when they're born the Quill attempts to write their name "At the precise moment that a child first exhibits signs of magic". Secondly, "The Book, however, will often snap shut, refusing to be written upon until it receives sufficiently dramatic evidence of magical ability." So, As long as the kid does accidental magic after they move Great Britain or Ireland the Quill/Book combo can still Accept/Admit them.

But all that ignores the information we got earlier about Hat Stalls and Squibs nearly getting into Hogwarts.

*** Sorry, my bad about the Pottermore source vs Harry Potter series source! And yeah, that's a good point about the previous information. I dunno anymore - I just want to write decent canon-adherent fanfiction, but there can be quite a bit of conflicting information out there sometimes. Thanks so much!

**** JKR didn't write 'canon-adherent'. Why should you?

All joking aside, don't worry about any tidbits that don't come from the books (which do still contradict each other). If you don't like the Book/Quill, there only being one cheap ripoff of Hogwarts in all of North America, Fleamont and Euphemia, or wizards soiling themselves before they adopted indoor plumbing you don't need them to be canon-adherent. Everything that is not the books is secondary. This is why I'm glad I'm also in the Star Trek fandom. The wiki for that is split into two sites Memory Alpha for primary sources (the shows and movies) and Memory Beta for secondary sources (novels, comics, and video games).

Just remember that Rowling is as bad at history as she is at math.

Magic didn't exist in North America until the glorious European civilizers came and founded Ilvermorny /s

(jeez could you get any more tone deaf?)

****** Magic did exist, but it was more tribal and less formal

then came the europeans with writing and a more formal sense

call it tone deaf, or call it history
