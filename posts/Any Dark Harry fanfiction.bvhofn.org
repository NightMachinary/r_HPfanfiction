I'm fine with slash so long as it is well written. I would like a powerful dark harry if you can find one.


** This fic is kind of my curse, because it's my favorite Dark and Powerful Harry story, but it is short (20k words) and sadly abandoned.

If you're ok with those drawbacks, try it out. I really do love it.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** How dark is dark?

linkao3 (The Sum of their Parts by holdmybeer) is dark!Trio (including dark Harry).

But there are also fics where Harry is adopted by LV and turns out to be, basically, a Muggle-hating Dark Lord in the serial killer, LV 2.0 sense. Is that the sense of dark you were going for?

** I will never not recommend Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). It has the scarcrux awaken and raise Harry as a minion/heir, which I know sounds really cliche and stupid, but the twist here is that it's /super/ well written and has not a single instance of bashing.

Before they convinced you life is war by EclipseWing

Harry does some dark things is the series but he is more gray personality wise. Which I like, because it keeps him in character but he still does some very questionable things. Is a Tomarry and AU.
