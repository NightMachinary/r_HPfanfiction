** I guess "a marauders plan" could be counted as a lord potter fic, he's the heir to both the blacks and the potters, but its more a "what could be" if he had someone who /truly/ cares for him. He's superpowerful and theres some pretty heavy political themes and some dumbledore bashing, but i think its a pretty good fic. Its definitely AU. and /long/- 800k+ words.
