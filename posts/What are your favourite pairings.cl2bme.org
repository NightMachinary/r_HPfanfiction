** Harry/ginny, Harry/Daphne. Though i am open to most other pairings depending on the story. The only one i dont like is harry/draco, i just struggle to see a case where this would be a pair.

** I'm a slash fan, downvote as you will.

Currently writing a huge AU with Draco/Harry, Draco/Charlie, Viktor/Ron, Fred/George/OFC, Hermone/Seamus, Neville/Luna, Bill/Fleur (oh look, the only canon XD), and I keep contemplating Percy with someone... but I might just murder him instead.

***** Yes, but he realizes his mistakes in DH though. And for all his follies, he's young and the young make mistakes, often impulsive.. and his ego pretty much prevented him from seeking forgiveness. He throws all his ego and pettiness away once he realizes his family is in mortal danger.

** Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny. These four characters ( specially Ron and Hermione) were literally written for each other. I can't really enjoy another pairing without feeling that the characters are simply not the same. Specially when it's OOC for out of no where.
