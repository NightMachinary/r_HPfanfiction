I'm looking for a fanfic i think it starts of in 5th year and the order have a meeting about how Ron isn't good enough/smart enough for Harry to be friends with, only Harry and Sirius disagree with them. And they tell ron he has to leave and not be friends with Harry again. So Ron leaves and proves everyone wrong and becomes a hero. I think the pairing is Ron/Daphne. I know it's not a very good description but if anyone knows the title of the fic, it would be amazing!


** I really want to read it now /sigh/ I hope someone will know what story it is so I can read it
