Luna Lovegood is probably my favorite character in the whole Potterverse, and I would love to read more about her. I'd specifically like fics that are /at least/ 10k words, but the longer, the better. Bonus points if the ship is Harry/Luna or Ginny/Luna!

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

  Luna lets Ginny borrow her dairy to read, but as Ginny learns more about Luna, she finds out some things that could tear apart a friendship forever. Rated just in case for later chapters

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4173777][The Girl in the Kneazle Nightie]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5574922/1/Christmas-Moonbeam][Christmas Moonbeam]] are Luna centric fics! (Christmas Moonbeam isn't quite 10k words, sorry.)

I do have one Ginny/Luna fic that is a decent length - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12217386/1/][Camelopard Dreams]].
