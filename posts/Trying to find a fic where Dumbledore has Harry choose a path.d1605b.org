:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I /think/ this was set in GoF. Harry was asking Dumbledore about some political questions or something like that, and Dumbledore stops him. He says something along the lines of having to choose a path(maybe a path as his apprentice)- one which would be simpler. Black and white, good vs evil, Harry vs Voldemort. Or another that would be very political and shades of grey.

Dumbledore kinda changes in personality at the same time, iirc. He gets a bit less kindly eccentric grandfather and more well meaningly manipulative master wizard.

Harry was asking /something/ related to a girl. I don't remember who but I think it was either Fleur or Susan Bones.

Thanks in advance, even if you can't help.


** Not the fic you're looking for, but relevant:

  Harry strays into the library's newspaper archives. The Hat wanted to put Harry into Slytherin. Harry was not just not stupid, he also was fairly clever if he wanted to be. Well, the Ministry needed a new player for quite sometime now. Not a bashing story. Part one - Sirius' freedom is complete. Irregular but not infrequent updates.

*** Dagger and Rose was the first fic to come to mind for me als, but it's not what I'm looking for. Neither is Journey Through The Dark. Thanks for trying, though!
