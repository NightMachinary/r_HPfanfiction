hey guys i've just recently read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12273702/1/A-Bit-of-Sky][A Bit of Sky by ShayaLonnie]] and I loved the way she dealt with the time travel trope & her characterisation of everyone - especially Lily and Harry & Draco. Looking for something with similar dynamics and tone. Thanks so much
