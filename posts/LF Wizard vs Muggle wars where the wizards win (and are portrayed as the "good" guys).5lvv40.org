Dark!Harry, Evil!Muggles, time travel or their first go through, whatever. Just fics where the wizards win eventually.

Please no mpreg, romance driven plot or genderbending. Crossovers, slash and bashing are fine. Thank you!


** You mention Dark!Harry and time travel and that's my experience with these stories: Voldemort's war spills out into the muggle world and they exterminate the "wandies" (and everything else remotely magical). Harry time-travels to prevent the exposure of magicals to muggles and/or save the magicals.

Half of the time, the decimation magicals is somehow Dumbledore's fault and Vodlemort is really trying to save magicals from extermination and Harry is now in love with Voldemort. (Must have a no-nose fetish.)

*** Or Voldemort secretly looks like an adult Tom Riddle and snakeface is a glamor for scaring the purebloods, or thanks to Harry's love he performs a ritual to gain his old face back.

Not that I actually mind. Aside from my dislikes, I'm actually not all that picky when it comes to fanfiction tropes.

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.
