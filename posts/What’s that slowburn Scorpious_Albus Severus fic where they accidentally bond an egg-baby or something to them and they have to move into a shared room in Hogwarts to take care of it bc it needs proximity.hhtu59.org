** I think you're looking for A Magical Bond by C.Queen. It's on fanfiction.net and it fits your word description; it's 229k words.

If you're looking for another read (maybe after this one) I'd HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Helix by Saras_Girl on archiveofourown. It's a fic about Harry and Draco who get in trouble with McGonagall and have to take care of snails every night. It was /cute as hell/ and sounds a lot like A Magical Bond :)

*** I think A Magical Bond might be it! I looked it up and it sounds about right, I will have to start reading it to make sure tho---I'll update you when I figure it out!

In the meantime, if anyone else reading this thinks I may be talking about a different fic, please add the link anyway, just in case!

Update: This was def the fic! Thanks again :)
