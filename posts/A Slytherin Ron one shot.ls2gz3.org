I've just finished rereading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16525733?view_adult=true][A Darker Shade of Red]] for the millionth time because despite being only about six and a half thousand words it manages to evoke so many emotions in me. If you're looking for a Ron centric ficlet I definitely recommend this one.


** Thanks for the recommendation! I really wanted the ending to read as Ron sees the green light of the killing curse because Draco has just killed Bellatrix to save his friend. That Ron's friendship with Draco is enough to turn Draco against Voldemort and they work together to assist the Order. Ahh, wishful thinking...

*** Huh, I always thought that the killing curse hit Ron, not Bella.

**** Yes, I think that's the intention of the author. I was saying I prefer the ending I wrote above. You might consider spoiler tags to hide the ending in your comment.
