What obscure trope do you with you'd see more of or love whenever you run across it? Have you ever actually seen it? Mine would have to be a reincarnated OC looking for themselves in the muggle world.


** (I don't know it these are obscure)

1. Fleur not being a walking talking French stereotype. You're a witch, you can't tell me there aren't translation spells. And if you want to actually learn the language (which I assume Fleur has been doing for years based on her easy comprehension and sentence formation) then her accent should be a whole lot better. I took French in college, and her canon pronunciation is just ridiculous.

She lived in England for quite a while, worked at Gringotts, her English shouldn't be so heavily accented.

Unless she's messing with everyone, in which case, I approve.

1. Diary Tom is awesome in any form, I love when he makes appearances. Or Harry being able to talk to his fellow Horcruxes.

*** Honestly, Fleur really is a walking stereotype throughout the books. The only time Rowling lets her shift away is at the end of seven with Bill being scarred.

I honestly find Rowling fairly bigoted in her views in a lot of things; that's one of them. Fleur is a walking French cliche from really bad British sitcoms.

Which is sad, she's also portrayed as potentially a kick ass character. Top of her class, Triwizard Champion, really smart. It's why I like the fanfics who make the worst of her behavior an act of sorts, or make it a hook in some other way, if they keep it at all.

** IDK about "obscure," but it still seems weirdly uncommon: casually badass postwar Harry/Ron/Hermione/etc. linkffn(the archaeologist by racke) comes the closest to this of any fic I've read so far, but I'm still holding out hope for, like, a Harry/Ron auror buddy cop fic where some new wannabe dark lord finds out the hard way that, while he might legitimately be able to overpower most aurors, he just can't compete with seven years of dealing with Voldemort and Voldemort-adjacent bullshit. (Meanwhile, the rest of the aurors are impressed/shocked/horrified -- take your pick -- at what they've just witnessed.)

- I like when people write Harry as being a very kind person, who likes to help others. It doesn't have to be some epic thing. Just being nice to Luna and Neville, for example. I know it's not obscure, but I love it.

- Harry catching up on his Muggle pop culture and then have a blast with his chipper friend/eventual girlfriend Tonks, talking about films, music and TV. Just don't do too much, lest it become cringeworthy. Just sprinkle a couple of references here and there, make them share a laugh and be silly.

Harry could tell Fleur was working hard to mask her accent, and he found it adorable.

** I dunno if these counts

- bashing. I feel like I'm seeing less of it now and that's unfortunate because I love bashing when it's done right. And it doesn't necessarily have to be with mega rich super Lord Harry

- Tom Riddle adopting Harry. And I don't mean it to where he's Voldemort and wants to protect Harry because he realizes he's a horcruxe or whatever. Preferably, I mean where he and Voldemort are 2 different people or he's from a different demension or something

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.
