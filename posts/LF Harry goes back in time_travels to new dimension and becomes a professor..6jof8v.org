Something like linkffn(5511855) or linkffn(11160991)

I'd prefer no slash, but as long as it's not something like Voldemort/Harry I'll read it.


** Linkffn(12184104) It's not too bad, but the writer is very pedantic, going to great details in describing how Harry improves even the smallest things in this new dimension.

** Linkffn(9908146)

Jamie Evans and the Lonely Queen fits this premise, it is a fem!OP!Harry, but more because Harry is an old grizzled war hero at that point. Despite that, the focus is very much on teaching and warm and fuzzy moments, aside from a few mopping up cannon bits. It's rather amusing the central premise is that Harry is fates chew toy, no matter how powerful he gets. Fem is due to a timetravel/AU mishap.

Edit: just realized I linked to the latest installment , its part of an ongoing series, so don't let the word count discourage you.

  Jamie has survived an entire year and has successfully kept her employment at Hogwarts. Now she has to deal with a family that knows who she is, a government that doesn't want her in the country, and people demanding to know when she'll get married. That, and there's also the pesky after-effects of throwing herself backwards through time.

** Linkao3(3926626). Kind of a fix-it fic, with Harry becoming the Muggle Studies professor. Written from the younger Harry's perspective, not the time traveler's. There's an implied slash pairing, but it's subtle and easily ignored if you don't like it.

Be warned, it's dead (though it does reach the end of 3rd year).

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** Linkffn(1226706)

HP/SS, Harry goes back in time to the 1970s to teach DADA. I like this one because it has a good balance of humor along with the actual time travel impact.

The relationship is a major plot point, if it's a deal breaker

It's been finished almost 15 years now, and holy fuck does that make me feel old

Enjoy!

*** Don't worry! The main problem I have with slash is the tendency to pair Harry off with way older men. Since this involves time travel I'm assuming that age difference is gone.

**** They are both adults, the fic picks up several years later.

The age difference does come up - but it's specifically because the teacher student aspect of their original meeting.... both times. The last chapter ties everything together perfectly.

This is defiantly one of my top ten in this fandom, so I will be interested to hear what you think.

... and now I'm off to read it again, since it's been a while
