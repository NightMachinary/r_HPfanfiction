The AUs I'm looking for are things like: 1. Going back and forward in time (eg. Harry and/or Hermione to Marauder era, Next!Gen to their parents years) 2. In or travelling to alternate universes/realities (eg. Harry travelling to one where a lot of people who were dead in his universe are alive such as his parents, Sirius and Remus and he's not the BWL) 3. Specific characters are alive (eg. Sirius not dying at the Ministry) 4. Harry having a twin sister that either they thought dead or lost (such as Poppy â€˜Stark' in Splintered Dimension by TheTruffalo on Fanfiction.net) 5. Stuff involving Sirius such as getting a romance in GoF and OotP and/or having a child that he knew or didn't know about 6. Fem!Harry in a number of previous points [eg. an older Fem!Harry (of age, 18 or 19, year or two fresh from last battle) along with the child of Sirius and/or Hermione to the canon universe. 7. Harry can't be really dark. Cynical and snarky sure but not evil!dark if you know what I mean. 8. This may seem a bit strange but I do like it when character watch their movies so if you know one or more, please let me know.

It doesn't have to be (1) finished, (2) updated recently or (3) have ticked all the points above [just needs to be at least one].

Though it needs to be (4) well written, (5) interesting and (6) long [at least 30-50K with 15+ chapters, preferably WAAAY longer, compacting stories with a lot of writing into fewer chapters].

These's are some examples from Fanfiction.net Don't Look Back in Anger ~ amandakid212 Harry Potter, Rise from Dust ~ Bluezz-17 0800-Rent-A-Hero ~ brainthief

I would like to thank anyone who has read to this point and please recommend me one or multiple stories you think I'd like.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]]: Time travel. 20 years old Hermione sent her memories and powers back to her 2 years old self, or 42 days before Halloween 1981. Hilarity ensued, but also heart breaking moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]: Time traveling Harry turned Bellatrix, and things turned better for most people. This fic is also the Marauder Era fic with the highest number of Favorites on FFN.

She has a good plan, but no plan survives contact with the enemy. Some totally unexpected complications happen in this story, but she has eventually a happy ending with Sirius.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.
