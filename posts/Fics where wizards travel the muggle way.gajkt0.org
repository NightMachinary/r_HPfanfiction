Fics that involve wizards going to the airport and flying to somwhere, going to disneyland, etc..

The coronavirus has basically made it clear that I won't be able to travel anywhere any time soon, so Instead of actually visiting cool places I'll just read characters visitting cool places.


** It's not quite traveling the muggle way but maybe Make a Wish - linkffn(2318355) - is what you might like. Harry traveling the world and seeing stuff

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** In linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) Percy just cannot take it anymore, and leaves with his girlfriend to Prague for a weekend (because, why not? and why didn't all muggleborns couldn't leave that way?).

In [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=9605][Rows by Antosha]] Ginny travels on train. It is really lovely one-shot.
