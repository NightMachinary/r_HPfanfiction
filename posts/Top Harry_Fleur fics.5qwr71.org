** linkffn(Euphoria) and linkffn(Wastelands of Time) are certainly the best fics for Harry/Fleur. The former for embracing a realistic side of the two, something the other authors could really need. The story paces the paring in a way that seems not completly ludicrous. The latter is clearly not a romance story (although it gets better in that regard with it unfinished sequel). but for itself it is an amazing story.

What else is there... linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) and linkffn(a Cadmean victory) get both suggestet alot, truth be told I found them both quite bad, but many people disagree, so make your own opinion.

Then there is linkffn(What you leave behind) which atm only hints a the pairing but should embrace it later on, and the story is quite awesome already.

And last but not least the best smut fic for H/F is of course [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10191925/1][How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me AKA: I'm a Lucky, Lucky Man (revised)]].

That should cover it mostly.

*** Cadmean Victory is good until the author decides that Katie isn't good enough for Harry and that he needs a sexy, older french veela babe on his arm instead.

**** Very possible that it was three times by me alone :D But what I can say, I really enjoyed it! Althougth truth be told I found the way [[/spoiler][Voldemorte let Harry go extreamly weak and 'easy'. As we have to learnd wether your Voldemorte is diffrent from the canon one this felt rather cheap.]]

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** See my flair for reasons as to why, but I recommend linkffn(A Cadmean Victory). It's good but bad in a somewhat good way. I'll still defend that it's a fun read as always.

linkffn(Deprived) is my personal favorite. It hits all of the popcorn read notes I like as well as being fairly well written for its genre and has a unique aspect to it.

If you're looking for smut fics I recommend How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me. Top of its class.
