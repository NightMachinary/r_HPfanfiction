So I wanna know what're the longest fics in word count or chapters,

(preferably both or just the word count)

I don't remember anything else but that I've read one fic with 800k words and I remember that linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has 112 chapters which is the most that I remember having read at the moment

So what are yours? I'll be happy to find out

Thanks for reading this post


** Hmm. Maybe the Sacrifices Arc? linkffn(2580283)

It's 7 books long and two of those are over 700,000 words so... It's a doozy.

**** Nope! Saving Connor is book 1 in the Sacrifices Arc. The entire series is about the sacrifices people make and how it affects themselves and the world around them

/However/, I have never made it past Book 5 of the Sacrifices Arc (and I've tried like 3 or 4 times.) It gets a bit long winded plot-wise. I have fallen for the Prince of Slytherin story because it hits many of the same high points (but they're spoilers for both series) at a much quicker pace without being too fast.

He allies with Doctor Doom, fights Magneto, makes friends with Death, and so much more yet they want to focus on his sex life which I honestly don't care about

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1][Black Sky]] might be the one for me; 1,355,292 words.

--------------

fem!Harry raised by 'good'&'traditionalist'-Blacks senile!dumbledore, transitioning into a crossover with Katekyo Hitman Reborn! at the end of Harry Potter content.

The writing style feels unique to me...

- example from ch2:

  #+begin_quote
    Sirius was not entirely sure what happened after he said that, but a few minutes later he was sitting at the kitchen table eating omelette while Tansy cooed over 'little mistress Dorry' and another much younger female elf --Mimsy-- carted off Sirius' bags while promising to 'sort out rooms for the young master and the little mistress!' Sirius just let it happen: his grandfather's elves had always been kind to him, unlike his mother's disgusting little sycophant Kreacher.
  #+end_quote

- and another (random) one from chapter 218:

  #+begin_quote
    Nono was trash but he could be sneaky.

    Don Scarlatti had been visibly conflicted at the sight of his daughter wearing the Varia uniform and standing at Boss's shoulder, which had been funny. The trash clearly couldn't decide if he was outraged that she was making herself even harder to marry off or delighted that she'd risen to such an influential position in the Varia that Boss was taking her places in an official capacity. Squalo had enjoyed the man's unease and amused himself exchanging glances with Sumu's kid brother, who was visibly delighted by his sister's achievements and had actually run over ahead of his father to hug her outright. The thirteen-year-old was the kind of Storm too bull-headed to be afraid of anything or anybody not actively trying to kill him, so had no trouble at all making eye-contact with Varia assassins and grinning.

** Visited by a Doctor It's a crossover but I think it still counts as HP fanfiction. I kid you not, it's got over 824k words (since I last checked) and about 100 chapters. The first chapter was published in 2009 AND IT'S STILL GOING.
