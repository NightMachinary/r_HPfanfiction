Looking for any wbwl fanfics where Harry is either abandoned or neglected so he leaves his family. He must be at least dark if not outright evil, cold or emotionless, and also more powerful then most if not outright overpowered. I do like the assassin Harry's or the monster ones to but it doesn't have to be either of those. Also he can't start liking his family again all the sudden read a couple of those and they are horrible. I would like there not to be romance but if their is just not the main point of the story. Any help finding any would be greatly appreciated. NO SLASH
