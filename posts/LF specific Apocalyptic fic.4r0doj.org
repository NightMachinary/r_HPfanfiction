So there's a fic I faintly remember that I'd like to read again. It was a kind of end of the world fic where Voldy summons demons that turn against him (I think!).

One scene I remember vividly is HP and crew (may not have been the Trio) where venturing to an abandoned military base to steal munitions, and on their way there (or back), they are attacked by a demon who emerges from a portal while they are near or at a gas station.

There's another detail that I remember, but it may be from a different fic. I think the Trio are working with Hogwarts staff to set up a refugee camp on Hogwarts ground, and they have a Muggle general or veteran helping them with planing defenses for the castle and grounds. I faintly remember something like a ring of fire based on diesel fuel or something as a trap. Though this may be from an entirely different fic. If so (and you know which one, rec please :p )

Thanks!!


** I /think/ it's the hero trilogy, but I myself didn't finish it. Written By the same guy who wrote The wastelands of time. Joe996 or sometging like that

*** It is this one, I remember both of those scenes. It may not be the first one though, so you could have to read a whole lot to get there.

**** Awesome. Thanks a lot guys!

Sounds like it might be it. I faintly remember reading joe's stories a long time ago. I like to reread the wastelands of time every now and again.

** Isn't the gas station scene in the forging the sword trilogy? Something like the first encounter with the demons which uses the gas station explosion to get rid of it? I'm far from certain but it's the bell it rings.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma by The Matt Silver]] has some similar scenes, though I don't think the details quite match up.
