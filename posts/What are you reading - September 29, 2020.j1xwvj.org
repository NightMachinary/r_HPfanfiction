** I'm currently reading three stories:

Title: 1979 by LadyKenz347\\
Rating: M\\
Link: linkffn(13520766)\\
My impression: This is a James Potter/Hermione Granger romance story that features the latter going back in time to 1979. The thing that I like most about the story itself is that it balances romance with tension quite nicely. On the one hand, James and Hermione's relationship deepens from the beginning of the story in a way that's not too fast and not too slow, while on the other hand, the story covers the war and what's being done to combat Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Also, everyone is kept in-character (for the most part), of which I'm a complete sucker for. 1979 is still on-going and is updated about once a week.

Title: Begging for Thread by Kittenshift17\\
Rating: M\\
Link: linkffn(12970488)\\
My impression: This is a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger romance (and smut) story that features the two of them sharing a bedroom in Grimmauld Place the summer before Hermione's seventh year. While this story is low on plot (and high on smut), I feel like it's a nice break from the craziness the world seems to be on as of late. Technically, I'd classify this as a slice-of-life-type of story and from my point of view, sometimes I need to read something like that - something where I can lose myself in the story without having to fear about anything bad happening to the main characters and the relationship they have with each other. Also, I'm writing a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger story myself right now and reading other Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger stories inspires me to keep up with what I already have written (though unfortunately, the Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger landscape is like an arid desert of new stories).

Title: Taming Destiny by Frickles\\
Rating: T\\
Link: linkffn(13698636)\\
My impression: This is a Harry Potter/Hermione Granger story that features James and Lily Potter having survived Voldemort's attack in Godric's Hollow. This story is fairly new (as there's only two chapters posted thus far) and was last updated a couple of weeks ago. The main issue that I have with the story is Harry's sex life: he beds women left and right a la Christian Grey. It's a bit annoying to read that, even if he hasn't met Hermione yet. What keeps me going with this story is the James and Lily factor. I like the idea of having James and Lily's perception of Harry and Hermione dating each other, especially since they know how Harry is with sex and such. Of course, because the story is in its infancy, I can't say much about it...only that I hope the author updates it soon.

  In 1998, as Horcruxes continue to go unearthed and the war wages without hope of winning, Hermione Granger is given a mission. With a journal of clues and a single long-jump time turner, Hermione must go back to before it all began. She has to go back to the fall of 1979.

*** I haven't read any of these fics, thanks for the detailed descriptions, helps me know what might be interesting to me and what to avoid!

I am mostly replying to say your reference to Christian Grey (50 Shades of Grey) as someone who beds women left and right is really inaccurate. I have read the book to see what the hype was about and he has only ever had 3 sexual relationships in his life (the main character, a crazy stalker, and "Mrs. Robinson"). A much better comparison would be Casanova or Lothario.

I read a really interesting scholarly book regarding BDSM in fiction and fanfiction, and the history of the tropes evolving and changing leading up to 50 Shades of Grey is so much more interesting than the trilogy itself!

******* I can't comment on the fic in question since I haven't read it; my point was the comparison of Harry to Christian Grey with the comment above, "he beds women left and right a la Christian Grey". If Harry is having sex with lots of women, that would be more in keeping with a Casanova comparison than the love interest from 50 Shades of Grey (for all that he's a gross collection of abusive behavior, just like the character he was modeled on, Edward Cullen from Twilight).

Whether this is accurate to your fic or not, since I haven't read it and make this statement based on what the reviewer above wrote, I'll say it again: I find the idea of a teenager as a sex god is laughable. It's not about having dates at all. Pop culture idols, for all their charming celebrity and media attention are not necessarily sex gods unless the definition of sex god is trading on an image of sex/sexual appeal. Is it the appearance of being sexy or bedding women as described above that makes someone a sex god? I don't think so, which is why I think it's silly to call a teenager that.

Mate, I'd hope that aspiring Ravenclaws wouldn't make assumptions about folks on the internet.

We're clearly talking at cross-purposes. I haven't read your fic, my comments were solely about the reference made by a reviewer, and that in my opinion, a teenage Harry depicted as a sex god is silly. It would be entirely believable for a teen raised with fame and privilege would use that to his advantage.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13092314/1/][Gates of Azkaban]] is fantastic. Harry and Hermione and Snape and Ginny end up in a 70's AU. A little mild bashing of James/Lily (though it's very reasonable) and a setup so blatant for later Hermione/young Snape it hurts, but it manages to he a believable AU that develops in a realistic way while not being too awful. Best bit of fanfic I've read in ages.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13123883/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Ticket-Backwards][Ticket Backwards]] is also a good read. It's a post-canon Harry all on his own as an eleven year old again, trying to defeat Voldemort on his own. But everything is awful, his friends aren't really connecting with him and he's starved for meaningful human contact. He's taking on a task he's not quite suited for and is doesn't really admit how awful it is for him. Oh, and Lockhart gets his blood boiled in a later installment.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9628375/1/Malachite-Gift][Malachite Gift]] (and two others in the series) is one of two slightly odd ones I've read recently. They're dead, but a lot of fun. Slytherin Harry, best mates with Luna and the Bloody Baron, spends his summers with a random Knockturn Alley witch. Bit power wanky, but not so much as to turn your stomach. Reminds me of Ashes of Chaos, really. All the Slytherin Harry fics I've read seem to start with something as ridiculous as Prince of Slytherin and step down from there.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6442123/chapters/14745928][Echoes]] is an SI, and a little arty for my taste. It's at the other end of the SI tone scale from Whats Her Name in Hufflepuff, but it's a bit of fun anyway. The SI is a first year during GoF and a bit sad about how she died. Cedric treats her like a cross between a pet and a sister. She reacts well to his death.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10093402/1/Initiate][Initiate]] is part one of a series where Sirius has a wet breaks out of Azkaban dream and does the equivalent of offering Harry candy to leave the Dursleys. It follows Harry pre-Hogwarts and Sirius trying to prove his innocence, sort of. It's currently in a few entries up to GoF.

You really see the development of Snape's character to the person that he is in Gates of Azkaban. Highly recommend reading that (though both Gates of Azkaban and The Cactus and the Toad work perfectly well as standalone fics).

  What use is knowledge of the future when she can't bring herself to care? She owed this world nothing - this story would continue without her. Death took a chance, gambled on the wrong soul, and now she has to pay for it. No one ever said the Wizarding World would be all fun and games, especially not with a Dark Lord's imminent revival, a Headmasters penchant for manipulation, and a Boy-Who-Will-Die's stubborn tenacity. Not that it will matter soon, anyway.Semi-Realistic, Somewhat Dark SI/OC (more OC than SI).

** *Harry Potter and the Daft Morons* - linkffn(12562072)\\
I recommend it because of all of the breaking of Magical Britain's common sense. Oh, you need to get a hold of Sirius Black so that he can finally have his trial? Send a post owl. Or a messenger patronus. Or a house elf.

First task of the Triwiz? He tried it with fourth year spells, then second year, then first year. He solved it multiple times, which made the other champions facepalm.

Of course, the main barrier for entry is the whole cliche "I was acting like a Gryffindor all along! Hyuk hyuk hyuck!!!1OneJuan"

That fic's theory for the killing curse was pretty unique too. The AK is just a super-obliviate. It effects even the autonomic nervous system, so the body instantly shuts off since it doesn't "know" how to run automatically.

** Just got finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12805587/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Old-Friend]] Pretty good. Sweet justice is meted out to evil!Dumbledore, the Dursely's, Umbridge, Voldy and other wizarding uber-jerks. Then Harry becomes strong, confident, blah, blah and goes on to do great things and have a wonderful life upholding The Greater Good (for realsies, this time) and striking fear in the hearts of various evil and slimy wizarding bureaucrats. I really enjoy this kind of stuff cuz it emphasizes and displays (in a good way) the positive aspects of humanity (and couldn't we all use a little more of that now?). In general well written. Not a lot of plot, but no complaints from me. Happy ending. Happy reader. 4 out of 5 stars.

** The Disapperances of Draco Malfoy is an incredibly written (almost reads like Rowling wrote it), fic about Draco taking Dumbeledore's offer of help and eventually joing the gang on their hunt for horcruxes. If anyone has a fic in this vein to recommend, I'm all ears.

Also been in the mood for a good plot rewrite. Basically just any fic that explores the ideas of "what would happen to the rest of the story if this one singular event changed". Any recs?

*** Speaking of the s-word, there's some neat fics/quests on questionablequesting. Don't know how much love the site gets around here.

Check out Black Humours if you do check it out. The MC is an OC(and male, shockingly). It's at 100k+ words. Oh, and Tainted Desire too, but I'm pretty sure that's also on ffn.

Hmm I'd never seen that site before. I don't really understand what it's about: some kind of online RPG? I'll take a look. The site seems very quiet though.

I'm not really that into S. any more, but looked at some as a result of a recent conversation about it with someone. There is some funny stuff out there though.

Added: I wasn't able to find either title you mentioned on QQ, but will look on ffn for the second one.

***** Nah, it's got separate boards for fics and quests. You also have to log in for the s-word stuff, which is why the site looks so barren, I imagine. The vast majority go there for the "questionable" content.

****** Oh lol. Ok I might take a look around, but most of the fanfic I see these days are about TV shows and manga that I'm completely unfamiliar with, so they don't appeal much to me. The main intersection is Harry Potter, so that's what I've been reading lately. Thanks ;)

** Under The Surface by Mellow_Cello (rating: M). Before going to Hogwarts, Harry was taken to an illegal facility where they experimented on him. Of course he returns just in time to go to Hogwarts. There's Slytherin! Harry, Drarry and Snape-as-a-mentor (eventually).

It's a great story, it took me ages to find a good angsty fic and I was so happy to stumble across this. This is one of the more realistic Snape-mentors-Harry-fics which doesn't paint Snape as a saint. It is still being written but the author regularly updates it.
