:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have read one ficlet at which Hermione's parents think that the Wizarding World brainwashed their daughter (They do not teach her to mess with memories, she learned out), and still loving Hermione and her kids, antagonise Hermione, and said a lot of time, Rose and Hugo should not go to Hogwarts.

I really like the likeness, and the fic.

I would like to know if there is other similar fics.
