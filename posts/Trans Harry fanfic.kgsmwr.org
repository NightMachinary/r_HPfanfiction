:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember a fanfic where a young Harry (before hogwarts) is on the street near 4 private drive and meets either Andromeda Tonks or Narcissa Malfoy and somewhere down the line Harry decides that they would rather wear a dress than something for boys.... I think it's called Raven or something like that

** I think I know the one you're talking about but I fear that it was deleted a while ago. Was Harry blind from an accident involving something acidic?
