A very long, probably at least 200K-300K words, romcom fic with no real plot covering years 6 and 7? No Voldemort, obviously, since that means plot. It's just Harry struggling through his NEWT years and also hijinks ensue. Would anybody actually read that, d'you think, or would I be wasting my time? I'd rather not invest any more time in the planning stages of it's doomed from the start, y'know?

(Also here's a boatload of random details I've worked out thus far, if anybody's interested:

- Voldemort was killed at Godric's Hollow when Lily sacrificed herself for Harry; the exact details of how and why this happened would be a mystery throughout the story

- Harry was still raised by the Dursleys who treated him as they did in canon: it was abusive, but they didn't exactly belt him for funsies. That said, his reaction to it is more severe than in canon; his base personality is pretty much the same, but he's much more closed off when he's around anyone he doesn't really trust, which is basically everyone

- Harry insists on being called either "Potter" by everyone but his closest friends. The title "boy who lived" is attached to "Harry Potter," and he seriously resents that strangers address him so familiarly. He has incredibly vague memories of his parents calling him "Harry," which is why it bothers him so much when strangers do it so casually

- some characters were sorted differently than in canon. I think that the sorting system as a whole is much more nuanced than most people treat it as being. Ron, for instance, is a Ravenclaw

- the Chamber of Secrets was still opened in Harry's second year, and Sirius still escaped just before his third. The exact details of how these encounters played out are obviously different from what happened in canon, but they're not really important, and the broad strokes are the same. Nothing in particular happened in his first year, and the Triwizard was held in his fourth, but he didn't participate since Voldemort didn't free Crouch Jr. from Crouch Sr. Sirius is still on the run from the Ministry and likely to stay that way, so Harry still goes to the Dursleys for the summer holidays

- every Hogwarts student is required to be in at least one non-sports club, but I haven't decided on what Harry's is. He's still the Gryffindor Seeker (but not the captain, that's Katie Bell) as well as being a prefect and on a dueling team (dueling is considered a sport, unfortunately for Harry), so he's pretty damn busy

- dueling teams are made up of three members who compete in either one-on-one or team matches throughout the year. Harry's on a team with the Goodwin twins (see below)

- Harry is a magical prodigy, not on the level of Dumbledore or Voldemort, but pretty darn close; he knows that Lily and James were great at Charms and Transfiguration respectively and works especially hard in those areas, but his best subject is still Defense

- Hogwarts has two teachers for every subject: one for years 1-5, and another for 6 and 7; the canon teachers take the NEWT classes while new, OC teachers take the lower years. Also probably there's around 100 students in a year, but most of them will never be relevant, obviously

- Harry doesn't own any clothes apart from his Hogwarts uniforms, which look a lot like your average catholic school uniforms if you remove the robes, so he can wear them in the muggle world without a problem

- Snape never took over for Slughorn as Potions professor, since there wasn't a second was looming on the horizon and he hates teaching and hates children; Harry's a much better brewer than in canon since his teacher doesn't hate him and doesn't tolerate other students sabotaging him

- Harry's two best friends are a pair of halfblood twins in Gryffindor in his year named Andrew and Andrea Goodwin. Their parents didn't know that they were having twins or what their kid's (kids') gender would be, so they decided on a name with a masculine and feminine variant. They kinda panicked when they were born, understandably. The twins' middle names are their parents given names, which makes addressing them even more confusing when they're at home

- I haven't decided on all of the prefects in Harry's year, but Malfoy and Parkinson aren't among them because why would you make a petty, bigoted, vindictive bully a prefect

Phew! I think that's everything I can think of right now. Writing all that out was surprisingly fun!)

Thing is, a lot of people have been so inundated by /terrible/ fanfics that changed his name that they'll encounter 'Harold' and go 'nope, I'm out'. They'll never read on to let you establish that it's part of this Harry's character.

Personally, I'm rather fond of using just the last name.

Honestly, just using that last name was my original intention, but the idea of giving Harry something that's super important to him and with a super easy solution (just use Harold!) and then having the entire population of wizarding Britain collectively lolnope him was too good to pass up.

** I feel like it would be a tough sell. I mean write the story you want to write and are passionate about. However you're asking if people would be interested in it and multiple people have told you no and why. So don't be surprised if it doesn't have a large readership.

You would need a very good hook or premise to get past the fact that Harry's friends are the Goodwins rather than Ron and Hermione.

Most people tend to read Harry Potter fan fiction because they love the characters and world. Replacing two of the main characters with OCs would turn a lot of people away. You could get away with replacing Ron and Hermione away with minor characters like Neville or Daphne Greengrass or Susan Bones because the names are familiar even if a character like Daphne might as well be OC. Next-Gen stories are popular (with some crowds) even if characters like Teddy Lupin or Lily Luna are entirely developed by the writer just because of the familiarity and attachment people already have for them.

The main draw for a slice of life story would be the characters. People love reading about their favourite characters doing daily things and feel good stories about Harry and friends being normal. But this story wouldn't be about any of the Hogwarts students we know and love, it would be about Harry and the Goodwins who we have no attachment to.

**** Idk all you'd have to do is have Ron be super loud about his rat going missing. Hell you could even have the Weasley twins make a comment. Up until the end of third year though, scanners was just a rat. It'd be like the classic Harry in another house fic where everyone thinks Sirius is insane and just assumes Harry's in gryffindor.

** You should write for the exercise and fun. I understand that is an incredible investment of time and effort and that obviously you want something in return in terms of response, but frankly...you cannot expect anything other than being respected for your choices when you put yourself out there.

You never know what they will like It or not. I have a story i was so involved with-my Idea being start out as a comedy and end up with a poignant Death scene- but people did not like It at all.

Was It bad? Yeah...but you Ger over It. Att the end of the day, the call is yours...but you cannot expect others Will but what you have to sell.

Now, that is Just a personal op, but i particularly dislike authors who keep asking for comments or holding chapters hostage. My only problem with your fic would be that- not Harry being Harold.

**** You'll need to carefully craft the story, especially the initial chapters, to draw in canon-esk readers. A long fic is a large time investment for the reader; the story plots/messages need to be intriguing since the fic will likely be read a few chapters at a time. But if your story message is strong, I'd encourage you to write for those who will read it, get something out of it, and never leave a review.

** You've obviously put a lot of thought into the idea already. I will say that you shouldn't write it only because you think people will read it: at 700,000+ words planned, you're going to lose steam and give up if you're not personally motivated to write it regardless of whether it gets read. This is true for every fic I think, but especially longer fics.

I see that there'll be a lot of "Idiot Balls" and forced teenage drama to move the story forward. Romcom is about relationships between either interesting heroes or characters we like. But still at some point a reader becomes tired from constant jumping of main character from boy/girl to girl/boy.

Also, if I did do this, it certainly wouldn't be in Ilvermorny, but that's just because I don't care about or respect Pottermore canon.

​

But please take into account that there're dozens of romcon and slice of life stories about teenagers. Unfortunately almost all of them are unreadable exactly because there's no plot and in order to create some drama and action the heroes have to do very stupid things.

After Nth story you are able to predict the used tropes with 0.99 accuracy.

** I like AUs and don't mind the name, nor OCs so long as they're well rounded people etc. and not the stereotypical self-insert. However there are a handful of other things that can break immersion or irritate me, one of which is Harry being extra extra powerful. Chosen one, Hallows, Positions, first/most powerful ____ in fifteen hundred years etc. Doesn't he have enough shiny things to be getting on with? Being that powerful robs the story of any tension, because he's never going to lose. He rarely does in fanfiction, but at least there can be minor losses enough to make the struggle believable. On the other hand, you have an actual canon prodigy left rotting under the Imperius curse, unused? I'd have personally found the story far more interesting if he were free and an average Harry had to fight creatively to beat him.

I'm honestly not seeing Ron as a Ravenclaw, either. He has little to no interest in knowledge or academics and I don't recall any real hint of creativity. He's a half decent chess player, but that's about it. If not Gryffindor, I could see him as either of the others, though. He has ambition, as evidenced by the Mirror of Erised, and he hates injustice - when it affects him or his friends, at least. He is fairly lazy though, so if anything I would probably lean toward Slytherin, if not for his own prejudice against it.

I also agree that it needs a plot, or at least a general direction. If people are going to put time into reading that many words, there really needs to be some kind of payoff at the end.
