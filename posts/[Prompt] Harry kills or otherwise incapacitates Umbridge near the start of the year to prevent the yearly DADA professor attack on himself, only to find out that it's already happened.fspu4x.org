"That's cheating!" Harry exclaimed.

​

Hermione sighed and put down her book. "What's cheating?"

​

"Umbridge was responsible for the dementor attack"

​

"And?"

​

"She tried to kill me before Halloween. That's cheating. She didn't even have the good grace to wait until term had started."


** Well you also cheated Harry. You have to wait till the end of term comes to kill the DADA professor and you did not wait.

**** There was one, it was called linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game). It did not end with minmaxing and becoming a god, because Harry wasn't a gamer in this story and thus doesn't know "the strats". Sadly abandoned though.
