I'm looking for fics where Harry differs from canon, (sorted into a different house, is nerdy, gay, transgender, different talents) but the catch is I want Sirius to be around to realize that Harry is not his father, other characters as well but there needs to be a scene with Sirius realizing that Harry is not a younger James. I prefer completed fics but I'll read anything that's well written and I DON'T want any Draco/Harry or Harry paired with anyone old (Snape, Voldemort, Lucius, Sirius, Remus, ect.).


** This mostly meets your expectations. Read the first few chapters before calling it quits, though.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

*** A guy on the HPFF IRC Channel says this is one of the best slash stories ever written and he knows his slashfics. Slash is not my particular cup of tea but I'll probably read it at some point.

**** Its an absolutely amazing story. The slash isn't overbearing, and it has a realistic romance. I adore the book.

** linkffn(for love of magic)

In this Harry is more self-interested and intelligent. Sirius is definitely around to notice how different Harry is than either of his parents.

linkffn(The house of potter rebuilt)

Also a serious and intelligent Harry (I kinda like those). This Harry is more altruistic, but doesn't wear his heart or his intentions on his sleeve. Sirius is also around a bit in this one.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
