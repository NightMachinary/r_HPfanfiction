** I'd love being a herbologist, honestly. Working with all kind of weird plants who -since they're magical- are kinda like pets. That is going from the assumption that there are a LOT more magical and active/exciting plants than mentioned in canon. And to go on long hikes in search of these plants. I'd love magical beasts too, but I'm too much of a coward to face or deal with something unfriendly. And most magical beasts are anything but friendly.

If not that, some sort of enchanter to make all kinds of weird and cool stuff that makes your life easier. The kinds of job that allow you to build your own little magical world with all the stuff you imagined as a kid.

** I'd love to be a researcher or inventor. A bit of Dumbledore's deep understanding of magic and a bit of the Twin's craziness and skill with creating enchanted items and I could invent a ton of useful things.

Take the drawing and scanning logic enchantments of the marauder's map, add the text input method used in Riddle's diary and the connectivity of Hermione's DA galleons and I could probably make a parchment that works like a computer with wizardnet and w-mail capability.

Take the enchantments on Arthur's car and the Knight Bus, add rocket engines enchanted to run without fuel, a navigation wizard computer and some spatial distortion magic borrowed from bigger-on-the-inside trunks and I could probably make a warp-capable spaceship.

Take some clothes, enchant them to transfigure themselves into indestructible metal when needed, add rockets, a wizard painting of an AI and some strength enhancing enchantments and I'd have a functional Iron Man armor that I could sell to the aurors for dark wizard hunting.

Or how about a cloak with levitation enchantments that responds to a thought? Strange enough?

I'd basically be The Hacksmith, but magical.

** I'd love to be an Unspeakable. I'm naturally introverted and that sort of working environment would suit me perfectly. That and I would be able to research obscure and dangerous magic while wearing that awesome grey robe that hides my identity. Just the thought that I knew more than the average wizard, and even the Minister of Magic, Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump himself/herself would give me a huge thrill.

Naturally I would try to work on projects that are dangerous, but not mortally so. Since magic can literally regrow bones, anything that doesn't kill outright should be fine!
