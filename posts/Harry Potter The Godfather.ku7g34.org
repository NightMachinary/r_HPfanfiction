The Order of the Phoenix and the Death Eaters are both illegal organizations and are run like mafias. For example, Lucius Malfoy disappears and Voldemort receives a Nate saying “Lucius sleeps with the fishes” and a few days later the Order receives a package containing Remus Lupin's head during a meeting.

** Darker Death Eaters are what I want. I get that the Harry Potter canon books were made for children, but now as an adult, I love the darker stuff occasionally.

**** I just meant doing more than they did in canon, that's all. They don't necessarily have to kill to be effective.

***** What were you thinking than. I have seen plenty of stories where they try they to make “darker” death eaters and it always comes across as forced, because Nazi Germany was fucked up, and that's what they're painfully clear reference to. So if you had to go about making them “darker” however you define that. How would you do so? And do you think you would have to sacrifice the political ideology that underpins the Death Eaters actions?

** Thomas Riddle, the son of Voldemort, was on a date with his girlfriend, Isabelle Parkinson.

"Yeah, I know Lucius Malfoy pretty well. My father helped him a lot, years ago. One time, he and Narcissa Black wanted to marry each other, but her father didn't want that. So my father went with Fenrir Greyback and told her father that either his mauled body or his signature would be on the marriage contract. That's a true story. But I'm not planning to join him in the family business. I'm not like my father."

** It'd take a bit of a reworking of the central conflict of the setting.

In /The Godfather/ most of the violence is "just business"---pursuit of money and security. On the other hand, in canon both OotP and the DEs are driven by /ideology/. Take that away, and what distinguishes OotP from the DEs except for having different dons and preferred colour scheme?
