Does anyone else roll their eyes when they run into yet another fic of overpowered Harry? It's overwhelmingly in Dark!Harry stories too. I'm no stranger to him being more capable of doing stronger magic but would it kill people to keep his personality relatively intact? Even when he's a dark wizard or placed in a very AU setup, he should still be recognizable as Harry Potter. After a point, I feel like I'm reading about someone's thinly veiled power fantasy OC who just happens to be named Harry Potter.


** Poor pacing skills.

** Good cases: The villain is even more insanely powerful

Bad cases: Bad pacing and living out power fantasies.

*** I feel like universal power inflation is even worse. You end up with everyone having the same relative power so you've essentially ruined the tone of the magic system just to get to the same place as you were originally.

**** I'm not talking about an universal power-increase. I talk about a protagonist (Harry) who has to face something even more terrifying than a Voldemort on steroids and "powers up" to meet that threats level.

If its universal, I agree... thats just not doing anything. But if you use it to emphasize some characters then it has potential for something good. Unfortunately I don't think I've ever read something like this.

**** If you beef up both the protagonist and the antagonist while leaving minor characters unchanged you can get a power fantasy that still maintains tension and conflict.

*** I would say most Hollywood heroes won because of luck and some willpower. This has become a boring and nauseating cliche to me.

HP is not even that guilty in this regard, since Voldemort got a few lucky breaks as well: Wormtail escaping and Dumbledore putting that Ring on.

** Agreed on the steep power climb, but I don't get the objection to changing Harry's personality with time. If you want to make wizard Jesus a Dark wizard, you kinda have to change him. Trick is giving him the right reasons to change.

*** I agree, changing him isn't necessarily bad though I prefer to have the story follow a logical progression of changes in personality rather then overnight deciding to use the killing curse. It's a case of bad writers tackling a trope that they don't know how to treat right.

**** Since he was trying to use the Cruciatus in canon at least twice, there's not really much needed to make him willing to use the killing curse.

***** Right, you do have a point. I think it wouldn't be the most challenging thing to make Harry willing to cast such a spell. The real challenge in making believable is getting him to go against the people he loves if he's going dark. This is where I see a lot of writers just take the lazy way out and endlessly character bash if they're attempting to stand against Harry going dark.

** I'm not really worried about the overpowered element because I think a lot of writers and readers want to see epic magical battles with massive transfigurations and elemental spells. It annoys me when Harry becomes overpowered and all his duels turn into the villain casting repeated killing curses while he just fires overpowered stunners over and over.
