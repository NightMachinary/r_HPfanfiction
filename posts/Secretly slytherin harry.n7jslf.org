I'm looking for fics where Harry is secretly friends with slytherins and/or is considering an “honorary” slytherin. I've read only a few fics like this and would love some more.


** You said you'd read some, can you link them? I'm interested

** One of the Harry's in linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12979337/1/]]) is a secret slytherin, though admittedly he's encouraged by actual Slytherin Harry

That's all I can think of right now

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.

*** if we're going along the same lines here, 'the many faces of Harry Potter' has almost the exact same 'encouraged by actual slytherin harry' line... some ron-bashing thou

it's also by FalconLux and if you've read any of their works they are NOTORIOUS for writing good but incomplete stuff. still worth it thou, and someone else continued it

**** Rad. The one I linked has little to no Ron bashing I'm pretty sure, which was quite refreshing. I'm not super anti-bash though so I'll be taking a look at your one
