I'm looking for fics that are unsettling, either because of content or the way it's written. Subtle horror. Mindscrews.

Some examples:

"Blackpool" linkao3(14760663) is from the POV of someone who constantly has his memories altered, so what starts out as what could be continuity errors, the reader slowly comes to realize that it's actually the perspective of very unreliable narrator. Add that with the drowning motif and it becomes an incredibly unnerving reading experience.

"Still Life with Skull" linkao3(13719279) and "Styx" linkao3(18456680) respectively use dementors and boggarts to create a very dream experience. It's difficult to tell what's real and it's disorienting in an interesting way.

Or "Mandragora" linkfnn(7864670) with how horrifyingly human the mandrake roots are.

Even something like "The Very Secret Diary" linkao3(2345300) which is unsettling bc of adult fear.

  What if you had the chance to travel back in time and change just one event in your life? What would it be?For Harry Potter there is no question; he would undo the events of Halloween 1980, when the Dark Lord Voldemort took the lives of his parents, both heroic fighters for the light side. Ever since he was a kid, Harry has dreamed of being able to stop the tragedy of that fateful day.Now Harry may get exactly what he wished for...... and much more than he bargained for.

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

** I'd recommend linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian) which features (in the first chapter no less) Harry wearing a man's freshly removed and still bloody skin. It also has some of the coolest magic I've seen in fanfiction when Harry does necromancy.

Also linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin) which is much less visceral, but the tone is certainly unsettling. It's an amazing fic that you only want to read once.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be even more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
