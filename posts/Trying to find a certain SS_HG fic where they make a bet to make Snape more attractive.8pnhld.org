If I'm remembering it correctly, Hermione may have become a teacher at Hogwarts, and she and Snape struck up a bet to try to make him more attractive and see what witches noticed. (There was possibly a part where they did the same with her?) But naturally she falls for him during the transformation.


** I have one in mind that might be it - on ashwinder - though for the life of me I can't find it now. It wasn't a bet though, more a sort of pact that they would both work to become more attractive to the opposite sex.

Brief summary: Hermione and Snape overheard Ron and Harry belittling her appearance. Snape suggested a mutual makeover - new outfits, hairstyles, etc. They wore glamours while working on their transformations so that they could surprise everyone by suddenly looking fabulous - and sprung their new improved selves on everyone at the opening feast. Plot points included a trip to a hair stylist who'd done Hermione's hair when she was a bridesmaid once, and a trip to Italy where Snape's cousins ran a tailoring firm and a beauty parlour (most conveniently).

If you think that's it, I can have more of a hunt around the authors on my favourites list.

** Is it the one where Neville came back to school hunked out and Snape and Hermione end up working together to make over Snape so he could get some attention (and a side of revenge) as well? They knew they did a good job when the girls were fighting over pictures of Neville and Snape... There's a few makeover fics out there because a challenge years back, but I'm trying to find the one I'm thinking of.

ETA: The group came back post war, so it might have been a late 7th year/8th year type of thing.
