Often I find myself reading a new fanfiction and all the characters are doing is running around shouting the same couple of spells. Its getting old. Are there fanfictions like Magicks of the Arcane, in which magic is more esoteric? Anything is welcome!

**** I'd also dive into linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone), also by enembee. It's a bit less esoteric, but Harry learns mostly by trial and error, and also pulls out some old school herbology. I personally believe it is better than Conloadh's Song and By the Divining Light.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** linkffn(The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope)

Although it is a semi-crossover (with elements from Fate/StayNight and Naruto), it does expand upon HP magic massively outside of what either of those two add. And while the plot might not be the best, I still enjoyed it.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it. It only made sense that she would fall for a prankster, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. Somehow, she was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived.
