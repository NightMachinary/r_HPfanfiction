Where Snape didn't die in the shrieking shack, where he did get a hold of Harry to tell him in Dumbledore's office the truth about why he was protecting harry, why he killed Dumbledore and that he was a horcrux.

Would be really interested to read some of these, I know someone must have written something like this

*** But it did all make sense. The doe and the sword, why Harry had the connection he did with Voldemort, the Parseltongue ability.

But I do wish Dumbledore's portrait just told him the memory was real.

**** Why didn't Dumbledore just gift them a portrait of themselves anyway?

***** Why didn't Dumbledore just tell them a lot of things they had to figure out on their own? He's just... not as smart as people think.

****** That was meant to say "a portrait of himself" but you probably figured that out.

Mostly just plot reasons I guess.

** Snape attempts to talk to Harry after the confrontation with the Carrows - he's under the Invisibility Cloak with McGonagall

He knows Harry is there and says something like Really Minerva, I insist that you bring Potter to me. We all think he's going to hand him over to Voldemort but obviously he wants to tell him the truth with the portrait as backup

She turns on Snape, they duel and he escapes
