Any stories where a character like Susan enlists the help of her friends/housemates to try to set her up with Harry, only for him to become more and more irritated/alienated by their borderline obsessive attempts at matchmaking?

I came across a few story ideas/snippets where Harry rejects a stunned Susan after she tries to hit on him/ask him out, citing that although he forgave them, he didn't forget how they acted in prior years, and it kinda gave me the bug to read similar setups.
