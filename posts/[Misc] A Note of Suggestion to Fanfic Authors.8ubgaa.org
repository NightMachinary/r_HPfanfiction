** A few people here are saying 'you need to learn how to cope better', and that seems a bit unfair.

For many people, reading fanfiction is a very different experience than reading normal, published fiction. I would think that everyone on this sub reads, and loves, both kinds.

Some people want the experience of reading fanfiction to be very similar to their experience of reading normal fiction, with no spoilers, enjoying the ride and seeing where things go.

But many fanfic readers expect their fanfic-reading experience to be very different than the experience of reading typical fiction. For some people, it's a comfort thing, reading about characters they already know/love and shipping people that they deeply would've preferred to get together or continuing a ship that did happen in canon. Self-care type comfort. As in, 'I'm reading this because I'm going through a really hard time and I need fanfic to make me feel better in a way that ordinary fiction can't.'

For writers to say, 'This is how storytelling works!' is understandable, but it's a clear sign that many fanfic writers don't understand a major contingent of fanfic readers. I'm not saying it should change how we write, but it should certainly affect how we respond to readers asking us honest questions.

** u/TE7:

  The reason I ask this of authors is because today I was left with a full blown panic attack because an author purposely misled me when I asked them whether or not a certain type of content would be in the story.

Maybe you should go outside and enjoy the weather and reflect upon how fanfiction stories are causing panic attacks.

I will pretty much always troll readers that ask me if my story will have X Y or Z because the vast majority of time it's clear they haven't bothered to read the story. Given that no one has asked me lately I think I'm in the clear.

That being said. Every story I've ever written, has had people PM me and ask if it will be Harry/Ginny or Harry/Hermione. This includes Vitam Paramus, where Ginny and Hermione are dead. I could respond no. But that's no fun.

I find messages asking me about what will be in a story to be utterly annoying at best and will probably troll or flat out lie about it because frankly they don't deserve the truth. Hell, even when I tell the truth (Harry Potter and Emily Price will never, ever, be a thing) people ignore it anyway.

**** As a write I can tell you that if you were to send me that exact message above I would 100% assume you were making every bit of it up. I would likely ignore it, but if I was in a bad mood I'd probably respond with something trollish.

The fact of the matter is I have never had a good experience with people wanting to know future content of a story while it is in progress. The ones that actually care aren't going to ask for spoilers. The rest are likely batshit ship-obsessed assholes that don't deserve the time of day.

I have literally been threatened, flamed, and insulted by people who start out with an innocent message like that who didn't like my response. Sure, eventually you stop caring about the reviews that tell you that you should be raped and killed because Daphne kissed someone not named Harry, or that you're a failure of a human being because Fleur wasn't soul bonded to Harry, but the initial reaction to reading those messages never really changes.

Every time someone has asked for spoilers and I've actually given them, they've tried to guilt me into doing something different. And often for asinine reasons.

So again, you're trying to guilt an author into feeling bad because you feel bad when fictional characters aren't paired properly have sex. Do you want to keep reading fanfiction? Because this is how you get fanfiction authors to stop writing.

** Could you give specifics? I'm not doubting your world but I'm having trouble figuring out what sort of lie vs. what actually happen could have given you an actual, honest-to-Merlin panic attack.

***** I literally wrote them a message explaining my problems and asking them if there would be any of that in the fic. No, I didn't expect them to tell me, or even respond to the message. I hoped they might so that I could know whether or not I could feel comfortable safely reading the fic. They purposely responded with a lie. They didn't have to do that. That is where they went wrong.

** So, I think this heavily depends on what is being asked.

If someone asks me if there will be rape, murder, incest, abuse or other triggering events in a story, I think it's probably kind to warn them not to read on.

If they're asking whether Harry is going to get with Ginny or Hermione or whether Dumbledore is a time-travelling Ron then no, that's just spoilers.

*** For the former it depends. If it's a scenario where you /should reasonably expect/ any of that to occur, then its unnecessary. If it's a torture fic it should be common sense that these sorts of things are going to happen.

**** Ok sure - but then you've had a heads up already. To trigger a full blown panic attack I'd assume it was a surprise.

** I'm assuming this was about rape? If so, I understand because I also avoid stories with rape and sexual assault and I'm upset if it's suddenly sprung on me. There should be a warning for stuff like that.

If it's for something you wouldn't commonly expect a warning for, or it was something mentioned in passing, you may need to recognise your own sensitivities and work out how you can cope in the future.

Without further details no one can really say.
