*** Sorry, She's trying to find it, but we will keep trying. I'll let you read it when we do though. Fair warning, though, the first line is "Harry Potter did not know he was transferred into Slytherin". And it was called "Harry Potter and the Deathly Black Hole"

My god, I still cringe whenever I think about the title.

** Well, it's not that suprising. Every trope and cliche have it's source /somewhere/. With most of tropes, good or bad, there is small evidence in canon supporting it (and contradicting, but some writers ignore it). You just invented it in the same manner as other authors, except without reading other ff.
