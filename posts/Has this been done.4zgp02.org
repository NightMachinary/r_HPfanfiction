A Jason Borne style amnesia mystery with a metamorphmagus protagonist who has no clue as to who they are and what the crap is going on but still can kick ass. Maybe Tonks if one would wanna shoe horn a political thriller into the events of the books. It's a cool idea but I have no time for something like this (Damn real life responsibilities.) Anyone wanna adopt it or some such?

*** Right? I always thought to many readers get bogged down in cannon while they have a whole sandbox to play with. Great things have happened from staying at hogwarts but the concept of the world of magic as a tool for story telling could be really cool. Just my two knuts.

** Tonks as Bourne sounds really cool with a lot of potential

** I would love to read this! I love the Bourne stories, and a "who am I?" combined with a "OMF what do I really look like" sounds like quite the literary ride...

*** To be fair, "Who am I?" with Tonks sounds even better)))

** Hm. I think a non-metamorphmagus might work better. (More of a chance to find out who you are.)

**** I like the "Trust me, we were lovers/best friends/honorable enemies before you disappeared" scenes.

On the other hand, given how rare metamorphmagi are, finding out who you are would be rather easy I think.

If I wrote something like that, I'd pick someone who had undergone plastic muggle surgery, then lost the memories.
