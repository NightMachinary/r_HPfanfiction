Hey guys,

In light of the whole hullabaloo after a black actress was cast as Hermione in the upcoming /Cursed Child/ play, I got to thinking that I've never read much fanfiction about experiences that POC have about being POC in the wizarding world. Like, is racism not an issue at all? Was it once, but the wizarding world addressed it? We see Cho, Angelina, Lee, Kingsley, Blaise, and the Patil twins - when non white wizards first came to the British wizarding world did they face the issues that non white muggles faced in the muggle world? Was there anti Semitism or Islamophobia or anti Eastern European sentiment? Or was the only prejudice blood related and it didn't matter where you were from as long as you could claim magical lineage?

I'd love to read a well written, completed fic where these sorts of thoughts are somewhere in the plot. Even if it's just a muggleborn being surprised at the lack of racial/religious prejudice.

Lacking that, even a fic where the main character is a POC would be welcome!


** Magicals don't care about skin colors.

The racism in magical world is based on blood status.

But I think there were country/nation based antagonisms, such as the war against Grindelwald.

*** I'm thinking out loud here, but I can't imagine that no wizards or witches are prejudiced or discriminatory based on race. Considering how outdated and bigoted they are in terms of blood, I would imagine that there would be some cross over in terms of other types of prejudice.

Maybe not overt racism - because there's probably so few wizards and witches in the whole world that they must have to cooperate across nations in order to survive. But imagine anti immigrant prejudice - for example, if whole lots of Polish wizards are moving into Hogsmeade and taking up jobs. Or Syrian wizards are fleeing the war into Europe.

#+end_quote

Apparently not. They have a different flavour of discrimination in the Pureblood ideology. Apples and oranges. There's a pattern in canon of subverted expectations. Not all of Voldemort's followers are Slytherins, not all of the Purebloods have light skin, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Was it once, but the wizarding world addressed it?
#+end_quote

Maybe it once was, but it isn't anymore. There isn't any evidence either way.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

This is a paraphrased repeat of your last question, so there is no way of knowing for sure.

#+begin_quote
  Was there anti Semitism or Islamophobia or anti Eastern European sentiment?
#+end_quote

Absolutely... in Muggle culture. Wizards have a distinct culture, so I'd say no.

#+begin_quote
  Or was the only prejudice blood related and it didn't matter where you were from as long as you could claim magical lineage?
#+end_quote

Yes, but this could be seen as an allegory for a host of social ills. There's no need to have every single potential form of discrimination covered in a children's fantasy series.

While your request is more broad than the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3xpjmu/lf_a_fic_that_features_blackhermione/][last person to ask]], the answer is the same: if there are any stories exploring the experiences of minority characters in the Harry Potter universe with Muggle preconceived notions, +none of us have read them.+

But that's what makes fanfiction so great: there's absolutely no reason why this can't be a thing. You can make one yourself and share it with us. If your writing is imaginative, your plots moving, and your characters interesting then others will certainly appreciate your efforts. However I'd caution against believing that a character's skin colour or racial identity alone will make them any more or less interesting to the reader. Mary-Sues from any background will be burned in effigy and author tract tends to be mocked more often than appreciated.

*** It's very strange that none of us can think of many recs. I totally understand that the dominant prejudice in HP is blood based, but considering how many prejudices people face in day to day life, and that fanfic often reflects the struggles of writers in their own lives, it's surprising that there isn't more fanfic about being a POC. I've read great fics that are about homophobia and sexism in the wizarding world, although there's not much evidence of either of those in canon. So it's surprising there's not many fics which take on, for example, Dean being called names when he visits his muggle cousins, or a time travel fic that goes back to times of slavery, or goes with Cho as she tries to reconnect with her Chinese magical heritage, or a little muggleborn girl in hijab showing up to go to school with Rose Weasley.

I'm not a writer unfortunately, just a reader of fanfic.

Of course someone's racial identity doesn't make anyone interesting alone. But if someone has had unique experiences /because/ of their racial or ethnic or even religious identity, then that becomes one more interesting and fascinating facet of their character. And if sometimes racial identity has shaped huge aspects of their life, then it becomes even more interesting to delve into. Imagine a fic of apartheid South Africa and being a muggleborn and going to the only magical, integrated school. How could the conflicts and prejudices of the muggle world not bleed into the magical one?

** Racism is apparently more absurd than mpreg in this subreddit, so unfortunately nearly no one is actually answering your perfectly valid request. I don't know any stories that deal with racism - I did see the topic of anti-Eastern European sentiment pop up recently, in relation to the story's treatment of Krum, Durmstrang, and Grindelwald - but I'll have to do a little digging for that.

I do know some stories with main character POCs that touch upon their culture:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=248128][Chai]] - abandoned but lots of fun, a wedding romcom love triangle featuring the Patil twins and Roger Davies.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=281651][All Over Again]] - post-war Cho Chang (I don't remember if this specific story touches upon her culture, but I know some of the author's stories do).

And I have a next gen heist-comedy with 3/5 of the main ensemble as PoCs (Fred II, Cho Chang's daughter, Padma Patil's daughter), [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][And Capers Ensue]].

I do know of another fic that deals with anti-Semitism, but it's quite old and was abandoned so I'd rather not reccommend it. It's interesting that so many of the fics regarding POC focus on East Asian or Jewish culture - does anyone know of any that explore others?

**** And ten minutes after I posted, someone downvoted both of us - you know, the only relevant commenters in this thread :p I mean, the other threads were depressing enough, but I don't have the energy for internet arguments after the last time. I'll just pop in for poor threads like these.

I've found that many MANY of my readers and fellow authors are of Indian, East Asian and South East Asian descent--actually more often than not! I know from their review names and some mention it (seeing a Chinese and/or Indian character like them on the banner is what drew them to my fic; hey, representation /is/ that scarce!). So that's probably some of the reason for the number of fics that focus on Asian characters--and the availability of Cho and the Patil twins as canon characters. A story set with original characters or in an entirely different culture is a larger beast since it'd pretty much be all-original--much harder to write and build an audience. I've seen plenty of little paragraph-long headcanons and ficlets related to other cultures, but not a full novel.

Agreed - I'd love to explore some of the other wizarding worlds hinted at by Rowling, especially the African school that invites students through dreams, but as a white Brit I don't really feel comfortable doing that in case I end up writing some cringey noble savage/exoticism type thing. The huge Asian fanbase provides plenty though, I just haven't explored much yet!

I'll definitely be checking your recs. :)

***** there is a fic that follows anthony goldstein as if he was an ultra-orthodox jew from golders green, (jewish neighborhood of london) it goes really in depth in terms of jewish culture (to the point that it needs a really long glossary at the end of each chapter to translate all the yeshivish terms) but it does a gpood job of showing how some one who came from such an insular world would deal with hogwarts and the ignorance coming from both worlds.

right now it's still in his first year and barely mentions what the trio are upto which is a little boring for me as i'd like to see how this chareidi kid ends up a part of dumbledores army and such. i'll look for the link.

The OP could have used the search function to find other threads on the exact same topic, which would have resulting in them discovering an [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Person%20of%20Color%20Hermione%20Granger/works][AO3 tag]] which might have led them to a suitable fic. Please don't assume that someone downvotes just because they're opposed to a new idea.

***** Oh come on, we see repeated topics and requests all the time that don't get downvoted this much. AFAIK, the last topic on this focused on Hermione specifically, and I just did a search for 'person of color' which brought up this thread and one irrelevant thread, searching 'race' brought up lots of irrelevant threads asking for stuff on magical races like goblins and merpeople, 'culture' was mostly about British culture, but had one relevant thread from 16 days ago.

Besides, why not politely encourage use of the search function? I'm really not bothered by imaginary internet points, but people haven't exactly been helpful.

This probably has to do with most people being into HP because they want to experience a magical world. There are many books that deal with racism, so they go there if they want to read about real-life racism.

*** I don't think that's necessarily true - HP fanfiction deals with heartbreak, homophobia, abuse, war, trauma, bullying, rape, prejudice and many other real world social ills. Racism is no different. And since asking this question I'm happy that I have read fics that deal with it. Fanfiction is just a reflection of the variety of fanfic authors there are, and all of the topics that fascinate them. Racism included :)

**** Yes, but we want to see all of these from the point of view of the wizarding world. Magical bullying involves cursing people in hallways. Magical rape might involve love potion, memory charms, or the imperius. We've seen magical war throughout books 5-7.

Magical racism, again, is different in that its against non-human intelligent creatures, or muggles (and by extension, mudbloods).
