Born fruit from a discussion in a recent thread where Harry rejects Hermione, does anyone know of any stories where Harry, for some reason or another (like forgiving but not forgetting Fourth year, seeing how they treated previous boyfriends, et cetera), friendzones a girl after they try hitting on him?

I know of two (but I can't remember their titles) where Susan is Zoned in one, and Hermione suffers from unrequited love as Harry begins getting serious with a refreshingly normal Daphne Greengrass.

I expect, due to the sheer amount of fics out there and the nature of their individual relationships to Harry, that Ginny and Hermione would likely be the top candidates for this search: different girls would be better.

Thanks for any help you could give!

--Harry in most fics where more than one girl is interested in him.

*** Oh god, this! Love triangles and unrequited love are great elements in fiction, like any other such as vengeance, hatred, bitterness, or love/self-sacrifice. The drama, the character interactions, dialogue, and effects on a plot? Great stuff. In Harry Potter fanfiction, though? "lol nope harem or nothing," an author/reviewer typed with one hand. "kek."

**** See, I'd argue the love triangles thing. I tend to find them boring and trite.

But yeah, there are a lot of harems that are stupid. I don't actually mind polyamory, I know a few people iRL who have been in such relationships for over a decade. But so many harems end up being 'Harry mostly with one girl and the others are there for titillation' which is dumb as hell.

***** They're great if they're written well... but I've hardly, if ever, seen them in HPFF: it's all about harems. sigh A realistic harem story would be... unpleasant, given the way girls scheme and plot even against their own friends. It would not be a fun time for Harry, that's for sure.

****** Like I've said, I've seen it done iRL.

Issue is a lot of harems just make it about titillation.
