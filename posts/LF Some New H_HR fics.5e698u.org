So I've already read most of the "Harmony classics", so to speak, and now I'm on the market for some new (published in the last year or so) fics.

Any recs?

P.s.: already read all of Starfox5's works.

** If you take Harry/Multi with Hermione, then:

*The Stars Alone*, linkffn(12040341): Harry/Hermione/Luna were exiled from the Earth through Stargate, and they began kicking Goa'uld's asses across the galaxy.

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771): the romantic Trio Harry/Hermione/Ron had to face zombie battleship BismarckMort. Fortunately, HMS Hood also returned to face her nemesis one more time. Excellent fleet actions and flashbacks about the Trio.

*Harry and The Alteran Gift*, linkffn(10211577): another HP/SG-1 crossover. The three Deathly Hallows played a big role. I'm only a few chapters into it, the writing is not the best, but the plot is entertaining.

  This is an AU cross-over from Harry Potter with Stargate SG1. This story starts near the end of the final battle at Hogwarts and the vanquishing of Voldemort-HP is all AU from there. Stargate Atlantis never happens, HP preempts it. Other SG1 events happen per canon unless HP and company preempt it. Pairings: Harry/Ginny/Hermione. M for safety.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
