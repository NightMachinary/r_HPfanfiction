TL;DR: Instead of getting Angra Mainyu as Avenger, the Von Einzberns got Sirius Black. He still gets eliminated pretty quickly and "tainting" the Grail, but since he's a prankster this has rather different effects...

  "You're giving me a stick." Jubstacheit von Einzbern, known more colloquially as "Acht", glanced impassively between the polished stick of dogwood and the visitor offering it to him.

  "Not just a stick," scolded Zelretch, "a /magic wand/." At his hosts's unimpressed look, he continued. "I picked it up through the Kaleidoscope and thought it could be a good catalyst for summoning a Servant, something I've noticed the von Einzberns haven't done yet this time around."

  "We cannot," Acht replied flatly. "Seven Servants have already been summoned."

  "They have?!" Zelrecht gasped in blatantly insincere shock. "Well, keep it anyway." He turned to leave, waving airily. "I'm sure you'll find /some/ use for it..."

  The irregular summoning ritual completed with a flash of light and a plume of smoke. When visibility returned, it revealed a tall, lean man in tattered robes clutching the so-called "magic wand" that had indeed served as a catalyst. He had shoulder-length black hair, grey eyes, a pale complexion and aristocratic features made somewhat less impressive by his gaunt, somewhat emaciated state and his half-mad expression. "Servant Avenger - or maybe /Marauder/ - has answered your summons," he stated with a posh British accent before adopting a manic grin, "and I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."

  In his chambers at Clock Tower, Zelretch smiled to himself and whispered, "Mischief Managed."

  *Sixty Years Later:*

  The smoke from the summoning cleared, revealing a young man of no more than twenty, though his bespectacled green eyes looked far older. A jagged scar in the shape of a lightning bolt peeked out from behind the fringe of his messy black hair. "/Servant/ Caster has answered your summons," he said, conveying an impressive amount of disgust at the first word, "and if you want me to call you Master it's going to cost you a Command Seal. I should probably warn you, last time I got dragged into a deadly magical tournament by enchanted drinkwear it didn't exactly end well..."

  "Kiritsugu, /darling/," Irisviel von Einzbern said with a beatific smile and a saccharine tone that spoke of pain and death in the immediate future if she was not appeased, "please explain to me why your Servant has appeared in nothing but a blue lace neglige√©?"

  "I was wondering that myself," the Magus Killer replied, keeping his eyes firmly fixed on his wife and not on the handsome blonde woman that somehow managed to look regal and dignified even in skimpy lingere, "can you shed any light on this Saber?"

  "I cannot," Arturia stated coldly as she called up her usual armored dress, "though I am thankful that, minimal as it was, my attire when summoned was at least tasteful and preserved my modesty, even if only barely."

  Tohsaka Tokiomi gazed in shock at the imperious golden-haired man in his summoning circle. "Servant Archer has answered your summons. I ask of thee," the King of Heroes ground out in a strained voice, "/WHY AM I NAKED?!/"

  Tokiomi decided /not/ to mention the fact that somehow someone had managed to write the word "PONCE" across his new Servant's forehead in what looked like permanent marker. The... anatomical illustration on his cheek was /definitely/ not going to be brought up.

  Lancer looked between his Master, who was sliding rapidly from surprise into rage, and the woman that was presumably the man's wife, who was staring hungrily at Lancer's... /other/ spear. "Well," he sighed, "this could have started better."

  "Yes, I'm your Master!" shouted a frantic Waver Velvet, "Now please, put on some clothing!"

  The bellowing laughter of his newly-summoned Rider servant did /not/ help his already frayed nerves.

  Kotomine Kirei gave the figures before him a bland smile. "I'm not sure why you're... /attired/ thus, but please refrain from such debauchery on Church property from now on."

  Matou Kariya stared at the hulking armored figure before him, wondering why he felt like some unknown power had taken pity on him...

Yep, instead of Angra Mainyu turning the Grail evil, Sirius Black has imbued it with a love of pranks and schadenfreude. Those poor, poor Magi...

As an explanation for the first prank of the Grail War, Sirius would most want to humiliate an arrogant prick like Gilgamesh. Harry got passed over for obvious reasons, Lancelot because Sirius figures that Kariya has already been through enough, and Arturia gets at least something to wear out of a combination of what chivalry Sirius possesses and a Briton's respect for King Arthur. She's still a good-looking woman, though, and with Irisviel watching the summoning the temptation was just too much for him to pass up.

Who summoned Harry? I don't know, except that it sure as hell isn't Ryuunosuke. No way would Sirius have picked him as a Master.

Overall, I'm just hoping somebody reads this and is inspired to write their own, more extensive version. I am nowhere near sufficiently well-versed in Fate lore to be able to actually write out a full fic.


** I can't write for shit, so I really hope someone writes this, because there is a lack of good HP/Fate crossovers.

*** To be fair, it looks like in that case it was his choice. Stripping because /he/ wants to is very different from /being/ stripped, especially to such an egomaniac. Compare Iskandar, who totally got the joke.
