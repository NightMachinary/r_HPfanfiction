**** Sadly yes! The author was really good and was scouted by an editor and recently published her 4th fantasy book... none of them translated yet though!

*** You know, I've actually read that one. I think the Slytherin where too easy on Hermione and Draco was a /word-I-am-not-allowed-to-say-anymore/ for a long while. It was sweet though, and made me smile. Thank you anyways.
