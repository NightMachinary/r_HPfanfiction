What if the contract was forged by the girl's parents? Maybe they just created a fake contract and bribed Gringotts (or select goblins) enough to have it treated as legit. Maybe they managed to steal a bit of blood from James and Lily's corpses while the DMLE was too busy with the chaos following Voldemort's fall, making the contract seem legally/magically binding.

Harry. Would. Be. /Pissed./

How dare they insult the memory of his parents like this? If they went the "stolen blood" route, how dare they desecrate his parents' bodies? How dare they try and take away one of his most important choices?

Cue Harry doing everything he can to both escape the contract and screw the people behind it. The daughter could be in on her parents' plot, an innocent victim like Harry, or anything in between. Romance could blossom between them as they bond over their shared circumstances, or they could become friends/allies, she could be just another enemy, or she could be heartbroken at the boy/man she's been told she would marry rejecting her. She could be almost as outraged as he is, and fully on board with his plans. She could play the innocent victim and throw her parents under the Knight Bus, possibly while romancing and marrying Harry.

I know there's that one fic whose title I can't recall in which the Greengrasses try to entrap Harry with a marriage contract, only for him and Luna to threaten to weaponize the contract's terms against Daphne, but that's the closest I know of to my idea.


** Not quite the same but The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie is similar. The ministry forces any purblood male over 15 or half bloods that are the last of their line to marry. The girls families are offered gold to entice them to sign their daughters up and they use magic to find the most compatible pairings. No one is really happy about it. Really good read as is most of Spookie's work

Can give any more details than in my original comment without spoilers other than there is a character death or 2

*** Didn't they use an artifact (like the Goblet of Fire) to get the best matches?

  One Shot. AU. A marriage contract. They want him to sign away his freedom and his future and his life on a girl who didn't even attend her best friend's funeral. Harry has other ideas.
