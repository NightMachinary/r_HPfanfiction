*Any Harry x Fleur story.*

Bonus points if it has one or more of these or is finished doesn't have to though.

- Harry goes to Beauxbatons. I mean other schools would probably want Harry in there ranks. it would look good for them if someone that famous chose to go there instead of Hogwarts. so I'm sure they would send an invite. Plus I could see Harry going since it's further away from The Dursleys.
- Harry is not clueless and blushing mess about girls, acts more mature and has confidence around girls.
- Fluer leaves Bill for Harry.
- Harry also becomes close to the rest of the Delacours.
- Harry takes Fleur to the Yulle Ball.
- Harry is the only Hogwarts student that can speak french so Fleur feels more comfortable with him in a new strange place because he can speak her first languge.
- Dumbledore is bad, trying to use Harry as a weapon, etc.
- Snape put in prison or dies. (I don't like Snape)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Harry is not clueless and blushing mess about girls, acts more mature and has confidence around girls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Harry can teleport like Nightcrawler or that movie Jumper or uses Apparition a lot. (Any pairing but no SLASH)*

The way I see it the difference between Apparition and the other forms of teleportation is Apparition needs a wand unless your super skilled which Nightcrawler of course does not. Apparition also has a range limit which the people in Jumper don't seem too they just seem to need a very good mental image or a physical picture. As the main character goes all over the world.

â€‹

Bonus points if it has one or more of these or is finished doesn't have to though.

- Harry looks like Nightcrawler. Blue, furry, tail, etc. As well as having the phsyical agility.
- If it's a crossover.
- If he is related to Nightcrawler in some way.
- Dumbledore is bad, trying to use Harry as a weapon, etc.
- Snape put in prison or dies. (I don't like Snape)

  It's been said that little things can change the world, and they can. But then, so can big things. This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic. Sometimes a skill gained by accident is all you really need to change the world.
