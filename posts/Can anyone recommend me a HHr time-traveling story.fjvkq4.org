Not necessarily Harry and Hermione travel back in time together, but just Harry potter going back in time to his younger body with the knowledge of the future and the story follows the cannon timeline closely something along these lines. And I would prefer the story not to be too out of character and not too much character bashing.


** You might want to post this on [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]]. I know some time travelling fics but none of them fit your description exactly. The people there might know more.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
