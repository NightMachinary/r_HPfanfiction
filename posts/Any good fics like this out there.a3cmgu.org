Okay so lately I've been really into finding some good, not cringe-worthy fics about Harry dealing with being abused (specifically by the Dursley's, but if you find something else that's really well written, feel free to rec it). As for the level of abuse, I'm not really picky, just put any TW on your recs if you can. Anything from strict canon to loose fanon works. Bonus points if it's completed or a WIP that's been updated in the last year lmao. Also feel free to rec me your own fics if they fit the criteria!

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur later on. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.

** Woah, i think i've got just whatcha need. Me and my friend's work. The names are altered tho. "Harry Potter and the Broom of Death" Story short: Harry Potter's beloved broom "Lightning" suddenly broke few days before the Quidditch match of Hohward. Dumbledr is sure that the broom will be fixed. Instead of his "Lightning" Harry is given an old "Torpedo-1" from the closet. The broom is soooooooo slow... When Harry was checking out it with Ronol Veasley, the broom suddenly made a backflip (Harry fell off), vibrated and flew away faster than 2 electronic "Lightnings". They try to find help from everyone who Harry trusts and knows but to no avail. Then Dumbledr remembers about the unknown mage Bordyak Booking, and the curse on every broom that comes from him... Also, i need time to translate it from Russian, but i have 1 chapter done if you'd like
