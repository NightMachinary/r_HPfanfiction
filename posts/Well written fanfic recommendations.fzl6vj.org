I read all kinds of fanfics, but there are few things I simply cannot tolerate. I hate it whenever the character is ridiculously super powered for no reasons, or something like "oh no s/he have such tragic background turned evil" blah blah blah. Gaining special "powers" because of some stupid reasons tires me out, and the latter just feels like a weak attempt to force out the nonexistant emotional sympathy. These are not my cup of tea.

That being said, I am in need of a well written piece of fanfiction, because this self isolation is killing me right now. Any genre or style of writing will do, as long as it has some degree of verisimilitude.

Thanks in advance!

** Cauterize is an incredible one-shot which makes me cry every time linkffn(4152700). I remember really liking The Changeling which is a Ginny-centric fic linkao3(189189). Also, I obviously have to link Antithesis linkffn(12021325). This is one of my all time fave fics. It's a little rough in the beginning, but it gets so good after. It's very grimdark and it gives you this ‚Äúthere's something very wrong here‚Äù vibe, which I love. It's kinda tropey with WBWL and Dark!Harry, but I think it's done so incredibly well. It has my fave characterization of Luna in any fic. 11/10 would rec

*** Three great fics. I will also add that Antithesis is entirely, unabashedly, a tragedy. It uses some tropes, but uses them /really damn/ well. It's also one of the most believable outcomes of a ‚ÄúVoldemort raises Harry‚Äù stories out there.

It may have made me ugly cry a few times.

*** Cauterize was amazing. I think it was one of my very first fanfic experience. As for The Changeling, it was on my to-read list for awhile. I don't really like the WBWL tropes, but I'll give it a try! I certainly don't mind if it is written well enough.

Thanks for thr rec!

***** From what what I can remember, in the end they had feelings for each other which went behind friendship, but then it was too late. There was no confirmed relationship between them. However I found it better than slot of the romance fics. It's the interaction between Harry and Luna, their communication and things said and unsaid and their action. I don't think there was any slash.

** linkffn(12132374)

Six Pomegranate Seeds by Sesalt. Hermione is sent back to year one in the body of the daughter of a death eater who was killed the same year, to find and cure a rift in the fabric of reality by the sentient manifestation of Hogwarts. That sounds kind of silly when you write it out, but it works. It's complete and so is it's sequel. I haven't finished the sequel yet, because it's good enough I'm rereading the entire thing before finishing. The writing is fantastic. It's a redo where Hermione can't change anything lest she lose where the rift occurred, but it's for a good reason, and doesn't dwell on things you know happened, just the changes. It shows but doesn't drown in the main character feeling impotent about the things she can't change. The Stations of Canon are mentioned in passing. She's justifiably, and no more, more powerful because of her extended experience compared to children. The author's writing style is almost poetic. Interesting concepts, great character study. Might be a little depressing, but it's holding my interest and a different kind of depressing. You'll like it if you prefer excellent writing to constant action, aren't invested in ships, and enjoy character rather than plot driven stories. Especially if you enjoy a little exploration of pure blood tradition and politics, alternate takes on Hermione, and grey purebloods, with the maintained conviction that Voldemort is evil.

** Linkffn(The Order of Mercy) A very good fic. Fleurs characterization is great.

Tom Riddle pov. A brilliant fic. So much Worldbuilding in terms of dark magic and Horcruxes. It's very interesting. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16497056]])

A Wolfstar fic. A bit smutty but it's one od my favorite fics. (The whole series.) The characters are so well written and there is a depth to them that yoz don't find in many fics. Linkao3(Howl by Shiftylinguini)

A few Snarry fics. I have recently come to enjoy them. These are a few well written pieces. Especially "Rapture"

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) This fic is called the boy who died a lot. I wasn't immediately hooked but after some time I got really into it. I laughed. I cried. Really good fic. Also this is Snape pov.

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

Also this time travel fic. Very well written, I liked it a lot. (Ships Sirius/Harry Hermione/Remus) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

One of the best Harry/Voldemort fics out there. Harry and Voldemort share their dreamscape. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9372596]])

Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

** I just read Fate is a Four Letter Word and found is absolutely gripping. It's a courtroom drama but it's also so much more. I don't love epilogue compliant stories because I generally find them trite or hard to believe but this one jumps off from an epilogue-compatible world and makes everything believable.

Note - there's a lot of sex which I tend to skim over but some of it was actually really hot.
