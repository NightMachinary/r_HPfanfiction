The description of his 6th year potionsbook has the margins of each page filled with notes on spellwork, potions etc - and I know he invented muffliato and sectusempra, but are there more we know of? Imagine what his personal notebooks might contain... he's probably one of the most low-key successful spell inventors of the age, seeing as that's what he did in 6th year...

Snape had so much knowledge, sucks that his teaching methods were shit...

EDIT: found a nifty little list on the harrypotter.fandom.com site: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_creation]] apparently Lockhart was so vain he invented a spell to shoot a holographic image of himself into the night sky...


** I think “levicorpus” was also invented by him. I remember him declaring he wouldn't let Harry turn the spells he created against him like his father did, in the climax of /Halfblood Prince/, but he might have been referring to “sectumsempra”.

*** Considering James used this spell against Snape its unlikely that it was something he invented.

**** From book 6, chapter 28:

#+begin_quote
  Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi ---\\
  “No, Potter!” screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape's pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.\\
  “You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them --- I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you'd turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don't think so . . . no!”

**** Snape does tell Harry his father used his own spells against him. It isn't farfetched to believe Snape cast it on James first, and then he picked it up from him and used it back.

I think you need to re-read what I said.

  He(Snape) wouldn't let Harry turn the spells he(Snape) created against him like his father did.

The fact that James used the spell against Snape is something covered in my initial comment.

** Slightly off topic there was an article on Red Hen where she had the idea that the Marauders at some point stole the potions book from Snape and that's how the spell got out. Her idea was the Pettigrew snuck into the Slytherin downs as a rat and took it. Interesting thought that I haven't seen explored anywhere else.
