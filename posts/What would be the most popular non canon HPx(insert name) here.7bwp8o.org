*** Something I've never really understood. I don't think Harry and Hermione would work together, but I could see why others would. I wouldn't have been shocked at all if JK put them together in the end. If she put Harry/Draco together, I'd burn Deathly Hallows. I just don't see Harry and Draco getting together unless you completely rewrote their personalities.

**** Lots of women like trashy slash romances, while many men enjoy harem power wanks.

Since fanfic authors are predominantly female, we get more Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, and Harry/LV slash fics.

**** I am pretty sure Drarry shippers dont actually think the pairing is realistic.

**** Drarry is a ship that I think is completely implausible because of the mutual loathing between the two.

Of course, I ship Harry/Pansy, so I don't get to talk.

**** I tend to avoid Harry/Draco but I've read some good ones, and part of the fun for the thinky ones is the mental exercise: what possible circumstances could possibly make Harry/Draco happen?

Post war growing up or sex pollen are too easy, Draco-rapes-his-prisoner squicks me, and fuck knows what's up with all the alpha-omega mpreg mating season weirdness, but there can be entire rewritings where it comes naturally about - AU, basically. Or ways when events in canon have backstory that changes the entire perspective and then it changes because HP gets to see 'what's really going on'.

However they're doing it, or whyever they are, they're doing it a /lot/. And not hurting anyone, so...

** Well, no slash wipes out /the/ most common pairing by a long margin. This isn't LF, so why specifically exclude slash? It can't be that slash is icky, you're not asking for recommendations to read.

So, going by experience the most common pairing, excluding the three most common pairings (Harry-Draco, Harry-Snape, Harry-Hermione), would be Daphne Greengrass, then Fleur Delacourt or Luna Lovegood at number five.
