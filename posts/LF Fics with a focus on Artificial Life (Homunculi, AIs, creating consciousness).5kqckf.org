Basically fics in which Harry is or creates artificial life. They need to have heavy involvement of beings that are not naturally born but instead created, crafted, programmed, thought into existence or a result of an accident while messing with organic matter, alchemy or potions. An example of Harry would be Harry Potter: Geth where he's basically an android or wordhammer's Holly Polter where she was that awesome inkblob imp thingy. In both cases Harry is very loosely connected to the term human. Other fics that would apply should include Harry creating something that is self aware enough to communicate and express emotions in some form. I have a hard time finding fics involving alchemy and created homunculi such as those in fullmetal and fate series used. Or puppet bodies.


** linkffn(4714715) It's been awhile since I've read it, but I recall a fair amount of the story focusing on Harry constructing a homunculous.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

This has a little bit where the portrait making spell is altered to create AIs.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.
