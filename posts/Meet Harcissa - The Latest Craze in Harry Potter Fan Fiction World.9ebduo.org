** I am impressed that people can have such a distorted view of reality.

#+begin_quote
  even odd pairings in mind, most notably the Harry/Narcissa
#+end_quote

There are 408 stories on FFN which have both Harry and Narcissa in them. *17 are tagged as the pairing, less than 20 stories on Ao3 feature it as exclusive pairing*. For comparison, just on FFN there are *3100* stories with a Harry/Draco pairing, *626* with Harry/Snape and *794* with Harry/Voldemort (or Riddle). And let's not even get started on pairing Hermione with those war criminals.

#+begin_quote
  It certainly feels a bit odd for a young and green wizard like Harry to fall for an adult woman like Narcissa Malfoy who is much older than him
#+end_quote

Seduced by an attractive older woman is one of the most common fantasies. And Narcissa would look at least ten years younger than in the movies (she was 43 during the Battle of Hogwarts, she looks beyond 50, and that's not even taking longer lifespans into account.)

#+begin_quote
  and who is the mother of his arch nemesis at school
#+end_quote

That just makes it hotter. I mean, there's a reason why "I fucked your mother" is such a popular insult. Not only did you score an attractive woman, you can rub it in your nemesis' face.

**** Just imagine the classic XBox chat and Harry just says:

"I fucked your mother last night until she was hoarse from screaming my name."

"Sure Potter."

/When suddenly another voice joins./

"Draco, remember to clean your room today, the Parkinsons are coming over later."

****** The one with Hermione and the squid is better. If you really want absurd, there's a Hermione/Hagrid/Fang oneshot on AO3.

******* or harry/crookshanks/mcgonagall ;)

like this whole thing seems so bizare to find such a vanilla pairing as "out there" makes me think author never read much smut fic since most common slash is harry/Volde or harry/snape or harry/sirius which all raise way more ethical concerns than harry/naricssia

**** But there's nothing odd about the pairing, especially compared to some of the mainstream stuff. OP's article makes it sound like something entirely unbelievable while even the French President married his high school teacher and is happy with that relationship. If you want odd, look at any Death Eater pairings, since shipping war criminals with their victims is a lot more detestable than the fanfic equivalent of "Stacy's Mom".

And Harry/Narcissa is definitely not the latest craze.
