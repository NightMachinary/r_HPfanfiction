Few years back I started reading a HP and the half blood prince fanfiction thinking it was the original. I loved it but I can't find it anymore. The plot was that Harry Potter needs to up his dueling skills and trains under Kingsley Shacklebolt. Meanwhile Hermoine and Draco get close. Please help.

*** Are you sure you found the right story? I'm 3/4 of the way through that story right now and it's not Dramione (it's a Harry/Hermione story) and so far Kingsley isn't involved at all.
