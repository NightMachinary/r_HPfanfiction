I've never actually found one that interested me, wondering if anyone had better luck. I'm not looking for anything specific, just a well written crossover between hp and fma (preferably with no slash)


** The only two I've ever read -- both complete -- and I think I liked them, but otherwise don't remember a thing.

  The professor of alchemy in Hogwarts must be imported every year from a little country called Amestris. Edward pulled the short straw this year. He's on a mission and no one will stand in his way, not even exams!

  Attempting legilimency on Edward Elric was a supremely bad idea, as it got Truth's attention, and now Ed's taken Harry home with him and Al. But the wizards refuse to believe that Harry is lost to them, and continue to search for Harry and the alchemist who kidnapped him. This story is now complete. Evil Dumbledore, and Brotherhood 'verse for FMA

  After facing the Homunculi, saving Amestris, and sacrificing his alchemy to save his brother, Edward would have never dreamed that the Truth would ask him to save another universe where magic reigns. Translation from French of mel72000's awesome fic, Par delà la Porte : E Elric et l'Ordre du Phénix.
