Lately I've been noticing a few posts where it is stated or implied that pairings with age difference are frowned upon for the age difference issue.

In a society where the average life expectancy is much higher, is a difference of 20-30 years (or perhaps even 40) so much of an issue?

I mean, we're not talking about a 15 year old with someone Dumbledore's age, that'd still be a wee weird. (And I'd personally also skip discussing underage/overage, since that brings up different views like US' weird laws on it). But an adult, so say, from 17 onwards with someone in their 40s?


** People tend to throw around words like "creepy" without explaining /why/ specifically the age difference is creepy. For now let's set aside the specific pairings that also suffer from an imbalance of power problem (student/teacher, boss/employee etc.), because that's a different can of worms.

The main reason age-gap romances don't happen in western society is that romantic partners usually prefer to have common ground with each other. Two people usually have hugely different mindsets (maturity, life goals, etc.) when one person is just graduating college and the other is planning for retirement. Extrapolate this to the wizarding world in which people can live several centuries: Albus Dumbledore had vastly different life experiences growing up through the late 1800s (including two world wars) compared to, say, Frank Longbottom who was a child of the 1950s.

When romantic partners have a significant age-gap there's usually an assumption that the older partner lacks maturity such that they are mentally on the same page as the younger person. Alternatively, the younger person might be 'wise beyond their years' due to hardships that made them mature faster. In modern times, we struggle to understand how such relationships could be a partnership of equals.

Most of the age-gap romances I've seen in fanfic just ignore these issues entirely, but I wouldn't be opposed to reading, say, a Remus/Tonks romance that treated the problems seriously.

*** Age-gap romances certainly happened yers ago. My grandparents had a 16 year old difference, with my grandmother being 16. It wasn't seen as a big deal back then.

Maybe in a period fic would be less of an issue?

**** For sure, marriages with an age gap were more acceptable just a few generations ago. In fact they are still aceptable in different countries arround the world.

My guess is that the western world's view of such things gradually changed because of growing belief in marriage as the culmination of romance, rather than the old fashioned view of marriage as a social contract.

Fanfic authors could certainly portray the wizarding world as more antiquated. After all, it makes sense that they would retain older customs if the people who grew up with those customs are still alive and acting as influential members of society (Dumbledore, McGonnagall, etc).

****** I get it and you are totally right. I'm not calling for them to banned or questioning how anyone could enjoy them...I'm just speaking to my own tastes and answering OP's question why I don't enjoy them.

/Holiday Inn/ is one of my favorite movies to watch around Christmas. It also contains a song in which the white actors perform the song in blackface to an entirely white audience while the black 'help' bops along blissfully to the music in the kitchen. This was perfectly acceptable at the time the movie was created in the 40's but is now (rightfully) decried based on today's view of race. I personally skip through that bit when I rewatch it.

Should this scene be cut from the original movie? Absolutely not. Can it still be enjoyed by someone watching it today based on the context of what was acceptable back then? For sure. If a remake of the film was done today would it include a similar scene? No way in hell. Because by today's standards it is rightfully seen as not acceptable.

******* Ah, it wasn't much about liking or not liking it, that's a matter of taste and doesn't really require an explanation (although I very much appreciate it), it was more about the fact that it seemed to me as if fics with those elements are sort of stigmatized because of it?

And not because of *how* it's done. That'd be perfectly understandable: "I don't like this or that fanfiction because it does the whole age gap thing badly".\\
I just noticed a few comments who seemed to look down on it in general, implying that it's bad on principle.

** For me it's less about the age gap between the two parties and more to do with the age of the youngest person involved. Simply put someone aged 16-18 in almost all cases does not have the maturity or life experience to be on equal footing relationship wise with someone much older than them.

There was a 13 year age difference between Tonks and Lupin. Tonks was 23-24 when the relationship started so I had no problem with it. Had they started dating when Tonks was 16-17 it would feel much more exploitative to me and I personally wouldn't want to read it.

** I take it by ranges, really. The divide by two add seven method works for me in most general cases, but when it comes to stuff I usually group it like this:

- Anything below 18 yrs | Two years up, two years down that goes to 1 year if it's below 14 years and 0 years if it's below 13. When you're at 18/19, dating a 16 or 17 year old is also generally circumspect, and I generally really dislike it unless it's a pre-established relationship from before they became adults and have had at least a year together, if not more. An 18 year old shouldn't be seeking out a 16 year old, especially if they're not even in the same school anymore, but that's my own personal experience rattling me.
- 18~25 | Divide by two add seven. It works in these cases because, largely, people are either in college or just coming out of college and an established adult will generally have more maturity than someone still in post-ed. There's more leeway and grey area - after all, they are all adults one way or another - but it can be really squick-y when you get impressionable kids being targeted by older men or women who want to take advantage of their general youthfulness or naivety.
- 25~39 | A weird age range, sure, but it is what it is. This is generally the age where people have an established life, and at this point while it can be weird to date someone ten years your senior it is /considerably/ less predatory, as most people will have matured enough to make informed and coherent decisions and will have the ability to maybe avoid being manipulated by someone who wishes to exploit them in terms of power dynamics in a relationship.
- 40+ | Do whatever.

I choose these age ranges in large part because of how power dynamics work in reference to them. As it stands, someone who isn't constrained by the school shouldn't be seeking out someone who is, as you have a far larger range of control over them then they do you. This applies but in less intensity to adults dating in-college/uni/post-ed students, where there is still a power dynamic involved but it may be more financial or lifestyle based. By splitting it up like these, I feel like it's easier to avoid being taken advantage of for your age and independence (or lack thereof) by those who would intentionally target it.

It also helps that most of the time this keeps people into their own generational group, which does seem to be a defining factor in whether or not people get along. I mean, I sure wouldn't know how to date someone whose interests are ten years older than me personally.

** Like someone said the age gap isn't really the issue. It's the age of the youngest party. With real life examples in mind, I have a huge issue with someone in their late teens dating someone 24/25 and older. And, yes, I'm well aware of what's legal. Legal =/= right

So, yes, ignoring the Nazi leanings, 17 yr old Harry and Hermione dating 37+ yr old Snape, Narcissa, Lucius, etc is still super weird. 24 yr old Tonks and 27 yr old Bill, too.

*** Yeah, let's compare Harry and Tonks (a popular pairing) in muggle terms. Harry is 17. He's a junior in high school, not quite sure what to do yet with his life. He likely hasn't had much experience with finances, careers, or life outside of basic schooling.

Now compare Tonks. She's 24 years old. At that age, she's just graduated college with her degree and decided to enter the workforce. She's been handling finances, careers, and the wider world for several years now.

Tonks is /seven years/ Harry's senior. Imagine the differences in life experiences and maturity between 17 and 24. Shipping Tonks with Harry is setting up a high school kid with a police officer who graduated before he was even a first year.

But people ignore it so they can give Harry a hot, fun Quidditch girl who is like Ginny but with the ability to look like anyone he wants.

**** Yeah that's a pairing that always bothered me in Harry's Hogwarts years. It's easy enough to write a solid relationship where Tonks survives DH, and for whatever reason Harry and Ginny don't get together. Harry and Tonks working together and raising Teddy together for a few years as they both move on from past relationships and you've got a basis for a solid romance/buddy cop story.

** I was never much of a shipper myself so the shipping drama usually takes a while to reach me, but from what I understand the purity police is starting to become fairly active in many fandoms. I've seen shit like calling age gaps with more than a 2 year difference paedophilia or calling ships where one character is significantly taller than the other one predatory and similar garbage takes.

It's /fiction/. It's /not real/. Pay it no mind and if you want to explore a relationship with a bigger age gap? Go for it, write whatever you like, read whatever you want to read. Even if it's frowned upon by the purity police, not all fiction needs to be pure and wholesome.

*** Exactly.

I don't get tied up in the exact ages involved so much as how the characters act, and how the relationship works.

Mostly I've run into this stuff with HP/Fleur fics. Sometimes there's a really really unbalanced dynamic to the relationship, and it has once or twice bothered me enough to stop reading. Usually that's because Fleur is portrayed as really experienced and.. dominating, I guess, and the relationship they had really didn't strike me as healthy.

** What kind of "big age difference" do we see in fanfic:

- Death Eater/ Teenager : there are some ships with it, but as I said in another discussion there, it is the magical equivalent of a Nazi paired with a Jew. I guess the age difference may be a problem (especially when the teen is only around 15, so a child while the death eater is in his 30's if not 40's, but compared to the other issue it can be passed other.
- Snape/ Teen : seem pretty popular, especially with Hermione or Harry as the child. It has all the issues of the Death Eater/ Teen ship except that Snape is also a /teacher/. If you put a teacher with a teen, it instantly become suspiciously similar to grooming.
- Voldemort/ Harry : Magical Hitler with Magical Jesus, it's poetic I guess. Of and Hitler could litterally be the grandfather of Jesus there.

​

In my opinion, the age difference in itself is not the problem, it's all the other issues around the 2 characters that is. I don't have any problem with a big age difference couple, and canon did some of them (Bill/ Fleur and Remus/ Tonk for example, though I am not a fan of how canon dealt with the Remus/Tonk relation).

I am totally fine with a big age difference couple as long as the other aspects of the relation are well treated (though I would have trouble pairing a 18 years old character with another one in his mid 40's. When one character could litterally be the parent of the other, always seemed a bit akward to me.)

** The gap is far less important than the age of the youngest person.

A 14 and a 16 year old have only a 2 year gap, but here in the UK that's the difference between legal and illegal (assuming the relationship is sexual), and those 2 years are EXTREMELY important in terms of maturity, understanding, and both physical, mental and lifestyle development necessary to consent fully and to deal with the potential consequences of sex - STDs, relationship changes, pregnancy etc. By contrast, a 75 year old and a 55 year old have a 10x bigger gap, but since both are fully grown adults who've reached their peak of intellectual and physical development, and built their own lives which makes coercion less available, it's completely harmless.

Luna didn't had grandparents, Neville had one of four, Ron a bit fat 0... Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, not a single member of the old generation is known to be alive.

I admit we lack the data to properly measure the average, but what is shown in the books doesn't show a society of long lived people, and certainly it doesn't justify pedophilia.

Also, someone at 17 is still a teen, regardless of Wizard laws. I would never read something with a 17 year old Hermione fucking some middle aged man, regardless of who it is. I find it utterly disgusting. She needs to be at least past her teens for me to tolerate it.

​

Frankly, the age of consent should be raised to 21 at minimum. 25 is when the brain finishes developing fully, so that'd be ideal, but giving the youth at least enough time to focus on their future, the fact that birth control always entails a risk of pregnancy, what they want out of relationship, and things like that would be good, in my opinion.
