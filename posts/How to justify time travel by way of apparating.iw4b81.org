I just had a thought when it comes to apparating. In fanfiction whenever the processes required to apparate is described the person has to picture the place they want to go and essentially will themselves there. This leads me to my idea of the possibilities of time travel by apparating.

Think about it if say a person wants to travel to somewhere not in their line of sight (long distance), the person needs to picture their destination from memory. And what is memory but a slice of time in a particular place in our subconscious. So by using memory to picture the destination subconsciously the person is picturing the destination in its past. And by extension in some cases of splinching when body parts can't be found to be reattached the cause could be the body part has traveled to the past or even multiple pasts.

I just thought this could be cool so if anyone wants to use it feel free I'm not a writer so you won't be stepping on my toes so to speak. And if people want to point out stuff I might of missed feel free to point it out.

If someone has come up with this before I apologise but I couldn't find an example of time travel using this method in Hp fanfiction at this point multi million word count of stories I've read so far


** I suppose time turners might be based off something like this, rather than changing destination they change time.

** Technically the method is to "focus on the destination". Given that we have seen people apparate to places they have not visited before (e.g. Death Eaters to Little Hangleton Graveyard), personally I doubt that "focus" means "visualise". Rather I think it's enough to focus on the name of the place, or your knowledge of where it is (e.g. its position on a map), or indeed any given symbol of that location.

*** You make a good point but we don't really know the effect of the dark mark in the death eater scenario. It could be acting like a magical homing beacon, or even just provides a mental image to them of where Voldemort is for them to find him. For your second point about using their knowledge of where they are going by using maps has the problem that if you don't know the place intimately you could end up inhabiting a space already occupied by an obstacle ie a tree, wall hell even a hill. I could imagine such an incident would be like hitting a solid wall at very high speed except if they apparted to the interior of an object it would be like spontaneously exploding from the inside as space they are currently in is already occupied by other matter. I personally don't think a name of a place and it's general location is enough mainly because when ever you think of a destination you don't just picture that place by its name but by what you expect to see. Think about your home, the first thing at probably comes to mind is your house or apartment and it's surroundings not nots it's name. Still thank you for your input it is very much appreciated

** If you want a scene for your fic, I would suggest Harry gets lured into a trap, Voldemort and Rookwood designed a new ward to stop him from apparating, because the previous design couldn't hold Harry in. Harry manages to do shenanigans of magic as usual. Harry had a time turner on his person. The magic of the Ward and Time Turner interacted explosively, transporting him back into time.

*** Cool idea, I'm not writing a story tho. I'm not much of a writer. I just thought about it and you can use it if you want. You could go down the route of the rules of magic just not applying to Harry as if you wanted to add a humorous element

**** Definitely. I remember a post a long time ago "discussing" the same rule that magical rules do not apply to Harry.
