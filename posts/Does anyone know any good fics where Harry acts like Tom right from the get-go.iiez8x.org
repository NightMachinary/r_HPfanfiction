I don't mind time-travel or reincarnation fics, and honestly it doesn't matter to me whether Harry does it for shits and giggles (to scare Dumbledore) or it's genuine. I just want Harry scaring the living shit out of Dumbledore with his uncanny resemblance to Tom.

â€‹

I got the idea when I read a fic (It's called Full Circle, for anyone who's interested) where Harry and Tom were soulmates who went from mortal enemies to lovers over the course of many reincarnations as different people in different worlds. The final reincarnation was an almost-exact parallel and they reincarnated as themselves, remembered their past lives when they met the night Voldemort went to kill the Potters, and then plotted to cause chaos in Wizarding World, starting with Harry behaving like Tom when Dumbledore met him.

*** Yes. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155/chapters/15133504]])

I came here to recommend Full Circle and then realized the OP already read it. It is an Excellent fic.

**** Yeah, Full Circle was what inspired the idea for me, but thanks for recommending it anyway! I've been giving it a reread because it's so good, it just kinda kills me that it isn't finished.

It doesn't exactly match what you are looking for, but it is a great read (if incomplete, although the style this fic is written in means it doesn't matter that much)

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
