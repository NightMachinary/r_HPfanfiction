** Pettigrew is one of the most unlikeable characters in canon, so this is a tough one. I genuinely love the idea of a comedy Marauders-and-baby-Harry story, though, so I am torn!

*** Exactly! You gotta have Pettigew betray them on a night when James is out (full moon maybe?). Lily still dies, the baby murder still backfires, but then it's James Sirius and Remus trying to three men and a baby this shiz. *chef's kiss*

**** OR a crack fic where four months post-war, Hermione and Ginny go back to hogwarts, and so Neville, Ron, and Harry turn Grimmauld into a bro pad. Ron is working with Fred (he's not dead, fight me) and George at Wheezes and is their unwilling product tester and forever coming home without eyebrows or worse. Neville is an apprentice herbologist under a crazily enthusiastic master who keeps putting him into crazy situations. and Harry - finally an adult - is the unwilling heir (and new model/spokesperson) of his family's Sleakeazy's empire, and has to do terrible print ads and has a bunch of people following him around All the time making him sign things. And then one day, Andromeda says she can't be responsible for Teddy anymore.
