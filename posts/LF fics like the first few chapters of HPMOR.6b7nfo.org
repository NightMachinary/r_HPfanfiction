I really enjoyed it, at least the first bit. I finished the whole part but the war games became a bit tiring. But the first act, that was amazing. I loved Harry being mildly surprised at McGonagall floating something then freaking the hell out when she breaks like 5 laws of physics when she turns into a cat. I love him trying to apply logic to magic, trying to figure out why the moleskin pouch can't understand math but can speak French. I love him explaining to Malfloy that muggles have landed on the moon and him freaking out. Are there any that replicate that, but stays mostly like that?


** In a sense Harry Potter and the Natural 20, where the protagonist comes from a universe (DnD 3.5 E [you really don't need to be familiar to follow this]) where physics are fundamentally different from our own (time is measured in 6 second rounds that define actions, 8 hrs sleep=full healing, PCs and NPCs are defined things etc), and it takes him some time to adjust to everyone around him not following those rules.

** You might want to check out WhiteSquirrel's works. Particularly linkffn(The Arithmancer) and its sequel, linkffn(Lady Archimedes.)

Also, perhaps tangential, but you might want to check out [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the BWL]]. It's a AU without magic, where "Harworts" is a school for super-spies. I very much enjoyed seeing what Hermione might be like as an actual combat scientist/engineer.
