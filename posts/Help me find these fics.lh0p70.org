:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, I am trying to find two fics I read a while ago but searching keywords doesn't seem to help. The first one was a redo fanfic in which harry was sorted into slytherin and becomes the slytherin king after duels for the special chair and all. Lily and James were alive and harry also had siblings. In the second one harry was reincarnated in the body of a slytherin boy who committed suicide during the Tom riddle era. Both fics were on ao3.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said, stalking closer, “is you.” He marched forward, backing Harry up until he was pinned to the cool wall of the common room. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely pleased. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro was a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer, “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

***** I know in my soul it is. But I didn't want to get invested only to be let down. I've recently gotten into it so I got excited! I'm on chapter 12 now and very please so far! I would keep reading but I really do need to sleep.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
