Any fics that feature wizards who've never watched TV before watching a movie? A Black Comedy has it, I believe.


** In Harry Potter at the Knees of the Marauders' linkao3(5338217) they do go and see a a movie as well as a coupe of other muggle things but is not the main focus of the fic at all. It is the second part in a four part series series but the only one I can think of off the top of my head. I know there is a one-shot which was quite funny and it was the main focus but I can't for the life of me remember the author or title, hopefully someone else will though.

  Harry returns to Hogwarts for his second year. A year that will be filled with books, good friends, basilisks, quidditch, prattish friends, horrible dreams, and pranks.

** Not sure whether you have any preferences re: ships but my holiday fic last year revolves entirely around a post-war film club at Hogwarts. Posting an AO3 link because of ongoing FFN weirdness, but it is available on both :)
