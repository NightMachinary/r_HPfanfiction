*** There's also this oneshot, part of Perspicacity's collection:

  This silly story eeked out a hard-fought last-place finish in the 2013 Dark Lord Potter Dystopia/Apocalypse contest. I wrote it on a lark, largely as a way of pulling rank on all those silly [[/spoiler]["Harry has a powerful, magical, Animagus form" stories. Harry's form is Cthulhu. I win.]]

#+begin_quote
  An assortment of Harry Potter one shots. Though listed as "Humor/General," the collection also contains Drama, Horror, Family, and Tragedy, as well as a few experimental fiction stories as I work out my stylist chops. Contain crossovers with several fictional worlds, including the Cthulhu Mythos, Starship Troopers, Star Wars, and James Bond.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
