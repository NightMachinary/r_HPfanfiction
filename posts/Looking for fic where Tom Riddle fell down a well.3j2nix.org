Hi, I'm looking for a fic that I've forgotten the name of.

What I remember: - It might have been a "Harry travels back to Tom Riddle's time" fic - As a kid Tom Riddle and another kid fell/were pushed down a well, and stayed there for several days. - At some point the other kid tried to eat Tom to stay alive, but he pushed him back - The other kid died and I think there was some mention of his body rotting (maybe?) - Riddle repressed that memory and didn't remember it, and had unconsciously charmed himself with a glamour. When he remembers the event, the glamour drops and he's missing toes and (I think) also has a scar (on his arm? not sure about the scar).

Do any of you know what fic I'm thinking of? Thanks in advance.


** I just read it a week ago. Never finished because of the slow pace, and 13 year old Riddle with 25 year old Harry just doesn't work for me. The Grindelwald/Albus side pairing is cute though.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter, weathered wizarding warrior in his mid-twenties, finds himself in 1940. Albus is coming up with a theory, and an adolescent Tom Riddle, torn between feeling threatened and piqued, acquires a controversial mentor. Hallows, spell-making, horror, politics and witty banter, served with a Grindledore sidedish. Slow and slightly disturbing TR/HP. First chapters re-polished.
