I've read both Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness and Finding Himself, both of which involve magic used by wizards across the globe. Anyone know of any decent fics in the same vein or with bigger focus? Thanks.

** The /Alexandra Quick/ series explores Native American magic quite a bit (especially the fourth book, /Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above/), and hints of other magical traditions (rural Ozarkers, Chinese, Japanese, et cetera) are dropped occasionally.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][Firebird Trilogy]] (complete) the protagonists travel all around the world for [[/s][spoiler.]] Reader discretion for harem fic, (violent) sexual content, and complete remodelling of many native characters.

In Mastermind Hunting (W: 616,225; Complete) Harry also has lots of travelling around, but I don't remember if foreign magic was any different or even discussed much, for that matter. In this case the warning's about [[/s][spoiler.]]
