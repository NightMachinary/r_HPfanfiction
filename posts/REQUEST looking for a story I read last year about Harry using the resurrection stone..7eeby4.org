Looking for a short story I read last year about Harry using the resurrection stone at the end of the battle of Hogwarts to command all dead spirits in the world. He orders them to kill all murderers, serial rapists, pedophiles, arsonists, assassins, betrayers, terrorists, etc everywhere in the world. Then overwhelmed with guilt he steps through the veil and meets death. Death offers him a chance to relive his life and Harry refuses until Death helps Harry by having Voldemort truly die along with all marked Death Eaters Halloween night 1981. He also meet Hermione & the Patil sisters, all four play a kissing game. The story was part of a group of one shots or story ideas by one of the more frequent fanfic writers. Thanks.


** The kissing game sounds a lot like a story by nonjon, but the rest sadly doesn't ring any bells for me :/
