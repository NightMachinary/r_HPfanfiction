I feel the portrayal is highly misleading, but defending my own work as an author seems really terrible on a public forum where things can and often do get misconstrued, so if anyone is curious they can just read it themselves.

It bothers me how Harry and his love interest (mostly Hermione) always seem to go from being friends on one page to then calling each other 'my love' or something similair on the next page less than five minutes into their relationship. I don't care if a pairing is obvious from the start or develops fast but for the love of love could it at least show us the journey and not just take us to the end. :/

** The historical importance of runic war warding.

I legitimately dislike this fic, but it's really popular and people seem to think it's like, the best thing ever. And I literally do not understand, at all. It's cheesy, cliche, needs a huge amount of grammar edits, and so ooc that I've literally laughed out loud at the story and the character choices. All of that wouldn't bother me if the author and the readers didn't treat it like it was some second coming. But the author gets told that they should have written canon because they're so amazing? That the ideas in it are new? But it's nothing new. At all. It's got lordships, Black inheritance! Harry, grey!harry, muggles are to blame for magic dying, the 'darkside' is good, just misunderstood... Voldemort is nice? (Because hey let's ignore that he's literally a racist in canon, he just went about his revolution in the wrong way, he's totally justified, really, just made some mistakes... Honestly, I do not understand how this fic is so popular, it infuriates me. It's such a perfect example of why actual good stories and authors stop writing...when you see what stuff gets popular instead.

You totally can in a believable way. Tom's second year at Hogwarts was during WW2's London bombings. Plenty of reason for him to justifyably hate or fear muggles. And headmaster at the time forced him to go back into the muggle world where he was likely to die.

The common character to 'bash' in fics that feature Tom Riddle being 'misunderstood' is Dumbledore. I don't think I've ever seen Dippet blamed, it's always Dumbledore.

Misunderstood implies there is another way to explain/justify/interpret a situation/event/character. A misunderstood character, at the core, needs to be justifiable. Anakin Skywalker is justifiable. Voldemort is not misunderstood, there's no point in his story where we sit back and go, okay, yes, i understand how he got to this point. There's no plot point that makes us go, 'oh' okay, that's why he is the way he is. We see the reason he hates them, but no real, actual justifiable reason to kill them.

Well, there's a difference in opinion then. I clearly can see how he got to that point. He was a scared 12-year-old facing almost certain death. He survived but was deeply traumatized. He began fearing dying to an irrational, or perhaps from nature's point, a natural degree. His life got consumed by the search for immortality, so that he would never again have to fear. Then he found Horocruxes. Maybe not the best option, but fears are rarely rational. And Horocruxes in turn corrupted and destroyed his mind, turning him insane.

********** Yeah, we're not going to agree on that. Voldemort is not justifiable to the degree that his actions are excusable or even explainable. Not to mention that most of the bombing took place between September and May, which means he was in hogwarts for the entirety of the blitz. That doesn't mean he wasn't affected, of course. But it still doesn't justify his desire to wipe out an entire race of people. The magical population had it's war too.

Which excuses his atrocities... because legit, if that's all he was doing, he could have just avada'd like, thousands and been done with it....But he didn't.

I might be a bit weird and looking at it differently but I see it more like Voldemort is fucked up in the head and does what he wants and the reason I don't see it as misunderstood Voldemort is because I think if I remember right Voldemort is explaining his reasons so wouldn't that be a case of “a truly insane person doesn't realize he's insane”?

  "I immediately decided that the logical course of action would, of course, be to overthrow the muggle-loving government who was abolishing our traditions and in some cases even making them illegal, because safeguarding the Purebloods would have the dual benefit of protecting both the Olde Ways and the Ancient Houses. The hope was for it to buy me enough time in which to find a more permanent solution to the real problem of magic dying a slow and painful death."

  He gritted out between his teeth. "That this is a war for the fate of magic itself, and that the means will always be justified when the ends are so vitally important."

  She rubbed her face, unable to believe that a man as intelligent as Voldemort was really this appallingly thick. "I'm going to be completely honest, knowing what I do now about the Fade I'm not even sure that your winning isn't actually maybe, /maybe/ a good thing. And I mean that is one hell of a maybe Voldemort. It's definitely something I'm going to have to sit down and think about, but only on the condition you stop treating 'saving magic' and 'not committing genocide' as if they're mutually exclusive!"

  "Muggles are the reason for so much of this mess and the most immediate and direct threat to our way of life." He sneered. "They are killing the planet with their pollution and their overpopulation and their greed, and if we don't find a way to deal with them then we're unlikely to make it another century before they've either decided to kill off either us or each other and indiscriminately blow everything away! You might have forgotten what it was like to huddle in a cramped air raid shelter night after night, listening to the bombs dropping all around and wondering if the next one was going to be the one that finally killed us, but I never have. They have to be stopped!"
#+end_quote

What the heck is this worldbuilding. "Olde Ways", lol.

Also, "that is one hell of a maybe Voldemort."

There is a reason why punctuation is important. If your clauses aren't separated, then you have people wondering what a "maybe Voldemort" is. Is he a new version of Voldemort with commitment issues?

Not to mention, if he is fucked up in the head, then we wouldn't need all this justification. He's fucked. End of story. No justification needed. He hates muggles. He kills them. There's no overarching goal. But that's not what the story does. It gives him an excuse, or tries to.

************ Not native english speaker, but IMo, your comments give the impression that you find Tom Riddle to be excusable for his acts and not that you are simply trying to understand his motives with an open mind, which are two different things.

​

If you go with WW2 argument, you have to realize that Grindelwald is also happening in tandem with Hitler, so living though war and destruction are clearly not a muggle thing; granted, the magical war had to reached Britain in full, but they knew what was happening...not to mention, muggle borns and muggle raised would also witnessed the detsruction and, taking your argument, they would also rationalize a fear for their own?

​

I think JKR exposing Tom Riddle ´s past life can explain enough without justifying; he was simply a boy ho ended up in the worst place to be for a wiazrd- a non magical orphanage- and at the crossroad of his life, where he could very well risen above all and decided to make something amazing with his life, he freaked out and became a murderer and, from there on, he literally LOST HIS SOUL.

************* I am trying to look at things from his point of view, because I believe that is the correct and only way to truly judge a character. I realize this method may seem stupid or silly to some, and while I have arguments in place to prove it's usefulness, I don't think that's what you're asking me. On a slightly different topic, saying that a character is not excusable is simply stupid in my opinion. Morality is subjective. Yes, I know nobody wants to admit that and my point will probably be considered moot now. I don't really care. My point is that someone in other regions of the world, regions with vastly different moral viewpoints, or some terroristic organizations, or anything similar, could easily excuse his acts. We are all different. It applies to our views as well.

Yes, that's how humans work. If you get robbed do you think "Oh, I do so hope he will have a good day" or "I hate that person?" And it's only a robbery. If we take rape or murder of your family, my point becomes even stronger. When bad things happen to us, we hate in return. Or if we are significantly hurt or significantly traumatized we develop fear or different symptoms like ptsd. Now imagine say a jew or a black person caused you to develop ptsd. You might start fearing or blaming their entire race. Is it logical from our point of view? No, but such things rarely are. After all we have zero investment, emotional or otherwise, in this,

Except you are wrong. He did become someone amazing. Even Ollivander said as much "After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things --- terrible, yes, but great." Hell, I could provide more examples. Dumbledore needed 60 more years of experience, the Death Stick, and a Pheonix to duel Voldemort. He didn't need, nor had, any of that and they were dueling like equals. That's pretty amazing. He discovered and created new magical spells. Was he evil? Sure. But he was certainly amazing.

I do believe in choices and circunstances; his circunstances led him to a choice- he was not forced to choose- and he chose wrong. So, yes what is so wrong about believing in personal responsability? My conclusion is that the guy had a though life and made a wrong choice and yes, he did not become something amazing; he became the Boogey man. If you think the Boogey man is amazing, then it is your problem.I am not wrong in thinking he chose wrong and wasted his potential because I believe that was the point of his arch- at some point in our lives, we have to chose, and if we chose wrongly, it will only lead to misery.

I do not think he was even such a good of a villain in terms of what he accomplished and in his methods. He was a caricature of himself by the end. Jeez, developing some spells, discovering ancient ones and being bold enough to go where people usually do not? Yes, that would be impressive in itself, execpt it did not lead him anywhere. Okay he managed to get a hold of many single minded people and convince them to go to war, but only because they were stupid enough to believe in a messianic figure.

He was beaten by a first generation witch who outsmarted him...he just came back because the loser of one of his followers got exposed and freaked out...his quest for imortality id not comee out of a wish for greatness, but fear of dying. I fear Death because it is unknowN. and it is totally fine, many do fear it too.

But fearing Death and trying to run from it does not make anyone great, just make them foolish because the most basic thing one has to learn is that everything that has a begging, has a end.

I REALLY do not think his methods and accomplishments were impressive.

Became powerful enough to duel Albus on even ground when Albus had the advantage of Death Stick, Pheonix, and 60 years of experience. Was so feared, people couldn't speak his name. He later put a curse on his name. He put a curse on a job that lasted from 1967 to 1998. That 31 years that even Albus couldn't remove his curse. Pottermore states that he is the most powerful Dark Wizard of all time. He could create and control Inferi. He has shown incredible Mastery of the Dark Arts. He can possess beings. He created his first Horcrux at 16. He formed a big army of wizards and other creatures. He had an increadible command over Wandless magic even as a kid, things that included levitation, pain curses, animal control. On one occasion, he took Dennis Bishop and Amy Benson, into a cave, where he performed an act so horrifying that the two orphans were traumatised into silence. I could go on and on and on about his accomplishments. If you don't think they count, then we really can't have an argument, can we?

Or, y'know, at least beat the shit out of them, ruin their lives, and permanently scar them. It's only fair. Legally sending them to Azkaban would be fine, but as they so smugly point out, that's not a possibility.

** Anything that talks about magical cores in wizards and witches. Still. It takes the magic out of it. If you have magic cores then squibs REALLY are the results of muggleborn stealing magic.

Why? Muggleborn could simply be born with magic cores and squibs without them because of genetics or something. I'm not too fond of Magic cores either I just don't see how they would imply stealing.

**** When you have magic cores, you then imply that there is something within the mage that is magic and not inexorably tied to their person. At that point magic becomes a possession separate from the user. This disconnect, between identity and the magic one has, means that magic can be considered independent from the user in such a way that 'cores' are their own thing and thusly the idea of them being moved between person to person that much easier. Then you apply 8000 years to this world and tell me that this doesn't justify the idea that magic can be stolen by people unable to do magic.

***** Just because there are magic cores doesn't mean they can be stolen. I always understood a magical core as essentially the part of a persons soul that's responsible for handling magic. You might be able to attack it and potentially even destroy it (for example by breaking a magically binding oath), but you won't be able to steal it just like you can't steal any other part of a person's soul.

****** You can't steal a person's soul because a person IS their soul. A magical core carries the connotation that there is a person WITH a magical core. NOTE THE CONNOTATION that the person and their magical core are now separable entities because magic is no longer intrinsic to the person but to the core that they bear.

A person with a magical core is a different concept compared to an intrinsically 'magical person'. When you have magical cores, your world becomes such that the only difference between a magical and a mundane is the presence of that magic core.

I reiterate: having a magical core suggests that there can be more than 1 or even less than. When you have vessels with magic cores you can have bodies that have their magic cores removed. Having a main reservoir of magic is a separate and much less objectionable concept.
