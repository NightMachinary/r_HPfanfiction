One instance I can think of had the Trio create a sphere made of blood mist around Voldemort and made it slowly collapse onto the Dark Lord.

Any other fics where they proactively use Lily's protection?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274529/1/An-Old-and-New-World]] (full version at ff2ebooks archive) has Harry and co. do something similar to Deathly Hallows where the sacrifical magic protections are extended to all of Harry's friends and family. (and also used to revive a lot of people)

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
