If I remember it right, afterer Sirius died he realizes nothing was more important than being prepared, so he drops History of Magic, Herbology, Potions, etc., and instead takes a magical pre-med class with Madame Pomfrey, a practical spells class, and an "enchanting things" class taught by Dumbledore.

I read it not too long ago, but can't remember the title and am having trouble seaching for it. Anybody remember this one?

Edit: Solved! [[/u/firingmahlazors]] found it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2527087/1/With-Malice-Aforethought][Here]].


** Are Crabbe and Goyle also in the enchanting class? Is so, then it sounds familiar to me as well. Dont remember the name though...

*** Yes, they are, I believe. If I recall correctly, the story gives them a bit more personality than usual.

**** Too bad the sequel is dead. The mentioned fic could stand alone IMO but there are compulsions inside me that wants to have all the loose ends neat. Thus, I'm hoping that the author will come back/isn't dead.

*** Thanks, but no. Most of the action happened during the school year, and there was no memorable pairing.
