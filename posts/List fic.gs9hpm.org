:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I cannot find a fanfic, nor remember the name.

It starts off with rescuing Ron and Hermione from Voldemort a d getting back to Hogwarts. The trio don't trust Dumbledore because he didn't bother the try and rescue Ron and Hermione. The trio refuse to stay in gryffindor and go into slytherin so snape can find out what happened when harry rescued Ron and Hermione because they refuse to speak about it. I think its pairings is ron/Hermione and snape/harry

Does anyone know it please?


** I don't think I've heard of this one although I enjoy the Snape/Harry pairing, if I find it I'll say, obviously, but if it's found before that could someone tell me? Thanks ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
