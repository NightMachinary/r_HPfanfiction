Hi guys!\\
I'm searching for a story (book, fanfiction,anime, original story) which has at least one of the following themes:

-a person needing to survive in foreign/unfriendly community (for example: being kidnapped and implemented as a slave in another society/planet, or suddenly having to live with aliens)

- being forced to follow the orders of someone against their wishes (through threat of violence, sexual stuff, or on threat of something precious taken from them i.e. family, home country, loved one)

-someone having to keep their identity or gender in a hostile environment a secret

I don't care about the genre, be it sci-fi, fantasy or whatever.\\
If it has sexual themes i don't care. if it contains slash, straight or some nonhuman (as in alien or humanoid) thats okay

If it contains lots of mature stuff thats also okay. Lots of worldbuilding preferred.

Things i already read are:\\
