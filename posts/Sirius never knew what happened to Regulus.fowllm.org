Sirius never found out what happened to Regulus, He only heard of his brother's death Through the ministry rumor mill. One minute he was pouring himself a cup of coffee in the Auror Briefing room the next he was sobbing with James Struggling to keep him standing, Bellowing for Kingsley to get him a chair.


** You do know neither Sirius nor James were aurors, right?

**** Rowling has long confirmed that neither Sirius nor Lily were employed anywhere, instead they were living of James fortune and working with the Order.

  Q: Harry often wondered about his parents lives before he died. What did Lily, James, Remus, Lupin and Sirius do after Hogwarts?

  JKR: To take Remus first, Remus was unemployable. Poor Lupin, prior to Dumbledore taking him in, lead a really impoverished life because no one wanted to employ a werewolf. The other three were full-time members of the Order of the Phoenix. If you remember when Lily, James and co. were at school, the first war was raging. It never reached the heights that the second war reached, because the Ministry was never infiltrated to that extend but it was a very bad time, the same disappearances, the same deaths. So that's what they did, they left school. James has gold, enough to support Sirius and Lily. So I suppose they lived foff a private income. But they were full-time fighters, that's what they did, until Lily fell pregnant with Harry. So then they went into hiding.

***** So, it depends on how much you believe post-book post-film JKR utterings. I don't accept even the Cursed Child, so I really don't care much about what she drops somewhere on the Twitter or in an interview.

****** I'm also a fan of “the death of the author,” but at the same time there are certain tidbits that I add to my head cannon - mostly little bits of trivia/spells or potions from the games

******* Yes, me too. I have nothing against Anthony Goldstein being Jewish (the name is mightily suggestive anyway).

** Oh Merlin this had to be the worst nightmare he ever had, he just has to open his eyes and it will all be okay. This had to be a nightmare. He just had to open his eyes and it will all go away. Regi is still alive. He is an idiot but there is no way he is dead. He opened his eye and saw James hovering over him with a worried expression on his face. If he kept it up he would have wrinkles before he was 25.

"I had a really weird dream James. Regulus was dead in the dream, can you believe it. Ha." He saw James face contort in despair and it felt like someone had stabbed a knife through his heart.
