There was a fic I had read where I believe Hermione was a Keeper for the house of Black but all I remember is 2 scenes. 1 she is pregnant and hides in her magical college's library from attackers and goes into labour and the second is at the same college and her bodyguards are playing with her kid(s) while she is in class... The second scene is really fuzzy but I remember in the first one there was a guy in the library who'd told her she was being too loud and then basically freaked that she was in labour. Someone please help!

Also it is NOT Arx Domus Nigrae by MaryRoyale on FFN... I thought it was but I just binged that fic
