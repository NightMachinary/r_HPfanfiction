Got around to "Department Of Mysteries Day" by Joshua The Evil Guy (the M-rated version), and despite some of the chapters being really not to my liking (crazy torture scenes, OP magic spirit inventions..), as a whole I am really enjoying it.

But the author keeps referencing other Time Loop fics that inspired him, and if this is a notable cliche in HP fan fiction, I seem to have entirely missed it.

Recommendations would be welcome - I prefer long fics and please warn if there is m/m slash

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][Dimension Hopping For Beginners]] has similar principles.

** Close but not quite it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][/Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time/]]. The groundhogging is in the backstory and has a period of about eight years between resets.

*** Agree about missing the mark. Read /Wastelands/ a long time ago. Thought it was sort of meh. Most everyone else loves it, though. Not really a Groundhog Day story.

To me, it is yet another DLP-bait, Harry-Potter-is-Wolverine fic. He drinks, he smokes, he fucks, he takes massive damage but gets better. The usual. It doesn't read like a Harry Potter story, more like the massive genre crossover it all but admits to in the author's initial blurb chapter.

The unwritten backstory's massive previous time loops were the only really interesting and unique part to me. Shame that wasn't what the fic was about. Instead, it is about Harry being on his last legs at the end of that process. But he's still a total badass. Of course.

** In my book, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] counts. One of the best time travel mechanisms I've ever encountered. Be warned that it isn't finished and isn't likely to ever be finished according to the author. First story arc is the best, where they are exploring the effect.

So, it isn't really a classic, can't-stop-it time loop, but if they don't keep intentionally setting things up to reset, they die for good.

Anyway, I liked it.

Interesting to note that, for whatever reason, /Groundhog Day/ style time loops are much less popular in Harry Potter fanfic than /Peggy Sue/ second chance stories. With a name like mine, I really should have written one by now...

*** Seconded on /Temporal Beacon/. In fact, that might need a reread...

*** I second this one, a real time-loop story. And I remember it clearly although I read it a while ago, which is always a good sign.

In this one the time loop is the entire span of Harry's life, so we only see the other loops through explanations/flashbacks. The author does a very good job showing how Harry changed over time.
