/AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet./

This is a really well written story, and is probably one of my favourites. It's a future Snape/Harriet story, so that might put you off, but so far there has been really no suggestion of anything like that happening and it's currently in the middle of Harriets 4th year.

  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-

** Omitting fics I've already seen mentioned...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]] and sequels will be the third best fem!Harry fic you'll find anywhere around here. Sadly abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9935403/1/Petal][Petal]] is a Avengers (or possibly just Iron Man) crossover with a hilariously OC Harry and some pretty wild colorings. The story itself isn't half bad, though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A-Butterfly-Effect][A Butterfly Effect]]: lauded by many (but hopefully not most) as the best fem!Harry fic they've ever read, this peculiar piece introduces inappropriately 'dark' themes and uses coherent plot structure to justify explicit and underage sexuality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1670793/1/The-Perfect-Girl][The Perfect Girl]] and sequels is a pretty poorly written piece of the typical Harry is forced into another gender and immediately becomes the trite feminine stereotype that we all know and hate. I love it to bits.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7868754/1/Behind-the-Veil][Behind the Veil]] has... excellent grammar.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10697365/1/Riddled][Riddled]] gets... okayish. Harry x Diary!Riddle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9904603/1/Phantasy][Phantasy]]: by the author of the acclaimed /Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is,/ this particular piece is typical Tsume Yuki writing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10298447/1/An-Avalanche][An Avalance]] is a weird one. Fem!Harry, along with Hermione, Luna, and Draco travel to Middle Earth and found a city. It's good, but accusations of 'might as well be OCs' run amok.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10131514/1/Back-to-the-Beginning][Back to the Beginning]] is fantastic in every sense of the world. Also a LotR crossover, this particular piece features a male Harry trapped in another's female body. The only problem I would apply to this is the slow rate of updating.

*** Ah, Petal, I say that one is a guilty pleasure at most. Not necessarily bad as far as writing goes, but there's the “why the heck does nothing really effing change” factor (because seriously, I cannot fathom why), as Harry's (or Amaryllis's) presence, in spite of all the things it could have changed in /some/ way, /any/ way, effectively changes nothing.

Not to mention the whole “let's make users vote on whether to kill Harry's kid or not”, which is just ... no, just no. I would have understood it had there been any ... you know, reason for it, but the way it is it just stinks; when you write stuff like that you either plan it ahead and know in advance or write as it goes and by default treat is as a no-problem thing unless something that changes it happens on-screen in the story, not ... this. That which we got there is, in my eyes, a major writing faux pas.

And yeah, I'd gotten through the entirety of what is of this story. Because I'd tried, because I like stories with female protagonists and that one had started promisingly. But as I read it just kept on getting more disappointing because oh how little Harry's presence there actually does and because in the end it just reads as a “Tony x OC who is not Harry and who is largely ignored by everyone around her for no conceivable reason” story.

Haven't read any of the other ones yet, though I'd stumbled on Tsume Yuki's Phantasy, went in, saw the word “Prolouge”, cringed, left, and never came back. Because stuff of that sort in chapter names or summaries does not fill me with hope for the overall quality of any story with mishaps of that sort.

***** I'm not sure at what point it was a year ago since I'd tried to read it ... I don't know, a few weeks ago or so.

Point is, wasted potential. It could have been great, it had the potential, there were plot hooks to take and use ... and it just doesn't happen. From the beginning (well, the part where they really get together) to the end, outside of the moments where we see wizards other than Harry/Amaryllis (and there aren't wizards later on, really), Harry's presence changes nothing at all, and there's not really any justification for it.

*A few examples:*

Harry does a deal with Fury so that Tony would get his father's files about the arc reactor tech? Yeah, Tony gets them in the exact same way as in the movies, at the same time, and Fury doesn't even mention Harry.

Early on, when the military wants to stop searching for Tony in Afghanistan, Harry chews them out for it and they change their decisions. Only, they'd found Tony in the exact same way as in the movies, so what's the point of the scene at all?

Tony's health is getting worse due to the contamination from the chest-sized arc reactor, and supposedly Harry can only apply some sort of salve to it which doesn't help much but helps some. Only, it's clear that it's supposed to change it somewhat and yet, once again, nothing really changes and Tony's condition worsens at the same rate. And there's already the “potions don't work on muggles because they have no magic of their own” thing that could have been used instead, but no, instead of that we get a change that is no change.

So yeah, could have been nice ... and it just doesn't happen. Sad, in a way.

*** Hmm ... yeah, I second “Fate be Changed”.

The character is pretty much an OC who could have turned the way she had even had Harry not been her past reincarnation. A few times she does things which some people would see as indicators of Mary-Sue--dom. She is much better as a burglar than Bilbo could hope to be and doesn't waste time throwing Bilbo out of the group and taking his place. Araceil has a weird-ish tendency to occasionally merge words that shouldn't be joined (“bestfriend”, “afterall”) or capitalise words for no reason outside of the fact that they seem important (“Canon”) even when rules of writing say it shouldn't happen.

However, Araceil's writing is still much better than what you'd usually find in fan-fiction (heck, her writing with no beta is better than many writers' with one), most of the conflict that occurs is internal or social in nature and that's something the character fumbles at often enough when it matters, the reason why Willowyn (the character) is skilled at what she does and willing to do it actually makes sense (oh boy does it do that), the plot twists are interesting, it's written in a way that doesn't violate canon as much (if at all) as it tends to happen, and the story is darn entertaining to read. Also, whatever romance could there possibly be doesn't feel forced at all, which I count as a huge plus because that's a rarity nowadays.

But Araceil's stories tend to be like that. All in all, I say she's a fairly good author and anything written by her should be given a chance.
