I recently found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] and really liked it. Are there any other good fics where we see the muggles' takes on things.


** also, linkffn(11111990) is a great fic. It is WIP with 1-2 updates per month. Hasn't happened yet, but I think pretty soon the muggle OC will learn about magic.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.
