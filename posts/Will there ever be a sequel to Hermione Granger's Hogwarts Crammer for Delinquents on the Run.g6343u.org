This is my all time favourite fic, I would pay good money for another one. Like I'd actually pay. Yes, a sequel could ruin it but I'm willing to take that risk. If you've not read it here's the link, it's one of those truly special fics and you need to read it.

** Listen. The idea to pay might have some merit. Find an author who's good, and pay them to make a sequel that is good quality. You could commision them to do it! It might work!

Actually, you could write it yourself f you are not willing to pay. That's the way life works, do it yourself or pay someone else to do it.

** Very high praise and honestly mate if there was money on the line I'd be willing to take a crack at my old behemoth, although being an underpaid teacher of small children it would have to wait for holiday time.
