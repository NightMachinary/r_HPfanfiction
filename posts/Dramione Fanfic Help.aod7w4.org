I just remember Hermione is the daughter of the dark lord. One of the scenes was Hermione and the death eaters were fighting at the Grimmauld place and Bellatrix tries to kill Hermione, but Narcissa steps in front of the killing curse. The second scene I remember is Hermione kills Ron and leaves him on the water shores making it look like an accident!

thank you :)


** Have you tried Dramioneasks @ Tumblr? They have a much larger and more active community than reddit has, so you're more likely to find what you're looking for over there.

Alternatively, try [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]]! The community in this sub doesn't like Dramione a lot.
