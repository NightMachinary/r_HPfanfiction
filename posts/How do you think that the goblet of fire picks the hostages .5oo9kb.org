I am doing a story based in forth year and I want harry to have a different hostage for harry. the way I plan on making the goblet pick the hostages in my story is that it will pick the person that the champion spent the most time with on the night of the yule ball.

for Krum and Cedric that was there dates

for Fleur she probably ditched roger as soon as she could and spent most of the night with her little sister.

for harry in canon he spends most of the night in the company of Ron but I plan to make him actually have a good time with his date.

How do you think the hostages were pick if it was not just picking the person that the champions spent the most time with on the night of the yule ball?


** Huh? The goblet didn't pick the hostages. Once it picked the champions it shut down. The hostages were picked by the host committee and judges.

** I can't remember the hostage selection process ever being explicitly laid out, but I do remember that I always thought the various Heads of the schools (perhaps in consultation with Heads of House where applicable) chose the hostages.

*** One of the problems with that is do you really think Karkaroff would really let Hermione be Krums hostage if he had any other option

**** I don't see a real canon reason as to why Karkaroff wouldn't let Hermione be the choice. The dude pretty much does anything and everything to make sure Krum is happy. Do you think Karkaroff is going to risk getting on Krum's bad side by importing a random girl Krum doesn't care about from Durmstrang? And, it's not like Karkaroff is going to go up to Dumbledore and say Hermione cannot be Krum's pick because she's English and a Mudblood.

So yeah, I'm of the opinion that the goblet had nothing to do with who was picked as hostages for that task.

**** That is a fair point. Perhaps the contract, drawn up by three ministries and their respective school Heads, stipulates the criteria for eligible hostages and, lacking other options, Igor had to choose Hermione because she was the only one that fit?

It's that or the Goblet chooses the eligible hostage (using the same criteria as last paragraph) and the Headmaster or Mistress is only to obey.

I know which one I prefer.

** While I don't think the Goblet chooses the hostages, I think it's fine if you wish to make it so in your story. It's your story after all.

I'm fairly certain Fleur's little sister wasn't actually there, not really a reason for her to. We don't see anyone's family in it after all, so maybe goa different path. Maybe the Goblet can magically access who's the person they've thunk a about more ever since selected. That ads up, since Cedric would most likely have been thinking about his new girlfriend a whole lot, Viktor was basically stalking Hermione at one point, and you can spin it as Fleur actually not having that many close friends at beauxbattons because all the girls are terribly jealous of her and the boys can't mantain a conversation for mroe than two words, so she thinks of her family a whole lot.

And Harry, well, we were in Harry's head, I'm pretty sure we can all attest Ron Weasley was the main subject in his head. So I think it fits. If this is who you wish to change, then simply make Ron never leave Harry after his name coming out, have them reconcile sooner, have Harry not care about the "break up" for one reason or another.

** Just pick the person they care about the most. It's a MAGIC goblet, it doesn't need a stopwatch to make decision.

Also, IIRC, doesn't canon Fleur end up fucking Roger in the shrubbery?
