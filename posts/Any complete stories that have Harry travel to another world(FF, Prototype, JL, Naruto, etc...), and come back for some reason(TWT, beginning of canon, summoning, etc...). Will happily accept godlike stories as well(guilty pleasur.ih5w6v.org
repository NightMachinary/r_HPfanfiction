My only request is that if he is strong, he doesn't lose his memory via Dumbledore obliviating him(happened in a FF cross, completely ruined the story for me), his power/s don't get retconned half way through(happened in a story where he had really OP metamorphigus skills), or something similar. Whether he's weak, or strong, I want his powers, and memory to remain intact upon returning to the wizarding world.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

*** Never mind. Just read the summary. I'll bookmark it for now, god knows i'm always looking for decent Harry Potter crossovers. What is his general power level in this?

***** Cool. Whenever I see Harry Potter crossed over with Avengers, I always think he should be beefed up. I mean HP magic is already pretty powerful in such a universe, but compared to the guys above street level, barely worth mentioning.
