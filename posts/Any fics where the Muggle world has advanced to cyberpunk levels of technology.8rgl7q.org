I'm just imagining a bunch of highly augmented Muggle borns coming to Hogwarts and trying to think about what sort of societal impact that would have. Obviously the technology and magic rules have to be ignored for it to work, or maybe not that'd actually be a great crack fic.


** I would love to read a crossover with Shadowrun

*** I know of one, but it doesn't focus on the cyber aspect at all. It's a fluffy fun fic in which Harry is turned into a Shadowrun dragon. It's better than it sounds, I swear :') the writer is Scottish and wrote one of my favourite McGonagalls ever. linkffn(Enter the Dragon by Doghead Thirteen)

  It began with a quirk of timing. It continued because dragons, such as what 8-year-old Harry Potter just turned into, are large and difficult to control. Fortunate for everyone he's a nice kid, eh? Shadowrun and Rifts crossover. You have now been warned.

*** Actually, amusingly I would say the opposite is happening, the magical society in this fic is actually magnitudes more advanced than the muggle one, and it looks to me that muggle society advances in technology are partially due to bleedoff from the immense power of the magical revolution that occurred in this fic.

I actually quite like premises like these, because when you have power to bend reality of course your society would be more advanced.

****** If you like d&d, there is this fic called hsrry potter and the d20. Its about a player character transported to potter verse, where both thematics clash. It makes fun of both worlds without bashin, has some of the best hermione, ron, draco and snape banter I had read so far, its very informative about the mentality and habits of munchkins. It stopped updating in 2015, but the author returned this January with a new chapter, so... hope you like it.
