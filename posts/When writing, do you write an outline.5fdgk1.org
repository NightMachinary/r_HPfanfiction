When writing, do you make a basic outline of how your story is going to go? Does it include lore? I personally have an entire document just for my stories lore and history.


** Usually, I'll have some basic outline that lists the most important events that need to happen and write from that, but rarely any lore or history. The only time I'll have more than an outline is sometimes when I include OCs that play a big part. Then I might write a little bit on them. Like a paragraph or two on if they have siblings, what they look like, anything special about them, like if they know French, or if they're especially knowledgeable about something because of x.

** I write a basic outline. Usually it's just a string of ideas that I want to include (usually the ideas that spurred me to even think of writing it). Sometimes I'll write a basic chapter skeleton to control the pacing, sometimes I don't. I don't go that in depth, rather, I like to let the story follow it's own path so it feels more natural rather than coming off like I'm strictly trying to hit every single bullet point.

Sometimes I write small little background pieces that don't necessarily show up in story. Things like motivation, of pieces of history that make someone act the way they are. Friends, family, etc. If only to just keep a recurring character consistent throughout a story. This could be 50 words or 500 words.

I don't overplot anything. For example, in my story "Euphoria" I have a mere 7k words of notes, while the story itself is 117k. And, some of the notes are just bullet points of snippets I want to include, while others are actual snippets I think will be interesting to include.

** I have a timeline, rather than an outline. Actually I have several overlapping timelines lol. The backstory is extremely well plotted, and includes lots of little tidbits that will probably never be mentioned in the story (wanna know how Harry got that scar around his left wrist when he was 7? Yeah, no one else cares either lol). The timeline of future events is a very very loose outline of where I'm going, with occasional blurbs that I'd like to maybe include. And as I write I fill in the different timelines.

Technically I use a printed calendar and a crap ton of sticky notes for most of this. But that's the basic idea.

** Not for my fanfiction, but for my more serious projects I do have them, yes. They mostly include whats happening in a story, with notes as to what needs explaining then, where certain lines of events are at that point and so on.

** I outline major plot elements that I want to hit, generally. If I've had flashes of inspiration of dialogue I want to include I add those in too. So it looks something like this:

-x goes to y

#+begin_example
  -x is looking for z

  -gets in fight with a

  -x: "lorem ipsum"
#+end_example

-a gets murdered

#+begin_example
  -in the hall with the revolver
#+end_example

-x blamed for murder

#+begin_example
  -b saw them fight at y
#+end_example

Generally it's no more detailed than that.

*** u/Kazeto:
#+begin_quote
  -x: "lorem ipsum"

  -a gets murdered
#+end_quote

Sorry for a random comment but I just had to say that this is probably the most random one-liner I've seen in a while.

***** And?

It does not mean it cannot be found funny by anyone. And most people who write placeholder dialogue generally go for stuff that actually resembles a dialogue or at least is an onomatopoeia of talking, which makes the lorem ipsum seem random and weird and funny.

******* Because you do not have my sense of humour and are not the exact kind of person I am. Everyone is different, and I find the usage of this particular placeholder as a one-liner to be random and amusing; it does not have to feel that way to you.

** I have a lot more lore than outline sometimes. Like whenever a little bit of how something /could/ work hits me or some history, I'll write it down. Worldbuilding is really stress-free because you don't have to worry about where it fits in the plot, you can just let your mind roam and speculate over the ramifications of whatever pops into it.

This is for my original fiction too, though.

** If I'm feeling stuck I'll make an outline or scene decomposition outlines. My most recent outline is 3501 words and it gives me a good idea about how to go into the story. But lately I've found that when I make an outline, it takes away from my motivation to write the story. As for lore, I do make separate documents for it.

** Well, it depends. For my main work, I have a lot of lore (to keep the whole world consistent), and a general outline for what has to happen one way or another. For anything long-ish that's not my main work I tend to have a bit of lore with a lot of unexplored ambiguity and rough listing of things that I think may happen if nothing gets changed, with the list being subject to change as needed. For shorter stuff, I generally just wing it. And one-shots (the truly short stuff) go two ways: either they are planned from the beginning to the end or they are just random stuff I write as I go.

That said, my main work is something that actually has to be kept tidy (yay for professionalism), the long-ish stuff are things I write when someone asks for it so they get what they ask for (more or less), the shorter stuff are things that happen when someone asks for /something/ that fits to whatever they need it to fit to but without any other limitations, and the one-shorts are either snippets of ideas that don't want to leave my mind or warm-up writing exercises. So that's why it's all treated differently.

** I don't outline the whole story before I start writing. I start writing with an idea, and usually sometime during the first few pages the idea forms into a plot. At this point, I start writing down the important things I want to mention later on, the main plot points, in a separate document, and with time this becomes an outline.

In the story I'm currently working on, I've now reached a point where I've planned the next several chapters in bullet points - to make sure that the content drives the story along, and is interesting and important.

For characters (the OCs): they start as a small idea, to serve a certain purpose, but I only discover their "true character" as I write about them and how they interact with others.

I don't really have any lore, but there I have background information on certain things that I write down, that don't necessarily end up in the story.

Generally, the longer a story is, the more detailed my plot/ or even chapter outlines become. Though it has happened that I have changed all of it because of an idea that came to me while writing, and that was just much better than the things I'd written down before.

** Yes. Stories that I take seriously have an outline otherwise I would end up with no ending.

** I outline my stories pretty much every single time.

I'm not necessarily sure if /everyone/ needs to outline: according to Stephen King, he seemingly wings it by placing his characters in a situation and then letting things unfold, at least according to /On Writing./ Not using a detailed outline seems to work for him.

However, for myself, I find outlines to be ideal for me to write coherently and avoid macrosopic errors as far as the drafting / writing process goes. I would hate to write a first draft and then come back to it and have to significantly alter entire swathes of it on a narrative, characterized-based, or thematic level. (And that's just for one chapter. Worse be having to do so in the middle of a long work)

As such, a lot of my revisions currently, given my outlining process, focus more on style and more mechanics-based fixes, rather than ascending to the level of outright narrative or characterization changes. It does tend to mean that I get to that first draft later than sooner, but it's a process that currently works for me.

In any case, take everything I say below here with a grain of salt, especially since I'm still trying to find the ideal process for myself.

My current outlining process depends on what kind of story I'm going for though.

For oneshots that run below novellete length, a single, long outline generally suffices, though not always.

For longer works, I tend to use multiple outlines. First, an outline that hits the major points of the entire work itself. Then, an outline for each major narrative arc within the work I intend to trace. Finally, a detailed outline for each individual chapter. For chapter outlines, I tend to break those down scene by scene, with a detailed list of what occurs in order in each scene.

I tend to use a boring combination of headings with bulleted or numbered lists. Occasionally I use images as well, but headings + lists make up the majority of my outlines. (The actual points in the list however could easily be a paragraph or more long however, especially for my more detailed chapter outlines) I've tried mind-mapping before, but it hasn't quite worked out for me.

For me though, outlining includes more than just strict plotting: I'd also have notes on characterization, useful bits from canon or other areas of research I might find relevant, small scenes or bits of dialogue I might consider incorporating, any themes, motifs, of symbolic gestures I want to hone in on, places, events, world-building in general, timelines etc. This is more significant for longer works of course and with oneshots, I tend to wrap all of that up into a single Word doc, whereas in longer works, it's divided into multiple interrelated documents.

As far as constructing the outline itself, I've been using MS Word to do that, and transfer later to Google Docs. I've been messing around with QuollWriter and Scrivener lately though and hopefully that'll help boost my ability to construct effective outlines.

In any case, that's my current workflow with respect to outlines and I'd be curious to see what other people do.

** I write a (very) rough outline - more like an exposé, detailing the background of the story and future plot developments, but it's subject to revision as the plot develops while I write.
