1. Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms, kissing him gently as they stood, entwined on the balcony.

2. Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms and kissed him gently. They stood on the balcony, entwined.


** u/deleted:
#+begin_quote
  Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms, kissing him gently as they stood, entwined on the balcony.
#+end_quote

This sort of formation lets you remove the phrase between commas while keeping the meaning of the sentence the same:

#+begin_quote
  Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms, entwined on the balcony.
#+end_quote

Snape is entwined on the balcony while he pulls Palpatine into his arms. Not what you were going for.

Omit the second comma and you have:

#+begin_quote
  Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms, kissing him gently as they stood entwined on the balcony
#+end_quote

That's conveying the meaning you want. The 'entwined on the balcony' specifies how they were standing, not how Snape was pulling.

Compare to the second version:

#+begin_quote
  Snape pulled Palpatine into his arms and kissed him gently. They stood on the balcony, entwined.
#+end_quote

In narration, your readers will typically insert a silent 'and then' between sentences: Snape kissed Palpatine, and then they stood on the balcony. That's not really what you're after.

Also, it makes the "stood" part more important and the "entwined" part an afterthought. You want to emphasize that they are clinging to each other like strands on a rope.

** In both cases, it should be "stood entwined" (without commas) because they're connected verbs. As long as you have that, both are grammatically sound, but stylistically I would go with the first.

** I personally would take out the sentence after "stood" in the first one. "as they stood entwined on the balcony".

Does that make sense?

Alternately, in the second one, I would move "entwined" after stood. So it would read "they stood entwined on the balcony."

But, that might be more stylistic than grammatically correct.

** What the hell are you writing that requires Snape kissing the Emperor of the Sith?

*** These days I've honestly learned it's better not to ask sometimes. This feels like one of those times.

*** A story, I presume.

Insert a rimshot at your leisure.
