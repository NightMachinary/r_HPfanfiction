As the title of this states, I am looking for Care of Magical Creature fics, with Harry still taking it and enjoying it. I know that this sort of thing might not be popular, but I have hope.

Preferably taking the main focus of the fic.

It will also be acceptable if Harry is taking care of some creatures, either at Hogwarts or somewhere else.

Any help will be appreciated, thanks.


** There was one I read but can't remember the name of(been looking for a couple weeks) where Harry is the only one to continue on to NEWT COMC. The gang gets their schedules at the beginning of sixth year and sort of sighs in relief at having dropped the class: "Well at least we don't have to worry about COMC anymore. I feel bad for Hagrid, but I'm not surprised no one is taking the NEWT class" and Harry just looks up like "Huh? I'm still taking it."

I remember Hagrid being surly about nearly everyone dropping the class, but Harry cheers him up by saying that since he's the only student they can study/play with any creature they want.

No idea what the rest of the fic was about, I just remember this scene. Maybe it'll jog someones memory :D
