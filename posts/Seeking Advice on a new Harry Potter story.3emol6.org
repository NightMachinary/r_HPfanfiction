I have spent many years reading and writing fanfiction in multiple genres. However throughout that time despite having read plenty of Harry Potter, I have never been able to get past a chapter or two when it comes to writing a story. I don't necessarily know why that is, but I like to think that it was mainly because a lack of proper foundation for the story. I wanted to see if the people in this community could help me create and critique this general outline. (There are some ideas that I will note, and hopefully you can help me pinpoint which are better from a storytelling perspective.)

So first and foremost as a writer I am never a fan of bashing. I feel that every character particularly in Harry Potter is flawed. Sometimes these flaws are more apparent than others.

*The title* of the story is: *Something Unforgivable*

*The summary* will be something to the effect of: Harry's first trial in the treacherous tournament is one by fire. Underaged, Untrained, and unsure he is left to face these tasks alone. Although an ambitious Slytherin simply shows him a solution that's Something Unforgivable.

*The Introduction*

The story would open in the fourth year. Either it would be slightly AU, or a standard opening. The AU timeline would have a somber Harry having skipped on going to the World Cup because he is still rather shaken up after witnessing the death of his would be Godfather Sirius at the hands of Dementors. Additionally instead of utilizing the Timeturner once to save Sirius, Harry tried(alone) and failed multiple times to save him. He feels responsible.

These AU notes obviously leave his relationship with his friends on rockier ground than the original story. However the general introduction reveals his relationship within his circle of friends with Hermione and Ron is strained due to Ron's jealousy with Harry's name being drawn from the goblet.

In this story Harry doesn't find the help of Moody. Although he also doesn't have Hermione's ear. He doesn't find out that the first task is dragons with Hagrid's assistance.

This all accumulates to a Harry who is both untrained and unsure of what lies ahead. Then he finds himself face to face with a dangerous dragon with no way of backing out. In the heat of battle he finds himself thinking to the most notable lesson he received this year in the Defense Against the Dark Arts.

The three unforgivable curses.

The chapter ends and the story begins with Harry using the killing curse to defeat the dragon and claiming his golden egg to the stunned silence of the crowd.

*The Aftermath*

I feel one of the big things that happens in fanfiction is that everyone wants their hero to be greater than what the original was. To do something amazing and different. Frankly this story isn't much different in that regard. However the means in which these things were accomplished, I wanted to change. Authors end up making Harry defeat enemies earlier, or flex his magical muscles. I didn't want to do that in this story. I feel that the emotional and moral compass in most fanfiction stories is lost in favor of telling a story where Harry walks a gray line kicking ass and taking names.

So in the outline I have this "Ambitious Slytherin" set to be Daphne Greengrass. I know, this is cliche now these days. Frankly I am open to ideas. I could just as easily make her an OC.

Moving forward Harry is under the political backlash of utilizing an unforgivable curse. People believe he is on his path to becoming the next dark lord. It further entrenches the belief that some have that he put his own name in that cup.

Daphne's character slowly worms her way into the gaps in Harry's life and tries her best to fill the role that was formerly filled by both Hermione and Ron. Meanwhile Harry feels like he is just forced to coast through the world with no control of his life. He feels he is in a competition where he is sorely and hopelessly outgunned, and he still has no idea what the second task is, or how he will survive.

Here you see the story divulge into two major character arcs. Harry begins to use Daphne as a gauge to the morality of using these curses, as he feels no different from using them. He questions whether or not he should have so brazenly taken the dragons life even though he realizes now he had other options(Although equally dark).

Daphne on the other hand begins to use Harry's name and her position at his side to try and arm him for the task as well as securing her own climb to power within the Slytherin household and beyond. Although the means to which she gets the answers to these questions is definitely on the darker side of the morally gray as Harry struggles to cling to the light.

*The Rest of the Year*

Daphne's own ambitions are brought to light first for the reader with her claim of wanting to make the Wizarding World a better place and wants to invest in it's future. Although you see her means of doing that aren't through 'The Light'. She manipulates and sometimes resorts to violence in order to obtain power.

Perhaps this is most notably emphasized when Harry has chosen to take Katie Bell to the dance. Daphne the night before the dance ensures that won't happen, and arrives to be on Harry's arm when Katie doesn't show.

Harry over the course of the year outside of his normal group of friends finds himself making new ones, and finds how influential he can actually be. (Varys from Game of Throne's line of "Influence grows like a weed" could not be any more apparent) His influence in his circle grows through his good deeds as opposed to Daphne's darker one.

This influence from both parties leaves them at the end of the year with more information. What would be Voldemort's return this time instead is met with resistance, and an ambush defeats the Dark Lord. However here you get to see the contrast between both Harry and Daphne with the first time the two of them display their "True Colors" in a scene together, and not dancing on eggshells. You get to see that while Daphne had initially tried to push Harry to the darkest of magic, he clung to the light and used it to defeat Voldemort. Meanwhile Daphne continued to cling to the dark and used spells of that nature to defeat Death Eaters.

This leaves our two protagonists with two very opposite ideologies as they intend to move forward with quite a deal of influence over the present wizarding world.

*The Twist and the End*

So admittedly I haven't thought too much about how I wanted to end the story. It is written like a story that could go on much further, but I don't really want it to

However one twist and ending I have toyed with is that throughout the story Daphne likes to believe she is the one in charge, and a step ahead of Harry. She believes with being this step ahead she is able to dictate their future doing forward, and whatever a future between the two of them could entail as she strives to climb in power and shape the future of the wizarding world.

Then as we come to a closing Daphne reveals that she has used Harry this entire time. That she did what she had to in order to secure her own future in the wizarding world now that there is a huge void left by the death of Lucious Malfoy, and how she intends to fill that void just as she filled the void of Harry's closest friends in his life now.

Harry proceeds to reveal in kind that he knew Daphne's true colors all along. That through all of the conflict that happened over the year the one lesson of her's he remembered was to keep his friends close, and enemies closer. Through her lessons she had made him a soldier from a boy. He ends with the fact that he knew every move she ever made.

This is where he reveals the time turner that he kept in his possession ever since last year as well as his invisibility cloak. Implying that he followed her every day out of sight and well disguised. And with that knowledge he also reveals that he has already filled the void that Lucious left behind in business, as the world doesn't need another just like him, particularly after all of the unforgivable things she has done.

I felt that this would be a fun ending to a story that was morally up and down with a lot of light and dark. Although I would like to hammer out the cliches, perhaps have suggestions for the development. Things like that. Finally if you enjoyed reading the outline. (I have no idea if these type of posts seeking help are allowed here. I'm sorry if they aren't.)


** A few comments and questions --- potential plotholes --- come to mind. In this, I am assuming that your universe is as canon-like as possible, subject to the specifically outlined changes and divergences.

- Why does Harry make the attempts to rescue Sirius on his own? Hermione is the one with the time-turner. Even if we suppose that Hermione is incapacitated for some reason, why does Harry have it at the end, if she had to return it? Did he steal it from her at the end of PoA? Why would he do that?

- Why /isn't/ Moody (a.k.a. Barty Crouch Jr.) helping Harry? In canon, he put Harry into the Tournament and helped him in order to orchestrate his abduction for Voldemort's restoration at the end of the Third task. If he isn't going to help him in your fic (or if he isn't impersonating Moody), why did he put him into the tournament in the first place?

- Harry killing the dragon with the Killing Curse seems implausible. BCJ in OotP suggested that children casting it would barely give him a nosebleed; and I don't buy that Harry is so atypically "powerful" or could even muster the mindset needed to cast it properly; and, for that matter, it probably takes more Killing to kill a dragon than a human: there's a reason they're supposed to be dangerous. (Also, recall that in OotP he /did/ witness his godfather die, and he still couldn't manage to sustain a Cruciatus afterwards.)

- For that matter, the bit with Harry "feels no different from using them things properly after casting Dark spells" is ripping out an integral part of his character. It's uncommon for a male lead, but Harry /feels/; he feels more and more strongly than most of his friends. It's why Dementors affect him more than others, but also why he can cast a Patronus to drive off a hundred of them. It's why he cannot restrain himself around Umbridge, yet perseveres through any pain and danger. It's why he cannot "close his mind" for Occlumency, but manages to drive Voldemort out of his mind anyway by concentrating on the feelings of his that Voldemort cannot tolerate.

- On a related note, if you're going to turn the graveyard ambush around, the only time I could see two fourteen-year-olds pull it off is /before/ Voldemort is restored, when it suffices to kill or incapacitate Pettigrew and babymort. Once the grown-up Death Eaters show up, they would make short work of Daphne, unless you make both her and Harry Powerful beyond all reason and taste.

- "The Light" is fanon --- usually Dumbledore-bashing fanon. There is no "The Light". There are people who practice the Dark Arts and revel in them, there are people who wish to eradicate Muggleborns and rule society based on their blood purity, and there are people, led by the likes of Dumbledore and Amelia Bones, who oppose the first two groups --- often quite ruthlessly.

- The twist ending, again, no, I don't buy Harry having known it from the beginning, successfully concealing it from Daphne. Harry cannot manipulate his way out of a proverbial paper bag, and he doesn't have the time or the margin of error to learn in your fic.

*** In the flashback you see that Harry and Hermione fail their first time going back using the Time Turner. Seeing Hermione getting injured on their first adventure, Harry takes the timeturner from her and goes back alone despite her protests. He begins to loop through the day over and over again to save Sirius. Naturally this makes his relationship with Hermione oil and water.

In truth it is a fanfiction paradox, because we know that if he had gone back with his friends he could have saved Sirius. If he stuck with the normal timeline, it would have worked at some point. However with Harry going back alone, he failed and lost his god father. I think this is what makes really great AU's. Where a single choice can change the outcome of the future.

I answered this below but I was just going to go for since Harry desires to be alone during the early part of the year and hiding from pretty much everyone, he never encounters Moody. The only time he really spends with Moody is during class and notably the unforgivables lesson.

The Killing Curse. I feel that desperate times call for desperate measures. This is played on later in the story with the ideas of light and dark, good and evil. The idea that what if magic was just purely magic. There is no light or dark. The public has taught the many that using certain abilities brands someone a dark wizard, but here Harry feels no different after using one.

Now as for the power behind the curse, I didn't even know about that line frankly. However I have always thought that the killing curse is unstoppable, and depicted it as such in this story. One cast rips the soul from the target's body.

Feeling. Don't misunderstand me. It isn't that he wont have moral struggle with the consequences of using the curse. This is integral to the story as a whole. The crux is that he doesn't actually feel any different after using the killing curse, and this bothers him. Because that goes against everything he has been taught.

The Graveyard. This is one area I haven't taken a big enough look at. The idea was that Daphne finds out Draco knows something. Then both she and Harry work together to find out the full truth of what is to come in the tournament, and proceed to prepare for it.

Then in the graveyard Voldemort intends to use a dark ritual. Daphne performs the dark alchemical ritual that killed her mother, that she successfully performed. Although she doesn't reveal to Harry what her full plan does. She tells him that she just needs to worry about Voldemort.

The ritual sacrifices the life and magic of those within the circle and transfers it to a target based on blood. Everything nearly unravels as both Harry and Voldemort begin to share the power being absorbed(Although Harry being granted a significantly greater portion of it). A showdown commences, and Voldemort is narrowly defeated. Not going to go into much further detail. Those were just the ideas bouncing around in my head. Perhaps killing Voldemort's child form is better, who knows.

He hasn't known strictly from the beginning. However he reveals that ever since Katie Bell disappeared at the ball that night, and Daphne showed up. He realized that she needed to be watched, less the rest of his friends start disappearing at inopportune times. So he began to stalk her from his invisibility cloak and time turner. It's not so much trying to manipulate, it is just to that Daphne doesn't get to do whatever she wants in the wake of destruction left behind after the tri wizard tournament.

#+end_quote

Firstly, why does that make them "oil and water"? Hermione is injured, and Harry has to complete the quest without her. It's not that different from what happened the prior year, /twice/. Why would it ruin their relationship?

For that matter, it still doesn't explain why Harry still has a time-turner, since Hermione would have needed to return it at the end of the year.

I am seeing at least four points of divergence, three of them implausible given what you've written.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

And then, Moody, who /really/ needs to talk to him, tells him, "Potter, see me after class." And, because Harry is is not an indiot (at this point), he is going to stay after class, and talk to Moody.

#+begin_quote
  The Killing Curse. I feel that desperate times call for desperate measures. This is played on later in the story with the ideas of light and dark, good and evil.

#+end_quote

If despair were enough, it'd be a lot more popular, because war makes for a lot of desperate people; and the notion that everyone was somehow just wrong about he Dark Arts, including people who practice them regularly, people who oppose those who practice them regularly, and people who used to practice them regularly but no longer do, are wrong is the biggest point of divergence yet. Yes, Rowling is very ambiguous about what makes Dark Arts bad beyond that damage they inflict often cannot be reversed, but there have to be reasons, even if you have to come up with plausible ones. There are dozens of good interpolations out there. "Everyone is wrong about the Dark Arts but me!" is not one of them.

#+begin_quote
  Now as for the power behind the curse, I didn't even know about that line frankly. However I have always thought that the killing curse is unstoppable, and depicted it as such in this story. One cast rips the soul from the target's body.
#+end_quote

If any teenager could cast the darned thing, a third of every Hogwarts graduating class would be dead, and another third doing life in Azkaban. (I'm exaggerating, but you'd have at least a murder or two per cohort.) It's not like it's obscure. Also worth noting is that during Voldemort's first uprising, Aurors were given special dispensation to use Unforgivables, so it's not this terrible taboo either.

And what has he been taught on the subject? Practically nothing, as far as I can recall.

#+end_quote

Draco knowing would require Lucius or Narcissa knowing. But, Voldemort doesn't trust Lucius, and for very good reasons. Lucius /does not/ want Voldemort back, for reasons that became quite apparent when Voldemort did come back. Lucius, if asked to help, is more likely than not to turn Babymort and Pettigrew in to the Aurors in order to clear his name and continue his cushy and influential life.

#+end_quote

OK, so now you have a 15-year-old that has shown no particularly extraordinary talents before, managing unprecedented magic (that killed her mother) on the first attempt, without any opportunity to try variants or experiment; and all that without any of its targets noticing. Why does she even bother going to class?

#+end_quote

If you're going to go with this uber!Daphne, why not just follow the premise to its logical conclusion and have her take over, rather than shoehorning in a "happy ending" that requires implausible social competence from Harry? There is no fundamental reason that Harry has to win or that it's up to Harry to stop her.

**** On second thought, perhaps I'm being too harsh and critical. I think that you are being very generous by contributing your time to augment the fandom with your fic, and diligent (and brave) submitting your outline for "peer review" and trying to fill any holes before you write them.

I stand by what I wrote, but please take my comments as things that can be improved in your outline before you take the time to write out the prose.

** Alright, here are my thoughts:

First I'll disect every part of the story. Some of the criticism would destroy your entire line of reaosning, so let it be more of a readers opinion than anything else.

#+begin_quote
  *The Introduction*
#+end_quote

Its a good premise. Make sure the writer knows whats up. Spend time writing about Sirius' death and maybe sneak in one or two dialouges with Hermione and Ron to establish the gap between them and Harry. Spend time on his depressed state of mind and coming from that, find a reason for him to ignore Hagrid and therefore the tip about the dragon. For Moody: just don't make him Barty in disguise. Let it be the real Moody.

I buy the premise that Harry finds himself in a life or death scenario and thinks of using the AK. But if you want to stay within canon, he needs to have some serious hate against something or someone to be able to cast it.

#+begin_quote
  *The Aftermath*
#+end_quote

First question: How do you intend to make Harry above the law? Casting an Avada Kedavra so publicly would ship him straight to Azkaban. If I recall correctly, casting an AK itself is a crime, not killing a human with it doesn't matter. Theres an entire school of witnesses and most of them do not like him at that point in time. Not to mention the already branded Crouch senior sitting in the audience. With Fudge being Fudge and Malfoy sr. hanging on his ear, I just can't see Harry being a free man after this. This reeks like plot-hole and cheap outs of the nature of "Dumbledore lets his political muscle play that I am making up on the spot - move along reader".

Second question: Do you want to make this a romance?

If your answer is *yes*, then proceed with caution, if it is *no* then here goes:

Get Daphne Greengrass out of the picture. Let Harry deal with this alone. There are literally thousands of these fics out there, where some sidecharacter steps up and becomes Harry's sidekick, leading/helping him through his challenges. In my opinion, the most interesting aspect of your fic would be the alienation of Harry from his old comrades and friends. I can't believe I'm writing this, but lets make Harry a "Lone Wolf" character. You could reason that the Avada Kedavra does something with him. Maybe he has to admit that he loves the feeling of so much power rushing through his wand.

But if you just really need Daphne in this (and since shes your second protagonist, well...) then please make sure you never ever ever ever ever call hert the "Ice Queen" or some shit. Don't make her this noble girl that seeks to "rule" the "Snake Den". Slytherin is a Hogwarts house. Its not a parliament. They are children, not politicians. They may be ambitious, but fifteen year olds do not grasp the details and intricacies of the political game. Don't make Hogwarts an Anime-HighSchool.

#+begin_quote
  *Rest of the Year*
#+end_quote

Well, ok. A lot of sidestepping, eggshell dancing and Daphne securing her place next to Harry. I'd say thats alright.

What I have my problems with is this "information gathering". I mean, you wouldn't be the first fiction with Hogwarts being the pivot of political intrigue and the major marketplace of information. But you also would have me roll my eyes constantly at this. Too many authors forget that we are still dealing with children here. Parents do not, never ever, and especially not when they could get in real trouble for it, let their children in on their powerplays, let alone the delicate and easily destroyed plan of their master returning. Draco Malfoy has always been an exception to the rule.

Also, I'm never cool with some teenager wiping the floor with a Death Eater (except for Harry - Chosen one and all). It makes no sense. But hey, same as above. You wouldn't be the first one to do it.

#+begin_quote
  *The Twist and the End*
#+end_quote

Since you admit that you still need time thinking about it I#äll just point out one thing that is essential.

#+begin_quote
  This is where he reveals the time turner that he kept in his possession ever since last year as well as his invisibility cloak.
#+end_quote

You NEED to hint on this at the very least. And not just hints of the nature of "only reader who follow cloesly will get it". No, this must be major hints. Ending the story with "I knew all along" out of the blue is one of the most disappointing ways to end a story.

So, yea. My final feedback would be to give the story some major thought at the beginning of the Aftermath. Once again, Harry not going to prison for this makes no sense without a decent explanation. Having Daphne in it seems unnecessary at first, but it seems you want toi make this story as much about her as you want to make it about Harry. I can say that I'm not a fan of this for the reasons stated above.

But if you really want to write this, go ahead. Just do me a favor and do some research on the cliches of Harry/Daphne fics. Especially the "Ice Queen persona" thing is so overdone that by now there are already parodies written about it.

I'm pretty sure that you actually have to cast it at a human for it to be a crime. I suspect that BCJ was skating on thin ice casting the Imperius on students (which could be excused as training --- Aurors probably undergo similar exercises), but he did kill the spider with AK.

Not even Harry. Chosen or not, Harry outright loses or retreats from /every/ pitched battle against an adult DE in DH. Why would he be able to pull off anything of the sort in GoF, and without the benefit of Hermione's tutelage? (Ambushes and such are a different matter, of course, but then any "teenager" who can cast Petrificus Totalus can do that, under the right circumstances.)

  For that matter, only BCJ and Pettigrew knew Voldemort's restoration plan before his actual restoration. There wouldn't be any information to gather.

And especially not by children.

Not even Harry. Chosen or not, Harry outright loses or retreats from every pitched battle against an adult DE in DH. Why would he be able to pull off anything of the sort in GoF, and without the benefit of Hermione's tutelage?

If he can AK a dragon, that puts him in the Powerful category, and if you remove any allies, he is, by definition, Independent. :P

Dumbledore was pretty clear that a prophecy only applies to those who believe in it; that, in fact, most prophecies aren't fulfilled. It is by acting on the prophecy that Voldemort made himself its subject, enabling Harry to be his nemesis. Someone who rejects the prophecy, or simply doesn't know of it, is not bound by it.

Anyway, as Barty Crouch jr. pointed out in his class, fifteen year olds wouldn't be able to cast it successfully. So, no matter how much hate Harry could gather, the dragon would probably just suffer a nosebleed.

****** Technically, yes, but given the ill-defined nature of "power", and given that we don't actually have Harry ever attempting to cast it --- so absence of evidence is not evidence of absence --- I think that placing some some extra requirements onto the Killing Curse is a reasonable interpolation. It could be as simple as a capacity to kill in cold blood and without regard for whether the person deserves to die. (Note that it's the /capacity/ that matters, and the particular use of the curse does not have to be cold-blooded or against an undeserving victim.) So, a sociopath like Voldemort can cast it without trouble, as can a hardened Auror (as during Voldemort's first rise) or a spy and Death Eater like Snape. But, a bunch of ordinary 14-year-olds have enough empathy and sense of justice that they'd have trouble doing it.

***** Eh, even if we take that at face value, it could still be argued that the cruciatus is the only one that requires hate. You have to truly want someone to suffer. One can want someone to die to end their suffering or to spare another as with Snape's killing of Dumbledore. And you can want to control someone without directing malice specifically toward them, as evidenced by Harry's usage.

*** Replying in the same format

*Introduction*

I agree about Sirius' death. It is actually going to be one of the bigger things that really diverges the story from the canon plotline. Things like Harry being too devastated and wanting to be alone rather than joining his friends at the World Cup, or even sitting alone on the train to find some time to himself as he can't face his friends. This would obviously bleed over to when his relationship with his friends goes south, and he in turn finds it best to be alone for the time being. This will affect his relationship with Hagrid as well. As for Moody, for the first task I was just going to make it that Moody can't find Harry as Harry continually finds corners to hide in. And since Harry doesn't know Moody is looking for him, the two never cross paths.

In regards to the AK, I actually wanted to change it a bit. They say that they are dangerous curses and that you need to mean them and have all of the intent behind them. I was instead going to make it that Harry in his desperation was able to use the curse. Then he is left to question: Did he want to kill the dragon? Is he evil? Does he have such hatred in his heart? etc etc etc. These questions start pouring forth. However the reality that is revealed is that magic is magic. The is no light or dark magic, there is just magic. It doesn't require anything different to cast these curses. It is just that the people who cast these curses believe that you have to mean the intent. Although this obviously doesn't account for personal skill either, that is also a requirement.

*Daphne and Romance*

Figured I'd make this it's own little topic.

The thing I love about some of my favorite stories is that they often have a contrast of characters. You have Luke and Han, Naruto and Sasuke, Harry, Ron, and Draco. The way these characters contrast each other and often play foils to one another is great to see.

The gist of Daphne's story was supposed to be the following. (Naturally this could be made an OC after you read this story.) The idea was that Daphne is a pureblood whose mother fashioned herself to be a bit of a scientist. Her mother wanted to be the next Nicholas Flemell(Spelling?) who creates something that revolutionizes the wizarding world. Although the way she went about that soon found her walking down the path of some seriously dark magic. All of it far darker than what is typically shown in Harry Potter. However most notably is her traveling down the path of alchemy much like Nicholas before her. However like most dark characters in the series, she didn't want to just play by the rules, she wanted to have her cake and to eat it as well. As she delved into these dark magics and the rules of Alchemy, she tried to bend and break the rules in her favor. This cost her mother her life, and her father who had been running for Minister pulled himself from the running to take care of his daughters.

Now you would think that "Well with that upbringing, why wouldn't Daphne become light?" well in truth Daphne saw what happened to both her mother and her father, and she believed that it wasn't their practices that failed them. It wasn't tampering with Dark magic. It wasn't trying to become Minister of Magic. It was their execution. Their beliefs that: Once her father became Minister they could change things. Or once this revolutionary magic was found, they could change things. These were faulted. One lacked the social standing while the other lacked the power to back it up.

Here you find Daphne not young and naive, but a girl that survived the metaphorical death of her family and seeks to give it's remnants a better future via the lessons she learned from both of her parents when she was younger. It is through her parents that you see her lack of an aversion to dark magic as well as her penchant for trying to gain influence among others from her father. So the thing is that like you said, Hogwarts students don't grasp the concept of a political game, and I wholeheartedly agree. However what if one did in a sea where everyone else had no idea what they were doing? I imagine that one person could claw and climb quite quickly.

As for Romance? This story wasn't slated to have a clear cut romance. The characters certainly aren't going to fall in love with each other. However you will get hints wondering if their relationship is leading somewhere. Although quite obviously with how the store is currently slated to end, these two are going to become rather tense friends.

*Rest of the Year*

Side stepped a lot because mainly it is just character growth. Things like the above get revealed with Daphne's history. Harry trying to figure out what he wants his place to be in the world after school as Daphne continues to reveal her own personal ambitions. Harry's initial delve into dark magic before leaving it alone for good. Harry's true story of Sirius and what he had yet to reveal to anyone was just how many times he went back to save him and failed.

*The Twist and the End*

Ah just getting to this. Yeah it is certainly planned for the time turner to be reiterated over the course of the story. Daphne will bring up times where it would have been great to have a time turner to do a conversation over or something, where in which place Harry simply says it broke on his last attempt to save Sirius.

Perhaps there is a flashback to that night where Sirius see's Harry's obvious display of the time turner and realizes what is happening. "Some things you can't change Harry, no matter how hard we try."

As for Harry's lack of prison time. The loophole is revealed that the killing curse is illegal to be used on humans. However farmers have utilized the killing curse for years on animals to preserve all of the meat and giving animals humane deaths. Harry falls into that loophole.

The goal with the story is in time to show how both Daphne and Harry want similar things, but their ideologies and means to achieve those things couldn't be more different.

Finally in regards to the Ice Queen. I remember when those fics were first coming out and the Harry Daphne category was only one page long lol. It has been quite some time since then. I don't care for making my Daphne some Ice Queen whose cold exterior is only warmed by Harry's valiant heart. I don't care about that.

Daphne here shall be consistent throughout the story. While displaying qualities that would be congruent with an Ice Queen. She makes no mistake about her intentions, and they are only to better her own situation and her future. I don't feel this is a bad thing. Too often writers attempt to make a character cold, and then the character falls in love with the protagonist. That isn't my goal. Daphne isn't going to change her dreams for the future because of some boy, just as we wouldn't expect Harry to put off on saving the wizarding world because he met a girl.

No, but seriously. That kills the entire tension. In one moment you're like "Oh shit, hes going dark" and in the next moment, you kill that friction. If we go with the flow of "Avada Kedavra needs intent" then what intent are we talking about? Hate? Or maybe just Indifference towards life? Whatever it is, it should rustle some serious jimmies throughout the story.

I just hope you're really - really good with dialoge. It seems that this story has not much in terms of action, so it's going to live or die with your characters speaking to each other.

Finally, I just want to say, that if this story is something you want to write, none of our comments should hold you back. You'll never sell it and if you're not in need of ego-stroking then you don't even have to appeal to a huge audience. Write the story you feel good with. Many very popular stories started with extremely negative criticism or a weak premise or hold a shitton of cliches. Write what feels right to you.

***** Well I am already writing three stories currently, so I am not even sure if I can tack on another on top of that. However I figured there is nothing wrong with ironing out the wrinkles before I start writing it down.

I don't believe the reveal that magic is simply magic however is a downer. I believe even Sirius states in the series that "We have both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the path we choose to act on." Something akin to that. In fact a lot of lines in the story revolve around things like that. "Destined for great things. Not good, but great."

The idea that magic isn't inherently tied to an alignment, but people have created a social stigma that it is so inherently aligned that you question your own morality upon their use and lack of aforementioned consequence.

I agree Flashbacks are lazy. I wish I was much better at telling short succinct stories through dialogue that properly display relationships between characters without having the event seem cheesy or corny. Even characters telling stories can be really potent, I am just working on that as a writer.

The story will be dialogue heavy as well as leaving hopefully an air of mystery to the reader to find out what happened in certain scenarios.

An example would be. Harry chooses to go to the ball with Katie after Daphne suggests that they go to the ball together. Then right before the dance, members of the quidditch team reveal that Katie is in the infirmary. Daphne arrives. And for the remainder of the period you are left to infer what happened whether that be memory charms or whatever.

And finally, I only really enjoy writing fanfiction if it feels original. If it feels like it hasn't been done. You can have a story with a familiar plot, and still feel original by how it is written. However if it doesn't feel unique, there is no need for it to fall in place among the hundreds of stories of similar makeup.

*** Well as I said it is currently on the back burner. I personally am a large fan of writing Naruto fanfiction. So this was just to hash out the finer details of the plot here while I consider where to take this story. I'd like to write a Harry Potter story in the near future, and I've had some ideas bouncing around in my head for awhile. However I tend to want my stories to be birthed from a defining character narrative rather than just a couple cool ideas.

An example of a simple story idea would be that Harry with whatever circumstances of his upbringing goes to Diagon Alley, and fails to secure a wand for himself for whatever reason. However Olivader then tells Harry of a time where some wizards didn't even use wands to practice magic, and that wands today have merely become a focus, not a requirement.

The story would then have Harry walking around with a simple stick, hiding the fact that he doesn't have a real wand, and throughout this time he is doing wandless magic. Few suspect what he can really do.

Although that is just an idea. I don't really have a story that surrounds that fun idea.

A story I would love to write if I don't find myself up for this one would be a story where Harry is not the boy who lived. This is not an uncommon storyline. However I feel whenever this scenario is portrayed, they still have Harry go on to try and save the world, just in a very morally gray light.

I'd want to write a story where Harry unsatisfied with his upbringing, but utterly ambitious and striving for a better life proceeds to go through Hogwarts purely looking after his best interests.
