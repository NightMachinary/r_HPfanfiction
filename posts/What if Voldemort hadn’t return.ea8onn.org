** It could be an amusing story. Dumbledore is absolutely sure Voldemort's gonna return, does pretty much as in canon.

When Harry comes to Hogwarts, Dumbledore has the philosopher's stone sent there as well, to attract the Dark Lord, and someone else tries to steal it (or someone gets a hold of it out of luck). Someone, in second year, is still opening the chamber of secrets. etc.

Each time, Dumbledore is persuaded Voldemort did the deed, and he convinces Harry as well, and Harry goes through all the responsability and saving people thing, for nothing. Things get more and more ridiculous until the truth is finally revealed and consequences unfold.

**** Sadly, I'm not up to write it, I have no experience writing, and English isn't my natural language. I'd fear that I'd botched it in all possible ways. But I, too, would read a fic like that.

** Assuming some sort of magical backlash destroyed his Horcruxes in order for canon to remain intact up to his death.

Harry is sent to the Dursleys. Sirius to Azkaban.

10 years pass. The curse on the Defense Against the Dark Arts professorship is gone. Hogwarts enjoys the first steady teaching in the subject in decades.

Harry enjoys a fairly peaceful first year, there was no break in attempt on Gringotts to bring his attention to the Philosopher's Stone. No attempt is made to steal it. No trolls in the girls bathroom to provide convenient friendship building moments. Snape is viewed as a dick, not an evil person trying to steal the stone.

No need for Dobby to save his life year 2. No diary. Peaceful year.

Sirius escapes, somehow this year plays out mostly the same. Harry is more trusting in adults though having not spent the last two years being ignored by teachers and forced to save the school/world himself. Peter escapes and goes looking for Voldemort.

Year 4, Barty Crouch Jr escapes his father and goes looking for Voldemort. Harry enjoys watching the Triwizard tournament. At the end of the year Barty and Peter are arrested trying to resurrect Voldemort. Sirius is declared innocent.

Year 5, Dumbledore tells Harry that he believes Voldemort will return one day and that Harry must be prepared for the eventuality. The Order of the Phoenix is reorganized to watch for signs of Voldemorts return. Harry passes his owls and talks with Mcgonagall about his possible careers as a Quidditch player or potentially teacher.

Year 6, Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix have learned from Horace Slughorn about Horcruxes in their information gathering. Dumbledore finds the resurrection stone in the Gaunt hovel, he is confused that it is no longer the ring from the memories he has collected. He was convinced that it had to have been a horcrux and is confused. He ends up using the stone, just for help in figuring out the mystery. To try to figure out about the horcruxes.

Year 7. Over time Dumbledore is worn down by the ring and the possibilities it allows. He uses it more and more, just for information gathering you seem. Until it wears him down enough that he summons his sister and his mother and others that have died. He lives in the past and slowly wastes away in his office over the course of the year. Hogwarts mourns his death. Harry passes his newts.

19 years later. Harry lives a happy and successful life, occasionally stricken by paranoia and anxiety about Voldemort, though he's working through that with his therapist.

*** Barty wouldn't have escaped his father without Voldemort, I think Crouch Sr. was being extra careful with the Imperius after the World Cup.

** I think this all depends on two important questions. Does Dumbledore believe Voldemort is dead and are horocruxes destroyed with his death?

If both are yes, there is one correct answer; Harry would be a professional quidditch player.

** A different Halloween does that.

edit: I think? I may misremember it. I do know there was a story where Voldemort truly died the night he attacked the Potters, but Dumbledore spends the rest of his life preparing for his return.

Interesting premise, but on the other hand, a Robst story.

** Well you still got the Horcrux's around so maybe Harry gets to fight each one like he did the Diary.
