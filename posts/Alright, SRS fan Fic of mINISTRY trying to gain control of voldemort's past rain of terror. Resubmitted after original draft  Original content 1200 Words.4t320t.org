It was a dark night. The nights were always darker since... "Wait." He said. He was very good at this. He always had a way of knowing whether or not it was safe for us.

He was by far the most capable sleuth and detective. He had worked for the ministry for a number of years as a special operations field leader and was the reason they had come this far in the first place. As his occupation required he had been undercover on a number of cult followings that ended in the capture of highly wanted criminals sent to various highly secure prisons. However, as late his job had seen a reduction of resources as corruption grew.

The nights were always darker since the turn of fortune, the turn of power. It had happened so suddenly. Without a trace the workers of the people had disappeared and been replaced by a corrupted standard of men.

There was no way a turn of power happens overnight, but it had been planned so diligently and patiently. As the shift in power changed, so did its inhabitants. Good people had been slowly replaced with people less mindful but more resourceful, darker minions for a greater power.

People became confused, they didn't know what was right or wrong. It became a very difficult and decisive time to live in. Either you owed complete allegiance to the new corrupted world, or you pretended to. Corruption had completely overflow the ministry; workers simply were not conscience or under their own direct control to make the right decisions by wizardry power. The shift in power hadn't been recognized until it had taken over.

"Continue." The field leader said. He said. He was the soul of this brigade. The ones who owed their true loyalty to a simpler time and were still in control or not manipulated by the Dark Lord.

Looking around a seemingly simple room except for the team of six or so (said lightly for anonymity's sake) inhabitants occupying it. There could be no trace of what happened here tonight. The only evidence up until this point were a few wisps in the air.

Simply said, any passer or onlooker would have not, well better put, could have not seen what was going on. They could not see what was going on inside because of the power put into that room on that night. Secured by the most powerful and uncorrupted; pure team. The inhabitants were surrounding a simple combination of rather meaningless objects.

The exact same set of items that were meant to set a world back to a simpler time, a better time. All we needed to do now was wait for the rarest key; the final component to a world of simpler time. We had been assured by the best minds and teams available that this was indeed one of the few options left to take back home.

It was of priceless value, just enough to take back a world filled by evil and restore it. It was meant to destroy the darker minions and leave their Dark Lord vulnerable to an attack. Entire precautions had been taken, misdirection and plans, and a continuation to edit and fix those until they had all lined up perfectly.

Tonight was the night and everyone who owed their loyalty to a purer, simpler time knew it. The darker powers would have largely been taken aback by the sheer power of necessity of these good people still left, because they needed it. It would be impossible to keep them from their true mission. Restoration.

Who could hold back the power of good? One. Their Dark Lord Master was entirely corrupt. Nothing of any form had ever been truly corrupted to even compare to this point. Although it seems impossible this one had been fully possessed by the greatest evil power ever known to the living world.

He had taken out entire legions of brothers rightfully defending their homes from invasion. The very sound of his name meant instant death spoken at any volume. Not here, but as his name was spoken it had provided him greater intense evil power. This was the same plan to his downfall.

By taking it right at the source. By destroying his name and its power entirely the world would be created new and pure

The plan for tonight was coming to a close. As perfectly described by the best of us. Speak his name into its fathoms and return it to its rightful place, underneath. It had taken such a time of preparation it was almost methodical as anything goes under intense repetition. A way to seal the powers of evil from the Dark Lord.

Many had thought it utterly impossible or so remarkably doomed to fail. But in its simplicity it was designed exactly as the darker power had been put into place. This was a better vision, to restore rightful power. Only the strongest were able to forge this plan. This had to be the end of tyranny, destruction and death. The men in this room simply put could not have all entered this room otherwise. Having all these people in the same place was dangerous enough, but was worth the chance.

Just for the last component.. "Wait." The field leader said again. He was getting increasingly agitated but for no reason. The door opened, and as planned they had received. With the door open a crack the room started to swell and light entered every corner. Brighter than any of those men had ever witnessed light was center in the room and flowing

It started to wrap on the walls outside. It was taking over. Men started to fall to their feet rapidly in any location who were corrupted. The power of the name was draining. The world was changing for good. A slight pop was heard, and under no pretense or condition the light gave way to complete pitch black darkness. Confusion erupted as on the edge of the light a pale figure formed from the shadow outside of the house. The skin coming from the dark robe was so painstakingly white it seemed to glow. A simple phrase was uttered as he raised his skeletal hand that only emerged from the darkness and could barely be seen but of a shadow.

The Dark Lord had come.

Pure terror erupted, so much adrenaline had been pumped into these last leaders at that point it would have been impossible to do nothing but stare. It was that they had been led here under pretense and were enchanted to be still at that very moment.

The phrase "Avada Kedavra" and all men fell at once. The world did not change so simply for a few good men. The world did not change that night but was moved ahead tenfold into pitch blackness for the Dark Lord's reign of terror to continue.

TlDR; Read it :P Voledmort destroys ministry rebels


** Not much happens here-- the leader says "Wait," Voldemort walks in and kills everyone. And a lot of exposition! If you think about watching the 'movie in your head' it gives a sense of how much the reader is experiencing. FYI I'm a new writer and this caught my eye because I'm struggling with exposition glutting up my stories, trying to work on strategies!
