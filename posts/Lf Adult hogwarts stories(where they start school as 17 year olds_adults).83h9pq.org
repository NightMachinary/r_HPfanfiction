*** It would mean more Muggleborns would get control over there magic in a similar way to tom riddle and Lily Evans. (can you imagen a Tom riddle who had an extra 6 years to experiment with his magic)

It also might lead to more muggleborns threw teenage pregnancy and more muggleborns marrying into the muggle population

it would also Cut the Muggle parents out of it if they waited till the muggleborns were of age in the muggle world

**** Lily could do a small amount of controlled magic (making a flower bloom) and that was probably with a lot of practice as well. Also, Tom Riddle wasn't a Muggleborn, but a half-blood descended from a founder of Hogwarts. Being the first non-inbred person from this line in probably a very long time meant he was both very powerful and prodigious. We don't see many powerful Muggleborns at all. Most Muggleborns probably wouldn't be able to establish control over their magic.

***** I hate this argument mainly because it gives the purebloods are better crowd an out. Power means nothing compared to skill, voldemort and dumbledore were powerful because of years of practice and study not blood, harry was powerful because of his love for others and selflessness and even them when it came to defense he studied hard at it.

****** Harry didn't study hard at defense. The only thing we see him really study is the Patronus charm, and that's because he wanted to keep the Dementors away, not because he wanted to be good at defense. Harry being good at defense is pure talent. Voldemort was powerful before he even went to Hogwarts. He was able to hang another boy's rabbit, bring two fellow orphans into a cave and do something to shock them to their core, and multiple other things I can't even remember. Hell, he framed his uncle for the murder of his father and grandparents when he was 16. Voldemort was naturally persuasive, manipulative, and ambitious (which Slytherins are known to be). So bloodline probably has something to do with it, and if you didn't notice, I wasn't necessarily saying purebloods are better, but rather that most of the powerful wizards we see are half-bloods. So maybe blood has something to do with it, maybe it doesn't. The point is that random Muggleborns wouldn't be able to control their magic. EDIT: The thing I meant by powerful wizards being half-bloods is that Harry is born from a long standing Pureblood family (third Peverell as we can see by the cloak) and a Muggleborn, and Tom from a possibly longer standing pureblood family (second Peverell brother as we can see by the ring) and a Muggle.

*** The story could just change things so that instead of being born with magic, wizards and witches aren't able to use it until they've finished puberty. Or that they can only use accidental magic in self-defense, like Neville bouncing after being dropped out the window, but not deliberately use it, like Tom Riddle threatening the other kids in his orphanage.

** linkffn(Whispers in the Night)

Not exactly an /adult hogwarts/, but they go into school at 13, so Harry's 17 in this fic.

Updated at the end of January and still going, but I've stopped reading it consistently.

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** Can't think of any that I've read, but to be of even less help, I'll say that I have a couple of unpublished fics like this sitting on my hard drive right now.

No, wait ... I do have /one/ fic pubbed fic where this happens, but it's weird and on hiatus and it starts before the term of an evil AU Harry Potter's school year. It also has an insane narrator that is a not-quite American, not-quite OC from another universe.

Not as good as that summary makes it sound, though. And it's also in first-person, based on a crack!fic prompt (while being taken seriously), and I wrote some of it after drinking.

linkffn(12589566)

Also available on Ao3 [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11627967/chapters/26147451][here]].

Edit: And despite the official summary, Snape has yet to show up. So ... pretty much the epitome of disappointing fic recs.

  What would really happen if a Slytherin Harry Potter became super independent, super powerful, and super dangerous, as narrated by his personal --- and very grudging --- minion, the marginally sane Violet Henry. Also features Snape, the world's worst mentor. (Dark!Harry, AU, dark comedy elements, no Harry/Snape.)
