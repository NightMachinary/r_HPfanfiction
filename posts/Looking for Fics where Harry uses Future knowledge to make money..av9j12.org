Don't care about pairing, slash or not. Or if the story is good or bad. Just interested in things like harry placing bets, making investments etc.


** This is surprisingly rare. Of all the time travels I've read, only [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9754483/1/Para-Bellum][Para Bellum]], linkffn(5511855;9754483), touched that topic, and only as a minor thing.

I have cooked up a plot in which time travelers used their advance knowledge to make big money in lotteries and stock market. It's a Harry/Hermione time travel to early 1970s, after losing everyone else in a hollow victory. They would stay away from Britain until Lily's graduation from Hogwarts, and focus on building up their business and private army in America or Canada.

After Lily and Marauders graduated from Hogwarts, they made their first move by faking a Death Eater abduction of the Evanses. They then captured Lily and Marauders in another trap. I've even written the scene about Harry and Hermione facing Lily and the Marauders. The goal is to get them out of the Order and into a training program somewhere in Canada.

Once Lily and Marauders are out of this war zone, Harry and Hermione will send out anonymous tips to Dumbledore about Horcruxes, Death Eaters, and the Deathly Hallows. The information will be so sensitive that Dumbledore has no reasons to doubt.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  An ambitious Voldemort prepares to lead his armies into the Delenda Est dimension to topple Minister Black III. But, he has lost the element of surprise, and there is a Pre-OotP dimension in between his dimension and the DE dimension where he will have to fight Minister Black's armies, spies, and civilian meddlers, not to mention two Harry Potters and the infamous Black Triplets.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** Harry potter and the Granger's take on the world. It's a bit rough, but the economics are valid (I mean barring one-shots where he destabilizes the market via Galleons being undervalued in canon apparently.).
