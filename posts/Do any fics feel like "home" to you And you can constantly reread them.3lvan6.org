So I struggle a bit with anxiety, and sometimes I just need to not think and read something easy. Oftentimes this involves rereading some fanfics that I really like, because they feel comfortable to me.

Do you have any fics like this?

  My take on the Slytherin!Harry genre. What if Harry's less-than-happy childhood had left him more jaded than canon? No pairings, and you won't find any eleven year olds talking as if they were at a Renaissance fair here either.

I think I've read it over twenty times now and I still enjoy it. Unfortunately, life has gotten busier for her and she's on a bit of a hiatus. She says she's still working on it, but intermittently when she can.

Edit: I also go back to the Lie I've Lived occassionally because the way Harry is in that story is basically how I picture James actually being, not the horrible way he is written in a lot of fics where he's constantly thinking about Lily and whining about why she won't look at him. He's a sixteen year old boy from a very wealthy family. I think he would be a bit of a flirt with a lot of girls and not constantly thinking about the one girl.

It's hilariously terrible, but the reason why I keep going back is because of the nostalgia. Not just because of what the fandom was a decade ago, but because of who, where and why I was at that time. All I had to worry about back then was not being caught asleep in Statistics class. Now, among other things, I've got to worry about paying the rent and having a life at the same time.

In fact, that site in general is good at taking me back. That and Portkey.org. (No longer a shipper tho)

** Like you, I have anxiety as well, and getting away to an easy fictional world is so helpful.

Sunset and Sunrise Over Britain by bobmin at fanficauthors.net.

Hope and White Knight, Grey Queen by Jeconais

A few fics by Bedelia that I grabbed off the net before she removed them for editing and then lost them

Linkffn(Came Out of the Darkness)

But the fic I reread the most is The Lioness Prophecies, a 7th year Snape/Hermione fic. It's been removed from the net but I have an epub copy of it. I reread it at least once a year. It's seriously so good and so relaxing.

** Great question! Glad you asked.

/Alexandra Quick/ does. I have to take a few months in between each reread, but I can find new little things each time I read, and make connections between things that I hadn't noticed before. The way Inverarity creates the world of Magical America is so incredibly detailed and feels so authentic that everything else is really just extra (even including the astoundingly well-crafted plotlines and storytelling, and the spectacular character development).

It may be the only reason I'm "proud to be an American", because I feel "at home" reading it, and I get all the cultural things and the expressions and the realistic portrayals of Midwestern life, even though I instinctively feel revulsed by most blatant patriotism.

It /is/ getting almost excruciating waiting for AQATWA, though. I think I'll get back to writing my continuation fic.

** Oh lord, yes. Many, many, many. I keep a list of favorites and try not to look at any of them late in the evening, because chances are I'll be up half the night on an addictive reading marathon, cocooned in good memories. The majority of favorites probably date from my early years in HP, when I first tripped over the concept of a(n) OTP and fell headfirst into Snape/Harry fandom, where I have remained ever since.

There are also certain authors who embody everything I love about fanfiction, and I return to their works again and again. I often wallow in stories not just for themselves but for the particular skill and voice of the author; some writers push every button I have. They can do things with words that take my breath away.

I should point out that many of my favorite fics provide pleasure and reassurance even though the stories themselves are anything but cozy or comforting, and some are downright painful. Maybe it's the catharsis. Or maybe I'm just a hurt/comfort junkie and enjoy a bit of transgressiveness and ambiguity even in my comfort reading.
