- Harry meets Eu, but ends up hit by a Car or something not so long after (Pre Hogwarts)
- Eu found him interesting and really nice, so revives him
- Harry being Dead removed the Horcrux
- Harry gets Ayumu's power (No Ayumu) and Zombiepower is the Power The Dark Lord Knows Not
- Harry eventually Falls for Eu, but loves her as family first (as she's the first one to show him affections)
- Eu and Dumbledore clash a few times (Necromancer would be seen as Evil) but Dumbledore doesn't realise that Harry is a Zombie (No one but Eu knows)
- Random group of unimportant Death Eaters (Crabbe/Goyle's parents) end up Crucio'ing Harry at some point, Eu finds it happening and kills them all to save Harry.
- Harry ends up in Ravenclaw (Sorting Hat can't tell anyone what's in Harry's head trope) because he wants to find a way for Eu to have full control over her powers.

A little OP Harry, but he'll be the same magically, just have Zombie Physicals/Immortality. (Not an instant win as Ayumu is really weak to Pain , Sunlight, etc) Overprotective Eu. Obvious eventual Harry/Eu. (Eu fell for Ayumu and admitted as such at one point)
