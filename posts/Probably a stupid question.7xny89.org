How does linkffn(12805587) Harry Potter and the Old Friend get 2.5k favorites in a month? I don't mean that as an insult to the story, it just seems like an absurd amount of likes in such a short time. At the time of this posting it is 2 favorites away from being the top story for the past 6 months. Even if it was the best story ever getting as many favorites in 1 month as the second best got in 6 months seems unlikely.


** Because Sinyk is a popular author with a huge following.

** Sinyk is one of those phenomenons, like robst. I find his style tedious and rambling, but a lot of people love his stuff. He got a huge following. I can see those numbers happening if he happens to find some sort of gold premise.

edit: Yup... just read the thing and it is as obnoxious in it's writing as his usual work.

*** I wish I'd seen your post before I read it. That has to be the most boring fic I've seen in years. Super!Harry gives Super!Bones files full of all the info she needs to fix all the problems in the wizarding world and she does it in about a week with no tangible resistance whatsoever.

Truly hideous... except for the owl-shaped section dividers.

**** I haven't even got to that point. Frankly, the fic died for me when the author "eased us into" the magical world as if this whole universe is new to us.

Then he just shoves this into our faces, in his usual, slow and just gear grinding way of tedious obnoxiousness, to come to a predictable and million times overdone conclusion.
