Having a conversation somewhere else and this thought came to me, what are the top ten issues or things that need fixing? What do we want sorting in the Wizarding World? What episodes do we want to see?

Some off the top of my head:

1) Time Turners

2) The end relationships especially Hermione and Ron.

3) Sexuality

4) Racism or at least make it make a little sense. I want a Mud Blood conversation that makes sense.

5) A last season which is after the books.

I have 2 interesting ideas for story lines.

One, when we first meet Harry he is a girl and it is only on entering the Wizarding World he finds out he is a boy and they changed his sex as part of hiding him.

Two, every season we have a trans week episode which is when all of the kids have to take a potion that flips their gender.


** Nothing. Make a new story about something completely different.

** Whatever they do, they need to avoid the traps the fantastic beasts movies are falling into.

In my opinion if they wanted to tell the story of the Grindlewald war (which I totally get, it's has great potential) this is how they should do it:

1: start with a movie of Dumbledore and Grindlewald's relationship, including the blood pact and possibly a search for a pet phoenix through to Dumbledore mother dying and the three way fight.

2: TV show, introduce newt's brother (Theseus) and the Aurors working to stop Grindlewald. Overarching storyline includes Dumbledore trying to stay out of it and scammander brothers trying to be brothers.

3: the first fantastic beasts film. As it is. This is the only film called fantastic beasts and where to find them - the others all have other names.

4: TV season 2. This opens with the Grindlewald breakout and then the ICW puts together a team of Aurors to take him down. This includes Tina and Theseus Scammander. The series finale is the team getting wiped out by Grindlewald himself with only Tina left.

Then a combination of other series and movies that tell the story of Newt and tina trying to take him down. Eventually Dumbledore joins them and the series culminates in a duel unlike any other.

Also, in this there are no random adults wandering hogwarts called mcgonagal before they were born or people who can turn into snakes called nagini, just because.

Thoughts?

** I want Cursed Child to be ignored (or at least sidelined so it doesn't matter) and for the show to happen sometime after the events of the books (possibly present day). No more rehashing of the same small pool of characters, instead do what was sort of teased in the first Fantastic Beasts and give us a good *new story* with *new people* set in the wizarding world, hopefully at Hogwarts.

Legacy characters can be mentioned in passing but shouldn't really appear on screen; someone can be reading the Prophet and mention Minister Granger for example or depending on year a prefect could be calling after a crowd of students, mentioning names like Rose and Scorpius.

One idea I had was to follow the mystery/CW format. The first episode starts immediately in 4th or 5th year (skip the child actors) where we are introduced to 3 Gryffindors who are essentially an updated golden trio but with swapping around gender/race to make them 'new'. There have been strange things afoot and they're investigating if there is a dangerous creature that might be living down in an abandoned part of the dungeons.

In the pilot we see them working the problem and giving the audience a tour of the school and supporting cast in the process. Asking professors and students they narrow down their suspicions, approaching a Ravenclaw who is known to specialize in the kinds of rare creature they suspect. They're shown being a bit abrasive, dismissive of those who aren't from the 'brave' house but still demanding help from others like they're owed it.

Having received little to go on they corner a Slytherin whose father employed dark creatures during the war and was sent to Azkaban. She's defensive about their accusations that she's behind what's happening and when they can't make her confess they move on. Finally they approach a Hufflepuff who's a bit of an explorer, asking him to act as a guide into the lost parts of the dungeons, but he doesn't feel comfortable doing it and they tell him off before heading out on their own.

Going down into the dungeons the pilot reaches the end of its second act with the three of them discovering there is a giant creature down there -- and promptly being killed, or at least that's the impression given. Cut to the headmasters office and the three characters from before, the Ravenclaw, Slytherin and Hufflepuff, are waiting on the bench to give the headmaster their accounts since they are among the last to have seen the 3 disappeared students alive.

So we discover that the new golden trio was just a red herring and the show will really focus on this new 'misfit' gang who find themselves pushed together to solve the mystery. The Ravenclaw for knowledge, the Slytherin to clear her name, the Hufflepuff to assuage guilt for not being helpful. Of course along the way things change and friendships form with all 3 of them growing.

In my idea the Gryffindors are taken out of focus, relegating them to a background role and seen by the main cast as something of a house of bullies who will occasionally be antagonists in the same way Slytherin was in the books. We also learn that Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff have their own specific rivalry which in this series overshadows the old Gryffindor/Slytherin one.

** 1) Marauder-Era fic that focuses on the Marauders' time at Hogwarts and the situations they faced while going to school during a wizarding war.

2) Inbetween Era that focuses on post-Hogwarts life for the Marauders, Snape, and the others affected by this Era. (Great battle scenes, please.)

3) Bill and Charlie Weasley centric that has them as the main stars in their Hogwarts/post-Hogwarts days.

4) Post-Hogwarts that focuses on characters like Luna, Blaise, Daphne, Neville, post-war Hogwarts.

5) Founder Era focused on the building and beginning of Hogwarts.

** Sexuality (of the kind you're proposing) will never be a big part of an HP series, because it doesn't sell well. Trans people are such a miniscule percentage of the general population that using them as a central part of an incredibly profitable IP like Harry Potter makes no sense. That's actually one of the most beautiful things about fanfiction; since none of us are making any money off our ideas, we can give under-represented groups screentime and storylines that they'd never receive in commercial storytelling.

The other reply on here that talked about it likely being a generic rehash of 'golden trio part deux' is spot on. Look at how Disney dealt with the Star Wars IP. They basically re-made the first movie, but said "Look, we added black and brown characters, aren't we heroic?!" I won't get into the directorial conflict between Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams, but the fact of the matter is that Disney knew Star Wars has a huge built-in fanbase, so they weren't willing to take risks. They told the writers "Okay, just shovel out the same ol' shit but add some identity politics, we're not trying to make good movies we're trying to make money."

That's what any future Harry Potter franchise - be it video game, tv show, or movie - will be. Generic, inoffensive garbage that checks boxes on 'what worked last time' while stripping away all of the wonder and magic that the series had before.

*** I think the thing with a tv show is they can show so much more.

Harry Potter has racism, sexism and genocide built into it so it would be very hard to white wash.

The problem with the new Stars Wars films is that the original films had stuff happening between them while the new films are stuck together. This means that there is no chance for character development between films. Think of the change in Luke between Empire and Return.

The real problem with the last film is I wanted an ending which was this is how the Jedi brought peace to the galaxy for a 1,000 years. This is why you needed to shot them in the back and not let them join forces.

*** JKR is the only gazillionare I know about who get herself out of the Forbes list of the richest people in the world by giving so much to charity (see [[https://www.wearelumos.org][Lumos]]). She may be a stingy Scottish lady, doing things like CC just to grab more money, but with her I am quite certain she uses them for good purpose.
