  I'd really like if the story actually goes in depth on the potion creation and process and stuff.

*/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]]/* has this, and Harry's also good at potions himself. However, he does not teach. And the fic is abandoned. +And your pet is dead.+

*/Delenda Est/*'s Harry gets sent back into Marauders' era and manages to get admitted for a Potions position there, but this Harry is an incompetent idiot not only at potions and teaching, but at being a wizard in general too.

**** Unfortunately no. There is /Methods of Rationality/ for a clever!Harry, but for a person who /talks/ about rationality that much, this Harry sure likes holding the Idiot Ball and more showing off than doing the job done. In this sense, I really liked the dragon scene in the tWGM---Harry there was both depicted both realistically /and/ as a reasonable person.

There is also the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Sacrifices Arc]] with well-developed characters and interpersonal relations, but here too characters often get stupefied for the sake of moving the plot along. Also, like many fics, Voldemort and Dumbledore are cartoonishly evil.

** I really like this too, but almost nobody does it (it's hard to embellish what it's actually cooking/baking when you think about it). Many fics have some scenes where Harry kicks Snape's ass at the first Potions class, and then no class scenes are shown again, or just one class scene in sixth year that really goes in depth for plot reasons, or an excuse to use the terrible Snape/Hermione (or Snape/Harry) pairing.

I hope someone recommend more stuff, I'm going to check that fic OONU posted (I already read Delenda Est, and he's right you shouldn't expect it to go in depth).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8859591/1/Resolution][Resolution]] is pretty awesome, if slowly updated.
