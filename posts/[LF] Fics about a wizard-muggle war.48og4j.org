I have been catching up on linkffn(Abraxas by Brennus), and it got me thinking about another direction this story could have gone. I would love to see a fic where the muggles find out about the hidden wizarding world and start a war. Specifically I thought about how interesting it would be to see the Death Eaters and the Order forced to (temporarily?) work together to fight the new threat.

I imagine a lot of conflict about what methods are acceptable, like whether Bellatrix goes too far when fighting muggles or the Order needs to stop playing too nice. There could be some great parts where there is a grudging respect between say, HP and Lucius Malfoy, tempered by the knowledge that either will gladly kill the other once the muggles are defeated. And who would lead this coalition? My money is on Voldemort, but maybe Dumbledore or Scrimgeour could.

There's just so many cool possibilities. Anyone have any recs that fit any part of what I'm rambling about?

  It started with a surprising proposals from an unexpected source, but that was only the beginning. Soon, Harry finds himself dealing with forces beyond his imagination and dreams, and ultimately finds that the world is not what he believed it to be.

** These one are short but chilling: linkffn(3446331) has Voldemort and the Death Eaters leading while Harry and the Order are forgotten.

[[http://themolesmother.livejournal.com/5762.html][More Things in Heaven and Earth]] is about the muggle ministers deciding whether or not to declare war.

  A different war begins. The people want a saviour who'll protect them from bullets and Harry isn't it. 'Death Eaters killed eleven wizards this week. The Muggles have killed eighty.' [oneshot]

** *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), is about how Harry's hybrid magical/muggle nation defeated its enemies, be they magical or muggle. [[/spoiler][Voldemort was still the main opponent, but he abandoned his Death Eaters in favor of brainwashing muggles into suicide bombers and directly putting muggle governments under his control. Nicholas Flamel controlled the pure magical state in Northern Scotland.]]

*** Oh, /that's/ what this one is about? I always see it recommended, but the info thing by the author is so vague I never got around to reading it. This sounds really cool though.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
