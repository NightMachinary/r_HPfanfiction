I need some help on how to improve searching for fics on Ao3. I have been reading HP fics for more than 6 years and I mostly read them at [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]. The problem is there are fewer fics that interest me from ff right now and would like to search other sites but Ao3 is such a mess for me. Even after excluding M/M pairings there are still tons of fics that would appear. While I could read slash pairings as long as there are not that much mature parts (I read a few Harry/Loki fics), I would prefer that it is easier to filter them out. Thanks.


** There's a chrome plugin I think called AO3rdreader or something, you can blacklist tags and then it always keep those tagged fics filtered out without you having to reset it everytime you open the page

** Set up a search once and then bookmark the result page. That way, you can quickly make small adjustments instead of excluding 30 tags each time.

Also, blacklist the relationships (eg Harry/Draco) and warnings you don't like (eg non-con, graphic violence and so on). Some people don't tag characters but the relationship or the other way around, so you have to cull both categories.

** If you aren't interested in it for M/F pairings, you could also do as the other commentators suggest and filter out tags like "smut" and "PWP". Many authors of course don't use them, but it would further filter out things you're going to be uninterested in.
