I've got a hankering for a slytherin based story. I don't necessarily want the golden trio to be slytherin. Or for the story to be about draco. In fact I'd rather like it if I found a fanfic that was set in the hp universe that wasn't necessarily about the hp crew.

I'm ok with crossovers and adult themes. And I'd rather avoid the ‚Äúk‚Äù and ‚Äút‚Äù ratings. (Sometimes life isn't all fluffy cupcakes and I like when stories don't avoid it just because of age or anything else.)

I'm pretty rotten at looking up things like this. If there's not a specific character or pairing I'm into I'm shit at finding what I want.

Thank you all in advance for your lovely recommendations! I will look at them all closely!


** linkffn(The Pureblood Princess)

Follows a relationship between Harry and Daphne Greengrass from Daphne's POV, superbly written Slytherin characters, none of the deatheater/politician-in-training nonsense. Somewhat dissatisfying ending however amazing story on the whole.

*** "Somewhat dissatisfying" is quite an understatement üòÇ. A great example of how a superbly written story only takes a few lines to drive right off a cliff.

**** It is QUITE the understatement. I want. To know. How. That is all. Though I did quite like the little blurb of the in character dnd stuff. As a pathfinder and dnd nerd myself I was exceptionally pleased.

  Daphne Greengrass always had a plan. She liked being organized. But the Dark Lord's return at the end of her fifth year derailed everything, and now she must decide who will best help her find the life she always wanted.

*** It never explains. The biggest part of the ending. Like. What?? How?? I WANT TO KNOW THE THEORY AND MAGIC BEHIND THIS!!! I am very frustrated. However. It was still a good story and it fit my slytherin fix to a tee.

I am always looking for recommendations though so don't be shy to share more.
