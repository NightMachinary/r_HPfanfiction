There's this one fic I read a while back and I can't find it, in it Snape is in the hospital and a healer contacts his ex wife Hermione. They divorced after the marriage law was repealed, but the healer searches Snape's house and finds out Snape loved her the whole time and worked to repeal the law for her. Does anyone know what it was called and where I can find it? Thanks!


** Oh damn I know this fic! I mean I don't know anything about it that's actually useful, but I know I've read it. If I come up with the name I'll let you know.

** I prefer the ship name Herus... Is this the one where [[/spoiler][Snape Kills himself after Hermione and Ron get married or where they get together?]]

  When Severus Snape comes to St Mungo's under a coma, a healer thinks her only responsibility is to inform his relatives of his inevitable death. Things get complicated when the healer finds out that he'd previously been married to a former student.
