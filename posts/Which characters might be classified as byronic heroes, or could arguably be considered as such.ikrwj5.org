** u/Hellstrike:
#+begin_quote
  Byronic heroes are characterized by having several particular traits. They may be angry, rebellious, seductive, and struggling with vices.
#+end_quote

Going with this definition from dictionary.com, I don't think that anyone fits since the series was written too cleanly for that. A Harry who deals with his grief by trying to fill the hole in his heart with women and whiskey would fit.

Although come to think of it, Dumbledore might fit given his past with Grindelwald (ignoring FB).

#+begin_quote
  Snape
#+end_quote

Snape is somewhere between antihero and "evil who wants revenge at the big bad". He is certainly no hero, not even a Byronic one. His treatment of Neville bans him from that title, nevermind his past as a death eater and willingness to sign a family's death warrant for cookie points with Voldemort.
