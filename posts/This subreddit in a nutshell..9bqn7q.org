Take the "Lord Potter" trope; these days, that's a trope that's generally frowned upon if not hated; but when I first started reading, those were the kinds of fics that I read nearly exclusively, because they were all the rage at that time.

1. Weak Harry. This covers not just a magically weak Harry but also an emotionally weak Harry. At minimum, I will only read a fic if Harry is as talented as he was depicted in PoA.

2. Weak magic. Anything that tries to reduce the utility/power of magic will be an instant-close for me. The most common offenders are: temporary or "illusion" transfiguration, magical exhaustion, and shields which can be overcome by non-magical forces (e.g. bullets).

3. Super Hermione. I like Hermione to be talented, as she was in canon, but kept in perspective. In particular, she should not be usurping Harry's position as the protagonist.

4. The introduction of too much physicality into (high level) duels. When you get to Auror level and above, people should not be dodging, flanking, etc. or really using any tactics inspired by Muggle combat. It should essentially be a test of magical skill -- with a bit of luck thrown in for good measure.

It doesn't sound overpowered at all to me. Magic can create and destroy matter, can allow you to teleport, travel through time, manipulate space so as to expand it, regrow entire limbs and organs etc. A falling building is pretty much nothing compared to those. And that's just thinking about magic in physical terms... in truth, magic is rather more wacky (see magic cast on secrets, job positions, the ability to bottle luck, etc) and generally just completely ignores all physical laws.

As Scrimgeour said in HBP, the problem is the other side can cast magic too. So your shield charm can stop a falling building, but there's no guarantee it will block your opponent's Stunning Charm.

#+begin_quote
  In your last point, are you talking about friendly duels like in a championship, or about actual fights between Aurors and DEs?
#+end_quote

Both, I suppose. Unless you're at a significant distance, I see magic as moving too fast to effectively dodge (which is distinct from evasion, which can be done). Basically your window to move out of the way/block the spell is while your opponent is in the process of casting the spell. Once the spell is "in transit", you're too late.

****** There is no logical connection between whether magic is capable of protecting you from a falling building and the speed at which spells travel. The former is determined by the relationship between magic and natural forces. The latter is determined entirely by magic.

Regardless, I did not say magic has no limits. I said it is not overcome by physical forces.

The limits of magic are described by magical theory, not physics. And as Snape tells us in OotP: "time and space matter in magic". Mass/energy, however, is something that magic routinely ignores/manipulates and does not appear to be a factor in magical theory. Consider, for example, the featherlight Charm, which Harry can cast by third year.

That said, again this has very little relation to the speed at which spells travel (it's more about the maximum distance at which they can be cast). There are indeed many spells which do act "at a distance", instantly, rather than travelling through the air. In fact, the vast majority of Charms and Transfiguration seem to act in this way. It's only really Dark Arts spells which travel through the air (and even then, not all of them - Imperius has instant effect from a distance).

Given that you need a Philosopher's Stone to make gold with magic, good luck. It's likely to be one of the 5 exceptions to Gamp's law (another example of the limits of magic being described by magical law).

Magical system in HP world is very primitive. There are just to rules in it (by JKR):

1. I don't want to stuck the plot with this problem, so magic can deal with it easily;
2. This problem is crucial for the plot, so magic can't fix it.

It's not bad for the series, because it's not about magic, but people. Magic is just a background and often a plot device to move things forward.

But if a fanfiction story is about magic and its capabilities, then more complex and solid system should be created with proper laws and limitations.

****************** It's very simple.

Magic vs physics? Physics loses.

Magic vs magic? "Stronger" magic wins.

Stunner vs shield? It depends largely on how competently the spell is cast.

Healing vs injury?

It seems to be more complicated. Why is splinching easier to heal than an injury from the dark magic? Splinching is just a result of an accident. Meanwhile, a curse is supposed to injure/maim/kill, this purpose (which splinching lacks) may work against the healing magic which has a opposite purpose. And the "stronger" magic wins.

"completely"

The issue is that HP magic isn't explained *at all*:

#+begin_quote
  We don't know.
#+end_quote

You admit it and yet, it's me /who doesn't understand/ :-)

All I say is that in order to affect physical objects magic has to be part of it, event if on the level we don't know yet (like Newton physics was unknown in ancient times). "Magic defies physics" isn't a rule, but a simple wish fulfilment. While it's not against what we know about HP magic (and as you've said we know nothing about it), it goes beyond the point of reasonable discussion, because it's on the same level as "Magic makes me God and you have nothing to counter it".

But it does, frequently. It just never gives us an infodump "here is how magic work", but subtly spreads the information. Which is good writing actually, even if I personally love infodumps about stuff like that.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8e3v5c/the_magic_of_harry_potter_by_taure_significant/][Taure wrote a lot about stuff that's told in the books about magic]].

Basically, if you think that there are no explanations in the books, then you have either never read them - or failed to understand what you read, and those are children books.

************************* I read that document. Taure did a great work putting all examples of magical theory together, but through the text it's clear that he (or she?) struggles to organize them into one whole and consistent system.

He looks at each example as it's given in the books, separately from others.

The best example is about food - he concludes that transfiguration (assuming it's permanent) could resolve their problems, but for some stupid reason couldn't be used.

Also there's a fact that JKR is bad with numbers and math. I think she couldn't create a complex and solid magical system, because it requires a lot of work with power levels, proportions, etc. and as I said before it's alright. We love HP books not because of it.

This statement is pretty ridiculous, he constantly connects informations from various examples. That was even more visible [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit][in the old edition]].

There is no such assumption? There is a presented rule of the system, and he theorises on how it works like that.

#+end_quote

Except it doesn't? This is not an RPG, you don't really need any hard numbers here. JKR's failure to comprehend numbers certainly undermines her worldbuilding sometimes, but that's not really the case for magical system.

#+end_quote

But I do. Rowling can't write a good plot to save her life (FB movie was close, until the mess of a final confrontation), but the setting, including the magic system, has a big potential. Unfortunately, most of the fanfiction authors don't tap into it, either sidelining wordbuilding aspects for a sake of writing shipfic, or just doing a terrible job at worlbuilding with trash like flammelage and scarred magical cores.

I think this statement explains itself well.

And shows that the system doesn't work. If transfiguration is permanent there's no reason for the Trio to look for food with Gamp's Law or not. He shows the the Law itself is just a bunch of words. Example: a pig is food for a wolf. According to that law it's impossible to transfigure anything into it.

Not hard numbers, but general understanding of strong, weak, limitations and boundaries, capabilities, etc. In “Harry Potter” everyone can do any magic that is required for the plot at the moment. After 4/5 books JKR needed her heroes to struggle and as result we see significant drop in their magical abilities.

Or she needed Harry to taste darkness, so he was able to correctly cast an unknown spell after reading it and no practice.

** Dude, half of your waking life is usually spent complaining about the other half, thats hardly new to the human condition. Its practically one of the tenants of Buddhism. Moreover, nobody expects to get anything out of it, its a form of catharsis.

Yes its repetitive. Yes it generally goes in a circle of everybody trying to make the most acerbic or humorous jokes about the same general issues. But a lot of the time thats just an enjoyable thing to type/write/read.

Don't read it if you don't your not interested, read if you find it funny or think you can come up with a funny joke at the moment - thats what I do, and it helps me to parse my thoughts for other situations.
