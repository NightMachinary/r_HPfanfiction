I'm considering reading it but I just have a couple questions before I dive into ~521k words of story.

1. Is the remastered version worth it? Reading on FFN is much nicer than reading on Patreon (It's free on there for those who might be worried that the author is profiting off of fanfiction) and the remastered version is very far from being completed (like 15 chapters at the time of me writing this compared to the original's 104)
2. It's completed but does it actually go through all of Harry Potter? I don't want to read 521k words on just year 4 (GoF and OoTP /combined/ have a lesser word count than that. how the hell do authors write that much on just one year?)


** I read it earlier this year and my advice to all who are wavering on whether or not to read it is: do not. I guess it's a decent story if you're really interested in romance, but if you've got any quality requirements, it's mediocre at best.

Here is a list of the worst flaws:

1. The only surprise the plot offers is how unoriginal it is. It's as if a divine force makes the plot follow the Stations of the Canon so that not even the biggest changes in characters' actions have consequences.

2. There are so many anticlimaxes that all tension evaporates.

3. The main characters are one-dimensional and unrelatable.

4. A very large portion of the text is simply filler that exists just because the writer wanted to give the readers something to read even when nothing important happens. I guess it was tolerable when the chapters were posted one by one, but reading the whole story in one go becomes quite a nightmare.

So, if you absolutely want to read the A Cadmean Victory, read the remastered version, because the original needs remastering so badly, and apparently the writer agrees.

To answer your second question, A Cadmean Victory begins at the same time as GoF and (if I remember correctly) ends around the same time as HBP, that's 521k words in three years.

** It is a completed story. Meaning you can expect that at whatever point it ends it will make sense to end it. Be that 2 weeks after it started or 300 years. Measuring it by if all Hogwarts years are written about is a very weird approach in my opinion. I mean, there are very high quality fics with 300k+ words that play in a couple weeks...

To the other question: it had its lengths from what I remember, so I can see how a remastered version could be nice. But not to a point where I would wait like a year for it to be finished.

*** I'm measuring in number of years covered because stories that stretch such short periods of time over so many words generally have an incredibly large amount of inane detail (or philosophising) to them that I don't care to read.

This could be different for some romance or angst or thriller fics but I'm here for adventure and world building and those kinds of things evolve over a larger period of time. I'm also looking for the characters learning magic and if they can match Dumbledore after 1 year then the sorry just strikes me as ridiculous.

**** It starts at the beginning of Year 4, and ends after Year 6, although Harry doesn't attend Hogwarts the whole time.
