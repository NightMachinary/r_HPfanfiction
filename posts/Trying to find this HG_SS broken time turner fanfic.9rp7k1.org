There was a romance fan fiction I read within the last year on FFN where Hermione was a teacher with Snape and she had a time turner. The problem was that is was broken or something so it took her and Snape to another time period. They were first stuck in a place where they were digging for gold, I think, and everyone thought she was Snape's sister but they didn't have the time turner and had to look for it to escape. Each time they left one time period trying to get back to Hogwarts, they were transported to another. In one, Hermione was mute, another on an island with Snape as a munk, I think. The last place was Canada where they had a child and friends and Snape had a job in the mines. Then something happened to him causing Hermione to use the time turner to take them back to Hogwarts. Ultimately were gone for 6 years but in the end only gone for 6 weeks, I believe. I could have sworn I saved this as a favorite but it's gone. Please help me find this!!!

Sadly the author took their HP stories down (although their profile is still live for other fandoms) and won't be reposting them.
