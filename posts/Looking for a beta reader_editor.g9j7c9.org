Hello. Monday was a bit weird for me. Weirder than anything else that had happened recently. I started writing Fan Fiction again.

I haven't written any fan fiction, at least semi seriously, for years so it was a bit of a shock for me to be writing again. But I had an idea and I wasn't going to let it sit in my head catching dust.

So, to that end, I'm looking for a beta reader or an editor or whatever they're called these days.

The fic itself will not be novel length, probably not even novella length. I'm aiming around 25k-30k words but I'm not determined to reach a specific word goal. When its done, it's done.

The fic follows Harry as an auror investigating a case where the dead are arising. I've written up a complete chapter plan and a very rough draft of the first chapter. So I'm looking for someone to cross the i's and dot the t's or is it the other way around?

Back when I used to write, they were called beta readers but I've been out of the game for so long now they could be called something entirely different.

So please if you fancy taking a look please let me know. If this doesn't belong here please delete and I'll find som other place to ask.

Hope you all have a great day!


** It would be cool to beta read or something but alas I would have no idea what I'm doing. Beta readers are like editors right? Do they just fix the misspelling?

Edit: Have a great day as well!

*** There's not a single right answer to that. I've been a beta for three writers of HPFF:

The first was a first-time writer who needed a lot of help with even basic stuff like formatting speech, and choice of words. It was quite rewarding and definitely made a difference to the story but it was a lot of hard work.

The second is a well-established and respected author, specifically [[/u/Starfox5]] . There, I (and his other betas) would receive a Google doc on which we'd make comments and edits. 95% of the time these would be spelling or grammar tweaks, and there wasn't much opportunity to give feedback beyond that. I think I got him to make one bigger change. This was all pretty hard work since Starfox's writing was already high quality and coming up with meaningful suggestions took quite a while. Eventually I didn't have enough time to do it any more.

These days I beta for [[/u/TE7]]. This has become something more of an online correspondence during which fanfiction is, from time to time, mentioned. Typically he'll send over a Word document with 500-5000 new words (usually closer to the former, the lazy bugger) and I'll send back some thoughts and we'll go back and forth then he'll send more. My comments can be anything from "Yeah that's pretty good - I liked x especially" to a series of questions, thoughts about character or plot development, possible contradictions or anything else. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/eevjkq/a_shortstory_for_christmas/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][One time]] I told him he was letting himself down and he went away and rewrote quite a bit of the first chapter of a new story. Eventually a chapter will be completed and I'll do a full spelling, grammar and anything else pass over it before he publishes. Starfox5 preferred full Brit-picking while TE7 likes to misspell words in his typical American way, except for one time when I Brit-picked it all anyway and he let it pass. Because all this happens incrementally apart from the last check, it's usually pretty relaxed and our biggest arguments come from our contrasting politics rather than fanfiction. Although the current project is already 52,000 words with no end in sight and will be an absolute bugger to proof-read.

So there are three very different ways it can work, and I'm sure other authors/betas have even more different ways. Not every author and beta can work together successfully so it's definitely worth asking what an author wants and how they plan to work with you before jumping in.

/Narrows eyes/ LIAR! It's 53558. But it also doesn't exist no matter what people on the internet tell you. it's not like I have /opens Ithaca, does quick math/ 93653 words of unpublished fanfiction!

...my God I have more unpublished Ithaca than I have published Ithaca. It's a good thing people don't read the shit I put on Reddit or they'd send me PMs going 'OMG UPDATE YOU HAS THE STUFF DONE'

Less watching the draft and more writing. Chop chop!

** I definitely fancy taking a look! I also suggest checking [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] for their schedule for when they offer beta services. There's also a list of betas you can contact in the sidebar of this sub.
