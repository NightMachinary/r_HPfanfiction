Like the title saysüòÑ

But seriously. I just re-read the Black Magician Trilogy. Again. I wondered is there a crossover with Mrs Canavan's works? Or a fusion?

And if not someone here to write it? üòâüòÑ


** Two exist. 16k words in total. A one shot and a incomplete fic. Haven't read either and looking at them I won't be.

*** I know right. Her works r the only ones I have more re-read than every other book I read so farüòÅüòÖ

And the x-over potential is is really big imo.
