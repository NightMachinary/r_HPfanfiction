Besides laziness, connivence, and lack of creativity. Why would JK EVER introduce something so powerful and so game changing that it simply cannot he ignored by the fans. I mean, I know Hermione is historically a stickler, especially in the first 4 books. But come on, she is smart enough to see how much they could've done with that! She never tried going back thousands of hours, never wanted Harry to have proper training (fugitive on his trail)!

The idea she had something more powerful than Dumbledore, Merlin, and Voldemort combined around her neck and didn't use it for anything other than extra classes... Jesus it has to be one of the stupidest things we all bought! Not to mention grown people trusting a 13 year old with it, like hey I know you can't use magic outside of school but here's a time machine that'll fit perfectly around your neck!

What did you guys think initially? When you first read the book what was your thoughts on this time turner? Because mine were HEY THIS THING MIGHT BE IMPORTANT! Not to mention how the timeline wouldn't already be constantly messed with, and not to mention Voldemort would've given anything to get one and he succeeds 95% of the time! Geez, what are your guys's thoughts?


** I honestly just thought: "Hey, neat, stable time loop." I liked that it seened a very bad idea to try and meet yourself, and that it seemed hard to impossible to change what you know happened when using the time turners and imagined this would greatly restrict their usefulness. That one only can go back a few hours with them influenced how i looked at them ( as "possibly useful, but not game breaking"), too.

The "cursed child" time turner? I don't like it as it got rid of all the limitations I liked aboug the original time turners.

*** I agree. When I first read PoA as a teenager, I thought it was fucking brilliant! What a cool way to set up all these weird inconsistencies and allude to terrible things happening that get "fixed" in a logical way. Then OotP came out and I was like... wait, why doesn't everyone have Time Turners!? What happened to my cool time loops?!

*** As far as I'm concerned the Cursed Child and the Epilogue never happened. Time Turners still work on the closed-loop premise, and paradoxes are impossible when using them. That's what my headcanon says, and it's a damn good thing I never plan on selling the idea, ‘cus that means I can ignore all evidence to the contrary.

** I know this doesn't really explain why Time Turners weren't more utilized in canon, (they would be incredibly useful in high stress / impossible scenarios), but I think with regards to the main cast, the below summarizes my thoughts:

My headcanon is that Time Turners can only make stable time-loops and trying to circumvent that leads to all non-stable realities collapsing; ei. you go back in time to create a paradox and end up in an infinite loop (thus not part of the original universe). The only paradox-free circumstances are safe. A paradox, here, is one in which you modify the past before it was introduced to modified time, not one which you create via a loop (which can be interpreted as a paradox, but for the sake of Time Turner technology, is stable). The past cannot be altered, but an individual can exist in two or more separate places due to turning time.

You can witness your future self doing something and it is not a paradox with regards to a Time Turner. If you witness something happening and try to go back to change it, you can't.

The Ministry grants these time machines to children because they know they can only create stable loops and aren't in any real danger of destroying reality with a paradox.

Most wizards, and children, are idiots and don't fully appreciate the implications and intricacies of everything a Time Turner can do.

Hermione isn't an idiot and slowly goes a bit mental trying to navigate all various possible paradox scenarios and winds up realizing that it's best to just not have access to that power anymore. Also, 36-hour days are terrible for your mental health. Hermione tends to go a little overboard with studying.

So, there are likely some non-zero number of realities where Hermione is trapped in time somewhere because she screwed up. No one else notices, because the Time Turner only allows a paradox-free loop to continue. It just seems like Hermione is taking on more classes than is temporally possible.

The best way to make a stable time-loop is to go back in time and tell yourself what to do before going on about your newly found free time. I don't know, maybe they come with a brochure or instruction manual or something.

So, you know you should be going back in time because you got a message from your future self to go back in time. You know you already went back in time, and you've already seen it, so you have to make sure it happens or else you're creating a paradox. Hermione walks into a bathroom, meets another self telling her to go back 2 hours after Charms class. She knows she has to do it because it already happened, but in the future, and her future self remembers being told to do it, so she tells her past self. Makes sense?

I think all these various facts and stipulations, not even accounting for the increased class-work, drives Hermione a little crazy.

You can't change the past, you can only "gain time" by being in two places at once. But, your body is still operating on its own clock, and losing sleep is terrible for you. A few too many all-nighters and it's evident that good, natural habits are far better than loads and loads of cramming. Anything you witness happening has to happen, because a future-you didn't prevent it, which means going back to try to change it is impossible.

I don't think JKR fully realized the implications of Time Turners to her universe, but, a great wizard from another universe once said: “A wizard is never late, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to.” Time Turners certainly alleviate a bit of canon contrivance with regards to Deux Ex Machina, so maybe her intention was to allow some wiggle-room with regards to why Dumbledore or Voldemort could always be where they were most needed at any given moment.

*** This is the way to handle it. The Homestuck way. Time loops are possible and incredibly useful, but when you have an absolute, already established outcome, fucking with it is either impossible or a very bad idea. Even when it seems like you messed with the established alpha timeline, you actually just completed it the way it was supposed to go in the first place. Executing every little thing right requires either an incredible amount of luck, or a mindbending amount of minute planning.

** When I first read the book? I was 9 at that time. I didn't think much else than "cool, timetravel!".

Nowadays I'm fond of trying to explain it from the perspective of the fact that a 13 year old got its hands on it. Which means: it can't be that dangerous, nor can it be overly powerful.

Hermione never tried going back thousands of hours because it was impossible to do so. A few hours was the maximum she could do. Given how much of a burden she put on herself with it by adding somewhere between 2 and 10 hours per day to her normal 24 hours, I'd also argue that it isn't exactly a end-all solution for training. 12 hours of work per day is pretty much maximum for people. 12 hours of /intellectual work/ is close to impossible. So if Harry didn't train and learn during his normal day as is, what need would there be for additional hours?

#+end_quote

Again we can conclude that if 13 year old Hermione was given this item, it was /not/ more powerful than any of these people - and probably barely came over the power required to do extra classes.

Because from what we see in the book we can conclude that the only thing a timeturner does is to allow a copy of you to go back in time and look at something /that had already happened/, from another perspective. All agency must be taken from that copy, because all actions have already been performed. It is a (individual) loop in time, rather than a split or a jump from, or around the timeline.

**** That would have been the ideal play, but I think it would be in character for Hermione to use it strictly for studying and try to fit it in around a normal eating/sleeping schedule.

I mean, at one point she misses Charms because she fell asleep studying or something. That tells me she very much /didn't/ use it to get more sleep.

Yeah, no. "Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time", remember? Whoever gave it to her almost certainly told her the consequences of fucking around with that thing. Maybe turning it even one fraction of a degree too much, or once too often traps you in paused time forever. Maybe you get stuck in a 1.88227 second loop for 10,000 years.

Experimenting with it probably sounds about as appealing to her as experimenting with antimatter does to me. Cool in concept and maybe something to be done after another decade or so of education/training and with supervision, but definitely to be left to the professionals for now.

I agree though, that the professors giving Hermione one is absolutely pants on head retarded. You just have to realize that JK Rowling wasn't really trying to create a logical and consistent world. The series was never meant to hold up to this kind of scrutiny.

** Well, she couldn't go back thousands of hours with it. It had a limit of five hours. Also, how do we know she didn't get up to her own shenanigans? We only have Harry's limited POV to go by. Maybe she used it to get some extra sleep on Saturday mornings. That's probably what I would have done.

** Personally I like the idea that the fewer interactions you have with outside world the more stable the loop and the lesser the chances of going mad become.. So a kid joining an additional class doesn't have much effect on the world around it, but a powerful wizard cloning themselves and going into battle twice at the same time, or trying to get information which will affect the actions of his double will cause unstable time loops and insanity.

With that you can take two classes if they are on the same time, but not actually do much additional study time over what you'd do before (Like if you could do 8 hours of classes and 4 hours of homework without a time turner.. with a time turner you can do 10 hours of classes and 2 hours of homework.. so'd you'd better be good at paying attention in class or doing homework already), or do crazy time travel shenanigans.

** I don't think it's that big of a deal - from the faculty's perspective, practically speaking all you have is an extra second-year student, and a very rule-abiding one. Both copies of her are still second-year students, not capable of getting up to much serious mischief, and contained within Hogwarts grounds. Considering how many things can go wrong at a school for magic, it doesn't seem to stand out as particularly risky. Moving staircases and Quidditch are probably bigger threats to student safety.

** One thing to note is per HP cannon, you dont go back and change anything. The timeline us permanent and cant be changed because when you go back in time, you were already there in the first place.

That said using it for training is a real possibility or some of the other considerations, but they also mean you can't not go back of things went wrong for the second run through.

** I find myself happier pretending /Cursed Child/ is just terrible fanfiction that happened to get published and ignoring its existence, so for the purpose of this discussion I will stick to what we see in /Prisoner of Azkaban/. With that being said, there're two points I'm going to address.

*The premise: Why Hermione got a Time Turner*. I don't like it, honestly. It seems bizarre that Hermione, as good as she is, would get the kind of preferential treatment the book implies that got her the Time Turner, for a simple and stupid reason. Because "I want to take more classes than is physically possible" is a stupid reason, IMO. And I mean, come on. McGonagall had to go to the Ministry of Magic to request special permission to get the Time-Turner and give it to Hermione so she could do this, when it's never done at any other point. Since Dumbledore himself knew Hermione had a Time Turner, I have to assume that he personally also assisted Professor McGonagall in lobbying to allow Hermione its use. That, to me, stretches suspension of disbelief well beyond any acceptable breaking point.

*The Time Turner itself*. Looking at how /PoA/ implemented this particular plot device, it actually did so reasonably well IMO in that there are implicit limitations as to what it can do, and it also shows the repercussions of use(or, more to the point, overuse) of such a device - repeating hours over and over again every day starts to take a toll on Hermione, as shown when she's so burned out she falls asleep studying and completely misses Charms at one point. And she comments at the end of the year that it was driving her mad, which would make sense given that she is ending up with a total amount of class time per day that is up to triple that of her classmates(I believe her schedule at least once, if not twice, shows her taking three classes/exams in the same time slot).

Now, I'm going to make two assumptions here. Since the Time Turner is described as looking like an hourglass, I assume one turn = one hour. Second, I am assuming that each class at Hogwarts lasts approximately one hour. In other words, for most of the story Hermione is only going back in time for a maximum of one hour, and the longest period of time that is covered is no more than three hours ("Three turns", per Dumbledore).

Additionally, the Time Turner creates a stable time loop, though one can assume from Hermione's own words that while stable, the loop is fragile and can be disrupted - with dire and presumably irreversible consequences for the one responsible. But these characteristics mean that the device, while powerful, is substantially limited in what it's capable of doing. Both the book and the movie make it fairly clear that this is what's happening - most obviously, with Harry seeing Harry cast the Patronus - assuming that he saw his father because, as he's been repeatedly told, they look so much alike.

The movie has a couple of other examples as well, one of which I find rather darkly amusing.

- At Hagrid's hut, while they're inside a rock hits the back of Harry's head, and upon looking out the window they notice the approaching Fudge, Dumbledore, and MacNair. Post-Time Turner, we find out said rock was thrown at him by Hermione.
- Not long after that, while the Trio are behind Hagrid's hut, Hermione hears a branch crack, and says /"I thought I just saw...nevermind."/ We eventually find out that the cracking branch was caused by Hermione stepping on it, so Hermione briefly saw herself.
- Then there's this one: just as the freshly-transformed Lupin is advancing on them, he hears a howl and runs off...we later find out that the source of the sound was Hermione, who (in a moment of hilariously monumental stupidity) thought it was a good idea to get the attention of a full-grown werewolf by faking a wolf howl. It was pretty awesome watching Buckbeak beat

Thus, barring some truly spectacular screw-up, the changes caused by use of the Time-Turner have already happened because the Time-Turner would eventually be used to cause them to happen. Stable time loop.

So in conclusion, I think it's a stupid idea, but it's implemented acceptably well in the story.

** It's hard to think of a reason for Hermione to even have the time turner in the first place that isn't either borderline Machiavellian, or screams out blatant incompetence of both the Hogwarts Staff (assuming that anyone other than McGonagall and maybe Dumbledore knows Hermione has it) and the Ministry of Magic (specifically the Department of Mysteries). Partly because I'm a terrible person and can think of a whole slew of morally questionable, if not downright illegal things I would do if I had one, where I could guarantee my own alibi with it.

Frankly, I find the explanation that she needed it to attend all the classes to be a rather flimsy one, when it would've been undoubtedly explained to her just how impractical, not to mention mentally draining, it would be to take on such a heavy workload. Ultimately, I feel like time turners were only made a thing because Rowling thought having a stable time loop as part of PoA's climax would be exciting and interesting, hence why the only other time they show up later on in the series (not counting Cursed Child) was when they all got smashed beyond repair in OoTP, probably because she'd realized just how plot breaking they could be in the right (or wrong) hands.

Not to mention a ridiculous level of favoritism.

I mean, think about it: McGonagall had to /personally/ request authorization from the Ministry of Magic, and on top of that, since Dumbledore knew about we have to assume that he himself, as a highly respected and influential member of the wizarding community, personally stepped in as well to convince the Ministry to authorize it. All for /one/ student. That is /insane/.

** With the exception of when time turners are used merely to hand-wave why someone is in the past (like a canon-era character traveling back to Marauder-era for example), where I simply just ignore it, my personal headcanon is that they can a) only go back a few hours, b) only produces stable time loops. So you can use them to get more time for a task, but you can't really alter time.

It still makes them very powerful, but not godlike.
