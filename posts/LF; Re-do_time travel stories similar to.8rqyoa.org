Just read linkffn(12868582) yesterday and would love more so over fics like it. Read all the main ones but this was new. And kinda refreshing until the end (did not like it). I want more stories like this, not much bashing, he finds more friends, tries to fix everything, finds love, maybe a saner Luna as a (girl)friend, and gets it right. No Ginny pairing please! Everything else is fine

Thank you :)


** Try linkao3(c'est la vie). Not complete, but an interesting story nonetheless.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry is struck with the killing curse and wakes up the day of the last task. This story will be the Order of The Phoenix if Harry a bit wiser and Luna a more present character. No time Paradox and no godmoding. Slow build up.
