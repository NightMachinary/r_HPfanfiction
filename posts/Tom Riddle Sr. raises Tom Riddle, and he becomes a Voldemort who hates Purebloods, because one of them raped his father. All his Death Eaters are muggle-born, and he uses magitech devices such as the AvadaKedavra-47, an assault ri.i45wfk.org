** That actually sounds pretty cool, although in this case, his middle name wouldn't be Marvolo anymore. Riddle Sr would definitely get it changed, and Tom might not use an anagram at all because he was proud of the Riddle name.

Furthermore, he could be sorted into a different house.

As for his weapon of choice, it looks like AK47 on the outside, but fires magical bullets including Avada Kedavra at maximum 500 rpm.

*** How would the bullets work? Are the already preloaded with the spell and each different clip is for a different sell like bombarda or stupefy? Or does the wielder channel their magic into the gun directly for the desired spell?

**** I assume pre-made. Since Tom loves magitek, he is also into new manufacturing processes. His Riddle Industries has a top secret magical division that can produce about 1000 Avada Kedavra bullets per month.

The advantages of AK47 are many: longer ranger, higher speed, better accuracy (no more complicated wand movement), and much much higher rate of fire. The drawback is of course only one type of spells per rifle magazine.

***** Another advantage is that the wielder doesn't have to focus on the spell either, which comes especially in handy for the killing curse which requires a true desire to see the other person dead. I imagine there could also be a built in switching spell to make a quick change to another magazine, it would save on fumbling around trying to change them by hand.

**** The Arithmancer/Lady Archimedes series explains magic gun and other magitech possibilities pretty well. In short: runes.

Essentially the way runes are explained in that series you can, if you know the math and can figure it out, make a gun that uses runes to fire the bullets. In that series Hermione makes a silenced, full-auto smg that way. At that point it's just a matter of engraving the runes for various spells onto the bullets, include runes that activate the spells on impact, and power up the runes once you've got them engraved. Best part about that is not only do bullets fire much faster than spells, but they also act as shield breakers.

**** Easy! Use the duplication spell to copy a pre-made bullet. The bullet is "real" for one minute, then fades away. When you chamber a round, the bullet is duplicated and moved into the chamber. As the bullet is loaded into the chamber for firing, an explosion spell is cast on it to go off when it hits something. When the trigger is pulled, a third spell propels the bullet at 1,000 fps (300 mps). The tuypical assault rife cycles between 500 and 800 rounds per minute. A machine gun cycles at 1,000 rounds per minute.

I really doubt any shield cast by ANYONE would withstand 700 explosive spells PER MINUTE!
