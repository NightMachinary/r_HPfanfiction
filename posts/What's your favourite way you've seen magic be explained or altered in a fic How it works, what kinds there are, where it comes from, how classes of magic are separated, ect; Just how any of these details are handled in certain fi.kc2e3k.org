I can't remember where I saw it but personally I'm fond of this explanation I saw to explain why Charms and Transfiguration aren't the same thing:

Charms is a class where you cast your magic, Transfiguration is a class where you mould your magic.

â€‹

Another thing I quite like is the idea that Parsletongue can amplify magical spells due to being magic in of itself. I don't know if that was the exact explanation given but I do know A Year Like Known Other has Parslemagic like that. (I'd link it but I don't know how to do it)


** Parslemagic as you said.

And although I know its cliche, wandless magic. I'm in love with the Harry Potter universe, but I was never a fan of the wands, so everytime wandless magic happens and is well explained in a fanfic, I'm really up for it!

Dark Arts. Especially because I think there is a seductive side to them. How they can corrupt people over time.

** It must be Methods of Rationality. It had like a giant overhaul with things like:

Rules for transfiguration, like you must not transform anything into a liquid that someone could drink, or burn transfigured object because someone can breath in the particles from the air and kill them after it transforms back into it's original form.

False memory charms was a thing where not even Veritaserum can show the truth, because yoj can alter someone's memory to remember differently.

Patronus Charm 2.0, but it's super spoiler.

Magical lightsaber, enchanted curse proof armor, a soda that you drink and then something funny or unexpected will happen and you're guaranteed to spit it out some way, etc.

Much stuff. It's like a remastered edition of the whole magic system. Also, the fic is super controvertial.

** I like it when authors write the dark arts as more than just crucio, avada kedavra and imperio. When they actually dive into it and explore the depth of all kinds of dark arts: necromancy, rituals, soul magic, blood magic, etc etc.

** I really enjoyed Core threads. Worth a read. I don't remember specifics as I haven't read it in a while but it was very interesting how Harry worked with his magic. Linkffn(Core Threads)
