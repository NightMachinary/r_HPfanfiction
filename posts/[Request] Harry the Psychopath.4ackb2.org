Any stories that Harry is still on the good side but is a bit like Dexter Morgan, he kills those who deserve it but in such a way that could be classed as murder but does it in secret.

Brownie points to any fics that Voldemort becomes terrified of the killer (Harry).

Thanks!

*** Harry doesn't exactly kill those who deserve it in this, just anyone who gets in his way. That just happens to be "bad" people a lot of the time.

Still a psychopath.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

** "Returning to the start" has him returning to the past, then kill Death Eaters off. I'm not certain he'd qualify as a Psychopath though.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  JK Rowling said: "If Merope had lived and raised Voldemort, he would have turned out to be much different, probably a better person." But just how much different? And how much different would Harry be if he was given a life without the expectation of saving the world? What if his hero-complex was still intact, but so twistedly dark, that he goes through desperate means to hide it?

** harry is on the good side but he worries that he's going insane, extreme violence, torture and disfigurement of enemies abound. linkffn(2680093) circular reasoning

much less mature look at violent harry in the denerian regendae series, still lots of murder and mayhem but don't remember him tourting innocent family of deatheaters for information for example linkffn(3473224)

I know of a lot more but most of them dont have harry on the good side so much as the self intrest side.

linkffn(Reunion by Rorschach's Blot) has that, and the rest of DA aren't particularly nice either.

linkffn(Random Craziness File by Darklooshkin) has a chapter, "The Damned", that has a Dark!Trio with Harry the killer, Hermione the drug dealer, and Ron the thief.
