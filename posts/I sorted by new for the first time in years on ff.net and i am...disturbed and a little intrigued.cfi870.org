What the hell is Alpha/Beta/Omega?

Why can't people write actual sentences?

Why are there so many great ideas that just suffer from horrible writing?

****** I've seen a lot of those on FFN, since on FFN they can't be filtered out. The same principle applies as with the barely legible fics. Once I've read far enough to realize what they are, I close the tab and move on. The only cases when I remember a fic of that kind is when the rest of the plot leading up to the bad parts is good enough that I stick with it for a few chapters before realizing what depths it will sink into.

So the point still stands: If the fic managed to hold my interest long enough to be memorable then it's still not the 'absolute worst'.

femJon/Oberyn. Soulmarks are basically gods ordained to either act as way to provide restitution for a wrong done by a family on another or to breed a hero/important person the gods deem necessary for something. Most people don't have them - only two couples have them currently that I can remember. People think this pairing happens because a) the North not preventing the death of Elia and her children or b) after the Baratheons the Martels have the closet ties to the Targaryans so by the two marrying they improve their joint claim to the Targaryan dynasty. Ned is not happy... at all. And there is also a bunch of AU events and their consequences that are interesting.

** Found a fic that sounded interesting the other day. I tried, and I mean tried, to read this thing, it sounded so good, but the first chapter was almost incomprehesable. The syntax was awful.

I have a rule of thumb for reading ff, if I can survive the first chapter, I can probably read the whole fic. This was one of those exceptions. 5 whole chapters went by before a single piece of dialogue was used, and the first use was a giant chunk, like two whole paragraphs, then dialogue was missing from the rest of that chapter and the next. That was when I finally gave up on this fic that had a great idea.

Teachers in primary/middle school always taught, ‚Äúshow, don't tell‚Äù and it wasn't until reading that that I realised this was not a thing ingrained into people.

The lack of dialogue, bad grammar, horrible syntax killed this fic for me sadly.

Also don't get me started on A/B/O fics or soulmates/soulmarks fics. The few I have tried were really bad.

I can read a fic with bad spelling, I can read a fic with questionable grammar. But if the story isnt written well enough I sadly just skip it.

On the note of bad spelling though, read a fic where ‚ÄúLucius‚Äù was spelt as ‚ÄúLuscious‚Äù every time, and it gave me a good chuckle.

** I attribute that to middle school girls. I've been sorting like that for a while after exhausting the favorites of authors I've read before so it doesn't surprise me if I have to look through 2-3 pages before I find 1 fascinating story. I usually see a bunch of Draco/Harry/Voldemort/Snape/Hermione pairings, mpreg/knotting/soul bonds/life debts and angst/hurt/comfort/drama, poorly formulated summaries that not only advertise boring looking stories but also a writer's inexperience/youth and even some that you can't really tell what the story is about because some idiot decided to take the opportunity to describe their story and instead acted like they're writing an A/N. But I'm fine with that if it means finding new stories... It's just a little annoying. Don't forget what this communities normal age demographic is. Us people in our 20s need to stick together for our sanities sake lol.

‚Äã

What surprises me even more is capping your searches off at what's only been uploaded this week. You can be tricked into thinking a fandom is alive and healthy when you're only going through its back catalog. With some of these smaller (*older) fandoms the weakly uploads are in the double digits. You can forgot about blasting through pages looking for that 1 good story when there's only the 1 page of stories to look through. And that's not mentioning the slow march towards death you can watch as you see fandoms weekly uploads become smaller and smaller. That's usually when the writers stop trying new things and instead form some kind of micro-community where they fixate on this one "perfect" story someone left unfinished and they're all trying to recreate/finish it... It's usually not very good in the first place so I can't explain why they've done so.

‚Äã

But instead of just complaining I'll give you guys a recommendation for something to check out. Framed & Fractured by Antediluvian Poet is a story I found just the other day and after pming the writer he said he's taking it off hatius and is working on the next chapter. If you try the story I think you'll know why that's exciting me :)
