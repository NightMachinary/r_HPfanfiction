** A couple of points. First, the thing about this is that doing "tropes well" comes down a lot more to the quality of the writer and planning rather than the tropes themselves (at least in my opinion). I'm not a believer in the idea "there are no bad ideas, only bad execution," but it does touch at the heart of what I mean. Most tropes seem pretty unique or cool or enjoyable even in bare-bones forms because most people don't encounter them a lot. But once you realize they are not unique in fanfiction (beyond just the particular fandom) only quality writing can make those more entertaining to reread.

Second, in terms of doing tropes well, there are actually /two/ ways that this is generally done. The first is to play the tropes straight and develop a world that actually is believable around them (sort of what PoS does, for example with the werewolves or occlumency) and using them to actually tell a story. The second is to /subvert/ said trope. A good example of this in fiction is the ASOIAF books where Ned (and later Robb) is initially setup as your stereotypical fantasy hero who follows their honor/heart/gut, only to end up dying unexpectedly. Taking an idea and turning it on its head, then seeing how that impacts the story. Again, it all comes back to telling a story and not just building a world filled with these tropes.

Now for what you are really asking for:

- Marraige Contracts and HP/DG: linkffn(Contractual Invalidation; The Amalgamation Agreement): both are examples of subverting both the Harry/Daphne pairing and the whole marriage bond idea. CI also subverts the whole noble reluctant hero Harry too (see Ron's hilarious dialogue in Ch. 1), along with other common tropes in the genre.
- Slytherin!Harry in general: linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): Harry ends up in Slytherin...and its absolutely miserable for him. Unlike practically every other Slytherin!Harry fic. Props for canon Harry characterization too.
- Harems fics: linkffn(The Firebird's Son): and its sequels. They create a world where harems are in fact a rational aspect of the world, except instead of being the dream of many a teenage boy, its absolutely miserable and more akin to vampirism than anything else (it makes sense in context). It also turns the whole 4th year tournament on its head too. These are also the anti-nice!Goblin fic, reminiscent of the Goblin Slayer light novels.
- Dark!character: linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist): a dark Hermione (or any character) that is simultaneously still a sweet girl without much malice whatsoever. More crack than anything else.
- Time-travel and many others: linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is a Dish Best Served Raw): plays most of the tropes straight, but the writer again makes it work through the quality of there story telling and originality.
- Time-travel and killing Tom Riddle before he grows up: linkffn(Realignment) for once Tom Riddle is arguably the hero (or at least protagonist of this story), with Harry acting more like the T1000 from Terminator 2. Tom Riddle doesn't miraculously become good, merely adapts to the circumstances and new information, unlike practically every reformed!Voldemort fic. Also Tom Riddle, the Boy-Who-Lived.
- White/Light Magic: linkffn(The Crown of Metis) - light magic is a thing, but similar to the horseshoe theory of political spectrums, it show that as different as dark and light magic are they are equally aberrant forms of magic in the HP world, warping those who delve too deeply.
- Fiendfyre and Dark Magic: linkffn(The One He Feared; Lesser Evils) - I have seen so many fics that show people throwing Fiendfyre around like candy, but few have actually shown it as intricately and well-developed as these fics. Not to mention showing how Dark Magic in general works better for people who are...well, jerks and monsters.
- Diety/Entity/Idea sends hero back in time: linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) - as brief as this fic is, the summary should get your attention. I cannot stress how unique and entertaining this fic is, and how it turns all the tropes of the genre on its head.

There are more, but hopefully this will work for you.

*** My one problem with Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is that it tries to combine a time travel fic with a harem fic. That's kind of child grooming, which is gross, but it's also so central to the plot and the world that there's no way around it.

**** I really enjoy this one because (as I interpret it at least) Harry isn't being portrayed as being the good guy - he's actually a bit like what I'd imagine a more connected young Tom Riddle would have been like.

** I remember reading a harem that did it right, not becoming a boring cringe fest filled with cliche tsunderes and etc.

It introduced 4 sisters who had only one thing in common, they hated studying. The mc was only a little older than them and was offered money to tutor them.

The sisters had unique personality that complimented each other, and I enjoyed it. It was a realistic situation, not any of the stuff you see in erotic fics.

Sadly, I forgot the name

*** Sounds like The Quintessential Quintuplets. And it's not a fic.

**** And they're quintuplets. And it's not (technically) a harem, since nobody is sharing.

***** On another thought, there are 69 fics for that fandom on FFN, so maybe it was one of those.
