Just kinda curious. To start things off, I think mine would be a polar bear, due to similar preferences for solitary life and meat-heavy diets.

Koala's are like the same but not as adorable

Although Panda asses are amazingly dirty

** Pottermore Patronus test gave me the Red Common Squirrel. I have been rather surprised at the first moment, but lately I think it is actually pretty good animal for me. I wouldn't mind if it was animagus form as well.

****** its an unusual behavior, but they can run pretty fast if they want to for whatever reasons. But, yeah. They mostly lazing around and sleeping because they can get stressed really fast and that's bad for their health.

*** Not Harry Potter, but my Gnome Warlock in DnD carries around a demonic Octopus familiar in a jar, which he then yeets with magic at people.

Octopodes are smart, so they have a capacity for malice that other animals lack.

** It's a hard question to answer. I doubt many of us know ourselves well enough (some people here are definitely selling themselves short!).

After a cursory google . . . mine might be a mole? Apparently they spend most of their time playing alone in their underground tunnels, and they're not fond of company. Fits pretty well.

** Sea lion or seal or something. Not very graceful on land, but I played NCAA Water Polo and continue to play in adult leagues.

I would love to be something that could actually breathe underwater, but being able to stay down for extended periods of time would be amazing itself.
