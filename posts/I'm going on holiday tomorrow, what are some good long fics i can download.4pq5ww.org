  Some call him the next Dumbledore. Others, a thrall of Grindelwald. Not even Harry himself is sure of where he belongs, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a dangerously magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way. Massive!Wizarding World, No!BWL.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** I would recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]]Though it is incomplete, it is still worth the read. I also loved [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1][Incorruptible: The Dementors Stigma]]

** Can't think of a long fic that's decent but not that well known. Long fics are either masterpieces or completely unreadable in my experience.

I'd try linkffn (Saving Connor), if you haven't read it before. Including the sequels I think it's 1 million words or so. I can confirm quality writing, but I've only read through the first two.

** I hope you've read the /Alexandra Quick/ series. If not, do it now. It's honestly the best fanfiction I've ever read, bar none - the plot is superb, the characters are well-rounded and dynamic, and the setting and "feel" is just spectacularly executed.

** I highly recommend the Albus Potter series by noahphantom. The series is canon compliant. I've always been drawn to fics that explore in-depth what magic is capable of and this series does an awesome job of it. The series hasn't been updated in awhile but the beta says it should be updating soon. Here's the first in the series: linkffn(8417562)

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.
