Hi everyone, was wondering if anybody knew or knows the story where Harry is a Hannibal-like character, and Hermione is the Clarice in the story. I remember Harry is a prisoner of the Ministry after the war. Thanks.


** Was there any cannibalism involved, or was Harry just good at manipulating and twisting people's psychology?
