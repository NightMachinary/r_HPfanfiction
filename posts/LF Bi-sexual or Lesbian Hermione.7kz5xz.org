The Circumstances are like in Canon. So Hermione discovers either Post-War or Post-Epilogue feelings for other Females (or one in Particular). I would like her to be at the Age of Epilogue (circa) or older. I would like to read how Ron and her Kids (if she has kids at all) would handle such a Situation. It would be good if there is a Sex scene included, doesnt have to be detailed, i would read a T rating, if there is a "jump/cut" and they lie naked to each other at the next morning. If Ron wants to try a Threesome, im fine with that too.


** Nothing for Epilogue era but Crazy little things is set after DH with a Hermione/Luna pairing playing out at university. Pretty lighthearted with lots of fluff. Has a supportive Ron IIRC. linkffn(3973687)

Also, there's Dignity in Fear, which was written by a lesbian woman and has some of the best depictions of emotional turmoil and coming to terms with your sexuality which I've read so far. Set during OotP. The best femslash I know but has not updated for a few months. linkffn(10798339)

** For a post-war bisexual Hermione, I'd recommend linkffn(Amends or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky), though she spends more time with men than women.

There's also linkao3(Love in the Eye of the Storm by rattlesoft) which I thought was quite enjoyable. Hermione/Narcissa

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  After the war, Narcissa Malfoy spends all of her time holed up in Malfoy Manor.
