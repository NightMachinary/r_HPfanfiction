#+begin_quote
  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.
