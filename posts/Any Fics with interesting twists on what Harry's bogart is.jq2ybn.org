** Harry's bogart turns into the door of his cupboard. The place and symbol of his weakness, helplessness and of oppression.

#+begin_quote
  Revisiting the concept of boggarts in Snape's Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, Harry was wholly prepared to face the faux dementor. But what stepped out of that darkened space was something else entirely. A handsome boy with a gleaming prefect's badge and a cruel smile.

** Crack! The bogart wast thrown across the room. Straight at Harry. He could see Professor Lupin moving forward wand ready. But Harry jumped forward. He was curious, wanting to know what he truly feared. Harry knew he feared some things, but what was his deepest fear? Dementors, Voldemort, basilisks all came to mind.

The bogart started to shift and spread out making a white wall. Harry was confused, what was this the infirmary? But the wall or rather the bogart grew more detailed. A set of stairs formed and pictures that hung in this oh so familiar hallway. It was the Dursley's house. Then finally the outline of a place Harry knew well. His cupboard under the stairs.

The cupboard looked normal, but almost seemed to pulse. Feelings of dispair, pain and quiet hatred seemed to float around the class. Harry could almost smell the dust and cobwebs.

The moment broke when Ron said loudly, "I don't get it." Professor Lupin swept up, the bogart turned to a silver orb and then was driven back into the wardrobe it came from. He looked at Harry, an of look on his face. With a small shake he said, " I think that is enough for today, read the chapter on bogarts, and practice your wand movements. Next class we will be practicing casting." The class was very quiet as the gathered up their things. Many were thinking about the things they feared. Some about what ever it was that Harry feared. Whispers and mutters spread as they all walked through the halls and stairs. All asking the same thing. Can the Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived really be scared of a cupboard? And why?

But Harry knew. He wouldn't even be put in the cupboard again. Never be broken, hurt, or feel the dispair that lived in that small space. Never again would he be that sobbing little boy in the darkness.

  "Sometimes dementors are within us, too." It's third year, and the dementors are leaching the happiness from Harry. He's majorly depressed and to make matters worse, his boggart turned into Uncle Vernon in front of Professor Lupin.Harry gets by with the help of Remus and his friends.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** I don't remember the name of the fic but Harry has somehow ended up in the past and at some point they're in Grimmauld Place and Harry comes across a boggart, which takes the form of Lily, begging him to end his life, "Wake up from this bad dream" and join them in the afterlife. From what I recall this is witnessed by Remus and Snape.

Edit: It's "Easier than falling asleep" by JacobApples in part 1.4. I was wrong, it was Sirius and Snape who witnessed Harry facing the boggart. I remembered it thanks to [[/u/Peace-wise]] looking for that fic in another thread.
