:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I remember reading a fanfic that i really enjoyed and now i just can't seem to find it again. I don't remember much, only that it was placed in the Order of the Phoenix era and that Snape cured Hermione from Dolohov's curse. The only fanfics I've been able to find that resemble the timeline and plot up to some point are "The Devil's Tears" and "Phoenix Song", but they aren't the ones I'm looking for. If you know or find a story that is similar please let me know. Thanks! (◍•ᴗ•◍)


** Havent read it but i literally just checked it out and dismissed it, but! It sounds like what youre looking for. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13193205/1/Whiteboards][Whiteboards by Rule23]]
