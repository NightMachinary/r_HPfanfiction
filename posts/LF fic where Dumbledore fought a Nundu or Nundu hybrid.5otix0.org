I remember reading a story a while back where the story was separated between Britain and Dumbledore fighting against a Dark Wizard in Africa who eventually releases a Nundu or Nundu-crossbreed out onto the muggle villages and Dumbledore ends up fighting and killing it. I remember being really impressed with the story overall, but especially these sections, since it was enjoyable to see Dumbledore really giving his all in a war setting and not just scheming in the background. The supporting characters were also enjoyable, and I remember the concept of the Nundu being explained in a way that was really enjoyable as well.


** Are you talking about accidental animagus by white squirrel? (chapter 76 I think)

*** Actually, you'll want Chapter 83, the Battle of Gisenyi. That one has the nundu in it.

*** Their 'A Little Child Shall Lead Them' and 'The Arithmancer' are also very good.
