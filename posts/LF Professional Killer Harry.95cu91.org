************ Wow, how incredibly gracious of you. You realize saying something like that comes off as extraordinarily condescending, right?

Here are two.

1. Sending Harry & Hermione back in time to save Sirius. Hell, simply allowing Hermione to have a dangerous time machine to cram in more courses is pretty awful.

2. Allowing Draco to continue at Hogwarts when he's a marked Death Eater who is actively plotting murder.

************* I should hope so, it's because I was being condescending.

1. Hermione had proven reliable enough. And at that time the books were written light hearted, as a kids story, so it only needed a light explanation.\\
2. He had Snape on the kid, and being marked didn't mean much, as he clearly didn't want it, but had no other choice beyond death. Sadly enough, the school was the safest place. Yes, two deaths almost occured, that's bad, and sad. However, Albus had flaws that made him compassionate and overly forgiving. Not flaws that made him malicious, evil, or manipulative.

Lovely. I disagree with you, so you set out to be deliberately offensive. That feels like good behavior to you?

#+begin_quote
  Hermione had proven reliable enough.
#+end_quote

.. What? In what way did this 13 year old girl prove that she's reliable enough to handle a highly regulated item that has terrible consequences if an error is made.

You completely ignored the main point. He sent them on a highly dangerous 'mission'. Dumbledore sends her and Harry to deal with a werewolf and Dementors. Children. Against a vicious dark magical creature, and a swarm of soul devouring monsters. You really don't see the problem there?

#+end_quote

What this translates into is "Rowling didn't flesh this out, so it's up to fanfic writers to come up with excuses for the characters if we're going to consider the situations in a serious manner." If the writers have to interpret things, then it can go either way. Dumbledore had a really good reason, or he didn't.

It means Dumbledore makes dangerously poor choices. Just because Draco's in a bad situation doesn't mean he isn't responsible for every child at Hogwarts. If someone that he's responsible for gets hurt or dies, his intentions don't change much.

IIRC, in that fic Dumbledore is portrayed as an idiot. Not malicious or evil.

************ 1. The philosopher stone, and the challenges which were so easy that 3 first year students could pass without problems, even though the fidelius charm can keep places unplottable and would have kept Voldemort out. The only rational answer is that Dumbledore wanted to lure Voldemort out to the school, since it is ADs domain and kill 2 birds with 1 stone by testing Harry's supposed power against a temporarily weak Voldemort. This is one of the biggest things that cause people to think of Dumbledore as a puppetmaster. That he is a puppetmaster is hard to deny, but I think you are right in that people go to far in claiming that AD is evil or power hungry, while he obviously is the opposite, though his means generally are questionable.

2. Leaving HP with the Dursleys, even though the only ward is a blood ward for keeping out Voldemort (and most likely marked death eaters). Obvious flaws: Almost 100% risk of Harry becoming a sociopath like Tom or mentally deficient in some other way, shape or form due to the abuse. The books are improbable in this case, though not unrealistic (though understandable, since they were children books in the beginning). After Voldemorts resurrection, logically speaking, he should have access to Harry since he possesses his blood, negating the blood wards from effectively holding him off. In the second book we see that elves can apparate into his room without a problem, even if their owner has the mark and even if they have objective ill intent, because from their POV every mission the owner gives them can only be coupled with their well intent. Obvious solution: Send an elf to apparate in, get Harry and apparate out. Since Canon-Harry is a moron, sending him a letter with a portkey would be extremely efficient (though I admit that most likely the owls go to Dumbledore first, due to Harry's lack of fan post etc., though it would have worked perfectly in the summer after 6. year until he was picked up). However, the last one is likely due to a lack in J.K. Rowling's intellectual abilities (google "quora harry potter plotholes", e.g.: Why was not James or Lily secret keeper; if one of them managed to cast the spell themselves they could have chosen the other as secret keeper. If they did not manage to cast the fidelius charm themselves, then it was likely Dumbledore, who then must have known from the beginning that Sirius Black was not the secret keeper).

That brings me nicely to another point: Dumbledore heads important positions in the british and international governmenta. The most high, in fact, in the ICW. Why did he not push for Sirius Black's innocence, if he could give his word, as well as having Harry and Hermione take witness with veritaserum and whow their memories? His status should be enough to not think him a liar immediately.

Why did Dumbledore sent Riddle back to the orphanage in the middle of the London Blitz, even though he knew it will fill him even more with hate against him and muggles? Look up the dates.

How could Dumbledore not figure out the riddle behind the chamber of secrets, even though he lived through the first time, knows who has done it and knows that Myrtle died to the monster? Would it not be obvious to someone like him, that the entry should be exactly there? Is he not powerful enough to put a spell on the room that will notice him when someone enters which would reduce the potential "heirs", since according to canon the room is not used anymore.

** "REVOLVEVLOVER" by firethesound and zeitgeistic is a great one, lots of adventure and intrigue (but also Drarry, which admittedly isn't everyone's thing) - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2340719]]

Summary: "The work Harry does is justifiable. It's justice. He works for his country, and his country is a republic---the magical side, anyway. It's not laudable work, it's not work he's proud of, but it's necessary work. Harry has always taken the necessary jobs that no one else has the stomach for.

It's just that he's never deciphered a kill sheet and seen Draco Malfoy's name on it."
