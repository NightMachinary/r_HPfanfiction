** I want to read about Tonks.

I don't particularly care about Remus, so Remus/Tonks fics don't interest me.

The only other person who Tonks tends to get shipped with is Harry.

Therefore, Honks.

*** Yes! I dislike Remadora even more than my indifference towards Honks. Tonks is such an underrated character, there could be so much more done with her, the creative advantage is limitless, and seeing her metamorphmagus abilities be used for only smut is so annoying because she could be so much more!

**** JKR just needed a woman to fill the place of Remus wife to get the repeating story again with Teddy.

I think Remus/Tonks could have worked, but needed more time to fresh out. Otherwise, I would have been fine with JKR leaving Tonks unpaired and having someone else marry Remus

** Tonks is nearly 7 years older then him, has a full time job, loving parents, and was raised magical.

They have nothing in common, has almost all of the problems of even someone Fleur and even more distance.

For them to even meet involves her intentionally giving up sleep or taking sick days so she can guard his house on and off for two months while remaining unseen. As a metamorphigis and someone with a muggleborn parent she would in fact be the most capable of remains unseen leading to her presence being the least noticeable to Harry.

She's a neat character but any relationship has to be contrived from the ground up.

The only interesting bit is you'll generally end up reading AU's which are almost always better.

** Honks get bonus points for not being Remadora, one of few ships I outright dislike rather than feel indifference towards.

I also always liked the idea of Honks in universes where Harry takes on the Auror job and where she survived, with them making a great team and getting closer over time. She's an interesting, and underused character.

The most common Honks by far is "true form" shenanigans where they're somehow forced together in 5th-6th year (usually with Tonks tasked to protect Harry). I was never really a fan of that version of the ship, mostly because it features a Tonks that doesn't really have agency and only serves to be a pretty face for Harry to be together with.

And the whole “true form” thing is so annoying to me, and I have no idea why. Sure I get that Harry has taken her walls down (or something like that) but something about it makes me feel icky. Perhaps because the idea is so stupid, she can open up to him in other ways, and she's settled on a form that she loves and that's that.

So many Honks fanfics are just self-inserts where she's every good personality trait ever and it really grates on my nerves

** I have no problem with Harry/Tonks, as long as he's out of school first. She's seven years older than him, so any relationship when he's underage is just creepy (like those female teachers who sleep with their high school students).

Just noped out of a story where 12-year-old Harry is crushing on Tonks, which is completely normal and believable---but she's encouraging it, which sends us right back into creepy territory. Sadly, most of the Harry/Tonks stories I run across have him still in school, often with her a seventh-year student of 17 to his eleven-year-old firstie.* ::shudder::

*This only works with JKR's "bad at math" syndrome. When they first meet in canon, summer before 4th year, he has just finished 3 years of school while she's just completed a 3-year auror training programme. Thus, they did not overlap at Hogwarts. (Unless they did.)

** For Harry/Tonks, try 'Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass' by Temporal Knight. Honestly, if you don't like the ship in that story, you probably won't ever like it. (I'm not saying it's the best Honks story, just a really representative one). It's time-travel, and does address the age difference thing later on.

In terms of Harry/Hermione... there's no real 'representative fic' to recommend. Like, there's the Robst-likes, the post-war wistful ones, the fluffy short fics, the non-Robst Ron-bashers, the fem!Harry ones, the Harmony-plus-others fics, the clearly written by literature nerds ones, etc.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

** I can firmly say that Harry/Hermione is my least favourite ship. I dislike any ship between members of the golden trio, but Harry/Hermione seems to become the default pairing in so many fics, and it's always so boring.

I actually like Harry/Tonks, though. I just wish there were more good fics with the pairing.

**** Your dislike seems to be stemming from authors and their bad fan-fictions rather than tropes themselves. I am sure there is some Harry/Hermione story where Hermione has flaws like a real person and is not a self insert and there is probably some fan-fictions where Tonks is master spy and/or assassin for a secret branch of Magical Law Enforcement or some such thing and uses her shapeshifting for things other than satisfying her partners fetishes and fantasies.(although I am not sure about Tonks one since there are not as many Harry/Tonks fics as Harry/Hermione fics).

If you want you can write such stories. For example I would like to read a story where Hermione acts like a SJW only to realise the errors of her ways too late and struggles to gain back her friends trust. Likewise ı would like to read a story where Tonks is basically magical version of Black Widow or some similar thing.
