** Benefits of Old Laws is a sane!Voldemort fic that I just started reading, it's very long and ongoing. While there are political maneuverings and wizengamot shenanigans as of ch.51 (where I'm at) the politics have served more as a foil for characters to act on the repercussions of the titular old laws. There are a few B-plots that are just as, if not more, interesting ( I'm partial to the Snape plot personally and I am not a fan normally.)

I hope this is something that works for you but i understand if it's not. Happy reading!

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  When Harry saves Hermione's life they end up in a different world and in the middle of another magical war - but at least they have each other.
