Looking for fics where someone takes Harry under their wing and teaches him 1 on 1. I dont care who the mentor is or what subject is taught I would just like the story to be over 75 thousand words or complete.

  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.

** Remus is a mentor to Harry in this story I've been reading ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/The-Bureaucratic-Error][The Bureaucratic Error]]). Remus Lupin being thrust back in time and gets a chance to redo things better. I love the nuance and insight Iniga lends to his characterization. It is a WIP and updated regularly. Over 200K words.

  After his death, Remus finds himself 5 years in the past, having undone Voldemort's defeat and Teddy's birth. He's going to need his old friend Sirius to help him with this one.

** Potions and Snitches is an entire website dedicated to Harry/Severus non-slash relationships. A good portion of them are mentor fics as well as adoption; either include a lot of 1on1 tutelage.

*** I'll give it a try I like those type of storiesunless Snape somehow turns out to be his dad that turns me off immediately for some reason.

**** They have those but you can choose not to have that Snape "flavour" in the drop down menu or search results. I don't care for that flavour either. I don't mind him fathering other children (I'm actually writing one of those) but the author has to have an exceptional plot for me to enjoy him being Potter's biological sire.

***** Exactly I haven't ever found one of those I liked because that specific reason it's usually just like hey Lily hid it for some reason.
