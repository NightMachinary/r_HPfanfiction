Any fics where Harry has an enemy that isn't Voldemort and for one reason or another they both despise each other yet begrudgingly respect each other


** There is an element of that with Harry and Tom Riddle (who isn't Voldemort) in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), and more particularly the following books in the series. After preparing the Diary, Riddle realised what he'd be giving up by making Horcruxes, felt remorse, reintegrated his soul, and went into politics instead, achieving his bigoted aims in less violent ways. But the Diary preserves his sixteen-year-old self at the time it was created, and when it's awakened, it decides the original has gone soft and rebels against him, calling itself Voldemort and enticing away his more extreme followers, like Bellatrix Lestrange, to pursue more violent methods of reform. Harry and Riddle are at odds but have several "enemy of my enemy" collaborations.
