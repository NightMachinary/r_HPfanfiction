As I explained in the title, I've got some free days coming up, and, having re read the entire series yet again lately, I'm on a harry potter high.

Now I don't have time to go into the huge 400 k plus stories, or even the bigger oneshots (10k plus), despite being sure I'll read that many words eventually. But that's mostly because if I don't have things on a book format, and instead on a scrolling page, my eyes get tired very quickly and I take breaks very often.

So, got a fanfic of yours that explores a concept and want me to review? Something your friend wrote? A what if onesie? If so send it, I'll review it.

I'll try to read and comment regularly, but I also have my own life. Maybe I'll regret this, nevertheless, send them my way. I've got no problems with things unless they're overly long.


** I'd love an outsider's eyes to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8773380/1/Dreamscape][my Draco/Astoria]], the last fic I'll be finishing on my author's page. It's incomplete, but the first chapter is up and oneshot length, if that's all right :)

**** Thanks! I'm really interested in writing an Astoria that is the "mystery" of the pairing rather than Draco who so often plays that role. Draco thinks he has Astoria figured out to a naive optimist but she has a deceptive darkness to that side of her. While he may be closed off, I don't want to play it for appeal; it's becoming an illness.

**** Thanks; glad to hear you laughed.

I think the lack of views/reviews was because of the character tag; if I'd tagged the story with one of the more popular characters, I'd have had more views; I have to rely on new traffic for most of my views.

In any case, thanks for the review.

***** Harry Potter is a complicated spot.

There are so many fanfics being posted you can't really rely too much on the people finding it in the first page after a couple of hours. My story. "Regulus and Snape's Gloom" Got less than a fifth of the views I'm used to, in other fandoms. And using regulus and Severus doesn't really help, while Snape is, in himself, fairly popular, Regulus is anything but.

****** Sort of a response and follow-up to the review; I'm not sure if you were aware, but the story is set just after the PoA Quidditch Cup Final; in the books; Hermione doesn't find out about the House Elves until the GoF. In addition, I'm sure I can recall Hermione mentioning that H: AH doesn't have any information about the use of House Elves in it; a fact that meets with her disapproval.

And yes; the HP fanfic page is so very busy that you have to either start a long, multi-chaptered story and use the fact that people will return, review, favourite and follow the story to get it to snowball in size until it's large enough, or post one-shots often enough that your name pops up often and gets a few people to trickle over to your other stories.

********** The Regulus one? I read it; and it provides an interesting look at Snape; and the showcases the caring nature that Kreacher speaks of Regulus. As Regulus was killed by the Inferi, am I to assume that Snape did not end up killing Regulus, or that you're going for a different scenario where Snape and Regulus did have a fatal confrontation.
