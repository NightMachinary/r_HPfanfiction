Voldemort is really angry that he didn't think that strategy before.


** AU where Voldemort actually really likes kids and teaching and would never even consider hurting Harry. Instead of trying to kill Harry every year he tries convincing Harry to spend less time training to kill him and more time trying to pass his classes.

‚ÄúCome now, Harry. Even if you defeat me how can you expect to go anywhere or do anything if you can't even charm a teapot to sing show tunes? Think about your future!‚Äù

*** "Mr. Potter, I assure you I am being entirely serious. You won't need to train to defeat me. After what your mother did, your victory is inevitable. However, once you /do/ decide to destroy what remains of me you will be free of your mother's spell and vulnerable to the cruel vicissitudes of fate."

"The what-now of fate?

"Vicissitudes, Mr. Potter. It means change. I know I cannot harm you after your mother's sacrifice, but that protection will be gone once I leave. That's why I am here, at Hogwarts. I will remain here, waiting for you, until you are ready to face the outside world."

"So you want me to kill you?"

"Heavens no, lad! But I hardly stand a chance. You are far too well protected by a form of magic that will be forever denied me. I am content to pass on what I have learned to you and your classmates, write a few books and live here in this wonderful castle."

"So what do you want from me if you're sure I'm going to kill you?"

"I want you to /slow down/, Mr. Potter. Do not worry about my defeat, that will come easily to you in time. Please do worry about the time that will come after. I ask that you consider your future career and your own happiness instead of rushing to the end of the path your mother and the headmaster have set you on. You shouldn't have to sacrifice your teenage years for me"

"...I'll think about what you said, Professor."

"Oh and do tell ms. Granger to stay OUT of the restricted section. Her scribbles are going to get her into trouble some day. Soul transmutation arrays as 'Deathless Dialectics' describes them are /not/ an appropriate subject for homework projects."

***** Yeah, figured it was fanon. I wanted to check in case it was a Pottermore explanation or something. I doubt that JKR would ever actually reveal something like that, even with that rumor that was going around about how she told her editor about how Horcruxes are made and he puked from it. Always took that to be an urban legend or a publicity stunt by them.

****** I don't really follow pottemore or her extended canon, so maybe it actually is from her... But it definitely isn't in the main books and I'm pretty sure it's fanon, but I have seen it included in perhaps a half dozen fanfics. I think that bit of fanlore might be associated with the Dark Lord Potter forums and associated authors.

** This is actually a plot point in /Reinforced Magic/ by Lupine Horror, a crossover between /Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha/ and /Harry Potter/. It is eventually revealed that Harry died in childbirth(or was stillborn) and Lily and James used his corpse as a magical trap for Voldemort, giving him rudimentary animation charms to trick Voldemort into thinking it was still a living, breathing baby. I haven't finished reading it though, so beyond the Potters being convinced Harry isn't actually Harry, I don't know how it all resolves.
