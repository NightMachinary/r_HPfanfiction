LF Charlie Weasley centric fics. Preferably slash and complete. Can be Charlie Weasley/OC or with canon characters or no pairing at all.

I'd like to see him in Romania or at least after he has already finished his Hogwarts education. It would also be cool to see a fic which is basically the HP books from Charlie Weasleys pov. But I'm not that picky. Just rec me some good fics if you are able.

Thank you :)


** k m bell has a great Charlie/female OC fic on wattpad called ‚ÄòImagine Dragons'. It is super long and is set mostly in Romania. OC also works with dragons.

**** I'm writing a Charlie heavily featured fic and I'd love to read this. I just downloaded the Wattpad app but it's not great for searching (or I suck, which I would never discount) could you share a link?

***** I'm on my phone, so don't think I can add links. If you go onto search and put in kmbell92, it brings up her works - all are great! I love Imagine Dragons (Charlie Weasley) and Tightly Knit (Fred Weasley), but she has so many great ones)
