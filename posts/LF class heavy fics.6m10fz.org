I recently fell in love with well developed magic fics, especially where authors take it upon themselves to explain the workings of magic. By this i mean that instead of "harry had found the perfect book on 'Beginners Occlumency' and hurried over to start reading. A couple of hours later he had already started organising his mind and had rudimentary defences"

Then i prefer when the author goes indepth about how the book describes occlumency, how harry does it, how he organises and defends, and basically is written in such a way, that if we (the readers) had the ability to perform occlumency, that we would have learned how to do it too.

Basically im looking for fics in classroom style where we the readers learn the same as Harry, so we know what he knows magicwise. (To a certain extent ofcause, ONLY classroom info is going to get boring fast)


** Maybe Pureblood Pretense and its sequels fulfill your request? Linkffn(7613196). There is a very intense discussion about mind arts and potions. It has a Fem Harry, so FYI. I love it, and it is very well written.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** I recommend Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man. There's not too much direct classroom instruction, but the author is absolutely amazing at worldbuilding. They have managed to go more in detail on EVERYTHING while still remaining true to much of canon (in details, not so much plot). A very enjoyable read.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë)

No class time, but the author does delve a lot into how magic works and Harry is forced to engineer various magical solutions to developing problems. Very fun.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
