******** You left in a note from your beta in chapter 2, the bit about Graces chewing on her lip. I've also noticed a number of spelling/grammar/punctuation errors they didn't catch.

********* Thank you so much for pointing this out. I removed the comment, but I am awful at finding those sort of errors. I'll point it out to my beta, but do you have suggestions on how to prevent that from happening. Should I get a second beta? I'm really new to this, but I've seen some stories where it's multiple betas.

*********** Wow, that's incredibly generous of you. It would probably really help me to have two editors. My punctuation is absolutely atrocious, so fair warning there... Do you have a beta profile or something? Or you can just PM me so we can talk in more detail.

** I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I absolutely love this story so far! I am in love with the idea of a sister for Draco and getting to hear their side of things. Such potential for some great story line at this point in the story. I cannot wait to read more!

*** Exactly ! I really want to show their side of the story. How Voldermort used Draco's love for his family etc.
