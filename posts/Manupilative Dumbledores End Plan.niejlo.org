Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was never the beacon of kindness and goodwill he portrayed himself to be. But He wasnt some secret Dark Lord either. What he was, according to him, was a kind brother who was led astray. It was sad that he had to Mold young Tom into evil incarnate or Damn the Potter child into an obscurial, but it was for the greater good. Not his, nor the worlds. But for her Greater Good. He will get his sister back, no matter what it takes.

(tldr, Dumbledore manipulates Harry and Tom to recreate/ressurect Arianna)
