Inspired by this post: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/446e41/why_do_people_always_complain_about_the_small/]]

Since a fair few of us here write fanfic, I thought it might be fun for us to do a little brainstorming about possible jobs in the wizarding world. Who knows, maybe you'll even get some inspiration for a story!

Here's 5 quick ideas I had: 1.) a magical architect/engineer that designs magical buildings and infrastructure 2.) chef/cook 3.) portrait painter 4.) potioneer? I'm imagining someone that works at an apothecary full-time on potions 5.)funeral companies - even wizards kick the bucket at some point

I wonder if there are childcare workers, tutors, designers, architects or farmers? How independent is the magical world from the muggle world?

*** I'd assume there are childcare workers/tutors. Even if it's relatively informal, like the neighbor teaching all of the kids on the block. Personally, if I was magical, I would be wary of putting my kid in a Muggle school due to accidental magic, especially at a very young age.

Similarly, is assume there are designers/architects/engineers working specifically on magical structures, whether hiding them from Muggles to enchanting them to be larger inside than outside.

I think the question of independence is one we really don't talk about enough. Obviously this isn't really the case during the 90s when the books are set, but in today's world, for muggleborns to attend school until 11 or whatever and then just disappear would not fly. There would have to be some level of information sharing. And this is just for muggleborns. What happens if a person raised in the wizarding world has contact, especially bad contact, with muggles? Especially since the prevailing fanon theory is that wizards are completely self-contained, and wouldn't even be known to Muggle governments and services. I think it's really interesting, especially since canon gives the impression that information sharing only happens when there's something on the level of a mass murderer running around.

**** Canon hints that many ministry employees have the job of basically keeping muggles ignorant of magic. Hiding dragons and magical creatures, hiding structures, undoing accidental magic, regulating objects, modifying muggle memories, etc.

But I wonder about things like do wizards hook up to city water and sewer? The Weasleys seem to live way out in the country but we know some wizards live close to muggles, like the blacks in London or potters in godrics hollow. I wonder how integrated they are in the muggle world. Especially since They seem to have a separate culture.

But in a large place like Hogwarts or St. Mungos, I imagine there's probably someone who tells them what to do, and makes sure they do everything the was it's supposed to be done. Filch does this inside. Some people have brought up in previous threads that the house elves would do what Hagrid does, and I say that it's the same. They take care of mowing the grass and keeping the windows clean, but Hagrid is the one who tells them to do it and how he wants it to be done.

*** You can't truly transfigure food. It's an elemental law. I'd assume that you can't merely use a duplication charm on it, as well, if the general consensus seems to be that magic-made food is not the same as normal food nutrition-wise.

Can wizards repair their own clothes and houses? Obviously Harry didn't do seventh year, but there's nothing in canon that process or disproves that the average wizard would be capable of doing those things with a standard education. I'm educated - and the most I can do is sew on a button, put together furniture and do other minor things around my apartment. That's why I think it's possible for there to be something like a magical engineer to s design buildings - because there's nothing that suggests whether or not the average graduate could do something like that without special training.

Post-scarcity? I highly doubt the Weasleys chose to be poor. Not to mention that I'd question any utopian place that has rampant and obvious racism but that might just be me.

Yes, I have proof. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Mending_Charm][This page]] contains a list of instances where Reparo was used in the books. Obviously it has its limitations, but it seems to repair superficial damage most of the time.

**** OK, firstly, you need to be clear about what poverty is. The UN defines poverty as “a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means a lack of lack of a basic capacity to participate effectively in society.”\\
In rich countries, the 'poor' tend not to starve to death but they do go hungry. They might have access to clean water, basic education and health care; but they're often homeless, badly educated and likely to die much younger than their fellow citizens. One marker of poor children is stable access to fresh food and two pairs of shoes that fitted. Some of the wealthiest countries (pdf link)[[[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/rc10_eng.pdf][www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/rc10_eng.pdf]]] in the world did very badly on these markers. America came second from last, only above Romania. So poverty is /hunger/. Poverty is /lack of shelter/. Poverty is /being sick/ and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to /education/ and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not being able to afford recreational expenses. Poverty is living one day at a time.

The Weasley's are basically the poorest people (we see, and implied) in the magical universe, but they still aren't really 'poor' compared to muggle poor. They have no fear where the next meal is coming from (and can afford to feed extra people when they visit), they are all educated to a professional degree, they can afford medical care, they can all get great jobs, Ron and the twins can participate in Quiddict and go to Hogsmeade. Their robes may be patched, but it is never shown that they lack robes at all. Not being able to buy new wands /may/ be considered poverty in a magical community (especially seeing as it is clear wands are super cheap for what they are), but a single poverty marker is not enough to class someone as poor. And they did eventually buy a new one when it was needed.

SO even if the the Weasley's are magical poor, that is not really poverty.

**** Government jobs are a pretty recent invention. The ISS is in the 17th century, and therefore before centralized government as we know it. Yes, the Ministry exists, and appears to deal with breaks in the ISS, but we never see them doing the other governmental things like social services, planning, allocation of money for health, education etc /until it's being run by Voldermort/ with the registration of muggleborns and the control of Hogwarts. We know St Mungo's accepts large donations from people like the Malfoy's, and therefore might not actually receive money from the government to run. Hogwarts has it's own board of governors, which regulates course structure etc, the job normally of the governmental education department.

There is no magical military. During the war, it is up to individuals to protect themselves, and while Aurors are around, they don't seems to actually do much for the wider community, even before the reveal of Voldermort.

Arthur is highly ranked (even if his department isn't) and yet is paid very very little. In the movies, there are a lot of people in the Ministry atrium going to work, but in the books, fewer people appear to work there. So I would argue the current government cost very little to run, and does very little. If there wasn't an ISS, would they be needed at all? I'm not saying that a government isn't needed, just that the Ministry we see the books isn't.

I had forgotten about them. I wonder if they actually enforce it though. The Weasley's do get a fine for the car, but that falls under the whole breaking the ISS.

Governmental jobs yes, but in the UK it was run by the Royal courts, and the feudal system, which is not what we think of as a government. Social services didn't exist then, which is one of the major jobs of government now (redistribution of taxes to those who need them).

** I think they'd basically have the same jobs we have, with the exception of the jobs that appear because of magic. As some people have mentioned, there would be:

*Curse breakers

*Doctors and nurses specialized in Magically-induced injuries

- People who raise, care for, or regulate magical creatures

- People who grow and cultivate magical plants

- People who create wands, brooms, and other magical items (like the Monster Book of Monsters)

- Moving portrait artists

- Tailors for clothing

I think that the challenge would be figuring out how they do the everyday jobs we do with the twist of magic. For example, what would be the "magical" process of building an instrument?

** I think a magicak architect is interesting. Thats what draco is in A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy, but i think the job was imagined a bit wrong there. I'm a architecture student, and lots of the things we have to worry about would certainly not be problems in the wizarding world. Do wizards need to abide by laws of gravity? The burrow seems like it doesn't. They can expand space, that is frequently done with ministry cars etc. If there would be a magical architect, I think they wouldn't in a traditional way draw and calculate what the building can withstand, but more be specialized in certain spells like undetectable space expandment, security wards, muggle repellants and transfigureration of very large objects like walls or whole houses. And keep in mind that the whole british wizard population is only about 3000, so I don't think they would build new buildings, only modify existing ones.
