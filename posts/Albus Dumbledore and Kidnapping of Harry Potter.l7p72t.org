One evening, something Dumbledore had long dreaded occurred. After the end of his 3rd year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter mysteriously disappeared from Privet Drive. No matter where Albus Dumbledore searched, the boy was just not to be found.

Even though the Monitoring Charms he had placed on Harry weren't dispelled yet, he couldn't use them to divine Harry's location. But at the very least, he was assured Harry was alive and facing no danger to his life.

That assurance was wiped off the very next day, when the Charms told him of Harry facing imminent threat of Death.

"Fawkes!" Dumbledore looked at the Phoenix, yet it only shook it's head. Unlike the time Harry battled the Basilisk in the Chamber, Fawkes couldn't swoop over to be the boy's salvation.

Thankfully, the alarming threat of death disappeared the next moment. Dumbledore only shook his head helplessly, praying in his heart that this was a one-time occurrence - that Harry would stay safe and unharmed wherever he was.

His prayer wasn't answered. That day, Harry faced the threat of Death a dozen times. Dumbledore never let his nerves get the better of him - that's what Minerva believed before she entered the Headmaster's Office and found all the mysterious instruments shattered.

Things got even worse. Dumbledore found out that a week later, one of the Monitoring Charms placed on Harry had ended. The Charm was only one of ten he had placed on Harry - normally it would take a year for the charm to dissipate. The fact that it had disappeared by itself meant that Harry had finally met another Wizard who had decided to remove the monitoring measures placed by him!

...Strangely, the other nine Monitoring Charms were unmoved. Dumbledore wondered if the Wizard was researching his spellwork or just couldn't be bothered locating the other nine charms.

--------------

Getting used to something was very simple. Dumbledore felt only some consternation when Harry faced 25 deathly threats that day. No matter how much he researched, the fact didn't change that he couldn't help Harry at all.

The next week when another Monitoring Charm dissipated, Dumbledore realized that things might not be that simple. Harry might have been trapped in a time accelerated environment. But just who would be insane enough to put the Boy Who Lived in a time accelerated environment and subject him to the threat of death multiple times a day?!

Eight more Monitoring Charms left. Eight more weeks left. Albus Dumbledore rankled his brains yet couldn't think of a way to rescue Harry. And then Fudge came in for a meeting, wishing to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament which had been abolished due to too many participant deaths.

Albus Dumbledore jumped on the spot. The Goblet of Fire... the artifact was ancient and magical enough to serve as a conduit for a forceful Apparition!

Of course, the fact that Harry was trapped in time accelerated environs made his rescue tricky enough. Creating and setting up the ritual in eight weeks of time would be hard even for him, but definitely doable. But still...

Harry only had to be chosen as the Hogwarts Champion. As for actually participating in the tournament... well, there were some loopholes that would let him ensure Harry's life would never be in danger.

--------------

Head Unspeakable Croaker gave Dumbledore a unimpressed look. "So it's been two weeks since the Boy Who Lived's disappearance. You've found out that the boy is most certainly being subject to deadly threats multiple times a day and most likely being imprisoned in a time accelerated area... And you didn't think to ask for help sooner?"

Dumbledore considered replying with his suspicions that the Unspeakables were the very architects of Harry's torment. Instead he sealed his lips and lowered his head.

"At the very least, you came to your senses early. The Unspeakables will provide you full support in the rescue of the Boy Who Lived." Dumbledore beamed in response.

Saul Croaker couldn't help but feel some pride knowing that the Greatest Wizard of Britain was asking him for help.

--------------

With the Unspeakables keeping the secrecy, no one knew of the sudden disappearance of Harry Potter.

Every day, Harry suffered through multiple deadly threats. Every week, another Monitoring Charm dissipated. However knowing that he was making headway towards actually saving Harry gave Dumbledore determination.

The amount of deadly threats Harry experienced per week began lessening. It reached the point where he didn't even experience the threat of death for a entire week. Dumbledore couldn't help but feel cheerful.

Six weeks passed by and Harry suffered from only 3 deadly threats in the meantime. The Goblet of Fire had been brought to Hogwarts. Alastor Moody had been selected as the DADA Professor. The students of Durmstrang and Beauxbaton came to Hogwarts. The Opening Feast occurred. Other things happened - Albus Dumbledore was busy and didn't really keep track.

Of course, Harry's disappearance became known. Dumbledore only replied with a twinkle of his eyes when his two friends asked him about his location. Suddenly rumors spread out - Harry was being trained by Dumbledore to participate in the Tournament, Harry was out on another adventure, Harry was using a Time Turner... Pitifully, no rumors about Harry being subject to continuous deadly attacks in a time accelerated area came up.

The final week had come. The Goblet of Fire was laid down and the students of Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons were allowed the chance to enter their names. Dumbledore strictly monitored the Goblet. When Moody attempted to Confund it, the man found himself stunned and bound immediately. After finding out that his hired teacher was a Polyjuiced Death Eater, the old man sighed. Yet another friend of his had been trapped in a forbidden ground, but he was blind as always...

Finally, Dumbledore looked at the Goblet. The Champions of Durmstrang and Beauxbaton were already selected. However, Hogwarts didn't have its Champion selected yet.

With a wave of his Elder Wand, the pieces of parchment carrying the names of the various hopeful participants of Hogwarts were summoned out. With another wave, the papers were burnt to ash. Dumbledore took out a vial filled with Harry's blood and dipped the wand into it. Then he conjured a parchment with 'Harry James Potter' written on it in shining bloody ink and banished it into the Goblet.

--------------

The next day, it was time for the Naming of Champions.

Dumbledore looked at the audience of students and teachers with triumph in his eyes. The flames within Goblet of Fire turned scarlet, darker. And a charred piece of parchment shot out, expertly caught with a flick of Dumbledore's long, slender fingers.

"The champion for Durmstrang will be Viktor Krum." Applause rang out.

The Goblet spat out another parchment.

"The champion for Beauxbaton is Fleur Delacour." Louder applause.

And now, the moment of destiny had come. The Goblet spat out the final parchment.

"And the champion of Hogwarts is Harry Potter!" The triumphant cheer in Dumbledore's voice was palpable.

There were some whispers from the Granger girl and Weasley boy. Rumors about Dumbledore training Harry for the Tournament were well spread already. And thus, there were even more cheers for the final champion.

As if in response to the cheers of the crowd, a stone gateway seemed to magically appear before the Goblet. It opened, revealing a snowy landscape. Within it, there was only a single man.

Dumbledore expected a scared 23 year old scraggly child, aged up by temporal acceleration and traumatized by daily threats to his life. The man was far from the imagined picture.

The scar on his forehead had faded away. Sharp green eyes, completely unlike his mother's. Lips that felt like they hadn't smiled for ages. The boy was now a man.

Wearing leather armor and a cloak on his back, Harry wore a sword on his hip. Upon his belt laid 12 wands - Dumbledore could see that 11 were sharp knives merely transfigured to look like wands. He had a backpack that was presumably filled with supplies - Dumbledore could smell the telltale scent of freshly harvested Bezoars.

Harry seemed surprised to look at Dumbledore, but he immediately ran through the gateway and entered the premises of Hogwarts. The gateway behind him shimmered.

Harry looked back upon the gateway with mixed emotions. "Headmaster, I won't be able to go back, right?"

Dumbledore didn't know how to respond - he had been unwillingly kidnapped and still wished to return? "No, that won't be a simple affair. But if you truly desire to return-"

"...It's not my world after all." Harry interrupted him. His words were filled with grief yet sounded strangely content.

The mix of emotions was curious enough. Dumbledore looked into Harry's piercing green eyes and sent a light legilimency probe. He only wanted to know of his surface thoughts - if Harry was truly interred in a time-accelerated location and forced to go through life and death situations, he would have no desire to go back.

Instead, Dumbledore found his mind assaulted with memories.

Awakening in another world with only wand in hand. Learning how to forage for food in the wilderness. Realizing that this was another world. Joining a wealthy family as a servant, hiding his identity of a wizard. Decadence of the rich, rife with poisoning and betrayal. /Training. Battle. Love. Betrayal./ *Voldemort*.

This wasn't Legilimency. It was more like... the experience of synchronizing with one's spiritual animal while becoming a Animagus?

Dumbledore's head felt like it was splitting from the weight of the memories. Just when he was on the verge of unconsciousness, Harry spoke. "Headmaster, won't you return the favor?"

Dumbledore understood what he meant. Taking out a Pepperup Potion, he immediately drank it down. The next moment, he gathered together the memories of what had happened after Harry's disappearance and sent them to the returned man.

"I am not quite skilled at Memory Magic as you, Mr. Potter. So I'll properly tell you about what happened after your disappearance sometime later. Now, the matter of the Triwizard Tournament is of foremost importance. Congratulations on being selected as the Champion of Hogwarts!" Dumbledore said with a smile.

"Nepotism, huh? I like it. Thank you very much, Headmaster." The man replied with a twinkle of his green eyes, like a smile that didn't quite reach the lips.

Just then, Dumbledore realized that he had actually sent Harry the memory of what lead to him being selected as the Hogwarts Champion. Drats.

+++

3rd year Harry went to the Game of Thrones world with his wand and corresponding knowledge. He survived for a decade. He survived poisonings, betrayal, wars, White Walkers, cultist mages controlling them and Voldemort who got reincarnated by one of the cultist mages.

He hates the damn world and is very happy to return home.

*EDIT:*

Unfortunately, I don't think any of the prominent girls would take part in the 'seduce Harry and betray him' plotline.

Cersei the usual suspect is too much of a Petunia ripoff, seducing Harry is impossible for her. Myrcella... meh.

Stark Family: Arya and Sansa don't have a seductive bone in their bodies and even less willingness to betray a loyal one.

Dany: Not much of a betrayer either. Her setting seems the most conducive for the betrayal plotline but she doesn't seem the kind of woman to take initiative in seduction.

*** This prompt was inspired by [[/u/inquisitorcoc]] 's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dp71eu/a_harry_potter_character_is_displaced_into_a/f5t3tf2/][comment reply]] to [[/u/muleGwent][u/muleGwent]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dp71eu/a_harry_potter_character_is_displaced_into_a/][original prompt]].

If I were to write this, I wouldn't put much focus on the GoT part, since it is more or less a tragedy and focused on making Harry hate everything in the world.

Harry isn't dark/ independent, he is actually a 3rd year and has 3rd year level ability - so he is appropriately cautious and takes care not to reveal his powers as a Wizard. He hides his identity as a wizard the best he can, learns swordsmanship, always keeps fresh Bezoars at hand and transfigures a dozen knives to look like wands because his power is based on a easily breakable wooden stick.

Unfortunately his ability to lay low is not enough - his secrets are arousing to quite a few people, plus he is just 13 year old and very vulnerable to sexual wiles. That's the first tragedy.

There are other points I'd insert in to make Harry's experience in the GoT world more horrible -

1) He gets a Dragon egg and learns mental magic from it. He hatches it successfully but it dies later,

2) He learns swordsmanship but his mentor dies,

3) Another mentor taught him politics, diplomacy and such things but was secretly trying to poison him and Harry has to kill him,

4) He falls in love with a girl and she truly loves him and dies protecting him...

...You get the point right?

***** Harry doesn't start paranoid but is simply cautious: the setting seems like Middle Ages and Witch Burning might be in the vogue so might as well hide being a Wizard. Due to Dursley upbringing he understands how people might have facades as well.

Harry's true fatal flaw is loyalty. The novel shows his loyalty to Dumbledore - enough that he was willing to commit suicide via Voldemort for his plans to succeed. But Dumbledore was merely his Headmaster who was very kind to him.

Imagine a woman who is actively trying her best to seduce Harry when puberty has struck him. Imagine they having sex and the woman saying that she loves Harry. Harry would definitely be willing to sacrifice everything to help her.

You'll need a overblown, epic betrayal for Harry to get it in his head that the woman is evil.

That said, I don't think GOT has a stupid woman who would be willing to betray Harry after finding out his true ability. That's why I didn't even think about who this woman would be.

*** If I carried this further, it would have Harry join either the Starks, Baratheons or Dany. While he is hiding his magic, he can't hide how exceptional he is - and one of the beauties decides to seduce Harry. Harry's fatal flaw is loyalty and he is willing to wholeheartedly serve the seductress - until she ruthlessly betrays Harry.

The problem is that betrayal doesn't tally with any of the girl's characters.

*Stark Family:*

Catelyn would never cheat on Ned.

Arya and Sansa betraying doesn't make sense.

*Baratheons:*

Cersei shares too much with Petunia, Harry would always be wary of her.

Myrcella... I don't know much about her character but no real reason to betray Harry.

*Dany:*

Dany isn't a betrayer either, honestly. She might just go insane and try to burn Harry with Dragon Magic but Harry would forgive her coz accidental magic.

***** Harry finding True Love™ upon appearing in Westeros and leading her to tragedy seems a mite cliche, though.

Harry being seduced by a babe, thinking he has found True Love™ and the true start of tragedy being her betrayal seems more Game of Thrones flavor. Harry at least learns something from that.

I was originally thinking of a Dany betrayal since I can have Harry get a Dragon, learn Dragon Magic and have it die protecting Harry as well. But why would Dany take initiative seducing Harry and why the betrayal after his loyalty is confirmed? I could have Drogon convincing her that Harry's death is necessary for her rise, but it just seems wonky.

****** That's absolutely true, but then the problem of breaking Harry in a credible way remains; the Tyrrells wouldn't think twice about having Margaery court him just for the future power it would grant their heirs, same with the Lannisters, Martells, Greyjoy, Frey etc.

To put it crudely: why risk losing a prized stallion when you can breed him with one of your mares and end up with a higher number of superior steeds? If anything there'd be a queue for the "honor" of marrying him and everyone would either want to get on his good side or kill him off as soon as possible because his magic would drastically upset the power balance between the Seven Reigns.

Then, there's the fact that his eventual children would be equally sought-after/ in danger for the same reasons.
