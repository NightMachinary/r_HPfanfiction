:END:
Title pretty much is it. I'm not sure if I read this in Tumblr or Wattpad. The fic is about the twin? sister (reader?) of Sirius Black who's so perfect. She's the model Black who's in Slytherin and is all prim and proper and Sirius hates her so much. He's jealous and just disgusted with how she is. One time, sister walked up to James? or Remus and talked to them to ask how Sirius was doing (because in actuality she's a good person), which left James/Remus really surprised. Later on, Sirius finds out that his sister got the dark mark (I think?) and that sister sacrificed herself so that Sirius and Regulus didn't have to do death eater things.
