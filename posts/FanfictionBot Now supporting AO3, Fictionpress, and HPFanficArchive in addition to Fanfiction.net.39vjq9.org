*** Adult-Fanfiction is a completely different story than other fanfiction portals. For one, you actually have to pass a simple age check. While normally, it wouldn't be a problem for a human to pass, it's damn effective when it comes to exploiting the lazyness of programmers.

** Would it be possible to add away to limit the search to one fandom? There's less of a chance of getting the wrong fic that way, especially for more obscure fandoms.

*** Sites will come, but it takes time, since I'm basically learning Python again on the fly while developing this. On top of that, I have a lot of IRL things going on.

I'll add it, but just a question - are there any subreddits that might benefit from the addition of FimFiction? If so, I'll also have to add them to the defaults list in the program.

**** Well, most of the pony subs, like [[/r/mylittlepony]] and [[/r/MLPlounge]], would find it useful in general. [[/r/mylittlefanfic]] as well, though I can't remember how active it is.
