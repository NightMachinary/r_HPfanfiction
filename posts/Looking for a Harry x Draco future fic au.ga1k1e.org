:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey everyone! I very vividly remember reading a fic where Harry is married to Ginny w/ kids but they're marriage is falling apart and he's the Head Auror and he laments to an old man in a bar about how he wished his life was different and when he woke up he was in a different universe where he had saved Draco during their school years and was now dating/married to him, he made art/furniture and had a pet snake! I remember this all so vividly and yet no matter how I word it I can't find this fic so if you recognize it please help me out!!


** It's Turn by Saras_Girl. My favorite.

  One good turn always deserves another. Apparently.
