I recently got back into fanfic after a 5 year hiatus. I remember liking SS/HG but now school age Hermione bothers me. I don't mind flashbacks or the story starting when she is like 17 but any romance should be when she is an adult. Older the better really. Smut is fine but there needs to be plot with it.

Thank you


** I'm a couple days late, but better late than never, right? I totally understand what you're talking about--HG/SS is my OTP and has been since I started out in fanfiction more than ten years ago. When I was younger school-age fics didn't bother me, but now that I'm almost 30 it's...a lot more icky. So I went through my favorite stories and picked out the ones that are post-Hogwarts only:

linkffn(For All Intents and Purposes by RhiannonoftheMoon) It's four years after Voldemort fell. Hermione goes back in time to one year after LV fell the first time, so everyone's out of school (well, Snape is teaching in the school, but nobody's a student).

linkffn(Facilitating Change by Aurette) I like everything by Aurette. This one's not really a fluffy happy-ever-after story, but it's good (and it doesn't have a depressing ending).

linkffn(Advanced Contemporary Potion Making by Lariope) I was surprised I liked this one--I don't usually like stories where Hermione's already married and she abandons that relationship for Snape. But the emotions are realistic and the ending is perfect.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Crystal of Time by Aurette) I don't actually remember what this one's about (and the summary isn't very helpful), but I have it marked four stars in my records. And it's by Aurette, and I haven't yet read one of her stories and not like it.

linkffn(The Marriage Benefit by miamadwyn) (actually I think I got this one from Ashwinder) The summary on this one is crap, but basically the premise is that Hermione and Severus have made a secretly celibate marriage of convenience to increase their pay rates as Hogwarts professors. They are forced to publicly behave as a married couple to foil attempts to prove their marriage is a sham. Short, but amusing.

linkffn(Phoenix Feathers by Camillo) This one's quite funny. It's a bit of a parody instead of a serious story, but it doesn't go so far as to venture into crack-territory. I enjoyed it.

linkffn(Transcendent Quality of Remembrance by Subversa) This one's a bit more angsty than my usual fare (I don't usually like post-war-Dark-wins stories), but I marked it four stars so I must have liked it.

linkffn(Yea, Though I Walk by Aurette) Yes, yet another Aurette story (are you sensing a theme yet?). Hermione's a healer, and Snape's in the hospital. Something (disease-like, not hunter-like) is killing people with the Dark Mark in gruesome ways, and Hermione has to figure out what and how to stop it before it happens to Snape.

linkffn(The Traveller by Somigliana) Hermione is a time traveler and starts the story at age 31. I don't remember this one much, but I rated it five stars so I liked it a lot.

linkffn(The Fine Art of Fine Print by Mundungus42) Hermione is a researcher in the Department of Mysteries. Funding complications result in her testing her new invention at Hogwarts for a year, and while she's there she decides to take out the tyranical Headmistress. The summary sounds a bit silly (and it is, to be honest), but this story is a fun read.

linkffn(The Occluded Soul by Aurette) Yes, Aurette again. Snape suffers a psychotic break after killing Dumbledore. Five years later, the war's still not over, and Snape is missing, presumed dead, until Harry discovers that he's been living at a Muggle hospital for the last three years.

linkffn(Of Muggles and Magic by Aurette) Ok, this is the last Aurette recomendation, promise! It's a Regency-era setting and I don't know if you're into that, but it's fantastic.

linkffn(Unfinished Business by Ramos) I'm not sure if this one counts as a school-era fic or not, but it's one of my favorites so I'll recommend it anyway. Hermione dies in a potions accident, and ends up haunting the Potions classroom as a ghost. The story is from her perspective as Snape continues teaching, eventually becoming headmaster. Nothing remotely romantic happens for years, so it's not really Snape getting romantic with a student, but technically she is frozen in age.

linkffn(Just to Be by Amarti) I love this story--it's excellent. I don't know if you like stories where much of the plot involves kids (I don't typically), but they're not technically Hermione and/or Snape's kids, so I guess that makes it better? I don't know. But I loved this story.
