I'm re-watching the Harry Potter movies and a scene jumps out to me: Harry had just woken up in the Hospital wing in the 1st of his many adventures there. He and Dumbledore were speaking of the events with Voldemort.... Dumbledore stops the conversation and stands up RIGHT before Madam Pomfrey (I assume) entered the room. Did Dumbledore KNOW she was coming?!?!?ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”


** He heard her, maybe. Or he can see through walls. Or he sensed her magic, if you want to go a little crazy.

*** Or the portrait on the opposite wall gave a nod to him. Or he smelled her.

Or he set some sort of alarm charm. Loads of ways to know.

****** Neither does the idea that he sensed magic, or can see through walls. This was ideas on how it COULD, not how it DID happen. Not to mention its fan fiction so we are not exactly restricted to canon. Not sure why people get so hung up on canon in a freaking fan fiction subreddit.

******* It does give us the "he can sense magic" in the cave scene. He says this place has known magic.

** Dumbledore is clearly precognitive - he knows too much too often. Why else was the P.S moved a day before any attempt on it was made? Why else did Dumbledore leave *3* brooms in the room with the flying keys? Why else was the final (and only) challenge to work (The Mirror of Erised) left uninstalled until /after/ Dumbledore was sure Harry knew how it worked?

Because he wanted Harry to go after the Stone. Harry even considers this in the book. Reading the book when I was younger, I didn't think on it too much. But now, I've realized how obvious and fucked up it was.

Fluffy --- Harry, who has shown no interest in music, uses a flute given to him by Hagrid, who's intensely loyal to Dumbledore.

Devil's Snare --- Hermione knew this, but what if Dumbledore had been there the first time they came across Fluffy? He himself said he didn't need a cloak to be invisible, /and/ he was there the second (or perhaps even the first) time Harry visited the Mirror of Erised, invisible. What if he saw Neville there and assumed he'd be their friend? Neville was good at Herbology, and would have easily figured out the Devil's Snare.

The brooms --- Harry was the youngest seeker in a century.

The troll --- they knocked one out already.

The chessboard --- Ron was great at chess.

The potions --- why leave a riddle, a chance for the person to get through it, in the first place?

The defenses, quite frankly, sucked. The only real reason for this is because Dumbledore wanted Harry to face Voldemort.
