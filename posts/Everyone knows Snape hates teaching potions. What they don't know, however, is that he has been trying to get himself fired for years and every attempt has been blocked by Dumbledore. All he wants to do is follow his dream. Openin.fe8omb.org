** Now I want to see a fic where Harry does the whole “So Potions is like cooking” routine, and instead of the “No, you fool, no muggle thing could ever compare to the art of potions” that sometimes happens, Snape exclaims “Finally! One of you dunderheads makes sense!”

*** I have a head canon where Snape worked as a cook in the summer during his teenage years.

If you have ever worked back of house in the kitchen industry you would know it is riddled with socially mal-adjusted people with anger issues, mental health issues, and substance abuse issues. "Not sure whether I am a cook or a pyromaniac with a knife fetish" is a good description for many slaving away to the beat of the ticket printer.

I've seen some fics where Snape's nickname among the death eaters is "knife" due to his skill with a potions knife. It is something that would translate well into kitchen work when you are 15 and not allowed to do magic yet. I think he would feel right at home in that atmosphere.

** "To clarify," Severus solemnly intoned, "I am being... dismissed... from all duties... of an Academic and Supervising nature?"

"You are," said the current spokesman for the fully assembled Board of Governors, his eyes glinting with a victorious and anticipatory gleam. "We have a new professor already lined up to fill both your former positions. We are generously granting you a full week to pack your things and mov-"

"I see," Severus interrupted, almost absentmindedly. "You are firing me." His words were so soft they sounded nigh on wistful. All tension and acerbic severity seemed to melt from his face and stance.

They broke him, Minerva thought. He was in shock; that was the only explanation, she thought. Maybe they should have found him another job in the castle rather than leaving him out to dry like this. Perhaps working adjacent to the infirmiry wouldn't be quite so traumatizing for anyone-

.And then.

.Oh And Then.

Severus Snape /smiled./

He snapped his fingers.

At his feet appeared a long black muggle coat, folded neatly and laying atop a black muggle suitcase, and atop the coat itself was perched a black muggle hat. Minerva watched, uncomprehending, as her former student, coworker, and decade-and-a-half-old terror to all magical minors swiftly capped himself, donned the coat in a single sweeping motion, hefted his featherweight case, and bid the room's occupants a genuinely pleasant "Adieu". From the Headmistress' office he departed; practically skipping, and humming a jaunty tune.

Students in the halls stared in shock and horror at the sight of what they could only assume to be either an imposter or their (not-so-) dear Imperiussed professor as he made his way to the exit. Even Argus Filch seemed astounded - the irrascible old man cut himself off from a heated scolding in order to gape and stare at his fellow terrorizer-in-arms suddenly not terrorizing people! At the very least, Snape's terrorizing was not being conducted in his usual manner. He occasionally paused and delayed his trek to shake hands with promising upper-year potioneers. He shot some unsolicited parting tips to students who were struggling in his (Former!) class. He pat a few darling firsties on their heads and crooned at their endearing-ness. All the while he was broadly grinning a grin which might definitely have given that old fraud Gilderoy Lockheart a run for his Most Charming Smile award.

It was official. The Halfblood Prince had gone barmy. It was uncontestable how unnerving this newfound geniality was for everyone. Students and faculty alike only turned away from this impossible sight to check each other for Confundus charms.

Totally beknownst unto Severus, a thoroughly befuddled audience trailed him to the front doors and watched from the steps as one Sourpuss Severus Snivellus Snape made his way to and through the school gate. On his way out he raised his unburdened arm and waved without a backward glance. Giddy as a schoolboy off on his first Hogsmead field trip, he was. Off to explore new horizons and do with the rest of his life completely as he wished.

Bakery-Apothecary? That was just Item Number One on his list of things to do!

** I mean if you think about it he never was hired for his love of teaching especially not for his talents at dealing with 13 year old Hufflepuffs, and hiring him as a potions teacher was just an excuse to hire and keep him. Dumbledore knew voldermort was coming back and he wanted to make sure there will be a spy under his fingers. Funny enough, voldermort sucked that story, that Snape wanted to work as a potion teacher for Dumbledore to spy on the headmaster later on, right up. However, there is something we are forgetting here, which is the fact that Snape wanted the defense position. In the book, I felt everyone believed he wanted it because he liked the dark arts, which is true, but I feel the true reason behind it is that he wanted to get fired after one year. This position was his ticket out and he wanted it so bad. What's sad is that when he got it finally, the year after that he became headmaster which is sad but somehow hilariously ironic at the same time.

** The store didn't end with a bang but a whimper. Specifically the whimper of a small dog as the life fizzled out of its eyes. The dog wasn't Snape's, of course. He didn't have pets and he didn't particularly like dogs, small or otherwise. Still, it was sad. Now the war had stopped, and the new headmaster was perfectly happy to let him go do his thing, and it ended because of /one/ stupid dog and it's scatterbrained owner. Now what. He could hardly use the damn thing for ingredients, could he? He had notified its owner (and had to parrel quite a few nasty hexes from the older lady) and she had, of course, sued him. Result: he was back to teaching bloody dunderheads. At Hogwarts. Again.
