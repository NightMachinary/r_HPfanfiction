Please, please, please let it be completed.


** I absolutely love Lily Evans' wake up call, linkffn(8182370), it's a one shot and completed. Others include linkffn(6953664; 12214441; 12305807; 12367630) I have not read these and are possibly not completed. But they do look good and fits your request a bit.

*** Just finished reading The dark side of the moon. Starts off pretty interesting but quickly becomes a canon rehash with paragraphs legitimately copied word for word from book 5 with only names changed. I'd probably stay away from this one.
