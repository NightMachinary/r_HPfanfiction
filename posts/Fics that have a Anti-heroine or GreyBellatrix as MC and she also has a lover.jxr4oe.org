basically what the title says. It doesnt matter who the lover is. It can be a Man or a Woman.


** Useful Oxymoron like using Bellatrix as a MC, usually to be paired with Hermione.

  Ugetsu and Akihiko's love story told over five years in five movements. The spark, the rise, the height, the fall, and the catalyst. People say that Murata Ugetsu is cold and untouchable. This is his truth that only one brilliant man and one gifted boy will understand.
