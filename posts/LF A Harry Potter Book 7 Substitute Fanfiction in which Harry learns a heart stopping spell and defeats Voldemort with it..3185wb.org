I have been looking for this fanfiction for ages! It features harry using a killing spell to stop Voldemort's heart, and Lucius Malfoy assisting Harry in the final battle. Furthermore, though this may be from another fanfiction, I remember Harry talking to Sirius instead of Dumbledore at King's Cross. Any help is appreciated, thanks!


** Please tell me the "spell" is the five point palm exploding heart technique. Because that would be ridiculously amazing.

** I vaguely remember something like that curse in this fic: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]]

But I don't think it had the discussion with sirius or malfoy. Then again it's been years. I may decide to reread it.
