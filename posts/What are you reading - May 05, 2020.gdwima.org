** I am reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23982997/chapters/57688111][The Scholar]] It's rating is mature. I find it interesting as I have read the other two fics in the series.

The author may reveal things early that are going to happen but it seems like they have a lot of ideas for the series.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12951919/1/Crime-and-Punishment][Crime and Punishment]] (t rating, fwiw), has just about blown me away: it's a fic where Harry get arrested by the muggle authorities after Dudley frames him for a robbery, forcing Snape to take custody of him for the rest of the summer.

It sticks out, though, because it's actually /well-written./

Usually, in these sorts of stories, Harry is a perfect little victim for maximum sadness points, and Snape is a boring, unemotive non-character who, once he realises that Harry's been abused by the Dursleys, completely gets over any and all hangups he has to become the perfect guardian/surrogate father. Not so here. They both genuinely feel like real people forced to deal with this situation, and it's just heckin' /great./

*** I don't know about this. It's certainly on the better end of stories in this genre, but I would hesitate to call it good. Like first I have to suspend disbelief that Dumbledore would assign Snape of all people to take care of the situation at hand, and then I'm supposed to believe that pretty much every adult Harry's ever trusted sees fit to accuse him of robbing an old woman like that's even remotely plausible, and then don't even apologise properly until he confronts them? There's a lot of passing the idiot ball around, I assume to make Snape seem more sympathetic.

Then there's the whole veritaserum bit. How am I meant to believe that a healthy guardian sort of relationship could be built upon such a massive violation? Forced confessions of abuse is a common theme in this sort of fic. Such conversations should be built on trust and mutual comfort, IMO, and Snape abuses Harry's limited trust for him by asking questions that weren't cleared while he's in no condition to refuse.

I also don't like the characterisation of Harry as believing the bullshit the Dursley's say about him, or that he deserves to be punished. Just kind of dumb imo.

In conclusion, it could be worse. I think if you're a massive Snape-fan, you can probably look past the flaws. But that I am decidedly not.

** Title: Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals

Rating: PG-13

Pairing: OC/SI

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12738075/1/Why-Time-Travel-Should-Be-Illegal-and-Other-Morals][12738075)]]

​

A well-meaning American with vague knowledge of the books is transported to 1970s and finds Harry.

The fic itself is fairly entertaining so far and very comforting at this time. Definitely would classify it as fluff.

The main problem is that it is unbearably naive and super cringe when it comes to romance (I scroll through that shit). It is also a bit heavy on religion, which is interesting to me as an atheist. I like reading how believers think. But it is also annoyingly preachy. Let's just say that the author isn't subtle in the lessons he's trying to teach.

Please, recommend me some better SIs or do-overs.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** So Close to Magic, M, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13332938/1/So-Close-to-Magic]]

An OC story about a Seer named Winona who is in Fred and George's class at Hogwarts. I didn't know if I'd think much of it but I've just been enthralled. Definitely some angsty parts that I could do without but teenagers are angsty, and the author can't just rehash canon events all the time, so going through a story that roughly (so far) follows canon and how a Seer may have affected things is really fun. I'm looking forward to/dreading how the future unfolds for Winona.

It has 101 chapters, and it's following the life of Rodrick Grindelwald, going to hogwarts in harry's year, using the knowledge that his grandfather gives him during his dreams . But still having to keep his heritage a secret. It's very good, not everybody's cup of tea though.

There's also a spinoff to this, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12558366/1/A-Grindelwald-s-Tale-Dark-Lord-Era][A Grindelwald's Tale: Dark Lord Era]] Rodrick gets to start his life again, and of course does things very differently. and ignores his grandfathers advice of staying under wraps. This one has been discontinued, as it hasn't been updated for a year, The original is finished i think? although it doesn't end at the end of the war.

It's very good, i recommend it. I've revisited it a bunch!

It's crackish and absolutely hilarious. Basically, drunk Hermione mixes Pringles with the sand from time turners to create a new WWW product and prove everyone that she has a sense of humor too. Each crisp is like a dare you can't refuse and it's active until you either eat a new one or the last crisp is eaten and the lid is closed. The can has also the ability to travel through time and space to whoever you dare next. It has all sort of tropes -- time travel, lordship, dimension travel, Gringotts tests but they're not taken seriously. The crisps also manage to return some dead characters (Potters, Remus, Snape, Regulus and some more) back to the land of living.

** The Futile Facade just updated!!!

Title: The Futile Facade

Rating: T

Link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11911497/1/]]

Thoughts: Violet (murkybluematter) is now on the fourth book of her rewrite of the HP series crossed over with The Song of the Lioness. In a world where Tom Riddle became a successful politician instead of a crazy terrorist, the separation between Purebloods and Half-bloods/Muggleborns has become profound. Only Purebloods are allowed to attend Hogwarts, and racism is only thinly veiled by civility in British Magical Society. Harry Potter, a half-blood girl intent on being the best Potions Mistress the world has ever seen, switches identities with her cousin, Sirius' son Arcturus Rigel Black. In order to fulfill her dreams, she attends Hogwarts and earns an apprenticeship with Potions Master Snape under his name. Things get complicated from there! Now in her fourth year, Harry is stuck competing in a revamped and much scarier Triwizard Tournament, has attracted the notice of Riddle who wants her to become the new face of Blood Purity, and most importantly, is STILL pretending to be Rigel Black. These books are exceptional, some of the best HP fic being written right now! The detail Violet goes into when building her world is amazing and her fics have evolved a life of their own with various spin offs and fan art created in her honor. Please take your time in quarantine to read her stories and tell her how amazing she is!

It has 101 chapters, and it's following the life of Rodrick Grindelwald, going to hogwarts in harry's year, using the knowledge that his grandfather gives him during his dreams . But still having to keep his heritage a secret. It's very good, not everybody's cup of tea though.

There's also a spinoff to this, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12558366/1/A-Grindelwald-s-Tale-Dark-Lord-Era][A Grindelwald's Tale: Dark Lord Era]] Rodrick gets to start his life again, and of course does things very differently. and ignores his grandfathers advice of staying under wraps. This one has been discontinued, as it hasn't been updated for a year, The original is finished i think? although it doesn't end at the end of the war.

It's very good, i recommend it. I've revisited it a bunch!

It was Heart and Soul that made me like the pairing. I couldn't 100% say what it was though. Maybe that they're potentially in the unique position of understanding each other's situations without having it be the exact same.

Obviously I like expanding on the Veela side of things. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but that has been some of the most fun I've had. So much potential.

If I had to pick one thing though, I'd probably say it's her passion. I always viewed her as a passionate person overall, and I felt like that would be what could really get through to him in the story I wanted to tell.

Before I was mainly a Harmony shipper, but now I just can't find it in myself to enjoy it as much since I've become addicted to Fleur and Harry. Honestly I love fics that expand upon the Veela side. Adds so much more to any story and JKRawlings never really went into it all that much. The International TriWizard Tournament also goes into it quite a bit and I find the Fleur in that fic interesting as hell. I concur with all of the reasonings you stated. Plus while Harry may be younger then her he's very mature for his age so it's not like he can't keep up with her due to his experiences.

Fleur is passion incarnate. I like characters who throw up a wall between them and other people, but once you get beyond that wall there is no one more caring or loyal. And Fleur is just that. Plus their little snogging session seemed to leave a pretty good memory in Harry's mind “smirks”. Also why do I get the feeling that the spell Fleur's mom made her practice that lead to her embarrassment had something to do with contraception..

Well you can count on me to stick with you to the end! Have any other plans for more of this pairing or other HP fanfics?

Idk. Its been fun trying to show that Gabrielle amd Fleur share this sorta...tired disdain for their mother's overbearing personality, but that they also still really love her and appreciate the sentiment behind it.

I dont think I'll do much more with the pairing. I'm not so sure I'd be able to do one that's enough different from these versions of the characters. I might do some one-shots peeking into their life after the story is over.

I do already have another fic sorta in the works. The plan for it is coming together, but I'm not gonna start till I'm done with this one. That'll be a Harry/Daphne cause I'm basic af.

Don't feel pressured to read on if you find the story to be boring, tiresome, annoying, disgusting, frustrating or anything of the sort.

Not only is it jam packed with unique ideas, the author's got a great grasp on his characters and as a result the characters each are unique and something you've never seen before (And so so interesting)

It's one of those rare ron centric stories, with no bashing or mary sues. It is one of the most well written stories I've read in my lifetime, not just in fanfiction.

Rating:M, mainly for violence

Link: linkffn(the odds were never in my favor)

Basically, Alexandra Potter, genderbent Harry isn't the BWL. That's Neville. She's sent to the Dursley's b/c James is essentially the Sirius equivalent and Lily was lynched. There's a shadowy organization controlling basically everything, and Alex is thrown into this.

This is essentially all the tropes turned to 11 and then to 12, as someone in a Discord I'm in described it. Bashing all over the place, 11 year old politicians, Mary Sue MC. The author uses this to make a pretty good story, and all of Alex's opponents are better than her. There's a great power curve, so even as a Mary Sue, she's not stupidly overpowered. It's really good for the amount of cliches it has, and I do recommend it

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** Title: The Secret Language of Plants (Series) Rating: Mature/Explicit Link: linkao3(9323225)

One of my favourite ever fanfics. This is about my fifth re-read of it. I recommended it to someone and then started re-reading it myself. It's extremely well-written and plotted. The characters are nuanced and very loveable. It's an alternative reality: Harry is adopted by Snape and Remus and grows up into a very different character. It has quite a lot of interesting and different magic because a lot of the magic from fairy tales and legends is incorporated ( people being turned into trees for example, and combs being transfigured into thickets and brambles). The link is to the first book in the series.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** I've been Reading the Harry Black Series by AuthorK

Honestly I'm on book 2 and while the author was new to FF in book 1 and there were some small mistakes, the book was still great and Book 2 is even better.

Rather than diverting so far from the cannon it follows it pretty well, with Harry gaining a different group of friends and handling situations in ways I haven't seen before.

Not super political, the author himself has said he's not too great at that, but the romance (Harry x Daphne) is one of the best I read and his character dynamics are all pretty awesome.

If anyone is interested check out book 1 here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13319565/1/Harry-Black-Book-1-The-Hero-s-Return]]
