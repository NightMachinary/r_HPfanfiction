** There are so many fun things on that table, turning into a potted plant, fireball centered on the caster, but my personal favorite is the one that summons a unicorn. Unicorns in D&D 5e are fairly badass actually. My friend summoned a unicorn twice in the same campaign with wild magic (we named her Rose) and she just demolished an encounter that was supposed to be much harder. I'm now picturing a fic where in the battle of Hogwarts something similar happens. It turns out the "power the Dark Lord knows not" was actually summoning an ass kicking unicorn all along.
