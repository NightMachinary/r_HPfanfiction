I have read countless fanfictions mentioning the Potter curse about redheads, but I canÂ´t remember having read it in the canon.

Is it just something many fanfic-writers share as a 'tradition' or whatever you want to call it?


** Complete fanfiction meme; people noticed that Harry ended up with a redhead, just like James married Lily and put the notion of Sirius and/or Remus teasing Harry about it in their stories. Later stories took it seriously. Even later stories used it as an anti-trope by suggesting that the Potters went for brainy muggleborn witches (to reinforce their Harry-Hermione preference).

That was used often enough that recent writers have suggested that it's a Potter family tradition to marry muggleborns so as to prevent the insanity due to inbreeding suffered by the Blacks and all the pureblood bad guys.

Funniest thing- putting in something completely contrary to any of these and have reviewers attempt to 'correct' you (How dare you suggest that Pansy was poisoning Harry with love potions? Everyone knows it was Ginny, supported by her insane money-grubbing mother Molly! You are stoopid writer who shoudl read more carefullier.)
