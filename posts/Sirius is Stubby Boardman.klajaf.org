I had an idea for a fic. Sirius time travels somehow (maybe through the veil), and ends up in the past. He needs a new identity, and ends up being called Stubby Boardman (maybe because he has a stubbly beard, and is still as â€˜skinny as a board' from Azkaban). He somehow joins/forms a band, and fights Voldemort/just chills while being a rockstar.


** Did something like this not happen in a fic? I think it might have been luna that called him that
