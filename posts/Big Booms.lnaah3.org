Any fics where there is Grand Battles. Like harry vs Voldy throwing around some serious heat? I mean there spells are throwing giant waves of elements to be shielded by large mystical shields to then mass transfigure an army of animals/golems to storm the enemy while Voldy is slinging so dark shit.

There is a fic I can't remember the name but I do know the main story where harry gets sent back to marauder era then goes to a bar and is attacked by the knights of walpurgis and he fucks them up sideways. Well there is a certain battle between Harry and Moldybutt that I absolutely LOVE!! Harry has a special animation magic he uses for transfiguration where he makes some seriously advanced and mostly sentient creations that suck up the dark art spells Voldy casts that kinda sponges it up and uses it as a attack boost that he sends into a group of DE's. He is ruthless to his enemies but still very much Harry Potter.

Stuff like that would be appreciated because the grammer and wording of that story was flawless.


** Sounds like you're describing linkffn(Wind Shear).

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** It was my first fic ever, so the writing in the first 10k words is a but rough, but there aren't many fics that have more frequent and believable magical battles than linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
