Hi there. I am looking for daily prophets issues, rita skeeters clippings and the books she wrote such as "the life and lies of albus dumbledore" or "dumbledores army: the dark side of demob". I am not interested anything under 50k word. Thanks in advance o/


** ffnbot(8553100) It's a WIP, and it's not 100% the works of Rita Skeeter, but it does focus on characters' reactions to her writing.
