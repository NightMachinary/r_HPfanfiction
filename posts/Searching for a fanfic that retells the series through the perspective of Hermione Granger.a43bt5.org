Hi [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]!

I'm writing a thesis on how fan fiction has become a safe space for marginalized readers. I've written very thoroughly on the slash genre, but I'm looking to extend this to feminist theory on women taking control of their own understanding of HP narratives. Anything will help, preferably something prominent with a lot of readers.

Thanks in advance!


** This isn't the entire series, but I came across [[https://slacktiverse.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/hermione-granger-and-the-goblet-of-sexism-chapter-one-and-introduction/][Hermione Granger And The Goblet of Sexism]] which is a rewrite of the fourth book from Hermione's perspective. At the end of each chapter, the author deconstructs the original book chapter.

I thought to share since this story has a feminist basis to it

*** Oh, this is great! Where did you find this? Thank you for rec'ing it =)!

Do you know if the author is still working on it?

I'd love to see her take on a Hermione POV of Harry's name coming out of the goblet, the first task and the Yule Ball.

**** I randomly found it when looking for “feminist” perspectives on fandoms online. Not sure if author is still working on it, I think updates are sporadic.

If you like this, I'd recommend linkao3(In Loco Parentis by Dolores_Crane). It has really interesting commentary on the Wizarding World.

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

** Not sure I agree with your thesis, but the one that immediately came to mind is The Arithmancer by White Squirrel, and it's sequels. It is a little AU but not by too much. The premise is of Hermione is a math whiz instead of just a book worm. Told from her perspective and covers all 7 books. The third in the trilogy is post Hogwarts and is WIP.

Sorry can't be bothered to link on my phone.

***** Thank you so much for your incredibly kind words <3 This story will always have a special place in my heart because it was my first venture into fanfiction, and pretty much writing fiction, in general. I'm so glad you were able to enjoy what's been written.

I definitely would only return to writing it if I got the motivation. But for the first time in a very long time that doesn't seem so out of reach anymore. Your words have definitely factored into that, so thank you again :)

****** Just found this post, and didn't expect to find you on here.

Someone linked /A Memoir/ at [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] on another thread the other day, and I read it all in about four hours yesterday. I didn't bother to get up to eat or anything. It's a fantastic piece of writing, but it was really disappointing to see you didn't finish it. You gave me all the feels - making my heart race, making me laugh and shed tears and feel good and bad. I should mention at this point that I'm an outwardly emotionless bearded guy, who never ever would admit that I'd ever read romance fanfics face-to-face. In fact, outwardly, I'm not altogether unlike your take on Harry at the beginning of /Grow Young With Me/, which I read half of yesterday and have almost finished now.

But I digress. /A Memoir/ made me fall in love with Hermoine. With you, I guess, in a way, having now read most of /Grow Young With Me/. I'd be thrilled to little apples if you did finish it. In the meanwhile, I'd be thrilled to see more of your writing. I've looked on your tumblr but haven't yet got my head round how that works.

Where do you keep your other work? Is it on your tumblr site or somewhere else?

******* Hello! I've only just come across this reply, I'm so sorry for not responding sooner! Thank you so much for your incredibly kind words. It always makes me most pleased when someone who isn't into romance, manages to enjoy my stories. I'm so grateful that you gave them a chance :)

I completely understand your disappointment at /A Memoir/ being abandoned (as of now), but I've recently come around to the idea of going back to it. I did leave off in a pretty unsatisfying part unfortunately. However, I definitely intend to finish /Grow Young with Me/ despite the long break since last chapter. I'm almost done with the new update, so hoping to get that out soon.

Those are my only two stories right now and both of them can be found on fanfiction.net. I sometimes post little random facts about GYWM on tumblr to help with the wait time between chapters. People also ask me questions about the story there sometimes, as well. If you ever need help navigating that website, I'd be happy to help. I know it's pretty confusing lol

Thank you so much again for your kind words, I hope this finds you well!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5]] generally writes Hermione centric fics that also feature her in a leadership role, such as:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Hermione formed a Muggleborn resistance group after Year 5 and dealt Death Eaters some devastating blows. She is a very effective war leader and shrewd politician here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Deceived by her enemies at an young age, she slowly uncovered the truth through her own investigations and linked up with Dumbledore's order. This story has one of the best Hermione characterizations among HP fanfics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Hermione is not the main character, but a squib Petunia Evans. Despite her born 'disability, she tried her best to have a great career and to raise Harry. She also took charge in her adventures, whether partnered with Bill Weasley or Sirius Black.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/763509/Annerb][Annerb]] writes great Ginny centric fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]], linkffn(6919395), has one of the best characterizations of a strong female character among HP fanfics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][FloreatCastellum]] also writes great Ginnys. Her [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], linkffn(11419408), is IMHO the best canon compliant Year 7 Hogwarts fic and shows how Ginny took charge against terror and torture.

One interesting case is the Bellatrix Black in time travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855). Despite devoting herself to Harry's cause, she's still by no means a paragon of virtue, but she works efficiently, gets things done, generally works out mutually beneficial deals for her 'allies'.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** Your bot usage is interesting. You know you can use the title, instead of the story number?

I've read or started most of those; Divided and Entwined is very well done, but it's about war, and war is hell, and it's really really long, and eventually I put it down. Tomb Raider sounds cheesy, but starfox is talented and I quite enjoyed it.

Delenda Est has an excellent first half, and then just totally drops the ball in the second half. Still worth reading imo, but lots of missed potential.

** Are you only looking for canon compliant stuff? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10529982][The Mystery Under the Trapdoor]] linkao3(10529982) is from Hermione's POV, but it's an AU where she's the girl who lived.
