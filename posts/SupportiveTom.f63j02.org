Fics where Horcrux Tom (the one in Harry's scar) is a supportive/helpful being who actually cares about Harry's happiness and wellbeing. And he goes out of his way to support and aide him in his own sick, twisted, Voldemort-ey way.


** I'm working on a supportive Diary!Tom. The gist is Diary!Tom hates Volde for trapping him in the diary and sees the scarcrux in Harry as a potential ally in exacting his revenge. There are other motivations at play, but spoilers.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

**** He's gathered the gist of what's occured, but there was a clean break:

“This isn't the first time you've tried to recruit me.” Anger was rising in Harry once again. “You killed my parents. You tried to kill me. Now you're trying to kill her!” Harry shot an accusatory glance over to Ginny, still laying motionless on the floor.

“Me? Now, I've been trapped in a book for the past 50 years. How could I have harmed your parents? You blame me for another's crimes.”

“Don't play games. You ARE Voldemort. You said so yourself!”

“I'm the memory of a 15 year old boy who's pen name was later used by someone who hurt you. Why should you hate me?”

** linkffn(11762850). Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux by Imaginizer. In this fic, Voldemort is some sort of a parental figure to Harry ( though if Harry annoys him, Voldemort does the Cruciatus from the scar). There's a memorable scene where he confronts Diary Tom and when the Diary is hellbent on killing him, he let's his Tom take over as in his words, Harry Potter cannot defeat Tom Riddle ... but Lord Voldemort could.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

#+begin_quote
  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
