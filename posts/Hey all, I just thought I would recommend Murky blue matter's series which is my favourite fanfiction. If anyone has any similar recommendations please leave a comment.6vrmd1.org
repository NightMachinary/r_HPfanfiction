*** A few things about it that I particularly enjoy are; the pure blood society aspects, the lower alleys and how a whole new 'world' is explored within the series with worldly characters and I enjoyed the academic progression behind the potions. It's not so much pairings or any particular desire for fem Harry rather than a well written story with intriguing plot, well thought out characters and a story that makes you want to stay up all night reading it!

** linkffn(the Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) - helps if you mention the story name. This fic is often recommended here along with other Fem!Harry fics, significant AU's, and stories about specialties in magic.

Mirroring [[/u/Whapples][u/Whapples]], if you're interested in finding more fics 'of that type' you'll get better replies if you tell us what aspects of the story makes it worthwhile to you.
