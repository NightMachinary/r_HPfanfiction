** Well, when it comes to straight up OC establishing, Black Luminary does a very fine job. The first few chapters are kind of a mixed bag, to be honest, but you'll have to trudge through them if you want to have a chance of comprehending and appreciating the later ones.

The second year, at the very least, is one of the best AU years I've ever read. And the quality stays consistent from there.

*** Commenting to support this comment and mention that the plots of this fic are amazing, expansive in scope, mysterious, thrilling and well developed.

I definitiely reccommend this fic, and if you are worried about Harry's weird behaviour around girls at the start, there is an in-universe reason and one of many ongoing plotlines, but it also gets much less of a thing as the story progresses, and well worth sticking with the story for all that amazing magic, characters, and adventure!

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
