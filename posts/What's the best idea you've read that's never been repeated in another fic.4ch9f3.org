** That Moody was Crouch Jr's Godfather. It's a rather tidy sort of idea: Crouch Jr must have known Moody fairly well to imitate him for a year without being found out, and if that connection was through his father, he probably also absolutely detested Moody.

***** in the uk a lot of people are the sort of christians that never went to church but still identify that way, or with general christian moralisms, and pick up a few things. like, the culture of it. godparents end up being part of the process, like making your friends into unofficial aunts and uncle, but i don't think it's that common and it's certainly not legalising them as back up parents, unless it's in their will. it probably wouldn't be that uncommon for those godparents to adopt their best friends children though. but, lily and james where buried in a church grave so chances are they were religious. in which case it'd mean a bit more. i have a hard time believing sirius as a catholic. j.k just got lazy with the whole thing i guess.

If you're over 18 it matters less but it's still nice.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Spoilers.

linkffn(Elsewhere, but Not Elsewhen)

Bella has a child born July 31. Bellatrix pulls a Lily. No one knows this happened though, just that both she and Voldemort disappeared. When the house blew up muggles found it, since no one was looking for Bellatrix that night. So the kid ends up in the foster system and grows up a supposed muggleborn.

Voldemort learning the prophesy decides to not kill Harry but send him somewhere he can't interfere.

The Horcrux connection goes both ways instead of Harry getting corrupted(which isn't rare) Voldemort becomes more like Harry.

Voldemort, once he's won, revises his agenda. This ties to the previous point. I always had a hard time believing a megalomaniac like Voldemort would ever really believe in a philosophy that says hes inferior to anyone.

** [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/ivy_blossom/TTAH01a.html][Harry isn't real.]]

This little fic is awesome. It's from Ginny's POV and uses the idea that Harry doesn't really exist. He's the culmination of the magical world's hopes and wishes. I haven't seen anything else like that. (Which I kinda understood. If it wasn't a one-shot, they might have to go into details of who has been fighting evil at Hogwarts or if that's another hallucination.)

I've been wanted to do that kind of story with a twist. Harry finds out the magical world's desires created him, and the real Harry Potter was buried in Godric's Hollow. It would be a mix of the basic idea of him being manufactured with the idea of him not /feeling/ manufactured. Sort of Dawn Summers, but the replacement of a real baby. This thread is making me want to revisit that fic idea.

** Mmail. Basically, wizarding email, complete with the tropes and grammar we use for it.

Seen in linkffn(Naked Quidditch) and linkffn (This Means War!), which expanded the idea a bit.

Still, the idea that wizards have some form of email/texting seems to never come up. Seriously, who uses a high- level anti-Dementor spell as a messaging service?

The library that needs a special portkey to get to is super interesting, and the physical mark of a dark wizard that you have to carve yourself is really cool.

God, that story had /so/ much going for it, and it was /just/ getting really really really good, but then the author abandoned it and deleted it from their account.

******* Hu, I did this in my own story (where Harry's POV and his hiding out is only a minor point, but he does it for a pretty long time) and my solution for "how can Dobby get him food without having to apparate into the vault" was simply.. Harry leaves Gringotts with his Invisibility Cloak when he needs more food, meets Dobby, gets a bag of food and goes back to his vault. Not idiot-safe, he could get caught while outside, but a minimal risk if he doesn't do anything stupid.

** linkffn(4343191) - Warrior's Heir

Harry goes into a dimension where his counterpart isn't simply a dark or evil version of him, his counterpart is You-know-who, and Tom is the Boy Who Lived. The dark side hates purebloods, while the purebloods are light. It's the only fic I've seen where Harry and Tom swap places, and while the backstory isn't exactly watertight (A bit hard to make a believable backstory with muggleborns wanting to kill muggles) it makes a surprising amount of sense. The story highlights both the similarities and differences between Tom and Harry.

It also gives Harry an ability, kind of like Parseltongue, where he has increased strength and reflexes. So, as a dark lord, his forte is dueling whereas Voldemort's would be knowledge of curses and magic in general.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.

** linkffn(9238861) - For some reason, I feel like it's probably been repeated elsewhere, but out of all the fics I have read, I've only come across it once. Where Tom Riddle reveals that his agenda was not a pureblood one all along and that he chose the purebloods to be his followers to brand them in public with the Dark Mark to ruin them on a social level.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

**** Some clarifications: "Ron" is bashed so heavily that he bears almost no resemblance to his canon counterpart. I find it helpful to think of him as Ron-In-Name-Only, merely an object of derision for the author.

There's also a fair amount of author tract and unexplained character development that occurs without any preamble or exposition.

That being said, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) is probably one of the best multi-chapter crack-fics out there.
