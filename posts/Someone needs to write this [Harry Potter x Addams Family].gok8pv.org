  He's done it. He's just five years old, but he's finally done it. The Dursleys are gone. And now he's with a new family who seems just as twisted as he is. How strange.

** There is one called Harveste Addams, which is the best thing I have ever read, but it's uncompleted and it's so depressing. Actually, I think I'll complete it one day.

**** I like linkffn(when harry met wednesday). Fits the prompt pretty well too and pretty good as far as writing goes, better than I would expect from a pretty niche crossover.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.
