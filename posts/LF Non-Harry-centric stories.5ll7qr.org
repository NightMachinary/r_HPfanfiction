Anyone know any good HP fanfic that /don't/ center around Harry? He can still be in the fic, just not as the main character.

To make it a little more difficult, I have some additional criteria:

- No fem!Harry, or Harry-In-Name-Only, or OC-possessing-Harry or crossover-character-taking-Harry's-place anything like that. (That's just /cheating./)
- No character bashing, /especially/ no Dumbledore- or Weasley-bashing. (Character bashing is my biggest pet peeve in fanfics, and I /like/ Dumbledore and the Weasleys.)
- No Marauders-era fanfics. (This is just a quirk of mine, but I tend to get bored with the Marauders. You can have stories with Sirius, Remus and/or Peter at different times in history, but no fics about their Hogwarts days.)
- If Hermione is the main character, no romances with any of the Malfoys, Voldemort/Tom Riddle, or Snape.
- Actually, same rule if Ginny is the main character.

Other than that, anything goes. So... Any recs for me?


** I'll just recommend some of my favorites, completed ones first:

"Cauterize", linkffn(4152700)

"Dark Marauder", linkffn(4586362): Marauders are MCs, but the fic has nothing to do with their Hogwarts days.

"Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince": fully canon-compliant Year 6 fic from Ginny's POV. Harry doesn't appear very often.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Harry is only an important character here, appearing less often than Ron.

"Murder Most Horrid", linkffn(10099028): in a Voldemort free world, Bellatrix and Hermione got together. There are new bad guys though.

"Not From Others", linkffn(11419408): Year 7 fic from Ginny's POV, and Harry barely appeared at all.

"The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877): another Hermione and Ron centric fic with Harry as an important character. It has one of the best final battles I've read. Lucius Malfoy is interesting here.

--------------

WIPs:

"Applied Cultural Anthropology, or", linkffn(9238861): Slytherin Hermione, often recommended here, very well written, but I've a feeling this one is NEVER going to be finished.

"Exile", linkffn(6432055): surprisingly good postwar Draco fic.

"Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance", linkffn(10991501): Salazar Slytherin reincarnated as Hermione Granger, and he/she set out to fix things.

"The Changeling", linkffn(6919395): Slytherin Ginny centric, extremely well written, near completion.

"The Red Knight", linkffn(12141684): Canon Ron reincarnated in a new world and things were rather different here.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they called her - and yet... Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar? (Reincarnation fic)
