For once I would like to see a crossover where Harry just becomes a regular guy. No superhero or good guy (though I wouldn't mind seeing some more stories of Harry as the bad guy) stories, just him doing something like a normal job.

An Abhorsen ending up in the HP verse somehow, discovering that death works differently, and saying screw it, giving the Deathly Hallows to the Peverell brothers could be interesting.

** Quoth /Pact/:

#+begin_quote
  The Wand is predominantly used in London, with a surveyed sixty-three percent of practitioners carrying wands there. In the practitioner schools in the United Kingdom, wands are provided to the students by default, for their convenience, easy portability, and a prevailing sentiment that the wand is the strongest implement of choice for practitioner dealings against hostile practitioners.
#+end_quote

I've always sort of wanted to read /Harry Potter/ crossed over with /Pact/. In a sense, /Pact/ is the opposite of /Harry Potter/: whereas down-on-his-luck Harry discovers a whole new world of magic where he is a hero and a fortunate celebrity with the potential to live a happy life, down-on-his-luck Blake discovers a whole new world of magic where his Karma is in the gutter, he has obligational enemies on all sides, and his life goes perpetually downhill into the drain. /Harry Potter/ is an optimistic story about how you can let your family and history control you (e.g. Voldemort) or choose to break free (e.g. Sirius), and it extolls the power of choice (it's made clear that the Prophecy only had power because Voldemort fed into it). /Pact/ is a pessimistic story about how your family and history really does trap you and limit your future.

Mixing the two series, whether by character crossover (a Potterverse Wizard in Jacob's Bell?) or fusion (an AU where Hogwarts is a school of practioners in the /Pact/ universe?), could develop the themes of the disparate series in interesting ways, IMO. But that's just my impression.

****** Then again, when your comparison goes “take the strongest characters from HP, they'd win against random encounter bandits/wolves/crabs”, well ... it kind of puts them in a pitiful light, really.

The higher-tier characters in Elder Scrolls are kind of broken power-level--wise. I do not doubt that a character from the Harry Potter series could be inserted as a substitute protagonist or something of this sort, but when you think about Elder Scrolls magic and all it has to offer in terms of firepower the HP magic would start amounting to a bag of tricks for the most part, some of them potentially dangerous, sure, but a bag of tricks nonetheless.

***** Yeah, I'm serious. Well, at least semi-serious. The magical systems are different beasts, at least when it comes to one thing:

Cost.

Mages in Tamriel have somewhat more limits on their magic. It needs to be replenished, either over time or with potions, rest, and special objects -- and leveling or amount of magicka is a factor in what spells they can or cannot use.

Witches and wizards of the /HP/ verse, meanwhile, do not get any form of magical exhaustion/depletion in canon, (aside from the normal bodily exhaustion involved in fighting). Physically, they're more resilient than Muggles, which, depending on the author, might mean they'd be more resilient than some races of /TES/.

The difference in magic itself is a lot more than that, though. There have been cases where characters have pulled off spells that even older wizards couldn't (Patronus); or have done certain difficult magic at a young age (the Mauraders learning to be Animagi); or learn difficult potions (Hermione brewing Polyjuice) -- so it's possible for less experienced wizards to learn more advanced potions or spells ... and with the advanced spells, they don't have to worry about being out of magicka after they cast them. They have magic that duplicates objects, which could, in theory, give them an endless supply of Septims through whatever they choose to sell (provided they can't just copy gold). They can modify memories if they get into trouble, or "just" Confund them. Or, if the characters involved are of a Dark bent, they could one-shot baddies with the Killing Curse.

And those are just a few examples that come to mind as major advantages, stuff that would be high-level magic but without the high-level costs.

*tl;dr* - The biggest problem, at least for me, is that /HP/ magic has very little cost while /TES/ magic has definite costs -- costs that go beyond the usual time, effort, and money.

******** Mmk, first idea I had is that it's a bit of a fusion. The Founders were Heroes, like in the overlord game, as is Dumbledore. Dumbledore is the last great Hero of the 20th century. Story starts in 5th year in Dumbledore's office with Harry learning the prophecy and shredding the locked door in a spectacular display of accidental magic. He goes to the room of requirement and asks for a chance to survive, or some such. This leads him to the Tower Heart and the Overlord's gauntlet. Harry puts the gauntlet on and Dobby pops in and goes apeshit with joy. Harry now has a fighting force of minions who can also cook. Gnarl is dead because while he was good comic relief, I figured I could make it funny without him. Also, I think it would make for a better story to have the Tower Heart itself lead Harry to the dark side. It can play "innocent magical artifact" better than Gnarl can play "innocent minion", not that he would even try.

Harry makes plans and eventually gets to the point where the Tower Heart convinces him to lure everyone out of the school and then lock everyone outside so that it can become The Tower once more, rather than just a castle.

Pairings can be whatever you want, if you want them. If you do, Overlords traditionally kidnap a few people while they raid their enemies homes.

Harry would start out fighting Voldemort, and then ideally he would kill him and then transition to fighting dumbledore, bu

** I would pay money for a really good HP/Fairytale crossover. Something that captures just how ridiculously powerful FT magic is and compared to that, how precise, versatile and absolutely horrifying HP mages can be. Add to that some of the FT humor and I'd be a happy reader.

The same goes for a HP / League of Legends crossover. However, I'd be amazed if I'd find even a good League fic, let alone a good crossover. Same thing with almost all videogame franchises. They're either terrible, or abandoned. HP/Overwatch, HP/Starcraft, HP/Diablo, HP/Warcraft... to name only the Blizzard titles.

*** I think most of the fics in the Witcher/HP archive more or less follow that idea. The best of them is probably linkffn(Wake the Black Wolf) on the dual account of it being pretty readable, as well as feeling like the author has done some research into Witcher canon, whereas a lot of other fics in the archive feel like they were written by people fresh off finishing The Witcher 3 and nothing else. The only issue is that I'm not sure if it's Harry/Ciri or not.

Full disclaimer: I, too, have written a Witcher/HP crossover that I'll link here, linkffn(The Lesser Kindness), but it's not quite what you're looking for. Pretty much every character from HP was born in the Witcher world in it, and it takes some 200 years before Ciri's birth. So don't worry if it's not your cup of tea.

Especially if Harry isn't just a Flash/Superman/Green Arrow Rip off, Magic is a pretty damn cool Super Power, a Strong one at that.

Harry Potter x Highschool DxD, I literally have a plot bunny ready to go, the Magic Systems don't fit but Harry traveling to DxD makes things interesting, does Harry get a Sacred Gear, was Harry super Strong before he came over, the OPness of DxD vs the Reality Breaking and Warping that is seen as everyday shit in Hogwarts.

Sirius escapes 8 minutes before Esme found Pettigrew. Fudge still sends dementors to "protect" Hogwarts: they resign after one of them is hit by Tiffany (with a cauldron, whose bottom fissurate due to inadequate thickness; this will be the spark of Percy Weasley's career).

The first few chapters, like all fics, are pretty weak, but later on the fic is filled with fabulous science and dramatic battles.

The website it was originally hosted on did have Harry Potter as one of the options to fuse with Dungeon Keeper, but unfortunately it's defunct now...

** I would like a good crossover with the Windrose Chronicles. The series is amazing and well-written, and I could see it going well.

** Oh, and this hp/legend of the seeker|sword of truth crossover idea I had is oddly popular. And sadly, I wouldn't mind completing it except it's so hard to finish the sword of truth. I got to the old world infiltrations and the constant separations of ricky/kahlan and the uber gary stuness of ricky that made me quit reading.

I'm also doing a gilmore girls/hp crossover where (time traveler) harry's just the diner owner that everyone can tell wants to nail lorelai to the floor with a nephew that looks a lot like him who goes to a boarding school in europe

**** Nail as in hammer away at her. As in euphemisms for sex. You should, it's funny, the women are hot, and you don't really need to know the series for my xover.

** I would love to read some Person of Interest / Justified crossovers, where the characters from either show end up at Hogwarts either as students or teachers. A crossover with The 100 could work as well where Harry finds himself in the future.

A Westworld-esque fic with a Harry Potter theme park world instead could work really well if pulled off correctly. Loads of potential there.

** I want to see a crossover between Harry Potter and Mad Father. Perhaps a 13 year old Harry Potter is transported into Mad Father about near the start of it.

An Avengers crossover that isn't slash, and is finished.

Harry Potter and Dangon Ronpa, I want to see what would happen with Harry there, but still have his magic.

Harry Potter and Minecraft, but still keep his magic.

Harry Potter and Portal, but still keep his magic.

Prince Of Slytherin Harry into normal Harry Potter universe.
