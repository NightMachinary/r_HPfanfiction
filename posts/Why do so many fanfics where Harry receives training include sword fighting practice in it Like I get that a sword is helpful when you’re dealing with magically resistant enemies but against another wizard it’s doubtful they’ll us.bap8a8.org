#+TITLE: Why do so many fanfics where Harry receives training include sword fighting practice in it? Like I get that a sword is helpful when you’re dealing with magically resistant enemies but against another wizard it’s doubtful they’ll use a sword and getting close would be so difficult.

Mythbusters also tested the myth “Don't bring a knife to a gun fight” in [[https://youtu.be/cGzeyO3pGzw][this episode]]. I have to remind you that both are amateurs, and Adam Savage was further wearing a heavy suit that hampered his mobility.

In close quarter combat, blades and swords may actually have a significant advantage in hands of martial art experts. Furthermore, these bladed weapons may be magically enhanced and could deflect/reflect spells to a certain degree.

** Sword fighting has been a thing for nobility for a very long time time. Specially a good sword is expensive in those days. Most of the time it's just fencing of the sorts. So I view it partly as a status symbol. So if there's a "Lord Potter trope" then Noble fencing or knightly appearance is a must. Even in Rome, nobles carry pugio.

Also, you can jump people with the pointy end. Technically witches were hunted by mobs with pitchforks so it's reasonable that a if a guy springs up with a machete or something, those who aren't used to fighting against it gets killed. A knife in a gun fight is a sure win at a certain distance. Spells are flashy but more dogeable so a sword is useful. So if they get close fast enough it's over. Our country fought off invaders to some extent and that's sword vs. guns so it proves that range is not automatically count as a win against meelee.

Another thing is foot work, like all martial are discipline there's foot work involved. Assuming at a spell fight you keep your arms/hand up at log periods of time, someone practices the sword is has more endurance since a stick is lighter than a great sword.

** One of my headcanon says that East Asian wizards in China and Japan can cast limited spells through their swords. Japanese wizards are specially proud of their "Kendo Magic", a fighting style combining magic with martial arts. Kendo Magic experts can even deflect or reflect spells with their special bladed weapons.

Similarly, Americans have managed to merge/hide their wands in their guns. Whereas No Majs see them as normal guns, they can also function as wands. Some of these gun-wand combo weapon can cast Avada Kedavra while firing bullets at 500 RPM, simultaneously.

** Swords would be rather pointless, but a dagger in your off-hand would be useful if you get into close quarters. Like, you are trading spells, but you also can simply stab people nearby.

Of course, bringing an automatic pistol to wield in your offhand would be a wiser choice, but that is a different question.

** Well, there are benefits to doing something that others don't. Wizards trained or used to fighting against traditional wizard means won't be expecting someone to get up close and start to fight them with a sword - and that means they might make a rookie mistake and lose easily.

You can also likely optimize for that to an extent. Enchanted robes, focusing on shield spells and movement/apparition could allow you to get that opening to get close and end it.

Is it likely to be the /best/ strategy? Perhaps not. But I could see it being workable, and the story can certainly be molded around it if that's what a writer wants to have happened.

** Sword of Gryffindor.... used to slay 2 snakes in canon...

Why did Gryffindor even have a sword unless he used it? Maybe the founders time didn't rely on wands as much, who knows...

But one could also imagine that Duels with wands could pick up a lot from Sword Fighting. Stances, dodges, parry's, repost... being aware of the space around you personal body space... physical fitness... Surprise Sword MFer!

Plenty of reasons... though most fics don't really explain it...they just think swords are cool and the SoG is just waiting to be used.

** In my headcanon, Aurors are trained to use all sorts of weapons. You never know when you'll lose your wand and you wouldn't want to be caught flat footed. I have one instance where Harry got his dumb ass shot because he thought the wandless wizard was defenseless. I also changed a magical duel into a sword fight because I wasn't satisfied with how it was coming out. Other writers have other reasons, but those are mine.

Like there's a chance you might encounter someone using a sword but it's guaranteed you're gonna fight someone using a wand. Isn't it best to practice the same way you're gonna fight?

**** I guess it depends on the writer's reasoning. I would agree that magic would always be the primary mode of defense and all else would be a backup. Be prepared and all that.
