I just read Exile by bennybear and I was hooked and couldn't stop reading.

In this story Draco fled into the muggle world (he realized that he was defenseless because he wasn't allowed to do magic and own a wand for 5 years). The author was great in describing the struggles of living in a alien world, realizing all the wrong things that he believed, cutting ties with his family and especially his process of maturing and settling in his new life.

So I'm looking for similar stories, not necessarily in the muggle world, but stories that give Draco a good redemption arc.

Thank you!

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy accepted Dumbledore's offer of help at the top of the Astronomy Tower too late to prevent what he had started. Given shelter with his Mother's sister he finds himself facing up to the true nature of the cause he once pledged himself to. As the war worsens he is forced to confront his worst fears and decide what kind of Wizard he wants to be.

And yes, I am afraid Exile is a bit unique. Certainly, it is by far the best Draco redemption story I have ever read.
