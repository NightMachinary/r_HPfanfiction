Can anyone recommend me good stories (bonus points for drarry üòâ) with sweet houseelf plotlines?


** So I haven't actually read this but I'm about to and there's a tag for a house elf OC so I assume she plays a decently big role.

  Draco wants to kill himself, but he's trying not to be dramatic about it. Harry wants to sleep with Draco, but he's trying not to be obvious about it. Misunderstandings! Pining! Grief! Self-loathing but in a kind of charming way?Feat. Misty the house elf who takes shit from no one, an Astoria who has her own mysterious aims, a Draco who is determined to use humour to get through things, and a Harry doesn't know what he wants, except maybe to touch Draco's pretty face.

** This fic is awesome. It's a Harmony fic (sorry it's not drarry üòî). There's house elf side characters with sweet personalities, and some world building.

** I was really surprised when I read this one because the summary made it sound like a fairly normal professor fic and then some really interesting but out stuff smacked me in the face. It delves into wizarding house magic pretty deeply and two of the house elf characters have a prominent role. An interesting interpretation on the nature of house elves.

  Eleven years after the war, Draco Malfoy leads a quiet, boring, and perfectly respectable life, thanks very much. Or, at least he does, until a sudden and very unexpected veela awakening causes him to throw soup all over Harry Potter in the middle of the Ministry cafeteria.

** I don't know if I'd consider the character great, but Limmy from the Ever Upward series by Stranglefig is pretty interesting. It's not Drarry (Harry's year haven't made it to Hogwarts yet), but it's got very similar vibes to The Secret Language of Plants series by Endrina, so if you enjoyed that, you'll probably enjoy this. The bot doesn't seem to like series, so I've put it to link the first story.
