A long time ago I read a Harry/Draco story that I really loved. I thought the story was named 'To the End' or something, but I can't find it in any of my favorites anymore. I'm not even sure that is the name of the story I'm looking for, or if I'm mixing two stories up. I have been trying to search for it on FFN and google, but I can't find it at all.

Things that happened:

- The plot is that Draco gets cursed to have nightmares every day, until the sun goes down
- People that has been cursed with this usually slowly starts going insane
- Only the true loves kiss can save him
- The dreams involves a monster
- Draco stabs Ginny in confusion because he was going crazy and he thought she was the monster

I will be forever grateful if anyone can find this story!
