** Assess my wants and priorities. Am I really trying to gain independence or am I trying to screw everyone over and take over the world?

If I'm trying for independence I leave the shitty fic and training montage - take my buttloads of gold and move to a different country and start a new life under a new name.

If I want revenge and to take over the world - continue the montage but be sure to add in more sarcasm and wanton sex as I flip everyone the bird and revel in my plot-armored awesomeness.

The End.

** For a relatively serious answer. Eh, after panicking. Probably getting a drink too. I'd probably get out of Britain with all my money, change my name, hide away, and live out the rest of my days in relative peace.

Alternatively, burn down the whole system:

First, continue the training montage. Might come in handy. Since this is a crappy indy!Harry fanfic, go to the goblins to somehow get the horcrux out through the power of bullshit, do that inheritance test for my millions of galleons, titles and goodies. Maybe convince them to deal with the Hufflepuff Cup.

Second, avoid getting dragged into a harem, or any relationships in general, while my body is still anywhere under 18-21. Honestly, for most people working out a relationship with a single person is hard enough, several? That's just asking for trouble. They're also all teenage girls (or adults, in which case I still don't want anything to do with someone wanting to date me in 16-year-old Harry's body, that's just creepy).

Third, start cataloguing and copying down all that knowledge from the Black/Potter/Peverell libraries or whatever. Hopefully, I haven't pissed off Hermione by then, and she isn't one of the local Dumbledore's sycophants, so she can help me out. If not, find someone else among my new best friends/potential harem partners to help me out. Probably a Ravenclaw.

Fourth, deal with the likes of Voldemort, manipulative!Dumbledore and the Ministry. With the power of plot armour.

Fifth, get all this ancient, Family Secret â„¢ knowledge released to the masses, integrated into the Hogwarts curricula. So that your average magic user is on more even footing with all these noble families. Dismantle the whole magical feudalist system that's usually the norm in these sorta fics and push some innovation. Because honestly, that disparity of power is just terrifying

Sixth, since this is the nineties. Explore the muggle world in the past. Invest in brands and projects that I know will take off in the future, go to concerts of some cool bands that were still around back then, and so on.

*** On that note, I used to do some jobs for a Saudi prince and he told me that an even number of wives is always better because then they can always team up on each other while if you had an odd number of wives, the one left out would come to you for support.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** Step 1 pray to God I have not ticked off Hermione. Some might ask why the reason is that Hermione is the person most likely to be able to help me act like Harry. So get in contact with Hermione and talk with her. Also try and date her before 6th year nonsense starts as I have no time for teen age drama so I will try and nip that in the bud.

Step 2 finish the training montage it cannot hurt and might help. Besides I will need the practice to get at least the basics down (another good reason to have Hermione on my side).

Step 3 plan the elimination of Draco Malfoy so this is an Indy Harry fic and a bad one so I am sure to swing by the Goblins for some jewelry and a free soul extraction. Thus I will be free to kill Voldemort without needing to eat the AK first.

Step 4 eliminate Draco he is a dangerous threat to people I care about so get rid of him and use the nice collection of Acromantulas for easy body disposal.

Step 5 work with Hermione to make a bag of holding and collect as much of the Hogwarts library as I can for future access.

** Honestly find out which houses I control and figure out who is most likely I'm going to marry for the lines. Stun Draco off the astronomy tower and have either goyle or crabble take the blame by having them fire two stunners with their wands. Try to place a memory (assuming indy Harry power up) in one of them that their fathers ordered them to. Get the Horacrux out of me and warn the goblins about the one in the bank. Maybe pre give them the sword of gryffindor to destroy the Hufflepuff cup. Go after the rest of the Horacruxs and allow Dumbledore get the ring. Pay off somebody else to go after Voldemort as I signed his death warrant with my own hands the prophecy can still be valid. About the only people to deal with would be the Weasley family and maybe Hermione.
