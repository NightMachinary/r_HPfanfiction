E.g., surfing, skiing, mountainboarding. All are usually used with terms that denote flying in someway.

I'M hoping in the next month or so to finish the first year of darkness ascendant and he'll be back in Australia for part of the summer, meeting some locals who are a few years his senior but all muggleborn adrenaline junkies who adopt him into their group.


** If he can control something going 150 mph, he can probably surf, yeah.

*** You're saying that any racing driver can surf?

***** The controls are a bit different between a broom that you sit on and hold with your hands and a surf board that you stand on too, mate.

** I imagine that if you take anyone who's good at one sport and ask them to play another, they'll probably at least be decent at it, as long as it doesn't use a completely different skill set. Just being in shape and generally athletic probably helps a lot.

I would guess that Quidditch has probably helped Harry get good at balance, coordination, reflexes, and endurance. Those probably would be helpful in the sports you mentioned. He might have to learn some new techniques and unlearn some habits that you don't want to carry over, but he'd probably be able to learn much quicker than someone without his experience.

But even without all that, if these sports just give him the same thrill as flying does, that could give him the motivation to get good at them, which will count for a lot.

** I've never thought about this but I think he would do good in a lot of sports. Like, playing quidditch would require some good abilities like balancing, quick decisions, physical strength etc. Harry is also has no fear apparently doing some wild tricks on pure instinct. He would do good with adrenaline junkies:D

** Well he is noted as being quick on his feet, slim, small for his age. So sports that suit this kind of build he will probably be at least reasonably good.

I doubt he would do well in boxing or wrestling. Which favour more sturdy physique.
