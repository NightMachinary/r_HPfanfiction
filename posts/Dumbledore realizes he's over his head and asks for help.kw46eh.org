Rather it's the Order Members, the teachers, other people he can trust, or whoever.

Can be about Harry, can be about the Horcruxes, can be about Hogwarts, or the Ministry, etc. Just getting more help.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc, doesn't have to focus on pairings

No Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.


** It's Mundungus. He asks why he can't get people to accept his lemon sherbets

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!

***** Oh no, it's completely fine! If you can remember another story where Dumbledore asks for help, that's great, if not that's perfectly fine too.
