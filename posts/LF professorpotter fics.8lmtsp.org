I think my favourite AU that really hasn't been written enough is Professor Potter. I agree with a lot of people that that line of work really seemed to suit Harry and was a lot more in line with his character than becoming an Auror for life. And it seems so fitting that Harry would be the DADA professor to break Voldemort's curse on the job.

I've read one or two fics where Harry is a Hogwarts professor (Hogwarts, to welcome you home is obviously the most famous) but I'm looking for more! I don't really mind the pairing, Drarry/Hinny, whatever doesn't bother me. But preferably post-war EWE and 100% no Snarry or Harry/authority figures.


** My headcanon is that the destruction of the diadem breaks the jinx on the defense position.

My new heavily au story i'm debating will have him as an established professor a la indiana jones but he'll be taking a sabbatical to travel to a new world

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.

  After the dissolution of his marriage and a good bit of soul-searching, Harry returns to Hogwarts as the new Defense teacher. Go figure, it happens to be the same year Draco takes over the role of Potions Master. Neither man is happy about this turn of events. Will they be able to set aside their differences and learn a thing or two about trust and humility on the way? (Spoiler Alert: Yes. Very much so.)
