I'm pretty sure this was a one-shot. Ron basically tells Harry that he's miserable working there, but that he feels like leaving would be abandoning him. I think lingering guilt over leaving during the horcrux hunt was mentioned.

Harry reassures him and suggests that George would probably be happy to have him working at his shop.

Does anyone recognize this?

*** I assume you mean in the second chapter? Or rather, the first after the prologue.

If so, then nah this isn't it. Thanks though.
