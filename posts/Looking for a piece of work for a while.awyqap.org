I read a fanfiction a long time ago and have never been able to find it since. I will try to give as many details as I remember. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny went to a summer school that was in a time loop. They were doing months of work during the summer. This meant that during the trial wizard tournament harry was technically of age because of the time spent in the time loop. The only lth thing I remember is all 4 became mages and I believe they made their own wands/staffs

Any help is greatly appreciated


** Is it this?

This author has a series of stories covering pre-Hogwarts, Hogwarts, and post-Hogwarts wherein Harry is protected by an American that Lily and James knew. He arranges for Harry (then Harry & Hermione, then Harry, Hermione and about 12 other people over the years) to attend an American school that uses time dilation during the summers.

Harry is really good at warding. Harry is a wand/staff crafter. Harry takes part in the Tri-Wiz because the time dilation has aged him and he's bound due to his age.
