I love fics with a motivated Harry Potter, where he pushes himself to learn new magic. Unfortunately, most of those feature some combination of Dumbledore bashing, power wank, or an incredibly whiny Indy!harry. I'll take any recommendations but I'd like to avoid those if possible.


** You may consider this one power wank, but it's not Dumbledore bashing or particularly whiny:

** There's no Dumbledore bashing in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), and although Harry has unusually large magical reserves, they are as much of a hindrance as a help; she just wants to brew potions, but being exceptional means that people like Tom Riddle want to manipulate and control her or just outright steal her magic, and her identity ruse is taking more spotlight than she planned for.

She is, however, very pragmatic indeed. Canon Harry was offered Slytherin; this Harry truly belongs there, because she has a goal - learning potions from Professor Snape - and she'll sacrifice whatever it takes to succeed and survive. She has a serious work ethic and is a born planner. Yet her friendships constantly struggle, as she can't fully trust and rely on her friends.

It's quite an original storyline, drawing inspiration from canon but completely reimagining it rather than just retelling it.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** Linkao3(A Journey to Emilio by Supermouse)

I'm offering this because in this story Harry is /very/ motivated to push his magic as far as he can make it go. I don't think it counts as bashing (Dumbledore pressuring Harry to stay with the Dursleys no matter what and being Very Keen to have Harry under his thumb are both canon and he isn't cackling or plotting evil or anything).

If you like the first three chapters or so (they're very short) you will probably like the rest, since it's all in the same style and stays in theme.

  After a few too many hard knocks in early childhood, magic has turned Harry into a tough, twisted, somewhat impaired and very ugly version of himself with a severe speech defect.Magic is also going to help him learn how to kick everybody's backside.(This story has a lot of very short chapters and is posted daily.)
