:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello, I'm looking for a particular fic with Harry/Cho as the main pairing. I think I read it on some obscure website but hoping that it's been reposted.

So the plot follows Harry making 'one' simple decision that leads to a series to major changes.

I think one important outcome I remember is Harry mending his attitude towards Severus Snape and vice versa.

The length is probably around 5k words, and was posted as a single chapter on the original website.

The fic ends with all major characters coming to sit in the main hall for a discussion about the fight against Voldemort iirc.

I can't recall any other pairings and plot points but am desperately searching for it to read it once again. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
