Any fics where Gabrielle is older (16+) and is either the main character or ends up in a relationship with Harry. Please no stories where Gabrielle is under 16 an in a relationship.


** I wrote one where she's, arguably, the main character. She's sixteen at the start, seventeen at the end, and twenty-three in the epilogue.

Linkffn(Vitam Paramus by TheEndless7)

It's also the only story I might write a sequel for.

*** I'm a big fan of most of your stories, but that one was a bit...not sure how to put it. Unfulfilling? It was like KFC without the crispy skin.

Still a story I recommend often.

** I'm working on one, it's far from finished though. Has Gabrielle starting at 16, relationship will be when she's 17 or older.\\
Warning you now it is very likely to take a long time to update, I haven't been writing much lately.

linkffa(1742)

it's a sort of expansion/rewrite of a one shot I did with Gabby at 14, "*Ella*".\\

** There's one where Harry wakes up post DH from a coma after like 8 years. His friends are now busy adulting, while he is still a teen mentally, so his romance with Gabby is age appropriate. Jeconais maybe?
