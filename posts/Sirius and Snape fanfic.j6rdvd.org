Im a really big fan of unlikely duos getting along. Especially if they start off as actively disliking each other. Snape and Sirius being forced to get along maybe on a case for the order or something sounds super entertaining to me. Something very focused on their dynamic and maybe plot .

No real preference for ships beyond no oc x canon character ship. It can be m/f f/f m/m whatever no sex swaps ( aka a male character who identifies as a boy in canon being born a female who identifies as a woman in fic. Like for example Fem Harry. Trans characters dont count as sex swap).

but the focus should be on Sirius and Snape regardless of what the ship is.

No ships is also fine


** I'm reading Swung by Serafim right now and they team up pretty early on

** Sirius and Snape become friends in The Prince of Slytherin if I remember correctly. It's not the focus of the story at all though and is a pretty tiny part when compared to the rest of it.
