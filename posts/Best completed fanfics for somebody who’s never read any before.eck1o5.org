** Keep in mind that different people have completely different tastes in fanfiction and writing. What seems great for one person may not be for another. I know for me I really dislike the black comedy and yet it gets recommended in almost every one of these threads. Same goes for many other fanfics.

If you are interested in reading fanfiction I encourage you to try multiple fics and not give up even if you don't like the ones recommended.

Do you have any characters that you like and want to read more about? How about favorite or least favorite genres (such as adventure, romance, fluff, gritty/dark vs. humorous)? It would be easier to recommend something if you give us more information.

*** Adventure, dark, romance, humorous, probably in that order. Honestly I'd probably just want to stick with Harry and Hermione. I read one fanfic that I absolutely loved, but found out that it was an abandoned project halfway through it (the wizard from earth - time travel/Egyptian story where Harry goes back in time during a vacation to pyramids in Egypt during Auror training and gets stuck there.) I've started reading wind shear and so far I've loved it.

**** check out the Arithmancer series! it's an AU retelling of canon and beyond based on the idea of Hermione being a math genius instead of a bookworm.

** In my opinion, it's Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste and Hermione Granger's Crammer for Delinquents on the Run by waspabi, as they are both very well-written and funny, keep true to character's voices, and have great dialogue. However, seeing your preferences for genres, I think you may want to check out Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider (listed as a crossover, but though I don't know the universe it's crossing and had no trouble understanding it). A Long Journey Home is a long fanfic you may enjoy, but I don't think it's finished.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

It's flawed, but I do think it's a good hook for people with sciency interests like me.

Another one I really enjoyed even though it's a ship I usually have little interest in: The Changeling by Annerb.

linkffn(6919395)

It's so rare to see a story from Ginny's perspective that makes Ginny into an actual character, with solid writing, original worldbuilding... I think that might be a good introduction too, for someone who's not particularly into the HP fandom.
