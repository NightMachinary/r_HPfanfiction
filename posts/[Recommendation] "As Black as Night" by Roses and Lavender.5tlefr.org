I just finished this fic and I have only one reaction. Wow. The fic is the best HP fic that has to do with lords, ladies, and an OC that I've ever read. I really can't find any fault with it. It's a perfect blend of humor, action, and drama. The fact that the fic has less than 400 favorites makes me sad. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys OC's, family politics, and canon characters that aren't OOC. linkffn(7936530)


** I just read this one. The humour's on point, the prose is readable and the characters are interesting.

But. It is inexcusably long and repetitive. The first three years are as wordy as the originals (without nearly as much content as PS+CoS+PoA); it takes a further 100K words and 52 chapters to get to the /Yule ball/. The author tries to make this a 'family drama', so the fic is filled with pointless little scenes following Druella Black or the Tonkses. And just how many times do we need to know that Maia is loyal to her family? Or that she's bad at transfiguration?

Cassiopeia Black is the shining star of the fic. She's no-nonsense, hard-hitting and even has character development! Thanks to her, the end of second year is perhaps the fic's strongest part.

It's a good fic (one that I enjoyed and finished), but it could use some serious belt-tightening.

*** Reading over this comment, I find myself agreeing with your points. They didn't really occur to me when I was reading it, but they make sense

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

** I put this down at chapter 61 and don't remember a damn thing about it. I was probably enjoying it to get to 61, but it's, like, gone, man...

** I'm way too pedantic, I know; but how can someone write a hundred chapters -- a quarter of a million words! and STILL not know how to format dialogue?

** Just finished it and the abandoned(?) sequel. It was good even if a little self-indulgent with itself at times. The pacing is rather slow but it was a good read purely for the great character growth shown by so many of the characters throughout the story which is a great change from the majority of fanfictions out there.

Cheers for the rec
