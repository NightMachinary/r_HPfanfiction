Hey! I was wondering if anybody knows where I can get ahold of a pdf of "The Death of Narcissa Black" by massicot. I've seen mention of it circulating after the original and the linked pdf were both taken down.

Thanks a bunch!


** Same as you, I've seen that mentioned on the FanLore wiki. However, the 1hr+ of searching I have tried yields no results, which is surprising. Perhaps some IRC channels or other chatrooms will be able to further help you. If you do find it, please upload the PDF to a public host -- all this searching has made me even more anxious to read it!

** I've also been searching for days! I've seen people mention having it on failfandomanon threads, but all the links seem to be down. You could try asking there though.
