So, I made a post, I think, earlier back when I promoted my first Harry Potter fic, and I got a bit of shit from it because of my summary (lol) and some of my first chapter. Not to say that the criticism wasn't warranted, but I still took another shot at making it better. Here's the old one:

He didn't know. He didn't know how wretched his parentage was. He didn't know that he carried the blood of a founding member of the greatest school. He didn't know. But when a familiar elderly man tries to rectify the mistake he had caused all those years ago, will he succeed? Or will he unleash another Dark Lord onto the wizarding world? Pairing: you'll find out. OC as the main.

Here's the current one:

Hidden away from a world that would've hated him, Theodore Riddle had but remnants from his past; bare pieces that would teach him his own wretched story. Clinging onto the vestige of his innocence, he tries so hard not to succumb to the Dark Lord's influence; he tries to keep his loyalty to Dumbledore and his friends... but a boy can never run from his own father. Gets darker. OC.

I was just wondering if there needs to be improvement on either of these summaries since I was told that the first one would be an absolute turnoff and would cause the reader to close their tab instantly. Thanks in advance.


** The new summary is loads better... Like almost unmeasurably so. The first one is trash.

I think the last sentence is a bit loaded and weird:

#+begin_quote
  he tries to keep his loyalty to Dumbledore and his friends... but a boy can never run from his own father. Gets darker.
#+end_quote

"Gets darker" should be replaced with "Dark fic" if you think this kind of content warning is necessary.

The part about Dumbledore and his friends (Theodore's friends? Or Dumbledore's?) can create intrigue, but it feels out of place.

*** I'd just get rid of the second semicolon and the bit after:

#+begin_quote
  Clinging onto the vestige of his innocence, he tries so hard not to succumb to the Dark Lord's influence... but a boy can never run from his own father.
#+end_quote

**** Yeah, I'm sure people could already tell that it's going to be an OC centric story. Thanks for the tip.

*** I thought that the old one was bad. I got ripped a new one when I first promoted my fic lol. I can see where you're getting at with “Dumbledore and his friends”, but the reason I wrote “Gets Darker” is because it's not considered a Dark fic so far. I haven't even reached that stage yet (all about the buildup you know?). But I'm glad to see that my new summary was taken well.

** The first wouldn't even get as far as opening a tab, I would have passed it by completely without a second thought. The new one is mildly intriguing, and if I was in the mood for an OC fic at the time would probably get a click.
