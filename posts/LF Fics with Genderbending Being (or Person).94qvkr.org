Im curious if such exist. So Fics that have a Being (or a Person), that can change its Gender anytime and has the Ability to charm those People around it. So even those who are Hetero or Homosexual are attracted by it, despite their sexual orientation.

Would be good if it contains some smut.


** In Vance McGill's stories, the metamorphmagi are actually part of a third gender. I've read Harry Potter: Neko's Mate and Rose Lily Potter: Metamorphmagus-Who-Lived by him, and both are pretty good. Although, if you're wanting someone changing their gender often, I'd go with the first over the second.
