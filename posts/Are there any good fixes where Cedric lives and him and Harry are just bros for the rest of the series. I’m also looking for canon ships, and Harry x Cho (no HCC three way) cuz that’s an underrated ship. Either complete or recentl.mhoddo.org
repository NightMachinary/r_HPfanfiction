#+TITLE: Are there any good fixes where Cedric lives and him and Harry are just bros for the rest of the series. I’m also looking for canon ships, and Harry x Cho (no HCC three way) cuz that’s an underrated ship. Either complete or recently updated.

** Not Cedric living but Harry/Cho... it's a pre-HBP series covering books 6, 7 and the year after.

  Warning OotP Spoilers. Harry starts his sixth year at Hogwarts, but he's in for some surprises. He's going to learn the true story of his parents and learn to deal with loss. There might be a little romance and adventure. Related to my JL fic. Complete!
