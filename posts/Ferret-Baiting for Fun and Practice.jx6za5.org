This idea was inspired by a bit from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Tried), a fic spawned from this sub:

  She gaped "That was you? But Malfoy shot first. And he was in the hospital for a week."

  Harry grinned, and Daphne thought she should be scared because it was definitely not kind, nor merely mischievous, but she wasn't, instead, she smiled back before she could stop herself.

  "For all his talk, Malfoy is incredibly easy to rile up, sometimes all I have to is pass him by the corridor without acknowledging him, or just dismiss him outright when he starts spewing his nonsense."

My idea is that Harry is repeatedly and deliberately baiting Malfoy into starting fights only to trounce the ferret and his shaved gorillas in increasingly amusing and/or humiliating ways. Reasons for this could include getting a bit of extra dueling practice, getting to try out some spells he's not eager to practice on his friends, keeping Draco busy for whatever reason, or even just for his own amusement and to see if the lesson will ever stick. More amusingly, maybe Narcissa has secretly hired Harry to do it as a way of teaching her son a bit of humility, restraint, and self-control, or at least sharpen his dueling skills if that fails.

  Daphne is locked in a marriage contract with Harry Potter, but she doesn't want any marriage contract, she wants the freedom to choose her husband, and the only way out is by killing him, so she tries, but Harry wasn't called the Boy Who Lived for nothing. Oneshot.
