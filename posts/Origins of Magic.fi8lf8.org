So, we haven't had a good 'Where does magic come from' thread in a while. I'm curious - are there any new ideas or headcanons floating about? Or just any cool old ones that you've been persuaded toward/recently integrated into your headcanon? Or even just any new spins on or additions to those old ideas?

When I say 'where does magic come from', I mean originally. Like, what happened to bring magic into the world and onto Earth to start with. Can follow that along into a current source of magic if you like (eg. magic originated when humans banged magical creatures and is currently permitted by genetics and biology giving Rowling-Magicals the ability to channel magic into spells) but that's only if you wanna.


** I believe magic itself has no origin, it is simply a facet of the universe, a infinite roiling undercurrent of metaphysical power. Occasionally, rarely, new species would arise that mutate the ability to access that energy. It was even used in pre-Sapiens times by rare individuals in other human species.

But it was Sapiens that was the first human species to be /entirely/ magically capable, and it was for this reason that we became dominant. Most of the forty five thousand years of Sapiens history we know nothing about was various magical civilisations that would rise, and fall.

It would not be until the Atlantis Cataclysm that most humans were robbed of their magic, creating Muggle Homo Sapiens for the first time. This is the reason why Muggleborns exist - they are the rare returns to the natural state, rather than mutants themselves.

*** That's a nice idea. A sort of natural force, like gravity, but manipulated by specific types of people who are possess of some gene or gland or whatever. Does make magicals a little close to X-Men style mutants, but that could appeal to some more. :)

What would this Atlantis Cataclysm look like in your headcanon? Or is it something you've taken from another source? Basically, 'that sounds interesting, please do elaborate'. :D

**** The Atlantis Cataclysm has been alluded to in a few fanfics previously, most notably in Heartlands of Time. I've sort of lifted a few ideas from each and smushed them together with my own notions.

The rise of the Atlantean civilisation coincided with the extinction of the last remaining bastions of High-Elf civilisation, which have no relation to the House Elves of today (which are twisted descendants of Brownies originating far later, warped by Dark magic).

Their nation reached its peak around about 7000-5000BCE. A place where magic and technology worked as one to create wonders. Picture something akin to Asgard from the MCU, but spread out across the breadth of the earth. They could do things with magic that would make even the most powerful sorcerors today fall to their knees in awe.

Fiendfyre was invented by them, as was the Killing Curse and the Patronus charm, though they would only be rediscovered millennia later.

The collapse of Atlantis was the origin of Muggles, and it was as sudden as it was complete.

It came not by a superweapon, or an all-consuming war. I've always been amused by the notion that the end of the world would not come from some great conflict, but seconds after some scientist said “huh, that's weird.”

In an instant, every living homo sapiens on Earth lost their ability to use magic. Their civilisation, so utterly dependent on magic, collapsed in a matter of days. It would be like if every muggle today went blind and deaf, and lost the ability to operate electronic devices at the same time. Mankind entered a dark age that would last at least fifteen hundred years. Strictly speaking, we're still in it.

Slowly, over centuries, wizards began to reappear. A unique form of atavism, somehow overcoming whatever exactly had been done to our species that prevented us from accessing our birthright. By the time wizards had begun to build a sufficient population to start unwinding the nature of magic again, Atlantis's legacy was all but wiped away by the sands of time.

***** Ah, Heartlands. I keep hearing that it's terrible so I've never actually sat down and read it. If it talks about this, then I might have to give it a try anyway. I'm a sucker for interesting worldbuilding Lore, no matter how shit the actual story is.

I've not seen anything in the MCU, not a big superhero fan outside of the Logan movie, but I think I can get the general idea. It's a very Science-Fantasy realm of "I'm florbling the phlobotinium to increase the flow to the reactor" sort of a deal, right?

Yeah, that "Huh, that's weird" moment and the "Next great invention" like the Bliss from Gridlock in Doctor Who are the best End of the World tropes, they really are. :)

I really like that explanation, that's cool. Are there any fics other than Heartlands that go into it?

****** Heartlands of Time has a much different Atlantis backstory, to be fair. It's just what cemented Atlantis as a thing in HP in my head.

** I always liked the idea of some of the gods from greek/roman or Egyptian mythology existing. The humans then got magic when they made some sort of deal with Hecate (godess of magic) or some other diety. It keeps magic mysterious and not easily understandable, but probably I just like it because I have a fascination with anything that has to do with Ancient myth and legends

*** That'd also be a really interesting magical-contract plot to play around with. Early Humans make a deal for magic, then Modern Humans break the deal... Could be fun. :)

Could also find out that the Deal isn't what they thought, or the other party is hiding something/isn't really a deity and is masquerading as one for some reason.

** I don't know why, but I just like the idea of the Conjunction of Spheres from the Witcher series. It just seems right for magic to come from other worlds and would explain why only a small fringe of the earth would have been affected, because it isn't originally native from our world.

*** It'd also make an interesting justification for why the outwardly pointless Astronomy is part of Hogwarts curriculum. If it was actually related to magic in a Lovecraftian Astrology sort of way, then it'd actually make sense to have it as a semi-core subject.

**** But Astronomy isn't really pointless, multiple potions need to brew for moon cycles and some can only be brewed under the full moon's light, the alignment of stars and planets can often affect magical plants during their harvest and some rituals or forms of Divination are dependant of the stars, moons and planets. This is all folklore and mythology, but it fits well with the way magic in Harry Potter works.

** Magic was what started the big bang, magic is everywhere, even Earth itself has magic, and that is what muggles call "mother nature"

at one point in time, all humans and it's predecessors had magic, at another point in time, some modern humans decided to do a huge ritual, this ritual would enslave Earth's magic to humans to use how they wished, the more reasonable and intelligent magicals told them that it was a bad idea, but the ritualists didn't listen, that led to them making a huge mistake, as in, they severely under estimated the amount of magic Earth had, this resulted in the ritual going extremely wrong and those people who participated in the ritual ended up losing their magic, those peoples decendants are known now as muggles.

After the ritual went wrong, they first freaked out, but then they started to hate magicals, they blamed them for their own stupidity and in doing so, made a promise vow on their existence that they wouldn't marry a magical, the magicals in return (everyone) made a magical vow to /never/ marry a muggle.

Squibs are people, who's souls were so dark or partial/broken, it took all their magic to make that soul normal, but it destroyed their magical pathways (they have magic but they can't use it), some generations later their magic fixes their kids pathways and that's where the so called "muggleborns" come from

If you have questions then ask, I really doubt I covered everything about it but that's what I could quickly write down.

*** An interesting idea, Erkki. Kinda reminds me of the Great Ghost Dance in Shadowrun, but the other way around (that increased the amount of magic in the world, not decreased). People fucking themselves up in the name of power or self-improvement is always fun, narratively. :)
