And thus where Luna is not a dreamy loofy girl but a bright cheerful witch.


** Well there is always [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2yjm8z/lf_fic_where_lunas_mother_didnt_die/][Luna's Hubby.]] Harry does save Luna's mom, but she still mostly remains the goofy girl we all know and love.

** I dont see how her mother not dying would make her normal.

** There are a few where someone goes back in time and saves her. I'm trying to think 9f the names of some but coming up blank unfortunately. Ill look through my profile for some though.

if you're into Robst, A Different Halloween has her not die iirc. Likewise, Three Turns by Ellipsa, if it mentions her at all (I don't remember) probably has her live. She plays a pretty big role in Tigerman's After Dark. I dunno, the majority of time travel fics that go back that far and save her because why not? I think reunion by Rorschach does it too.

** I don't like the name JKR gave her. I once read a fic where she was called Sigrid or something like that - what is it?

** Try Fates Gambit by (Robst). It's a two-parter, complete and a good read.
