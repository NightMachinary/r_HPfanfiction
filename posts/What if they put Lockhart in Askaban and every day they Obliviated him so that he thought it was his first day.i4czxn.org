** He'd probably become one of those mad people who Sirius mentioned eventually lost the will to live or stopped eating. There'd be little to no strong memories or convictions to help Lockhart keep his sanity against the negative presence of the Dementors.

Actually, wait, I guess Lockhart wouldn't survive Azkaban either way, whether he was regularly Obliviated or not. He wouldn't have any convictions and firm belief in himself, because he knew he was a fraud (if we're talking pre-brain-damaged Lockhart).

Dementors glory in despair, so irrespective of whether or not Lockhart knows he's been in Azkaban for a long time, he would still know that he's a fraud. And the Dementors would exaggerate Lockhart's hopelessness and insecurities to create a nice little cell of madness, gloom, and despair for their benefit.

However, if we're talking St Mungo's Lockhart, well, he'd go even crazier than usual and regress to the point of just dying somehow. Remember that St Mungo's Lockhart was learning basic things like writing, so how do you think someone like that would cope in Azkaban?

Not much hope for him at all.

** Well, I suppose eventually he'd go insane from the constant obliviation and dementors. Look at what happened to the poor muggle that was obliviated so many times and Sirius.

Not sure why they'd put him in Azkaban and obliviate him as well. Azkaban's unethical enough already.

** Hear me out , he gets a condition like the one in fifty first dates and doesn't have to obliviated.

Since his brain basically rests everyday he isn't overly effected by the dementors.

** They wouldn't even necessarily have to.

We only see him for a few minutes after he gets mindwiped, who says it didn't damage his ability to form new memories as well?
