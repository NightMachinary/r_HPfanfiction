I would prefer it if someone else is helping her recover. Please no dramione, or intergenerational ships (eg. snamione etc.). No bashing please. I'm fine het or femslash.

Edit: And also genfics.


** What about “[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2072&chapno=1][Say it with Socks by St. Margarets]]”, which is the parallel story to “Red Is The Heart by St Margarets” linksiye(2902), which is a sequel to number of stories starting with “Wallpaper Moments by St Margarets” linksiye(2036)? All of them very much worthy of reading.

#+begin_quote
  "In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you." Harry begins to understand the truth of this statement as he learns valuable lessons in love, friendship, and choices during his sixth year. A fluffy H/G tale of adventure. A sequel to the "Wallpaper" trilogy. (Read that first.)

*** Hello. I'm interested in reading but the link for Say it with Socks isn't working. Do you know of any other copies?

Edit: Never mind. I found a copy. The story is gorgeous. Thank you so much for recommending it.
