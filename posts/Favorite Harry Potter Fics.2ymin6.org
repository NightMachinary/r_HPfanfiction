So there was recently a post asking for your favorite fics but it had some requirements I didnt like. So if you could it would be great if you could post your favorite fics that are a. Over a hundred thousand words. b. Complete. And thats about it. There can be any pairing slash or not. Preferably no angst but really I dont care. My goal is to read every fic thats posted


** My Favorites :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] by Mira Mirth : This is /the/ Slytherin Harry AU. Excellently written and beautifully characterized. Each chapter is better than the last and it seems to get better on every reread -- I've read the 5th and 6th years of this story at least a dozen times. If you haven't read this story, stop whatever the fuck you're doing and start reading. WIP.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Trilogy]] by Shezza : Dark!Harry. Slight crossover with Dresden Files. The Fallen angel Meciel gives seven year old Harry a chance to escape the Dursleys and be powerful. Great Asshole Harry and excellent action scenes. Also, best Dumbledore characterization ever. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]] by Sanction : Epic LOTR-esque journey. Harry, Moody and his mercenary nephew go on a quest to retrieve a weapon for Voldemort's downfall. Best characterized OCs /ever/. There are lots of twists and turns and major character deaths, but it never goes into grimdark territory. Story's major arc complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2973799/1/Equal-and-Opposite][Equal and Opposite]] by Amerision : Easily the best 'Harry goes Dark' fic and revenge fic I've ever read. Harry meets his evil female self from another dimension, who intentionally seduces Harry and then leaves him, leaving Harry's life in shambles. Great twisted relationship between Harry and his female self. Harry's fall into darkness and madness is beautifully depicted. Slightly short, but complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][The Wendell that Wasn't]] by Opalish : Crack One-shot. Snape's ghost haunts the Potter family. This is some of the most hilarious stuff I've ever read.

Other good ones -- /Cauterize/ by Lady Altair, /Boy Who Lived/ by Santi, /Wastelands of Time/ by Joe, /Clash/ by shez, /Song of the Trees/ by Tinn Tam, /Resistance of Azkaban/ by Shezza, /The Very Secret Diary/ by Arabella, /Anything but Slytherin/ by IP82

Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

**** Its a genuinely unique fic that keeps you entertained the entire time. Joe is a published author so his works tend to be of a higher quality i.e. spellchecked with a coherent plot.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]] by Inverarity is the first book in a series about a young American witch with a terrible destiny. There's four books so far, supposed to be seven in the series, and it is absolutely amazing...almost professional quality. Needs way more credit than it gets. Darker plot than the HP series, but still just as fun.
