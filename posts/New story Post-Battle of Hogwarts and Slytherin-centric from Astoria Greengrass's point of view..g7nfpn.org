I am excited for this story. I have long felt that Slytherin was always given the shortest stick, and I wanted to change that. So here begins Astoria Greengrass's sixth year, after the Battle of Hogwarts, and all the challenges Slytherin House might face. Thanks for taking a look!

  Astoria Greengrass returns to a rebuilt Hogwarts but knows her House is dying. Or, the one where Slytherin's reputation was ruined after the Battle of Hogwarts and the students are left to fend for themselves. But Slytherins are resourceful and look after their own, especially when adults won't.

  Tags will be updated as the story progresses. All errors are my own.

** Mistress Pony has written a new story? I absolutely loved the Wand Shop story you wrote. I'm sure I'll love this one as well.
