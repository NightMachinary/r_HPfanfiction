Maybe an odd question but it seems to me that bad looking individuals are a rarity in the Wizarding World, my theory is that they have better beauty products thanks to potion or maybe it has to do with magic they have maybe they don't get stuff like acne etc. Do you believe it has something to do with magic or only that J.K Rowling did not want to write unattractive characters? i mean they can shrink to big teeth and have potion for hair that can tame even Hermione hair where she herself said she tried everything but then the potion for hair developt by Harrys grandfather is able to do it.


** Three words: Crabbe and Goyle

Also, the Midgen girl has serious skin issues while Parkinson, Snape and Bulstrode are described ugly as well.

Lastly, there isn't a single mention that Malfoy or Ron are attractive. That is just the actors.

******** Or perhaps /because/ of cosmetic spells...

Now I have this notion that Tom Riddle was a fine lad and growing into a decent wizard who was maybe too enamored of his own good looks. Confronted by an unacceptable blemish on his nose, he cribbed one of those fashion spells from a senior Slytherin, only to have it remove his nose entirely!

He constructed a replacement that matched his original just perfectly, but it tended to lose cohesion over weeks, due to the lingering effect of the curse that removed the original. In his desperation for a cure, he searched deeper into forbidden texts, finally coming to the conclusion that this sort of thing had been incurable since Biblical times (leprosy, that is). His only recourse was to change his persona so that being noseless made sense and was done on purpose.

If only that Slytherin hadn't played a prank on him, so many might not have lived in fear, died too soon.

The biggest danger in human transfiguration is getting stuck. Which is not as much concern in cosmetic transfiguration. Then there is the fact that the Weasley twins invented Canary Creams - a 'safe' human transfiguration - before taking any NEWT level courses and nobody batted an eye at that. Hagrid gave Dudley a pig's tail, another person doing human transfiguration without having done his NEWTS.

Also notice that those courses are more concerned with full-body and non-human transfiguration, states where you may lose connection to your magic and the ability to return to your normal body if you don't know enough.

In conclusion, in context of cosmetic transfiguration the dangers are overstated and people are irresponsible enough to try transfiguring themselves and eqach other regardless of what the Hogwarts curriculum says.

That is besides the point. The issue isn't desire, but whether or not they can actually do it. And from canon, we know not everyone can, e.g. Neville.

It's not just getting stuck, there's the issue of even getting the change correct in the first place, which (contrary to what you said) is dangerous when making cosmetic changes to the human body. Imagine trying to correct your jawline (that is, altering the bone structure in your face) and screwing it up even a little. Say you take away too much bone and your jaw breaks when you try to talk? Or you need to reorient the positioning of the bone and you cause it to poke right out of your face? That's a real possibility if you can't even get into NEWT Transfiguration, and to undo the damage you couldn't simply Untransfigure it, you'd need a medic wizard.

The twins were described as talented (by Hermione), but not academically inclined, and would have been rather motivated to study and work ahead of their coursework where it concerned their future employment. This a completely different scenario than the "getting tips from friends" scenario you gave before. And the Hagrid example really doesn't work for you. His attempt almost completely failed and produced a small, unobtrusive effect. Cosmetic alterations can have much more invasive effects and correspondingly require a much more delicate and detailed alteration so that the change doesn't negatively affect the body afterward.

The twins were talented - they INVENTED spells and spell-effects. This is not what we are talking about. We are talking people using pre-designed magic. Which requires next to no talent.

Neville's 'problems' in Transfigurations are, as stated by the professor, due to his lack of confidence.

That's clearly false, otherwise transfiguration wouldn't be such a hard branch of magic (which it is). Learning spells takes talent too, otherwise everyone would be Hermione. I'm not even sure it's true that the twins were inventing spells as opposed to using created spells as part of commercial products. We know at least some of the spells were standard spells (e.g. the Shield Charms applied to hats) so there's more evidence to suggest they were applying known spells to objects and creating know spell effects.

Neville's problems in Transfiguration were never said to simply be about confidence (that's more likely to be true in Potions), he just couldn't do the coursework adequately to move beyond OWL. That's why McGonagall told him to go with what he wanted to do, not what his grandmother wanted.

There's no reason to think Hagrid could have properly performed the spell with a proper wand and there's every reason to think he couldn't (he was expelled as a 3rd year).

Bullshit! It is not immediately fatal, it is easily undone by a professional and professionals to do it are easily available. This means, like with various other magic we've seen, there is little to no consequence to failure and no incentive to avoid it. We've seen more than enough examples of what wizards will do in such a situation.

*********** That's like saying "Because professionals can undo splinching, there's no incentive to avoid it", even though we know that's exactly why Apparition isn't as preferred as a Portkey in many cases. A number of wizards don't even have the talent or knowledge (education) to do this at all. And having bones sticking out your face, or messing up your eyes from attempting to modify the shape of your eyeline, or what have you, are pretty big consequences.

Think about it like this. Even something as small as removing pimples from their face led at least 1 fourth year to try and curse them off. Not transfigured them away, but just knock them off. McGonagall's solution was to just use the appropriate potion.

According to Mr. Weasley, a lot of adult wizards don't even bother with Apparition. It's exactly the right conclusion: If Human Transfiguration requires a lot of talent and education (it does), then it's not something you can do well unless you are taught it. So it's not something you can just pick up with a few pointers from friends over lunch, otherwise no one would bother with NEWT Transfiguration requirements for jobs like Aurors.

This is just non-canon. Mr. Weasley (in GoF) says that it's the /danger/ of apparition that makes many adult wizards not use it at all, to the point where they prefer brooms over it. Losing body parts hurts. The issue is pain and danger, not just time lost. And that many wizards are OK with using brooms over Apparition, it's simply a fact that time lost is not the real issue, since brooms are much slower.

** I assume magicals and muggles are both born human. They physically have the same parts as any other human species. Think of Merope Gaunt. She was born with physical defects because of so much inbreeding. Tom Riddle Senior was described as incredibly handsome which is where Tom Riddle Jr got his looks. So physical looks are just depended on genes and what someone in their own opinion finds attractive. Magic is just another thing a person either inherits or not. Not every witch or wizard is a veela so to speak. They have a choice on whether they want to ‘enhance' their appearance or not like every other human being.

** I think you may be interpreting descriptions of people very differently than I do. Rowling often uses very simple, but consistent descriptions. But peopel are rarely explicitly described as handsome or ugly. Tom Riddle is described as handsome, and Harry has a liking for girls with sleek, long hair, so those are described as pretty. And Sirius and Bellatrix come both used to be handsome/beautiful. But otherwise not so much.

Mostly we get (paraphrasing some):

Scrawny, with knobbly knees

Pale, pointed face

Bushy hair and large front teeth

Gangly and freckled with a long nose

Glasses that amplify eyes and make her look like a large insect

Face like a toad

Greasy hair and sallow skin

Toothless grin

Face covered in scars, with a gash for a mouth and two different sized eyes

A mass of dark hair, with beetle black eyes

Duckfooted and hunched shoulders

Face like a pug

Gorilla arms and piggy eyes

** Thinking about this, it occurred to me that the standards of beauty shift from culture to culture and over periods of time. Back when being overweight meant you weren't starving and/or working from dawn to dusk like the average plebe, a beautiful woman would be the one who was rounded and full-figured. In our time, when being overweight is more common among the common, having the drive and extra time necessary to maintain a fit and slim body are hallmarks of modern beauty.

So what does that mean for the wizarding world? As many have mentioned, magic has the capacity to change appearance drastically, yet there are plenty of prominent people who aren't noted for their beauty. Given that unnatural beauty is often associated with being false or enchanted, the valued and prominent person would have a natural and unassuming appearance. In fact the culture is guided by the Statute of Secrecy, so the best wizards and witches would be the ones so plain as to blend in with muggles.

The other prominent feature of the best of wizardkind is age; nearly everyone in the Wizengamot appeared to be well past the age of maturity, and the most powerful and influential were over a hundred. It may be the case that the Professors at Hogwarts deliberately age their appearance in order to command greater respect from their students.
