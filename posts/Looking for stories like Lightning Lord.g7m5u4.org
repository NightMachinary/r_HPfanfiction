Hey,

I am looking for some stories similar to Harry Potter and the Lightning Lord - or maybe also like Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament.To be precise, stories where Harry gets /independent, starts learning powerful magic,/ and /stops playing by the rules/ imposed by others such as Dumbles. I don't care for Romance as long it is not the main theme of the story.\\
Yeah, the two stories I mentioned had a lot of romancing, but I prefer stories that focus on Harry and his path to power :) I also like time-travel stories like 'Time to Put Your Galleon Where Your Mouth Is'...

What I don't look after:\\
-Harem stories with too many smut scenes.\\
-Gay Romance (Not that I am homophobic, but most I have read so far feel damn forced what just made it an awkward experience. 'Again and Again' was the only one I liked so far)\\
-no HarryXGinny or HarryXSusan stories (I don't like Ginny, and Susan is a Hypocrite in my eyes - like all Huffpuffs)

I hope there will be a story I haven't read yet ^^

Thanks!

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
