** While I would love the story to be completed I'd much rather see authors doing what they love rather than fighting a story to get it done. I personally wish her good luck and thanked her for updating us.

*** I'm confused, she used the update to tell readers to fund her gofundme, and didn't even put her story up for adoption despite saying she's never going to finish it. I know literally nothing about the author but this is a terrible first impression.

**** *shrug* she didn't say it wasn't up for adoption. I figure if it's acknowledged to be abandoned it's free for all.

****** It's a fanfiction. you can do whatever you want. It's not like it there's copy rights. If it bothers you that much you can take it up with them.

****** From the author's profile:

#+begin_quote
  P.S. I have read every single review I have gotten, even since I stopped updating. I grateful for them all and I haven't forgotten you guys, but thoughts of Cameron, Cassidy, and Kit have taken my attention away from Harry, Hermione, and Tonks. I don't think I'll ever make my way back to HPCOC but I'm not quite ready to call it abandoned. *If anyone wants to take the story and run with it they are more than welcome ask, just PM me a link so I can read it too*.

*** Over two years, but it still comes up as a recommended story for HP/NT.

** Does this get better? My test for these kinda of fics goes sort of like this:

5 - (no of years it takes Harry to set Sirius free).

After the first chapter this story is tentatively at -5, with all signs pointing to it becoming far worse.

Ps. Just added a "fuck this" for a sort of sexual situation with an 11 year old Tonks.
