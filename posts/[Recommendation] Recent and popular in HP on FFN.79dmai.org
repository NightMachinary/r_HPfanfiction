A digest of stuff that started at most a year ago and has 4x favourites to days running.

Fics are sorted on best Favs/days ratio so there are a few recent whole fic dumps at the top.

These are somewhat different than Scryer's "recent" filter

** It is almost depressing how so many fics from this list are weasley/ Dumbledore bashing, cannon re-hash harem fics.... I had hopped those particular trends had died down somewhat. Alas, there are a few that look pretty cool in this list. Thanks for posting it OP! ( searching by most Favorited in the last year is a pretty good idea.)

*** I actually agree about Daft Morons. There's a lot, but it's not very interesting. It also suffers from logic flaws and when I PM'd the author for an expanation I was ignored so I decided to just drop it.

Heroes Assemble is decent, but it's more of a Marvel fic.

Game On 3.0 is good, but it's a continuation of quite long dimension jumping fic that barely remembers that it is a Harry Potter fic anymore :)

Curses of Interest is completely AU and Naruto cross of FemPotter basically foced into becoming a djinni but I quite liked it.

Haven't had the time to check the others so far.

**** I like Curses of Interest. I'm glad Tsume Yuki started that fem!Harry Djinn trend. It's produced some fun fics.

** Which ones aren't Weasley/Dumbledore bashing? Don't want to waste the time to look.

Why is that still a thing? You'd think the bashing would get old and people would want to do something different with the characters.
