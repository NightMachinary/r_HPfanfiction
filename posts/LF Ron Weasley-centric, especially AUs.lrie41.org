I'm aware of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/red-hair-green-tie-hp.334067/][Red Hair, Green Tie]], but not much else.

Searching for Ron in the tags on Ao3 leads to a depressing amount of "...and Ron was there, too"-type stories.

I don't have any pairing requirements or anything like that.


** Oh boy this is my time to shine

Trompe L'œil by Anonymous: The story is basically an Au where Ron gets Tom riddles diary after the whole chamber incident. Status not complete. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26759686/chapters/65280652]]

Singing, Crying, Laughing, and Fighting by IlliterateJanitor: An au where Ron weasley gets a job over the summer, it's not complete [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16449143/chapters/38517737]]

How to steal Magical Britain by gingerbridge: It's a golden trio fanfiction but each character plays an impotant role. Status, not complete, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24347173/chapters/58709953]]

How to Succeed in Dark Wizardry (Without Really Trying) by technically_direct: Its a crack fic where Ron weasley tries to become a dark lord, Ngl it kinda gets boring. Status not complete. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25787359/chapters/62633206]]

Choices by random-fruitcake04: Really good story, one of my favorites, its basically an au where Ron is a seer and gets sorted into slytherin. Status not complete. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/Choices]]

There and back again by Chuchi Otaku: An au where Ron dies instead of Fred during the final battle, he gets a second chance to redo everything. Also one of my favorite hp fanfiction. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11598532/1/There-and-Back-Again]]

Sadly there aren't much more Ron Weasley fanfictions, which really sucks cause he's such an interesting character.

** Ron's a major character in many of my stories - all of them AUs. You might like "The Granger Principle", where an AU Ron's the POV character - it's not a muggle AU story, despite how it might appear at first glance. You might also like "The Dark Lord Never Died".
