** "My lord! What happened! All we saw was a flash of light where you stood, and now your robes have changed?"

Albus looks down at the cowering group of robed wizards. All of them, to the last, have a branding upon their forehead - a phoenix, stretching its wings.

/Oh dear./

*** Those type of stories are very popular, I just kind of wanted a Dumbledore one instead.

Since it's normally Harry, Hermione or sometimes Ron too.

**** Is that the one where Dumbledore has Fawkes trapped in some sort of ritual where Dumbledore uses the revival abilities of a Phoenix to restore his youth every 20-30 years?

***** I think that's the one where both Harry and Ginny go, and Molly Weasley runs some sort of reconditioning mansion and Harry has to rescue her. That's most of the main stuff I remember.

** I'm pretty sure there's one called " the next great adventure" where good!Dumbledore replaces an evil!manipulative!Dumbledore, but a quick search revealed approximately a million fics with that title and I'm not willing to delve to find the right one. I remember it being a solid fic that went through the events of PS/SS.

#+begin_quote
  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.
