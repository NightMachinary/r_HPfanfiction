What were members of the House of Black doing while Sirius was in jail, Regulus disappeared and Voldemort defeated. Half of the family was alive by the time Harry was doing his fifth year? But we never hear or see them? So where are they?

For instance;

- Lucretia Prewett (née Black) died in 1992, aged 67. Paternal aunt to Sirius
- Arcturus Black died in 1991, aged 90. The grandfather of Sirius and Head of the Family.
- Cassiopeia Black died in 1992, aged 77. Sirius's Grandaunt
- Pollux Black died in 1990, aged 78. The grandfather of Sirius
- Cygnus Black died in 1992, aged 54. He's the father of Bellatrix, Narcissa and Andromeda.

Am I curious as to why the rest of the House of Black would just sit while their family name is dying out? Shouldn't they at least tried to get Sirius out of jail?


** None of the living Blacks had any reason to help Sirius (or at least try to), and even if they did, it's not like they could do anything.

It's something that is often ignored in fanfics, but despite their "difficult" relation, it's not Walburga (or any other Black) who banished Sirius from the family. He left on his own accord and the "burning of his name" was merely the reaction of Walburga against this insult. Sirius was dead from the family the moment he ran away, and judging by how prideful the family was (according to Sirius), nothing would have ever changed their mind. Better see the family die rather than leave it in the hand of a traitor.

Now, even if one of the Blacks decided that he wanted to help Sirius (he was exposed as a Death Eater after all, so he must follow the family values), just what could that person do?In 1981, the Black Family doesn't have anyone in position of authority in the Ministry (at least to our knowledge), and no matter how many goodwill they had before the war, it is now gone ("Hello, I'm related to 2 of the worst follower of the Dark Lord" is not a good ice breaker). Their closest contact in the Ministry seem to be Crouch Sr (a distant cousin). But since the man threw his own son in Azkaban, it's not like anything could be expected from his side.

And, I'll ask once again, but why bother? After his arrest, the case against Sirius is strong. So strong that, despite his cousin being caught red handed torturing the Longbottoms, he still seems more guilty than her.Nobody bothered to ask a trial for Sirius because, unless you managed to make Pettigrew appear in front of the court to admit his faults, the only conclusion for a trial would be a very quick vote from the Wizengamot, and Sirius being sent back to Azkaban for life, unless the Ministry decided to use this occasion to "truly" punish Voldemort right hand man and made him Kissed.

​

The Blacks didn't want to save Sirius because even trying would cost a lot of ressource they didn't have, for someone they didn't like or care about, and it was pretty much assured that anything they tried would not arrange Sirius situation /at best/.

** I'm curious as to who is killing off the members of the House of Black. These wizards and witches should be living much longer than that. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Armando_Dippet][Armando Dippet died in 1992 at 355 years of age.]] So even Arcturus living until 90 is a very short lived wizard.

Did the inbreeding get to them? Was it an enemy of the House of Black? Was it their close association with the Dark Arts?

*** I've always thought of it as an indirect result of the Blacks' violent tempers (exacerbated by the use of the Dark Arts), propensity for radical choices, and likely some in-house conflicts, given the divergent political views of the members.

But this is a very intriguing theory: what if another rival family had been systematically eradicating the Blacks, like certain irl prominent families? What if another family had placed a curse on their bloodline so they eventually died out? Granted, the second possibility would be a little hard to achieve given the Blacks' extensive knowledge of the Dark Arts, but not impossible.

*** Not just the Blacks, most of the marauders age adults have dead parents despite them being in their thirties. I think they all died of convenient-to-the-plot-itis.

After all James and Lily were 21 when they died and their parents pre deceased them, what are the odds of 2 21 year olds both having no living parents. Now James' parents were supposedly older parents but even then they would probably have been 60s at the oldest.

Lucius Malfoy is canonically in his 40s (forget exact age) his Dad died of dragon pox and slughorn dismisses this with "dragon pox at his age" but if Abraxas went to school with Tom Riddle (I forget if that is canon or fanon) he would have most likely died in his 60s which should be practically middle ages by wizard standards.

It makes sense that wizards live longer than muggles given that accidents and general medical issues can be treated way more effectively than muggles can (e.g. even shattering entire bones is no problem, limbs can be regrown/replaced by fully capable prosthetics), but people do indeed have to die some time.

** Why would they try to get him out? Even if they, for whatever reason, thought he was innocent of what he was put away for, he literally fought for their enemies in the Voldie War and espoused every equality/decent human being thing they would dislike as Pureblood bigots. That kind of thing tends to destroy family bonds, especially among bigots who feel passionately about that sort of thing. Lots of those 'Christian Parents find out child is gay, do /insert terrible thing here/ and proceed to essentially or literally disown them' stories about, so it's a thing that happens IRL too.

Canonically, I don't think we ever have any idea what any of them are doing, beyond some of them holing up in Grimmauld Place and going crazy with the dark magic and traps. Not sure if that was just Walburga or not, but I think it's canon?

If you're asking what they could've done, then it could be literally anything. For all we know, they all fled the country when Regulus/Voldemort died and never came back, or got drunk and went on Strictly Come Dancing and lost, then immersed themselves in a dance studio to practice for the rest of their lives. I don't think we really know enough to take a concrete guess.

Watch any Celebrity Bitch Fight News Phenomenon and you'll see people weighing in on one side or another with incredible vitriol for someone who isn't fully informed in the situation at all. Even if they didn't know, I guarantee they had a guess. That's what people do.

I have no idea what the first generation of Death Eaters did or how long the war lasted. You'd have to ask someone more canon-knowledgeable to reference/guess at that.

I imagine he waited because, despite what Indy Harry fics suggest, even a prodigy schoolchild isn't going to be a match for someone with decades of extra experience. And well, if he was in fact an actually cunning person back then and not the utter moron he was in the book-era, then he'd want to take his time and prepare rather than just graduating and immediately going for it. Especially so if he'd already made his Horcruxes - he's immortal, what does time matter to him? If you think you have forever, you can afford to be patient.

  “I haven't looked at this for years. There's Phineas Nigellus... my great-great-grandfather, see?... least popular Headmaster Hogwarts ever had... and Araminta Mehflua... cousin of my mothers... tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal... and dear Aunt Elladora... she started the family tradition of beheading house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays... of course, any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isn't on here. Maybe that's why Kreacher won't take orders from her - he's supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him -”

The copy of the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/other-canon/bft/][Black family tree]] sold for a charity auction contradicts this in two places:

1. According to the books, Sirius' mother has a cousin called Araminta Mehflua, but she does not appear on the charity tree. The only cousin Sirius' mother has on the charity tree is the son of Charlus and Dorea Potter.

2. There is no Aunt Elladora on the charity tree. There /is/ a Great Great Great Aunt Elladora, but she's listed as dying in 1931 so Sirius would never have known her and so wouldn't really refer to her as "dear" (sarcastic or otherwise), which implies a certain familiarity.

** The out-of-books answer: Nothing, because they aren't there.

You see this principle at work with how the last living (relevant) members all die in 1992 -- this is because PoA begins in 1993, and by then Rowling needed Sirius to be the last member of the Blacks, aside from the Black sisters. Hence, she killed them. But this also answers your question: If they /would/ have done anything of note, Rowling simply would've killed them sooner. So, they aren't there.

One in-book answer: Sirius had broken with the family, so they shrugged and cut their losses.

Whether that makes sense is a somewhat moot question. Whatever the reason, they did nothing, so this is just as good as any. For FF, you can make up anything else, or even change the family and the actions of the remaining Blacks completely.
