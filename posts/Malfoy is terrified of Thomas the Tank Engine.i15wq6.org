One year, a muggleborn brings a Thomas toy that their sibling gave them to remind them of home. The purebloods and magic-raised half-bloods find the train to be.../disturbing./ They're not sure if it's because of the grey corpse-like face or the vacant glassy eyes that seem to follow them. Fred and George, taking note of this, take the few they can find in Arthur's shed during the Christmas hols. Borrowing Harry's cloak and the Marauder's Map, the two will occasionally place a toy wherever Malfoy is. At first, he thinks nothing of it, assuming that one of the mudbloods left their silly toys in the halls or in class. But once they start showing up in his bed, he begins to shudder at the thought of them. By the end of the school year, just the mere mention of one is enough to make him scream like a child.


** Then one day someone gets the bright idea to transfigure the engine of the Hogwarts Express into a life-size replica.

Fred turned his teddy bear into a giant spider mid-hug to get back at Ron for something

Breaking his toy broomstick, as I recall.

I think Ron said he was three, so Fred would have been about five. So it may well have been an accident on Fred's part.

*** No, it doesn't. They pull pranks but they are not intended to be malicious and scar someone for life. Ron's arachnophobia comes from the fact that one of the twins turned Ron's teddy into a spider after Ron broke the twin's toy broom. But they were 3 and 5 respectively so that was unintended magic.

** Then [[https://youtu.be/Q3E7L_RoyTU][this]] starts playing whenever he's alone walking down a corridor. Quietly, at first, then it starts getting louder as a toy Thomas the Tank Engine approaches from behind.
