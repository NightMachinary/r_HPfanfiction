What the title says. A recomendation ( is a character having a secret muggle life and public wizard life. Also add in the cliche of someone finding out about it.


** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) Kinda fits? Edit: apologize, I don't know what I did wrong. Maybe this will work.

*** 100% fits and highly recommend. Harriet/Rigel has multiple worlds to which she presents different faces. The series also does an awesome job expanding Potions into a real part of the magic system.

This is where Percy kept his muggle life completely separate from his wizard life. Basically, Percy is more different from the other Weasleys then they thought. However, this has some dark themes in here that will probably trigger people.
