I'm looking for docs with Hermione (or another character) using alchemy to create jewels. I've read 2 before, one where she pretends they're from the malfoy vault and another where she sells them to muggles (for some reason I remember her using Barclays). The first is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13417462/1/Diamond-Heart]] and I can't remember the second. Any recommendations and/or the name of the second fic would be much appreciated!


** The Arthimancer linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14281440/chapters/32942874]]) has a subplot where Hermione creates diamonds and sells them to Muggles, including a present for the Queen. Specifically [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14367483/chapters/33248481][chapter 27]].

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.
