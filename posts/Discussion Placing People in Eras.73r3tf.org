So I'm sure that I'm not the only one who has read stories where practically everyone that seemed old enough is set in the Marauder's Era, which just isn't believable in the slightest.

Like some people have Molly, Arthur, Fabian, Gideon ect extra in the Marauder's Era, which just isn't true. They are older then them, and I don't see them being at school while the Marauders were.

Same with Lucius Malfoy, there are some stories I've read that have him in third year when the Marauder's are in first, and I'm like wait; that's not right. Lucius was either in 5th or 7th year by the time they started because I remember him having a badge (although I can't remember if it was from the books or movie) and he was either a Head Boy or Perfect by the time the Marauders were at Hogwarts. Also I looked and I believe he was a 7th year when the Marauders started.

So I thought we could help each other out and make it believable enough to where everyone is at. Some people are obviously older then the Marauders, and some are younger. I think it would just be nice to help each other out, because when I see like twenty plus people in a Marauder's story that shouldn't be in their seven years at Hogwarts I just stop reading because it's unbelievable in my opinion.

For instance I personally (my own headcanon here) have Frank and Alice as a few years older than James and Lily, that way they aren't exactly the same age/year and little stuff like that.

How do other people think characters like Umbridge, Fudge, Lockhart, Skeeter, Trelawney ect extra is all in.

So if you have someone and you don't know where to place them then people can talk about it.


** I think a lot of it is just trying to include all the characters at once. I personally always have Lucius in Seventh Year when Snape & the Marauders begin; Narcissa in her Fourth Year around that time, and Andromeda and Bellatrix in their Sixth and Fifth Years, respectively.

People don't think to look this stuff up. They just want to include everybody, you know?

Many young readers do think of all the characters as being "old" or "older" rather than so many years older, so the Marauders era becomes a catch-all for all of these "old" characters, although the timelines don't make sense.

** Umbridge and Skeeter were born around the same year as Bellatrix 1951. I tend to write Alice and Frank at most seventh years when the Marauders started in 1971. I think Fudge might be a year or two older than Molly and Arthur. Trelawney, The Bones and Kingsley maybe the same

** Bellatrix's age is highly suspect: JKR put her birth year in 1951 and her father's in 1938, so you people can see the problem. The author of "Delenda Est" increased her father's birth year to an unspecified date, while pushing back her birth year to 1957/1958. I think this is a much better solution than canon, and it puts all three Black Sisters in school together with the Marauders.

*** I've always regarded Cygnus' birth date as a typo, since it makes sense that he's born in 1928 rather than 1938. And sort of the same for Pollux, I suppose, although a sordid tale about teenage pregnancies and forced marriages to save face doesn't sound too out of place either.

***** She could, but she would still have to be older than Andromeda, since she's on the left of the burn mark in the family tree (according to the fifth book), and Andromeda was probably out of Hogwarts when she had Tonks in 1973 (+11+7(Hogwarts)+3(Auror training)+1(as an Auror)=1995).

If she was born in 1954 or late '53, she could have been a seventh year when MWPP and Lily started Hogwarts.

** Lockhart /is/ canonically four years younger than the marauders, though.

As for Trelawney, she hasn't got a canonical age as far as we know, but to me it makes perfect sense that she's not that old. I imagine her spending a couple of years or two on the dole before the Divination job opening at Hogwarts. (If you want a seer as a medium for your 'word of god', you could use her instead of flanderising Pandora [yet-to-be-]Lovegood.)

Narcissa, if you follow canon, is starting her sixth or fifth year if you follow all canon, but otherwise she just have to be old enough to have Draco in 1980. Andromeda has to at least be a sixth year in 1971, whereas Bellatrix just have to be older than the other two (since her name is to the left in the family tree).

Molly must have graduated in 1969, or 1970 if you're really pushing it. Gideon and Fabian are most likely only a few years younger or older than her, but they /could/ be still at school in the mid-seventies without "breaking" canon.

It's a shame that so few fics are set in that era with the MC being at least a few years ahead of the Marauders. (But after my own attempt, I can see why: it's hard to get a plot going, when all your characters are OCs or "semi-OCs" [like teenage Narcissa Black, Amelia Bones, Kingsley Shackebolt, etc.], and Voldemort is still kinda inactive.)

** Yeah I think Rowling has stated that she isn't good at math, which makes sense why the other characters haven't been given a year that they were born in. And yeah I did say figure people out who are older and younger then the Marauders as well.

I always imagined Trelawney to be younger then the Marauders myself; maybe a year or two younger at the most. Although I suppose it's possible that she was around Bellatrix' age at the most.

There's just so much to debate with the characters. It's really interesting.

Fudge being older then Molly and Arthur makes sense, although how much older is the question here. I say maybe a 5th year by the time Molly and Arthur started Hogwarts?

And I have Fabian and Gideon older then Molly in my headcanon personally. Just the idea of older protective brothers is always fun.

Although I suppose it could be possible that Trelawney could be around Molly and Arthur's Era, we really don't know how old she is.

I tend to have Emmeline Vance in Molly and Arthur's Era. Although I don't know if her age has been stated.

Professor Septima Vector could possibly be around Molly and Arthur's Era, maybe a bit older just depending.

Charity Burbage I see older then the Marauders, although I'm not sure how much older myself.
