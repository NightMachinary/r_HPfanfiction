**** unfortunately just as it sets the stage, so to speak, the author left it unfinished. My hope is that enough positive feedback might tempt the author back.

****** Yeah, that one more or less defines the entire concept of a Sherlock/Harry Potter crossover for me I'm afraid. After reading that one, well, I have not found another that does the concept nearly as well. Leave Ishtar a positive review, and you can join me in hoping that sufficient positive feedback will be an enticement to return.

  This story deals with a version of Harry Potter that is absolutely brilliant, comparable with Sherlock, and what happens when he moves into one of the flats at 221 Baker Street.

** The maybe longest and most famous one (HPMOR) is very unpopular around here, so be careful of what you ask for. It is basically nerd wank. IMHO it did some things very well and was super funny in places, but most of the complaints about it are true, so it depends on your tolerance for those sorts of issues.
