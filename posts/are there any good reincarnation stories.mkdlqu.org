I don't mean crossovers but when an oc from real life dies or other wise gets transported to the harry potter world, as either harry himself or an oc. i've found one i liked but that's kind of it. decided to ask for suggestions thanks.


** The Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe fits your "OC dies and gets transported to HP world". Significant departure from canon, and also lots of "this is different from the books I read back in the real world" moments. linkao3(21500365)

This is extremely well-written with tons of cultural references from the "real" time period of Harry's childhod. Not being a Brit, I spent a fair amount of time on Google after some of the chapters. It also has extensive author's notes about these details---but people who hate excessive author's notes can skip them without affecting the story at all.

Over the course of the story, it veered quite a bit from interactions with Harry. Author was posting as he was writing, and said if he'd planned it out ahead of time that would have been a side story. (Harry hasn't even got his Hogwarts letter yet.) This story is marked complete with a sequel promised, hopefully getting back on track with a Harry-centric plot line.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

** I love OC/reincarnated fanfics from HP world too! Maybe I have read too much fanfic with the usual HP main characters and got sick of it (the rinse and repeat of same plot). However I still love the HP world setting. Be glad if you have any suggestions as well.

Currently following one that is updated everyday. The MC is an OC that is studying in Hogwarts in the same year as Harry Potter and is good friends with Hermione (but not with HP and Ron). The link is here: [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/harry-potter-new-world_19337489706185205]]

** There are a bunch! Few completed though (and thus there are many which I've subscribed to but haven't written down the title of). If you haven't already I recommend looking for collections with SI/OC stories of AO3. Like this one [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/SIOC_Insert_Collection][A Collection of Beloved Inserts]]

A few random recommendations:

this one is gold though it's a oneshot linkao3(8906032)

The first of a series but I think it works as a standalone linkao3(Accio Butterflies by tearlessNevermore)

Ongoing and really good linkao3(Fractured Fairytale by Tsume_Yuki)

This one hasn't updated since 2018, but so still worth a read as it's very well written linkffn(Ottery St Catchpole by Erisah Mae)

And here are some that are like... Adjacent to what you're asking for

Brilliant linkao3(The Potter's Seer by Spellmugwump)

A bit weird very fun linkffn(Tom and Evie by MerhppDerhpp)

  Dropped alone in a world of magic that seems strangely familiar, I must take up arms to save the day-or I could just tell Dumbledore and let him deal with it? Yeah, I prefer that idea. A Harry Potter Self-Insert fic.

  From a tumblr post by accio-shitpost: "i wanna see a muggle who goes stealth among wizards purely by having a ridiculous aesthetic." Zinnia, a bisexual Australian nurse, moves into the home of late Great Aunt who lived near the Weasleys shortly after the events of the Battle of Hogwarts. Molly Weasley decides to be a good neighbour to the new "witch" in town. That's how it starts.
