:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a Fic I have read before but cannot find. I sincerely hope that it hasn't been removed or if it has that it exists on another site. It is a MOD Harry, that is an unspeakable and a group of six that he leads are examining an artifact found in Stonehenge I believe and sends them all into the past. Its a Harry/Ginny fic with her being on of the six and the Twins are also a part. I can't remember the others but I think Neville and Luna are part of the group. Eventually the group is ambushed in Hogwarts by one of the current head unspeakables and her group. I'm pretty sure she is called Shadow and she trained Harry before she died. Really liked this fic and am currently on a rereading binge. Please help me find this fic!

Although, calling it now, that sort of title sounds /super/ common so it'll probably be a tossup if the bot picks the right one.

EDIT: Yeah, it didn't. Let me see if I can trigger a refresh on the bot.\\
EDIT 2 THE EDITING: That's the one.

  The war is over, however not all went to plan. Many died. Too many. Harry and his friends are some of the few survivors of the Order of the Phoenix, and after the war, attempt to live normal lifes. However, it seems fate doesn't want them to. Post-OOTP
