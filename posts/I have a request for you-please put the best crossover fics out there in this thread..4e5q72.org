Because wading through the muck has ground me down and knowing that I can't be the only one who's sick of wading through dozens of crossovers that sound interesting until you read them, let's help each other out. Post the funniest, most dramatic, outrageous, adventurous, horrifying and original crossovers you can find in this thread-including the ever elusive /good/ 'X goes to Hogwarts' fic... which I am sure exist even if concrete proof of such a belief continues to elude me.


** *Great*

/Harry Potter: The Last Avatar (HP/Avatar)/

#+begin_quote
  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night. [Harry Potter characters in an AU with magic replaced by the elemental powers of Avatar: The Last Airbender / Legend of Korra. Full summary inside.]
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar]]

/The Black Prince (HP/GoT)/

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince]]

/The Shadow of Angmar (HP/LotR)/

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]]

*Good*

/The Denarian Renegade (HP/Dresden)/

#+begin_quote
  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade]]

/The Denarian Trilogy has a rocky start, which is why I've put it in "good" rather than "great". However, by the time you're reached the second in the trilogy, it's well written and gripping./

/Retsu's Folly (HP/Bleach)/

#+begin_quote
  It all goes wrong when Dumbledore gives Harry the choice to go back and fight Voldemort or move on. Harry is taken before he can make that choice and is thrown in an unexpected afterlife. Now he is on a mission to fight his way back to his own world.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5543906/1/Retsu-s-Folly]]

/The Havoc Side of the Force (HP/Star Wars)/

#+begin_quote
  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force]]

/Wand and Shield (HP/Avengers)/

#+begin_quote
  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield]]

/Discordant (HP/SW)/

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't the bright and shiny Jewel of the Galaxy you've all seen on the HoloNet. Harry's story started in the Underworld, a kilometer below the upper levels of Coruscant, where you never walk the streets alone, especially if you don't have a blaster hanging by your side. He left for a little while, but now it's called him back, whether he realizes it or not.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10016768/1/Discordant]]

/Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous (HP/LotR)/

#+begin_quote
  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.
#+end_quote

*Short or WIP*

/For Fallen Souls (HP/LotR)/

#+begin_quote
  AU. What cannot remain dead will never cease to be, so the elves really shouldn't be surprised when one of their enigmatic gods fall from the sky. The Master of Death, after all, has never adhered to anything so plebeian. Life on Middle Earth is bound to be interesting with him around. Immortal!Mandos!Harry
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11813597/1/For-Fallen-Souls]]

/Ice Age (HP/Dresden)/

#+begin_quote
  By unleashing forces he couldn't comprehend or control, he defeated the unbeatable and slew the immortal. It was the only way and he didn't regret it. But to all things, there is a price. He thought this one would be his death, but instead he found himself falling down the rabbit hole. It's said that time changes all things. Does that include heroes, as well?
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10090788/1/Ice-Age]]

/School Spirit (HP/Dresden)/

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter wasn't surprised to learn he was a wizard. He'd been dreaming of wizards and magic for years. He was just surprised at what sort of wizard he was. Prologue is identical to "Death and Dreams". Dresden Files crossover.
#+end_quote

#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486247/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Assassin-s-Creed]]

#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4247866/1/Drink-Up-Me-Hearties]]

/Culture Shock (HP/Culture)/

Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock]]

/The Wizard From Earth/(HP/Man From Earth)

#+begin_quote
  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  When Albion calls Merlin, he returns to puzzle out why. Meanwhile, two years of peace are shattered when Harry Potter is attacked and left badly beaten, the Elder Wand stolen from his grasp. Then a sword appears in front of Buckingham Palace and a dragon escapes from Wales. As the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix scramble for answers, Merlin gathers his allies (both old, new and unexpected) as he prepares to greet Albion's Darkest Hour. Morgana declares war in a single, devastating blow that leaves England's wizards stunned beyond words, making it clear that the time of the Once and Future King is upon them... if only they knew where he was. Will wisdom learnt through the eyes of Minerva's owl be enough to prevent disaster? Mostly cannon-compliant for both series.

**** It's creative enough, certainly. Harry has the potential to become an absolute BAMF hero. However, if you like Luna, don't read it. Not because they mess up her character, but... well, I had to quit reading on principle.

/Supernatural/: linkffn(10323896)

/Merlin/: [[http://treefics.livejournal.com/18145.html][A Morning Walk]], [[http://treefics.livejournal.com/20822.html][The Second Walk]], [[http://treefics.livejournal.com/21253.html][Third Time is the Charm]]. There hasn't been an update since 2011, so I assume the series is on-hold. By "Third", it seems treeson is leaning towards Merlin/Hermione, even though she originally stated she was planning Arthur/Hermione. I put this under "no pairings" because there is nothing concrete on the romance front.

  [SHERMIONE] There was a reason why he let Mycroft think he was a virgin. He didn't want him to know that he was right---that caring was a disadvantage, or that he'd lost more than his virginity the summer when he was 16. Sentiment was a weakness...but what was love? When he finds her again years later, barely conscious and bleeding, his heart's forced to feel once more. (Not Beta'd).

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
