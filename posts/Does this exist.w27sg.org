Ok, so there are many fics that fit the wrong boy who lived where Harry is abonded/ignored by his parents in favor of a different sibling, but are there any fics out there where Harry /is/ the boy who lived, his parents survived, he has siblings that are not ignored/abandoned and his parents aren't complete idiots?


** Hmm. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] fits most of your requirements. Harry isn't the BWL, but his twin brother is, and his twin is effectively Canon!Harry. Note that the author has stopped updating on FFN, and that a lot of updates are on the Darklordpotter WbA section.

You'll understand the cowardly parents bit later on in the story.

******* Where is the femmeslash? I'm just curious... I'm an avid HP/DM reader, but I'm in book 5 and I haven't seen any femmeslash.. unless I'm oblivious?

******** No, you're not an oblivious! The femmeslash begins in the " Wind That Shakes the Seas and the Stars" book. You have one more book to go before you can reach the femmeslash!

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][This]] is what you're looking for.

It's heavy AU, though. Voldemort isn't especially relevant, so no real BWL stuff.
