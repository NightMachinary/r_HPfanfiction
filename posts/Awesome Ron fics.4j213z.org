No Ron bashing, please. Hermione bashing is a-ok.

Number Games is frequently recommended. Quidditch fic. Haven't read it though.

This is the story of the big things that happen when Ron Weasley meets his mother's cousin, the Accountant they don't talk about. Ron learned that there is more to life than magic.

*** Gryffindors Never Die is great. I like how Ron ends up as Minister instead of Harry (not a spoiler, it's a time travel story and that much is revealed in the first chapter), although the ending is a bit anticlimactic.

I didn't like the Marriage Law Revolution *(spoilers ahead)*. I read it the whole way through, expecting at every moment that reality would assert itself and the main characters would realise that a massive bloodbath of their political enemies doesn't normally lead to a strong or moral government (see, among others, the French Revolution), and for the massive muggle weapon wanking to stop. It just broke my suspension of disbelief really hard, and felt more like either an Aesop or a dystopian sci-fi novel than anything to do with Harry Potter.

***** I don't have a problem with people who've committed crimes (e.g. raped, murdered, stolen) are tried and punished but killing people for 'thoughtcrimes' - as in, for their beliefs /even if they don't act on them/ - is something I find repugnant. Then again, in the UK there's no death penalty and our police aren't even usually armed so I suppose it's a different culture with regards to crime and punishment. There's typically also not many people with fantasies of violently overthrowing the government and replacing it, as we don't have recent civil wars and haven't been invaded or had another country 'own' us since 1066.

I don't remember all the details from the story but I remember that the author goes out of their way to make a bunch of characters act out-of-character compared to canon so that they can feel justified in having Harry and Hermione kill them in cold blood. I also think the story is quite unrealistic in a lot of ways, and very AU, despite claiming (iirc) to be close to canon.

As it's been over half a year, I don't remember all the details, but I do know that after I finished it I was confused about how the plot started at the end of canon HP and ended up where it did. I would recommend it to people if they liked rather bloody and action-heavy stories, but not to people who want more justification for the plot and political consequences other than "now the good guys are in charge".

I originally thought when reading the story that it was going to turn into a dark look at how power corrupts, because pretty much all the actions Harry and Hermione take look like the sort of things that start out with the best intentions and then lead to something like the French Revolution, or post-revolution Communist Russia. Instead, everything went their way, all the enemies are incompetents and idiots who can't cast spells properly, and every foreign european nation gets stomped by the protagonists (at least that's the impression it left me with).

****** It's an AU. PTSD is a thing there. And it assumes that you can't simply turn a country into a replica of Nazi Germany and start to genoicde muggleborn without a significant part of the government and at least the elite supporting that. It further asusmes that Magical Europe did not advance after 1690, but was stuck in feudal and monarchistic systems, and even those who had a nominally democratic regime were more an oligarchy than a democracy. And everywhere muggleborns were oppressed, which was a reason why many of them supported Grindelwald decades ago.

People were not executed for "thought crimes", but for rape and/or (mass) murder, or for helping others to rape and/or (mass)murder.

I also don't know why you think revolutions cannot work out. There are numerous examples where people shook off the yoke of aristocrats, and didn't end up in a grimdark corrupted country. The American Revolution comes to mind.

With regards to the competency and "easy mode": I used history as examples for the conflict. The foreign nations were stomped because that happens to corrupt regimes when the majority of the population can't be oppressed anymore and demands equal rights. The other nations were not stomped by the protagonists, they were stomped by the population rising up - in France, in Prussia, in Bulgaria, and ultimately, in Russia. The British helped there, but in each case, the majority of the "stomping" was done by the natives - with France being an exception, at the start at least.

With regards to incompetence: the purebloods were fighting with magic, against an enemy using magic and technology. That's a doomed course of action from the start. But in order to use technology, they would have had to abandon the very ideology they were fighting for.

The purebloods were doomed just as the nazis were doomed when the USA entered the war in 1941. Overall, the nazis were about as competent as the purebloods in the story - outclassed, but doing their best (or worst). They bloodied the Western Allies a few times, caused casualties all throughout the invasion and drive to Germany, but they had no chance at all to win. None.

The story wasn't meant to be a tale where victory was snatched from the jaws of total defeat with a trench run by rogue squadron, seconds before everyone died. It was modelled after WW2, with the Western Allies marching through occupied Europe. And overall, that worked out well for Western Europe. Even the execution of nazi criminals after the war didn't lead to a new dark age.

So, yeah, I don't get the problem people have with a story where wizard nazis ruling over an oppressed Magical Europe suffer the same fate as real life nazis did when they were ruling over an occupied Europe. Unless they want to complain that WW2 was unrealistic.

After the first invasion was defeated, the question for the New Wizarding Britain was never "will we win?" but "what will victory cost us?" And of course: "How will we get along with the UK once the war is over and we don't have a common enemy anymore?"

Are the British muggleborns and blood traitors in the story the good guys? They did a number of evil things, but overall, they were not worse - not even close to - than the Western Allies in WW2.

Also, I completely forgot that you were the author, which makes this discussion a bit awkward. However, I'll give you my honest opinion and hope you take it in the spirit it's given.

This, coupled with muggleborns not having (successfully) fought back earlier, just doesn't seem realistic to me. The setting seems contrived and rather unlikely to occur naturally.

I definitely didn't draw any WW2 parallels when reading it. Part of it is, of course, the statute of secrecy - it's almost impossible to have a serious land war, and instead you'd expect more assassinations, coupled with fear and occupying a few key buildings. Voldemort's attempts to take over Wizarding Britain seem closer to what I'd expect to happen. None of the individual ideas are bad, they just don't seem to mesh well with the setting you used (at least in my opinion).

The Nazis had control of Germany and Austria, the Sudetenland and Alsace, iirc. Everywhere else they were foreign occupiers, and imposed their rule from above as opposed to being the 'local' government. Speaking of Wizard Nazis, look up the 'Night of Long Knives', as well as the aftermath of the 'Reichstag Fire'. There are parallels to be drawn to both sides of the conflict in your story.

I suppose the point I'm getting towards is, your story is a good example of what I'd call Grey and Black morality - the heroes aren't the noble defenders of the oppressed who want to create a wonderful world for everyone, they're just fighting for the least shitty cause. There's nothing wrong with that, but it feels like the whole setting has been fine-tuned to make them look like the shining heroes. Whether that's what you were going for or not, that's the impression I got from it in the end.

If Voldemort really had that much support, he wouldn't have needed to fight from his resurrection until he killed Scrimgeour. He could have just taken over immediately.

Everything that happens in the story follows logically from something we are told, but it often feels unnatural and manufactured - of course the enemy are all evil, and of course the mass-murders of diplomats was justified, but it seems to be by fiat. You can't have a whole government of Darth Vaders - more than one or two overtly evil guys doesn't really work, imo.

The American Revolution was a side theater of a larger war between England and France, where the locals were opposed to the foreign (and remote) rulers of the land. While technically a revolution, it wasn't like the one in your story, as the forces they were fighting were not 'local', for lack of a better word - it wasn't a civil war in the same way. And organised killing of political opponents is generally a very bad sign for the quality of the new government - the fact that coincidentally all the political opponents in HGMLR were Evil with a capital E feels contrived.

******** I think you have a very biased view of some points. "Mass murder of diplomats"? The delegation demanded the surrender of Britain, and when that was refused, drew wands to attack the Minister. That's when the British forces opened fire, and killed them. That's not "Mass murder" by any sane definition. That's self-defense. If a diplomatic delegation tried to draw arms on the Prime Minister, his security details would shoot at them as well - would you call that "mass murder"? I hope not.

With regards to the muggleborns not fighting successfully back until then, I have to point out that popular revolts often took several attempts to succeed. In this story, Gridnelwald attracted a large number of muggleborns (which explains why he managed to invade other countries so successfully), but his defeat set back their cause as well. I modeled that after Napoleon, who was welcomed by many, and the restoration of the old Europe (with great influence by Metternich) after his defeat as an example for that. Several rebellions and revolutions in Europe followed, but it took decades for them to finally succeed.

For the setting itself, I assumed that until 1690, there was no separation, and afterwards, the magicals copied the systems they were used to and continued - with a magical Duc in France, for example, a Tsar in Russia, etc. Some countries had shake-ups, most importantly Prussia, who ended up with a Chancelor after Grindelwald, the old system having been destroyed. And the Magical Ottoman Empire was pushed back from balkans as was their mundane counterpart. But overall, I simply assumed that the countries were kept going as they started - a not really weird assumption, I think, given how conservative dress modes were in canon.

I am very familiar with Nazi Germany and WW2. I don't need to look up how Hitler came to power. I really hope you do not actually equal the massacres nazis did to the trials that led to the executions of nazi war criminals after the war. Harry and Hermione had trials for the captured purebloods, with veritaserum. They didn't massacre prisoners. It's just that in this story, far more purebloods were all too ready to massacre uppity muggleborns or at least help with the genocide than in canon, and so more people were executed for those crimes. Of course those who willingly helped with the raping and murdering were also political opponents - but calling their executions "organised killing of political opponents" is so skewed and wrong, it's on the level of calling the nazi trials after the war as "murder of political prisoners". Once again: Political opponents were not killed. Only murderers and rapists and their willing, eager helpers were executed, after trials. I really do not get why people keep claiming things that never happened in the story. I even show, in several scenes, that the pureblood opposition is still alive, and working on their own candidate against Harry and Hermione.

I maintain that in order to take over as quickly as he did, Voldemort had more support in the government and the elites. I assume that only Dumbledore, being his equal, was what held him back from simply taking over. As soon as Dumbledore was dead, the government fell.

I draw parallels between the Nazis occupying Europe and the pureblood aristocrats oppressing muggleborns since effectively, pureblood wizard nations are separate countries - at least they see themselves as that - and the muggleborns are all citizens of muggle countries. For them, the local government would be the muggle government, not the one that came to them at age 11 and told them to submit to the new rulers now.

With regards to the actual war, most of it was mobile strikes against wizard enclaves or enemy camps.

And yes, compared to genocidal racists, the good guys look like shining heroes. I did show though that even among the bad guys, people cared for their family, and the Tsar went as far as to sacrifice himself to end the Russian civil war to save his country further destruction, after sparing his son who had tried to end the war by a coup against him.

With regards to "a whole government of Darth Vaders": I did style whole governments after historical examples. Whole governments were ready to crush the French Revolution to restore the god-given rule of the monarchy. Whole state governments, whole states, were ready to fight for their right to keep slaves in the ACW. And the idea that colored people were subhumans was shared by a lot of people in the 1850s, and for decades afterwards. That's what I used as examples for the enemies.

I am glad you consider this attitude Darth Vaderish, but it doesn't change the fact that it was very, very real just 150-200 years ago in real life.

And fighting against them, fighting for the freedom of your fellow muggleborns, is not exactly "fighting for the least shitty cause". At least IMHO.

I must have misremembered that - I can't remember when I read it, but it was at least a few months ago. Still, that sounds rather strange - send a diplomatic delegation and then they open fire? It doesn't feel realistic at all, especially when you play up how the purebloods value their honour. I'm sure there's an explanation, but that just makes it feel like authorial fiat decides that they're the bad guys so they have to kick puppies. I'd like the story more if there were morally questionable decisions made by the main characters that felt morally questionable, and were treated that way.

I feel like we're talking from two completely different points of view when it comes to ethics and morality. I think I was reading around this area [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/uu/why_does_power_corrupt/]["Why Does Power Corrupt?"]], [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/uv/ends_dont_justify_means_among_humans/]["The Ends Don't Justify The Means (Among Humans)"]], [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/v0/ethical_inhibitions/]["Ethical Inhibitions"]] of the lesswrong sequences when I started HGMLR, but I'm not 100% sure. Nevertheless, you might find it interesting reading, if for nothing else than to see where I'm coming from when I say that HGMLR feels somewhat unrealistic.

I see that we have different impressions of what happened in the story. I'm not foolish enough to think I know better than the author, but regardless of what you wrote, this is the subjective experience I still have from it, several months later.

I read it with much the same feelings as Saruman of Many Devices - it was interesting, but not gripping or tense, and it didn't feel too much like the original source at all, either in characters or setting. That's not a criticism - I generally like AU stories, it's just that this one lacked a few of the things that I personally enjoy. I'm trying to phrase this in the least confrontational way possible, but I wouldn't rate your story as highly as some others I've read, and that's for a range of reasons, most of which I've tried (with only limited success) to write down. I can understand it must be annoying, as I'm willing to bet to you it feels like I'm missing the point repeatedly, but written communication over large [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance][inferential distances]] - you know more about the military history of Europe, for example - is always difficult, especially with the added difficulty of imperfect memory.

********** I think you are projecting attitudes from other stories on my story. I never really played up the pureblood regimes as particularly honourable. But even if they were, they wouldn't extend that to mudbloods. The pureblood aristocrats see mudbloods as the Southern "gentlemen" saw African-Americans prior to the ACW, and Colonial powers saw "Lesser races" in Africa. They didn't really treat them with honour.

The "diplomatic delegation" was composed of the dauphin of Magical France, and his "companions" - two dozen of the most skilled duellists of France - and had come to take over the country in the name of the ICW's mandate, not to negotiate anything. With the apparent leaders of this "mudblood regime" right there, they thought they could stomp out this little rebellion easily - the rest of the mudbloods would surely run once Harry and Hermione were done for. Or at least wouldn't dare attacking once the leaders were caught.

I'm not exactly certain that we're coming from two different points of views when it comes to morality, I think we simply see the world in my story very differently. You simply do not seem to accept that in my story, a lot more people were Death Eaters in deed, if not in name. I've equated the pureblood regimes to the nazis, and with good reason. They consider muggleborns as subhumans - just like nazis saw other races, and many white Americans in the south saw African-Americans. The British had been faced with an actual genocide, and then - as shown in the prologue - saw that the vast majority of the mass-murderers were not punished by the new regime. They saw that the same thing that had happened 20 years ago was happening again: The bulk of the criminals were getting free, and nothing really was changing.

Faced with this, faced with in their eyes sufficient proof that the "legal" way wasn't working, that the new regime was as corrupt as the old one, they saw no other valid choice to protect themselves and their families, and to prevent a third blood war, than a violent revolution. That's, in my opinion, an ethically acceptable choice. If fighting Voldemort was acceptable, then fighting his heirs who are protecting Voldemort's followers from punishment for their crimes is acceptable too.

And, again - it's not "puppy kicking evil", it's an attitude that was widespread among Western countries in the 19th century when it came to other races, especially Africans and African-Americans. Colonial powers committed the first genocides in response to rebellions. And no one really cared.

I'm sorry if you prefer a grittier, "everyone is evil" story, but when one side is fighting for their lives and freedom, and the other is fighting for their "right" to oppress and kill them, that's simply not the case. That wasn't the case in canon either, by the way.
