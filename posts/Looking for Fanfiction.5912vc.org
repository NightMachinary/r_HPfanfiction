That starts like this; -Intelligent, independent Harry -Manipulative Dumbledore -Starts pre-Hogwarts -Harry blackmails Dursleys so they treat him less horribly -Harry realizes that Molly Weasley shouting ("Now what was that platform number again?") was a set-up for him and evades it -Can be (but not necessarily) a Slytherin Harry -Has Weasley bashing -No crossovers (I just don't like Weasleys and Dumbledore. Gred&Forge are super cool tho) -It shouldn't be too short, I'd like something to read for longer than 20 minutes (So should have at least >20-30k words) -Doesn't have to be complete but that's a plus

Thanks! (I hope there's at least one fanfic like this..)

** I can guarantee you there's thousands of it of-course if you don't bother about quality.

*** I've found one that got me all interested into this theme but it was abandoned after like 9 chapters and it didn't even get to Christmas 1st year.. :( Can you recommend me some, or at least tell me what to google for? Thanks for your reply!

**** Sorry but I was joking. This category tends to very very bad quality. Google Manipulative!Dumbledore Harry Potter Fanfiction. You may find lots of lists.

** There are so many of these it's not even funny.

Just search "Lord Potter" and you will find this. Same with "Slytherin Harry".
