Are there any fics that deal with this issue? I have seen plenty of H/Hr fics that try to resolve the "she's like a sister to me" comment, but none that really have him struggle with those crazy images he saw. Like maybe how it affects his relationship with Ron that he now knows his greatest fear is him being with Hermione. They don't have to be H/Hr fics but that would be preferred.
