Thoughts? opinions?


** Out of the three options, bombarda, as it is shown in the third book and movie to be able to demolish a door/door frame, and it has the root word Bombard, which suggests siege level destruction. Personal opinion? Invent a stronger spell. I remember one fic there existed a spell that took ten seconds to cast but had enough force to send a car flying down the street.

**** I've never been a fan of the "Maxima" addition. Just seems a bit lazy, not to mention we never get any idea how much more powerful it's supposed to make the spell. And assuming it does make it more powerful, at what cost does this happen? Apparently you don't get physically tired doing magic, but there's got to be a reason why people don't toss out more maxima variations of spells, the patronus for example. Can you imagine a Patronus Maxima? No one would use the regular version.

***** I agree.

Although I suppose with explosions there is time you want to blow up a bookshelf, there are other times you want to bring down a wall. Or as in my case, a whole house. In that case the levels of finesse make sense.

I didn't want to create a spell I would have to explain if there was already one which would do the job.

****** Honestly, I doubt there's any one spell you can use to take down an entire house in one go. Houses are actually pretty sturdy, for obvious reasons. They have multiple load bearing walls, they'll have supports, they'll have concrete foundations. If a tank can drive straight through one and not have it collapse, one spell isn't likely to do the trick. So either you're just having him cast Bombarda Maxima (if you must) at the house repeatedly until it gives, which would probably take anywhere from 5-10 tries, or you go the uber-badass route and use one spell, just once. There are problems with the second route, depending on which character is destroying the house and when in the story they're doing it, but without knowing who I can't say what exactly. Would you be alright with elaborating?

******* I'm writing a Post Hallows murder mystery and my killer (who is magically unstable) is trying to kill the one person he thinks might be on to him. (There is a reason he decides to use these means as opposed to something more direct but that would involve me telling you a huge slab of the story which would probably bore the teats off of you.) I suppose the whole whose doesn't need to be vaporised but damaged enough to be structurally unsound. I suppose a rupturing gas line could burn down the rest?

******** Okiedokie. Magically unstable (as opposed to mentally unstable) would give his victim an out (assuming you want the victim alive) by destroying certain parts of the house more than others and collapsing it a certain way. Since he is magically unstable, that takes the uber-badass route out of the equation, as you would need to be both stable and powerful for something like that to work. Which is good imo, uber-badass comes with a number of other problems (i.e. it sets standards for previous and future actions).

You could rupture a gas line, but unless they had the stove on (assuming this a muggle home) I don't think it would catch fire. In my opinion, HP spells don't really "spark" like explosives do, they just directly cause the effects. A bombarda hits the wall and the wall splinters forcefully. A cutting spell hits the couch and the couch splits. There's no... friction, I guess you could say. And I doubt the killer would know that a gas line was ruptured, so he wouldn't think to use a fire spell to set it alight.

********* The intended victim was only just returning (late) to the house and sees the attack from across the street.

I think a ruptured gas main would still do it. This is a house that would be muggle friendly so is likely to be wired, a few arcing wires plus gas will do the job.

****** I don't like Bombarda Maxima BUT there is some support for it in general. ex. Protego and Protego /horribilis/. Or even Mobili and Mobili/arbus/ (arguably) but I think canon implies they aren't required. They are simply additions to the spell to specify/help with the casting. The addition does not inherently provide an effect. I think it's Tonks who does a Pack! spell, Tom Riddle does a Tell The Truth!, Snape does Reveal Your Secrets! These aren't real spells, they haven't been crafted and invented the way I like to think normal spells are, but they can function based on/if the person has understanding and a specific desire. Similarly I believe adding extra words might help hone a result, particularly if they have an extra half second to get it right. However the result is based solely on the casters already present understanding (knowledge, practice etc.). ex. If a forgotten silly charm was found and the incantation and nothing else given to Professor Flitwick and Augusta Longbottom there is a decent chance Flitwick could perform it (or at least in short order) Augusta wouldn't stand a chance. Back to Bombarda (or Protego) it doesn't matter if the person includes an addition as it won't do anything outside what they already could. So it is canon to have extras, but they should be used with caution as it has a high likely-hood of sounding silly.

To expand on the understanding a spell idea- Lets take Protego which simply protects. Provided the person understands the concept sufficiently, but there is a weight behind that concept. We know this can't be easy because there is a school, a whole class subject, sections of if not entire books on the spell and idea- and still many witches and wizards can't do it. So it might be as abstract and akin to knowing someone. Knowing the name Jane, knowing of a Jane, knowing Jane, knowing the real Jane, and being Jane and knowing things no one else does are large and often profound differences. I don't think it's easy. Again the point being /horribilis/ won't do anything save help the wielder focus on the understanding and concept of the spell/desired result.

******* Mobilliarbus is not a strengthened version of mobillius, just a more specific one. Arbus, like arbor, means "tree", so mobilliarbus means "move tree". I have no idea why more specific wording would be helpful in these types of charms, maybe it gives better control over the motion (she's trying to be sneaky at the time).

I very much agree with your ideas on "maximus" etc. Magic is visualization, belief, and intent, with a hefty amount of ritual. Emotion helps. Beginners find shouting helps focus their intent, masters learn to focus without speaking at all. Someone who is really damn good at a reducto can scale their level of force with the same incantation, or no incantation at all, but other people find that adjectives like maximus or horribilis helps gear their mind into a proper "blow ALL of the stuff up" mode.

***** I supposed the stronger versions of the spells are harder to cast. If you're not comfortable with a Maxima version, in a time of emergency you might find yourself using a weaker spell.

But yeah, I expect stronger wizards won't bother much with the normal variations. Even so, there are so many spells stronger wizards don't bother with - Expelliarmus, for example.

And keep in mind - not every wizard is good at spells. Neville, for example, might have struggled with Maxima.

And of course not /every/ spell has a stronger variation.

****** This is where HP's magic system starts to frustrate me. I agree they'd be harder to cast, but I don't know /how/ they'd be harder to cast. I'd call it a classic case of "add more dakka" but apparently HP magic doesn't rely on quantifiable power. I'd say you need more familiarity with the spell, but the books never go into what casting magic actually /feels/ like, if it feels like anything at all. There's just no information beyond plot related stuff.

** A note on canonicity- ignore this if it doesn't matter to you.

Bombarda is a movie spell- it never appears in the books. Similarly, the '-maxima' modification was a movie-based expansion, as are the variants of Lumos often found in fanfiction (-Solem, -Solaris, -Maxima). There were variants of the Shield spell which modified the effect and scope [-Horribilis and -Totalum] but that's it.

** If you want to destroy a house, an /incendio/ does the trick. If you want to blow up a house, an unstable potion that turns into a fuel/air explosive would probably be a bit more original than simply having your character yell /obliteratus/ and watch the house vanish.

*** Nope it has to be a spell.

Part of the killer's MO is using whatever means his intended victims were famous for using during the Battle of Hogwarts. (As reported in a commemorative Witch Weekly Article) in this case the victim is mentioned as collapsing a wall on their enemy , so that's what the killer tries to do to them.

**** Well, if it's a house... /Evanesco/ the mortar and foundations? A /sonorus/ variant that hits the structure's resonance pitch, causing the building to shake apart? A spell that delivers a massive punch of kinetic force that simply blows the structure away and turns anything organic it hits into a red puddle with the consistency of molten cheese? An /oppugno/ or /piertotum locomotor/ charm that targets the house's bricks? A /depulso/ and/or /accio/ aimed at the load-bearing wall(s) keeping the house up?

It's magic mate. Doesn't need to be just those three. A clever enough spell-chain incorporating one or all of the above would do the same with less noise. Hell, if the house has a warding system, blow /that/ up and let the backlash turn the house into a bomb for you.
