***** Both meanings actually. Lots of Love, because his fics were awesome and his devoted followers miss him, but Laugh Our Loud, because did you read his author's notes? you know the lamas and the tutus and the crazy, things in them? or how about the humor in his fics. I doubt that Bob was a man who rarely laughed, his life was probably filled with laughter as shown in his fics.

******** You are seriously deranged. Laughing at cancer?. I hope that kind of pain never reaches anyone in your family, glad you think I'm acting over ridiculous, too. All I ask is for people to show some sensitivity but apparently all that gets you are dowvotes here. That's unfortunate because I love this community, and I love HP.

All the best, Ben Mears

******* If you think about someone, and you immediately laugh, that's not necessarily disrespect. Lots of people in the entertainment industry (and writing fiction is basically that) would love to be remembered that way.

Was bobmin the kind of person who loved to make people laugh?

** Mrs. InsaneOne has the best crossovers. I love her work. The best thing is that you don't have to be familiar with the other universe, she does such an excellent job merging the two worlds. 12/10, highly recommend.
