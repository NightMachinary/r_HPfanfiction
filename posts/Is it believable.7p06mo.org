** It's not like Bellatrix didn't commit any crimes before torturing the Longbottoms in canon. I don't see why they couldn't have just evaded capture like they do in canon in the first and second war.

** It's your story. You can make things happen any way you want. I don't see any reason why you couldn't make a perfectly plausible reason for Bellatrix and her cronies not to have been caught.

*** I also just got the idea that maybe Carissa and Neville might vaguely recall each other since both sets of parents were killed or tortured by Bellatrix. Obviously she just finished Hogwarts when he starts.

Like a big sister/little brother type of thing.

****** Childhood amnesia is the observation that children do not retain their early childhood memories of before the age of three as they age and that by around the age of nine they will have faded completely. It has nothing to do with oblivation.

*** No. There's no indication in canon that anyone gets any sort of post-traumatic help or counselling. Rather the opposite in fact. There's a definite sense that a stiff upper lip is what is mainly required. If magic can't fix it, it don't get fixed.

** Carissa is Oliver's cousin. I wrote Oliver as a half-blood with a pureblood dad (who is Carissa's dad's younger brother) and a muggle-born or half-blood mother. So, maybe it's her aunt's idea for her to therapy.

** Yeah it's believable, I would just be very careful about giving OCs tragic backgrounds. It can cause you to stumble into Mary-Sues.

**** If you can't tell, she is.

The more unique you try to make a character, the more Mary-Sue/Gary-Stu it becomes. Uniqueness is not a relatable human characteristic. Adding more and more and more makes it less real and moves into Mary-Sue story.

Characters need to appear like what they're imitating. They need to have ups and downs and they need to change from what happens to them. Also it's not crucial for characters in the story to like the OC.

On a more general advice line purely because you're posting a lot of these, I'll offer a few suggestions that I think can help.

The first is that not everyone needs a fancy name. Josephine, Anais, Liesel, Diedre, Carissa, Adelaine, Delaney, and so on. What's wrong with Jane? Liz? Mary? Or going with the more Latin/Classical motif that is present in Harry Potter and using like Julia or Livia. Everyone doesn't need a fancy modern name. The weirder the name the more Mary-Sue the character seems from the start.

Granted I named a kid of Harry and Luna Aurora because I was amused by the pun of from the night comes the dawn, from the darkness comes the light. But then again, Aurora doesn't actually physically appear in the story, so.

On a related note, everyone doesn't need to be related to a canon character. That just creates clutter. Ask yourself if it's entirely crucial to the plot that they're related. If not, don't have them related.

But as a whole, characters are tools. And like tools they should be used for a specific purpose. Figure out that purpose and tailor the character to suit it. Titus Button doesn't exist because I wanted a Slytherin heartthrob beater with a Latin name. He exists because I needed a foil for Harry to show relationships developing outside of his circle. Use the characters efficiently to build the plot.

The second bit of advice is more simple. Anything is believable if it's explained well enough. Present a character's reasoning. Harry Potter is also a magical world. Use magic to explain things if necessary.

***** The names I go for because the names you mentioned are too common. Josephine goes by Jo, she's named after one of her mum's favorite charcters in Little women. Anais is Spanish, Diedre is Irish, Carissa is Scottish.

****** My point is that common names are good. The question I'm replying to is about identifying a Mary-Sue. Weird names are a hallmark trait of Mary-Sues. Accepting and using common names is pretty much step one in maturing as a writer.

I mean I once thought it was a good idea to have a character named Ice. Now I think that me was an idiot. Names are a hugely important aspect of a character and identity. Simpler is often better.

Normally I wouldn't bother getting pedantic but since the description in the story states Anais is American, so I'm going to assume that you were referencing the name's origin. Admittidely I couldn't be fussed to find her age, but Anais was not in the top 1000 of baby names in 1996 when that story takes place. Again, weirder is not always better for dramatic purposes.

But getting more pedantic, the origin of Anais is French. It comes from the Latin for Anaitis which, and the pantheon gets a little weird here, seems to likely be the Latin name for the Persian goddess Anahita or a local dialect addon to Artemis in the Late Empire period. The Roman pantheon isn't nearly as clean as they often teach.

Carissa's origin is Greek. It's derived from Charis. Naming derivation wise, it's closer to Cheryl in English.

But none of this matters. The name is the 'First Impression' of a character, as it were. And the stranger they get, the more likely it is that readers tune out or run away. At least try to stay with the naming convention of the source material if you want to go the unusual route. Then again, there are very few 'unusual' names in Harry Potter as is.
