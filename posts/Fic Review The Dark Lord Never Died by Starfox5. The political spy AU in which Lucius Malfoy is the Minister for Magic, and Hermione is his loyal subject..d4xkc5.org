*Premise*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]] features a canon divergence from 1981, on the night James and Lily are killed. Lucius Malfoy rallies the Death Eaters after Voldemort's downfall, pretends to the rest of wizarding Britain that the Dark Lord is still alive and takes over the Ministry of Magic in his name. With Dumbledore and the rest of the Order fled to France, we pick up in 1999, when Lucius Malfoy has had 18 years to cultivate wizarding society as he wants it.

The story clocks in at just under 180k words and has an M rating. Nothing explicit occurs on page in terms of sexual content, but in certain parts there is some graphic violence.

​

*Plot*

The set up for this story was exceptional. I love this premise and the world building that goes along with imagining a society run by a Death Eater. Lucius Malfoy has himself set up as Minister for Magic, and has divided society into a caste system according to blood status. Purebloods at the top of course, with Half Bloods relegated to second class citizens, but it's what he does with Muggleborns that really takes the cake.

Rather than having Muggleborns killed or existing as a slave class, Lucius bans magical folk from all contact with muggles, with the Obliviators acting as watchdog. When magic is detected in Muggle Britain, Obliviators are dispatched to either deal with a law breaker, or to abduct a young Muggleborn witch or wizard showing their first signs of magic. The parents are usually either killed or framed for the abduction of the child. The children are beaten and obliviated and told throughout their lives that they were saved from their abusive muggle families, shown mercy by the benevolent Minister despite their tainted blood. They are taken through a special program at Hogwarts which trains them to become soldiers in Lucius Malfoy's personal army -- The Wand Corp of Britain (excellent pun by the way). Hermione has been raised in this new society and is a Wand Leader in the Investigative Branch. She loves Lucius Malfoy, as any truly brainwashed child unquestioningly adores her parental figure/Dear Leader. The author has cited this concept as being inspired by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissaries][Jannisaries of the Ottoman Empire]]. It's also [[https://he-man.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Adora][pretty much the plot of She Ra]].

The story kicks off when the Dark Lord finally does return after 18 years of silence, and Lucius Malfoy does not wish to relinquish his power. He tells his subjects that they are under attack by fanatics and a pretender -- since he faked Voldemort's death ten years previously it would look rather embarrassing for him to acknowledge the real one now. Voldemort is so livid at Lucius' betrayal that he prioritises taking power back from him over going after The Boy Who Lived.

Meanwhile, the Order have been infiltrating Britain to try to bring the regime down, and Ron has just been dispatched to pose as Antoine Dupont, a Québécois ex-soldier seeking a new life. When Death Eaters attack Diagon Alley, Ron and Hermione literally fall on top of each other during the crossfire, fighting back to back and sparking an action spy movie romance.

The plot from there focuses on how The Wands fit in as the tipping point in a greater game for control of Britain. There is a heavy emphasis on political moves for power and tactical moves for war. Whilst I give it top points for planning, I will say that it didn't often feel as though the stakes were particularly high. Given how much action occurs in the story and how often people die, it seems counter-intuitive for me to say that there isn't much conflict, but no one we care about dies or loses a battle or anyone they love. Despite Ron directly quoting that “no plan ever survives contact with the enemy”, actually all but the very last one do, and being completely secure in everything always being fine for our heroes makes me less invested in wondering what the outcome of a dangerous situation will be.

There are however, some great action scenes. A lot of effort is put into giving us a riveting blow-by-blow of the duels our heroes get into, and the quick and creative spellwork they use to outsmart the enemy. If this story were ever adapted for the screen it would undoubtedly be an action flick. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGLXpKnQfSs][Possibly starring Angelina Jolie]].

It is a very structurally sound story. The author knew exactly what they were going for when they wrote it, planting and paying off to great effect. The story is paced very well, the plot neither moving too fast nor meandering. The overarching theme is of resistance to oppression, and I feel that this was handled very cleverly. Lucius Malfoy is an extremely shrewd man, able to not only demean the Muggleborns as he always wanted, but to make them love him for it. In fact, my only real critique around structure is that overthrowing Lucius should have been the crux of the story, as he was a much more compelling villain than Voldemort.

One of my favourite tidbits from the world building of the Wands was that along with their earliest memories, all of them are stripped of their last names. When I first read these formal British soldiers addressing each other on a first name basis I thought it was sloppy writing, but it's actually genius. It unifies them as the orphans of Britain ("Britain is our family" is the tagline) and ties their identity to the Minister, who represents the sovereign nation. Simultaneously it denies them the respect accorded every other citizen who are referred to by their last names -- a constant reminder of the Muggleborn's status as the lowest ranking class. I was extremely impressed by how cleverly and believably the author set up this alternate universe.

​

*Writing*

The story is written in 3rd person limited, with 5 POV characters -- Hermione, Ron, Lucius, Albus and Voldemort. Shifts in POV occur multiple times in a single chapter, each marked with a date and a time stamp. Stylistically this very much suits the genre of the writing, which is part action/adventure and part political espionage story. Ron even gets compared to James Bond a couple of times. The majority of the story is told through Hermione's and Ron's eyes, giving us a ground-level view of what the Wands and the Order, respectively, are up to.

In terms of overall quality there is little to complain about. The work was beta read, and what grammatical errors I did find were so few and far between as to not be worth mentioning. It reads well and for the most part very naturally. There are even a couple of meta jokes thrown in which I enjoyed quite a bit, particularly this one:

#+begin_quote
  "Lucius would rather have a [[https://images.app.goo.gl/AK2baznsfox36Ypc8][muggle hook]] than attach a prosthetic that the leader of the Unspeakables had made to his own body."
#+end_quote

The only thing which did stand out to me was some ill-fitting choices of indirect reference to the characters (such as “the muggleborn witch”), when their name or even ‘he' or ‘she' would have done just fine. It's partially because we're supposed to be reading the story from a character's point of view, so whilst it might make sense for Ron to refer to Luna as “the blonde witch” when he's just met her and is unfamiliar with her, it doesn't work when Hermione, who has been best friends with her since their early Hogwarts years, refers to her the same way. Luna is constantly called “the blonde” regardless of whose perspective we're reading, even if she's only in the company of another blonde, as occurs once when she's talking with Draco Malfoy.

​

*Needs more gray*

I was going to put this under the characterisation section, but I realised it's more of a thematic problem than one of individual characters. For a story which finds its strength in realistic political machinations, indoctrination and war tactics, it has a surprising lack of moral complexity. The good guys are good, unified, understanding and down to earth, to the point where nearly all of them seem to have the same personality. The bad guys are bad, divided into petty squabbling and have no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

What really brought this home to me was that Lucius and Narcissa have a bad marriage in this story, where in canon they appear to be [[https://www.deviantart.com/makani/art/fa100-touch-78619241][very supportive of each other]]. Narcissa is a selfish and malcontent wife who doesn't understand politics but constantly criticises her husband for how he handles things. Draco is an even more pompous and useless sack than he was in canon, and his primary feature is how he languishes about and abuses the power afforded to the Minister's son in order to rape the female Wands, including Hermione. Despite being a clear and primary strike against Draco's character, it's also a shockingly downplayed part of the fic -- no one ever even calls it rape. And despite the fact that Lucius is always extremely nice to the Wands, even when they're children, he calls them mudbloods when they're not in the room and from his POV we can see that he has no regard for any of them at all, or anyone else for that matter. He seems to despise other purebloods as much as he despises Muggleborns.

I'm not saying your bad guys shouldn't be bad people when you're writing a story, especially if you're trying to get across a point about evil and oppression, but the fact is that even J.K Rowling wrote these characters with more moral gray matter than this, and she was the one who wrote for children and dismissed the Slytherins wholesale. To have such a realistic, gritty setting only to make your characters into caricatures of good and evil does a disservice to what is otherwise a well-nuanced story.

There are one or two exceptions to the moral dichotomy of the characters, which I'll talk about in the Characterisation section.

*Characterisation*

Characterisation was not handled badly per se -- as I said, the overall quality of the story was very good -- but it was definitely weak compared to other story elements such as setting and plot.

I mentioned above that many of the good characters read as the same person. Little effort goes into giving ‘voice' to the individual characters, and as a result Hermione, Ron, Dean, Harry, Colin, Percy, and at least three OC characters all come across the same in the text. And if the physical stakes in this story are low, the emotional stakes are pretty much zero. No one has any genuine fights or clashes of personality -- there are no fallouts or interpersonal conflict between good guys. Everyone is totally reasonable in all the same ways, in order to not hold up the overarching plot. Even when Hermione finds out who “Antoine” really is, she just sort of says “I'm hurt that you lied to me, even though I understand why you did it”, and then she's a bit standoffish for a while, but that's about the extent of it. Unfortunately it means that it's hard to bond with these characters and get invested in how their arcs pan out, and that's a very important element to me.

What was interesting as well was how this emphasis of plot over character informed the writing of the epilogue. Epilogues are usually used to tie up loose ends and complete character arcs, especially to wrap up emotional journeys. Instead, this epilogue is sort of a condensed, one-chapter mystery plot which still largely focuses on action and intrigue, as if the author needed to stick to what they were already good at writing rather than just having a character-driven chapter to wind things down.

Getting onto an individual basis, I did find *Hermione* to be very believably written. In her POV chapters we see the bones of who she was in the canon translated well into someone who has been trained intensely for battle. She finds meaning in her role as a Wand, and her moral righteousness is still very much present, but turned towards the interests of the Minister, whom she believes in wholeheartedly. In fact, the dynamic between Hermione and Lucius was one of my favourite aspects, because the two of them get along very well to begin with but there's so much under the surface. Much of Hermione's arc revolves around her investigating what she thinks is a plot to overthrow the Minister, but instead finding out the truth of how Muggleborns are extracted from their parents. We then follow how she handles that knowledge as a member of the Minister's most dedicated subjects.

Hermione may be a trained soldier, but *Ron* has also taken a lesson in [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalBadass][Badass^(TM]]). As it's an AU and it takes place when they're all adults, this is pretty much a free pass for characterisation. Ron was a /Gendarme Magique/ in France, which loosely translates to Magical Police (total side note: I do not speak French, and whilst I fully appreciate that the author probably speaks it well, it was at times difficult trying to keep up with untranslated French word-peppering). He has therefore had proper training and battle experience, so I do very much buy his skill level in this universe. However, very little of Ron's canon personality survived the AU, so whilst I can get on board with his romance with Hermione, it does at times feel like Ron's name is the only thing which makes this a Romione story.

*Harry* himself is far in the background, and not a POV character at all. At the crux of the story, there is a very similar scene to the end of OotP, in which Voldemort tries to possess him. We sift through Harry's treasured childhood memories with Voldemort, but we haven't gone through his childhood with him, and the Harry who was raised by Sirius Black in a happy environment, grew up French and went to Beauxbatons isn't the Harry we grew to care about. With the exception of this exact scene, Harry scarcely matters to the story at all. I don't care about his love for Ginny (which also happened off page before the narrative started), and I don't care whether he lives or dies.

Some characters do come to life more than others, such as Luna and Dumbledore. I don't feel like either was entirely on point, but for different reasons.

*Luna* /sounds/ very much like herself, but doesn't act like her much. She's very affectionate here, like [[https://images.app.goo.gl/59tUm7AG8u22Yks86][that cute Lolita friend who physically throws herself at you just to hug you hello]], and squeals with delight whenever they hear something about your love life. It seems like she's being shoehorned into a rom-com BFF role, where her only real purpose in the world is to pair her MC best friend up with someone. That's a strange fit on Luna, who was never a touchy-feely person in canon and did not care one whit about love lives. Unlike the other characters, Luna's own backstory hasn't really altered enough to account for the change in personality. That said, she's a journalist for the Quibbler, which feels very in character for her, and there were some excellent Luna moments which felt exactly like her. This was probably my favourite:

#+begin_quote
  "So....do you want to catch dinner with me?" She added "at the Cauldron" before Hermione could ask if she meant it literally, like that time in Hermione's seventh year.
#+end_quote

The other character I wanted to talk about was *Albus Dumbledore*, who doesn't quite sound like himself, but whose actions are 100% in character. Dumbledore represents the best and perhaps only meaningful example of a morally gray character. Since we see his POV we are privy to how very much he cares about Harry and the members of the Order who put their lives on the line for him, assuring us of his humanity. However, we are also privy to how deeply manipulative Dumbledore is willing to be for the Greater Good, and certain tactical manoeuvres he could never disclose to his allies for risk of completely losing their faith in him. No one ever finds out for example that he and Snape worked together to deliberately bring Voldemort back, knowing that his return would divide Lucius' followers and weaken his regime enough to take over. Dumbledore's chapters afford us a high level view of the decades-long and countries-wide chess game for control of Britain, and the moves and countermoves needed to successfully topple Lucius' pureblood regime. A lot of people hate how manipulative canon Dumbledore was, and there is a whole sub-genre of manipulative Dumbledore fanfiction, but I'm a big fan of how his individual actions could be reprehensible, but without his machinations guiding the direction of the war, the good guys could never have won. Props for this Dumbledore.

​

*TL:DR*

Would definitely recommend this one for a read because the story is such a creative and original one, and it executes really effectively. It has great world building, detailed magical mechanics, action packed fight scenes and a really solid plot. Whilst I think the story could be rounded out by strengthening its character development and matching the moral complexity to the plot, in its current iteration it is already a tight and concise piece of work. I'd give it a *7.5/10 rating* overall.

​

A reminder that I take requests for fics to review, and encourage you to recommended me one which you think would sell me on your ship. The only caveat is that the fic must be completed.

Next up on my reading list: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Wyste/pseuds/Wyste][Wyste]]


** I think you summed up very nicely why I don't like Starfox5's fics. The premises are often really, REALLY good and imaginative, but the execution.... leaves a bit to be desired.

The writing is always technically sound, but it's also oddly bland and emotionless. There's no real personality or individual voices here... remove the dialogue tags and more often than not you wouldn't be able to tell who's talking, because with a couple of notable exceptions, almost all the characters talk in the same, slightly stilted and awkward way.

Really, the only emotions Starfox5's fics ever invoke in me are anger and boredom.

Boredom because in Starfox5's quest to remove the "idiot ball" from his stories, he also ends up removing much of the fun, warmth and humanity since those things often clash with cold, fard facts and logic. Much of the time I don't buy these characters as PEOPLE, because not being allowed to mess up or do anything that's not perfectly logical or goes against the author's personal convictions on what's right or wrong, their personalities blend together (not helped by the fact that, as I said, they all speak in the exact same way). There are many authors who have one or more characters who can act like the "author's mouthpiece." Starfox5 seems to have nothing BUT "author's mouthpieces" at least among the good guys.

Anger because... well, because that seems to be the most prominent emotion overall. There's SO much anger in a Starfox5 fic, much of it rather self-righeous. the fic wants you to just HATE the antagonists and is generous with loaded words and telling you how scummy and shitty they are, and how justified it is to kill and torture them because they are total scum who deserve no mercy or compassion... but unlike many "angry" fics, the anger here isn't hot and passionate; it's ice-cold, calculating, uncompromising and unforgiving. Usually the set-up involves the protagonist (which is almost always Hermione) having suffered unfair treatment at the hands of the antagonists, and coldly plotting/getting revenge against the antagonist... and often also against the society (read: Purebloods) which allowed such unfairness to exist in the first place.

In fact, "cold" is a pretty good description of these fics altogether. They're a study in cold, clinical anger and a sometimes dispassionate, but still always intense, thirst for revenge. I don't think it's a coincidence that every Starfox5 story I've read starts with Hermione either as the victim of unfair or unjust treatment, or Hermione TALKING about how she has been the victim of unfair and unjust treatment, because without the desire for revenge there wouldn't even be a story.

This particular story takes a while to get to that stage because at first Hermione isn't aware of how she's being oppressed and downtrodden, and it spends more time than usual in exploring all the ways the wizarding world under Lucius Malfoy is oppressive, unfair and unjust... but in the end it's ULTIMATELTY pretty much another "Hermione gets revenge against those who treated her badly" story.

Or that's my take on it, anyway.

*** Just to clarify; the fact that Harry is far in the background isn't the issue to me. Harry doesn't have to be the MC for me to enjoy a fanfiction. It was more that he was both kept in the background but still often written as someone we were supposed to care about at the forefront of our minds. He was given a crucial, game-changing scene at the crux of the story which was designed to emotionally resonate with us, but we barely know this character, so it could never work here the way it worked in the original series.

** I think I was the one who recommended a Starfox fic. Thanks for writing this review!

I don't consider myself much of a Starfox fan (there are dozens of us!), but the your critique pointed out some fair points about their writing - the worldbuilding detail is thought-out, and the narrative + structure is generally competent, with each character's role well-planned, the update schedule regular, and the fics get a conclusive ending with closure, which is a rarity in fanfic where so much content gets abandoned or trickled out over a period of years. People got stuff to do, that's reasonable, but the amount of content and consistency at which is delivered is what makes Starfox admirable within the fandom community.

Some deserved praise goes to this fic for avoiding many fiction-writing pitfalls - plot holes, Idiot Balls (characters only as competent or intelligent as the plot requires), static action sequences that read like a narration of a turn-based video game, and magic being used just for the occasional Cool Set Piece instead of being integrated as an intrinsic part of the setting.

This is where I acknowledge where and how this fic didn't connect with me. You picked out the main ones - the rotating ensemble cast, the two basic flavors of black and white moralities, and the "off model" characterization, which read like a generalized archetype of the canon characters in question, rather than the characters themselves. It was a personal struggle to keep hold of my suspension in order to keep going with the rest of the story. In short, the characters were like the New Coke® of Harry Potter. Recognizable, but clearly upgraded and deliberately different, something I could adjust to given the time... but my tastebuds still clung onto a memory of the Rowling-flavored OG.

On top of that, once you know the structure of a Starfox fic, you know how the Celestial Karma Scale allocates things, thus the ending is telegraphed from the start. And that ending (as usual) left me externally satisfied, but in a sense, emotionally hollow. You're right, it /was/ kinda like watching an action flick playthrough, while the fics that I find most memorable and appealing are ones that engage me on an emotional level. Usually through having a single PoV with a well-developed character voice and an evocative writing style, like how JKR wrote Harry.

#+begin_quote
  On the opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified excitement shot through him---any moment now--- "Come on!" he muttered, staring about. "Where are you? Dad, come on---"

  But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of Dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was time for the rescuer to appear---but no one was coming to help this time---
#+end_quote

You know that moment after the stampede when Baby Simba is nudging Mufasa's paw in the original Lion King cartoon and asking him to "get up, I'm sorry, let's go home"?

Those are the feels that JKR's storytelling gives me. Starfox fanfics, and I'm sorry to say this, are like the Live Action remake of Lion King. Visually great, entertaining, well-made, the side characters are given deeper backstories and more complex motivations, but I always find myself going back to the original, because it has something that resounds with me emotionally.

Yes this. For me, a fic which can make me care about the characters and resonate with me on an emotional level will always leave a more lasting impression than one which does not. The scene of Harry on the lake - that absolutely wrenched at me, and that kind of character writing is for sure what made me fall in love with the Harry Potter series.

I've generally been noticing something of a fork in the road of fanfiction types - they are either very focused on plot and magical mechanics, OR they're very focused on character development, but not both. I tend to get hooked reading the character-driven ones more than the plot-driven ones, but given how popular many of the plot-driven stories are, this is a priority for a lot of readers.

Thank you so much for the recommendation, and I really appreciate your thoughts on it as well.

*** This is what I feel every time I tried read Starfox5's story. The worldbuilding and action scenes are great. The characterizations are supposed to be great. It check all that I know about good characterization, but I can't connect emotionally with the character, even when the stakes are high.

The only time I care about Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][HP & the Lady Thief]] is on the first few chapter when she's about to be expelled from Hogwarts. I can't really bring myself to care about what The Muggleborns [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]] were facing except for the beginning of their resistance. The threat of Voldemort in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed Returned and Really Trying]] seems... non-existent? I have no idea, I feel like Reformed is only about Grindlewald messing around within the Dumbledore-Voldemort conflict.

This the reason why I'm only able to finish two of Starfox5's work, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy][Democracy]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans Tomb Raider]].

To be fair, this could be said for all Harry Potter fanfictions. I haven't found any fanfiction that is a good imitation from the original. I could read a 200k fanfiction, completely loved it, and I would recommend it to everyone I know; but I'm not sure if I would re-read it only for the sake of enjoying the story again. The only fanfictions I've re-read are oneshots or short multichapters that only takes me less than 20 minutes.

**** I have to say, Starfox5 writes great summaries. I'm quite tempted to read a couple of others just because the premises are so interesting. Do you think Petunia Evans: Tomb Raider is worth a look in? It really piqued my curiosity. I have this feeling like the author is really inspired by the life's work of Angelina Jolie. Mr & Mrs Smith, Tomb Raider and Salt all seem to have their themes echoed in Starfox5's fics.

I feel like there are fanfictions out there which can resonate with you as deeply as the novels, but aside from a Drarry I read earlier this year I'm hard pressed to tell you what those were.

As for recommendations, what you've done is perfectly fine. I've had a look at the premise and a quick scan of the opening paragraphs and it looks good to me. I've added it to my reading list for a future review, so thank you! Let me know if you'd like to be notified when the review is posted.

/Petunia Evans: Tomb Rider/ has an interesting take on Petunia's character. She's still a bitter and jealous character we see in canon, but she tried to direct it to the wizarding world in general; not to Harry. It has a good description on curse breaking and a good action scene. It's a short story and it's mostly a canon Rehash so I could finish it in a short amount of time.

To be honest, I mostly read it because I'm a sucker for Harry-with-alternate-childhood fanfiction.

******* Oh, I stopped reading Turn after a few chapters in, maybe I'll start again sometime in the future.

My issue with Turn is how the authors shows how unhappy Harry is in the original timeline. I'm sure that's only because I'm too invested in canon relationship to believe that Harry could be unhappy with his life. Granted, I've only read one chapter on the original timeline, but maybe if she could try to show that even when Harry have a shitty day he wouldn't trade it for anything else, and then proving that this is not true, it could appeal to me more.

******** Ah that's fair. If you're invested in Hinny, then any story which breaks them up may not work for you quite as well as it does for me. Harry does love his kids deeply and wouldn't trade them for anything, and he's a great dad figure in Turn, it's just other aspects of his life which make him unhappy. There are definitely characterisation choices in that story I wouldn't have gone with myself, but nonetheless the strength of the writing brought me firmly along for the ride.

** You clearly deserve an upvote for the effort you've put into this review :).

I would try to think of a story to recommend to you, except that I already heartily approve of reviewing Problem of Potions. Best Snape redemption arc I've seen, not a bad Draco redemption either, and I love the dry humor. The only quibble I can think of is, it checked in at the stations of canon to a degree that I felt was a bit stretched. But the writing quality pulled it off, and it certainly didn't lack for divergence.

#+begin_quote
  Snide or not, Snape's commentary on Harry's abysmal Potions skills actually was good advice, if you ignored almost everything he said.

  Luckily for Harry's temper, which grew shorter with every chapter he struggled through with no further luck at actually learning something from the book, good potion brewing involved a lot of crushing things, slicing things into small pieces, and making things blow up. The latter Harry hadn't realized you could do on purpose, but Fred clued him in. ("I think otherwise little Harry-kins is going to melt the good cauldron, George, and we can't have that.") Being able to make red and orange fireworks whenever he got too frustrated by alchemical theory went a long way towards reminding him of the long game.

** That's a great review! Some remarks here:

First, a confession: The pun with Hook was unintentional. I never saw that Peter Pan movie, nor did I know the actor.

Lucius Malfoy might have worked better as the final boss - but that wouldn't have fit the characters as written. Dumbledore wanted to remove Malfoy first - Voldemort was deemed less dangerous, sabotaged as his resurrection was thanks to triple-agent Snape while Malfoy had far more influence and loyal slave-soldiers. And the Wands who discovered the truth about their families wanted Malfoy gone asap so they wouldn't have to fight their family, so to speak. So, as I wrote the story, I couldn't have Lucius go down second, not without some plot railroading or extensive rewriting. And I generally prefer to let characters act as they would even if it wrecks my plots - in one story, I had planned to have the heroes play cat and mouse with Umbridge at Hogwarts. That got derailed in the first meeting.

With regards to the stakes, well... a lot of the Wands die. I hoped people would care about Dean and Colin, who both died in the final battle, as well as other OCs. On the other hand, not everyone cares about side characters. I do like happy endings, though, even if they come with a high body count.

With regards to the Malfoys, I don't consider "I love my family" as a redeeming quality. Almost every Nazi Mass murderer loved their family. That didn't make them "grey" or "redeemed". Draco only showed character growth in canon when things turned so far against the Malfoys that even he got the message. He showed no empathy before, no regret. In this story, things don't really go as bad before his death - on the contrary, for most of the story, he's living the high life. I don't see him changing for the better in that situation. Narcissa might probably be a little too negative - on the other hand, we don't really see much of her in canon, and, once again, we only really see her once her family has fallen from grace. I agree that Lucius and Narcissa could've been a little happier with each other, though. And Lucius... well, in canon, he wants to sacrifice a little pureblood girl for his political schemes, risking a dark artifact trusted to him by Voldemort. And he is perfectly fine with children getting murdered at Hogwarts. It's hard to find a more evil and more stupid action in the first books.

I disagree that JKR wrote morally gray characters - she just ignored what she wrote, especially about the Malfoys. But objectively? Lucius is irredeemable for his actions before his fall from grace. Technically gray, I suppose - like a tiny drop of white paint added to a barrel of black paint tecnically turns it gray even though it's still black for all practical purposes.

Still, I admit I should have made the Malfoy family a little happier - it would have made the contrast between their love for each other, and their utter lack of empathy for everyone else, especially muggleborns, more drastic.

With regards to emotional clashes, that was a choice. I can't really stand idiot balls, and people starting fights with each other for stupid reasons while facing a much bigger threat to everyone is one of the most annoying idiot balls in stories, in my opinion. It usually feels really, really forced and tends to make me drop a story in the "ah, yes, of course everyone has to become stupid and fight each other instead of finishing the enemy off before settling accounts" sense. It barely works with teenagers, but with adults? I prefer a litlte more competent characters.

Or in other words, for me, it's hard to care about characters who act like idiots in that manner. Hermione could have been more emotional about the revelations, I admit - but overall, she's not the type of person to wallow in pointless angst when there're important tasks to do and lives to save.

However, I hoped that the emotional moments - Luna meeting the ghost of her mother, Hermione meeting her grandmother, the dead bodies laid out after the fight etc. - would help with making people care for them.

With regards to the epilogue, I write epilogues to show how the characters live their lives after the story ended. That can be a wrap up at a funeral, a wedding, a glimpse of politics, or - in this case - a criminal case showing that Ron and Hermione are back to working as magical police officers.

With regards to Ron, I do see canon Ron as a badass. He laid down his life in first year on the chessboard, stood on a broken leg and told Sirius to go through him to get to Harry, he was deathly afraid of spiders, yet faced acromantulas with Harry and went down to the chamber of secrets with a broken wand... if that's not a badass, then someone's standards are impossibly high. I also consider his humour, slight inferiority complex and loyalty to friends and family core parts of him, with the inferiority complex not very pronounced here due to different experiences.

With regards to Luna, I see her as affectionate especially since she is much closer to Hermione in the story - she is Hermione's BFF, after all.

*** Thank you for your response!

For the most part I was going to leave your points be, as they can easily come down to a difference in stylistic choices and we've each given our two cents on those, so I've tried to confine my comments to just what I think I could have expanded on a little better.

​

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes a lot of Wands die, but except for Hermione, and arguably Dean and Colin, the Wands are just [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt][Red Shirts]]. Hermione probably knows their names, but the reader either learns them right before they die, or right afterwards. We the readers do not care, and their deaths have a pretty negligible impact on Hermione, who is the only central character who might be distressed by them.

​

#+begin_quote
  With regards to the Malfoys, I don't consider "I love my family" as a redeeming quality.
#+end_quote

It is though. The whole schtick with Voldemort being irredeemable and weak was that he had no concept of love - couldn't feel it at all, and so could feel no remorse for anything. Having a redeeming quality or two doesn't make a character into a good person, and you'll never catch me saying that Lucius was a good guy, but he's not a psychopath. Whilst power and selfishness is a big motivation for him, his love for his family is too. Like you said, everyone believes they're the good guy.

​

#+begin_quote
  With regards to emotional clashes, that was a choice. I can't really stand idiot balls, and people starting fights with each other for stupid reasons while facing a much bigger threat
#+end_quote

So this I can certainly understand. I can't tell you the number of stories which have given me rage because of idiot balls being thrown around needlessly. That said, personal clashes are not the same things as idiot balls. There might be a slice of them in the venn diagram of personal conflict, but there are also plenty of legitimate reasons for characters to clash. Having conflict may have no impact on the plot but do much to develop your characters (such as Ron and Hermione fighting at the Yule Ball), or it can propel the plot forward (such as Ron and Hermione fighting about 'death' of Scabbers) - it's all in the writing of it. I agree with you that Hermione is not a wallower, but she is a highly reactive and indignant personality.

​

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The last thing I wanted to clarify was that I'm not saying Ron has no badass qualities in canon. Your examples refer mostly to his bravery, which yes, he absolutely has in spades. The upgrade I'm talking about is mostly to do with his combat skill level, which as I noted, is pretty well justified here. Canon Ron was not this disciplined and could not have pulled off espionage like this - his temper was very much toned down. But I'm certainly not trying to bash canon Ron.

**** With regards to the stakes, I'm not fond of the "Oh, let's kill a character to show it's serious" trope. Sirius's death in canon felt like one of the "oh, Harry needs some grief, let's kill off his last family" tropes, forced and cheap. Fred, Tonks and Remus basically felt like "we need a few more deaths to show it was a bloody battle, so let's kill off some characters". Any of those deaths might have worked, imho, if there had been lots of dead Death Eaters as well. Sirius dying in a battle where Lucius and Bellatrix, and some other named Death Eaters died would have avoided the "Oh, now the godfather dies so Harry can grow" feeling, IMHO. Same for Fred and the Lupins - if they had died, and we had seen villains die as well, named ones, their deaths would have had a bigger impact, IMHO, since we wouldn't have seen the wires, so to speak.

We'll have to disagree about familial love being a redeeming quality. Just because Voldemort is an even worse monster who can't even feel love doesn't mean someone who can love is redeemable. You don't need to be a psychopath to be a monster. And that he thinks he is a good guy doesn't really change anything either - many Nazis thought the same. Or, in other words, how people treat their family isn't nearly as important as they treat strangers and those "below them". And we all know how the Malfoys treated Dobby, and everyone else. You could even argue that the Malfoys love for each other makes Lucius' and Draco's crimes worse - unlike Voldemort, they could have known better and done better. Lucius loved his own child, yet had no trouble murdering other children, after all. It only proves his utter lack of any empathy for others.

I consider the "death of scabbers" a stupid scene, actually. Scabbers was a damn rat. You either keep that animal in a cage or you never let it out of your sight if there are dozens of cats around. The whole thing felt forced - and barely aceptable for immature kids to squabble about.

We'll also have to disagree about Ron. I think he is not quite as undisciplined as you see him. But then - consistent characterisation isn't exactly a strength of JKR. Her characters are always subjugated to the needs of the plot.

  Do you remember why you chose to make their relationship the way you did?
#+end_quote

Not any more. Might've been that I just thought that twenty years of ruling Britain would cause some stress in any marriage. And that I don't really see Narcissa as an exceptionally smart witch.

#+begin_quote
  People do this kind of thing in real life though. I can understand why it would feel weird to write it down as a writer because you know it's dumb, but people do dumb things sometimes, no matter how competent they are.
#+end_quote

Indeed, they do dumb things. But in stories, it often feels forced and convoluted (and cheap) if the heroes (or the villains) suddenly act like idiots so the other side wins a fight or escapes. Like, say, if Voldemort gets killed by a plane crashing on him. Yes, such things happened. People got killed on the ground by a plane crashing on them. But if that happened in a (non-crack) story, it wouldn't feel satisfying at all. You can use such mistakes, but it needs a very light touch. And turning on each other while fighting the Dark Lord wouldn't have fit that, in my opinion.

With regards to emotions, I don't detach the characters, usually, from the events - but I assume people have at least some degree of control over their emotions. Yes, they might really want to curse someone, but they won't do it if it'd be stupid. it's not the emotions themselves I avoid, it's the loss of self-control, especially in situations where it'd be very, very stupid. Yes, some people will lose control - but some people will also roll over and let themselves get killed by the enemy, or give up even if it means death. And I prefer to write about people who don't do either.

When it comes down to it, I want to write about heroes, people who keep going when most would give up. Not the average people who will end up traumatised and broken by half of what Harry and Co. went through in the early years in canon.

That might not be to everyone's taste, of course.
