** linkffn(9708318) Fairly self-explanatory, not really the 'Matrix-esque' style you might be looking for, but it's worth a try all the same.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

**** I'm going to throw out some warnings for this fic for anyone coming across this thread in the future. That fic has child porn, incest, and what basically amounts to bestiality. The child porn and incest are completely gratuitous and super gross and ruin what is otherwise a pretty decent fic. All the other terrible stuff can be handwaved as video game stuff, but that can't. At least the author doesn't write explicit sex scenes, but it's explicit enough to be clear what's happening.

You can read a good chunk of it before getting to the gross bits. I'd say it's safe to read until Harry is given an Alternative Identity potion. The grossness starts at that point.

***** Thank you. A friend read this a while back and recommended it to me, but I didn't recall enough of it to give any warnings.

**** Yeah, I guess no story quite gets to the level of broken that is this story.

That said, it did have some quite hilarious bits, so all is fine in our kingdom.
