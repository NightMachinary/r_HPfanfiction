The pairing was Harry/Luna, and they started an organization that fought Death Eaters. I think the used some kind of muggle drugs at some point during the story, though I can't remember what for. Luna's family had some artifact that ripped the horcrux from Harry's scar, and the Dark Mark from Snape. Hannah Abbott got raped as well. Hermione's parents were also in Harry and Luna's group. Snape brewed potions for them. I'm certain it was in-between 150,000 and 200,000 words.

Anyone remember a story that fits what I remember?


** Probably "Help of a Seer" by Aealket.
