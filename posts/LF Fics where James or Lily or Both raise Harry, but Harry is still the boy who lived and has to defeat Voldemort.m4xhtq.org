I just read a fic where James never died, and instead woke up in a muggle hospital from a coma 14 years after Voldemort kills Lily. So Harry is still the boy who lived, still had to struggle with Voldemort coming after him and all his trials through his school years, but James gets to come in during his fifth year and be sort of a parent, it really left me wanting for more fics similar.

So basically fics where somehow either James or Lily live (or both) but the prophecy is still in effect and Harry is still facing down with Voldemort during the end of school years. It can be where either raise him from birth, or like the original fic I read one of them comes when Harry is already at school or something.


** How is the fic called?

In this one Lily and James raise Harry and take Dudley in after he is orphaned:

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"
