I was looking back on my ideas for when I first started it and I was laughing at some of them because in my head they're no longer anywhere close to the character and I was wondering if that's what happens alot of the time?


** It can. Looking back on my notes, some characters (canon ones, at that) have practically switched names as far as plot progression goes. When I start hashing out my ideas in long-form, some things stick and others don't, so I tend to go with the flow.

A couple of things end up playing out differently, but if you trust the strength of your concept, you should still be able to recognise it when all is said and done.
