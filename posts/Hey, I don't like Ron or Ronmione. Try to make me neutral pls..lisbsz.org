** If you don't like Ron, you don't like Ron. I don't see much sense in forcing yourself to read about a character, or a ship, you don't like.

  He also is insecure which can be understood but YOU AREN't INSECURE FOR LIKE 8 YEARS AND INSECURE WHEN UR 18
#+end_quote

Are you saying ppl aren't insecure for years on end and insecure at 18? Both statements are very untrue. Nevermind that Hermione is pretty insecure herself.

** I mean if you don't like it, you don't like it. The thing is we don't see how they behave in a relationship other than the small scene during the battle of Hogwarts where they seem to be very supportive of one another with Ron allowing Hermione to destroy the Horcrux and Hermione excitedly giving Ron all the deserved credit when they meet Harry.

I don't think that their dynamic is that far fetched. I've personally had crushes which I knew were reciprocated in the past on which for whatever reason I chose not to act. The tension can make you behave strangely sometimes being downright mean to the other person. On the other hand, Ron is quite protective of Hermione defending her even against Harry, who on the other hand doesn't seem to care much for Hermione (he even thinks that he doesn't enjoy Hermione's company as much as Ron's when the two have the falling out in GoF).

But in the end they are just characters and they will behave as the author chooses to so you can just swap the names and there you go.

As I've said in other posts in the past. My wife and I have a relationship pretty much like Ron and Hermione. Arguing happens. But hey there's love. We have been together for quite some time now. And the spark is pret much still there.

** I was never a fan of it to be honest, I'd like to think that Ron's casual approach to life, in spite of any chaos surrounding him, eventually mellows-out Hermione. Likewise, Hermione's studiousness motivates Ron to take /some/ steps to improve himself much as James Potter matured enough in later years finally attracting Lily's attention. But I don't think that is shown in the original books.

Some other things you might want to consider:

Hermione has a great intellect, but she's not famed for being ballsy enough to ask someone out, /except when she asked Cormac McLaggen to the Slug Club AFTER Ron had insulted her/. She says that Krum asked her out in the library, so he doesn't count.

I think that Ron is convenient for her. Familiar to her. I think Ron is a baseline or a rock to her that she can always turn to, who has had her back and forgiven her even when she's made mistakes and vice-versa. She doesn't have to go out of her way improving her social skills to get with Ron, they already had a deep bond that cannot really be replicated with any other partner she might meet. And I don't think she thinks very much about what kind of partner she wants. I guess she's touch starved and lonely and, even post-Hogwarts, she is likely pretty intimidating to most men. This makes it a bit difficult to find a partner. I would imagine that they take a break post-Hogwarts to get some space, and then months later get back together for good because vowing to reconcile their differences.

Source: have spoken with some "intimidatingly successful women" who stay with familiar partners in unequal on-and-off relationships because they can't find other partners, or they stay single because other men they consider "similar" are in rare supply on the dating market. This would be ~ women with six-figure jobs, high-stress jobs, top-level managers or executives -- women who literally just don't have time to spend dating over and over again finding Mr. Right. Men in a similar position on the dating market are essentially either married, widows, significantly older, or permanent bachelors who won't settle.

** I'm willing to give this a shot. Full disclosure, I am not a fan of Ron either, but I've come to realize it is because Rowling wrote him in a way that makes zero sense. Here's how I learned to write (and genuinely enjoy) Ron as a character.

Of all of Harry's friends (not just the Trio), Ron is the only one who understands what it was like for Harry to never have anything of his own. Harry was denied everything in his childhood, and his most prized possessions are heirlooms from his parents. *RON* was also denied his own things, forced to use 2nd/3rd (even 4th!)-hand items that his brothers used. This shared understanding of the importance of ownership is never explored by JKR.

Ron feels overshadowed by brothers he sees as larger than life. Everyone one of the Weasley children except Ginny (who is the only girl, so she's 'special') absolutely excels at their chosen professions. For Ron, the desire to be great is there, but more importantly he also recognizes the *futility* of that desire. How can he - ordinary Ron Weasley - ever match up to Bill, or Charlie, or the Twins, or even Percy (who - though a ponce, has a meteoric rise in the Ministry)? For Harry, he has to live in the shadow of his dead parents, who are hailed as legends, who died before any flaws or mistakes manifested. Again, a shared commonality that JKR was oblivious to.

I thought about these things, and I realized that canon!Ron is actually the OOC version of his character. canon!Ron is disloyal, a bad friend, constantly jealous and unable to appreciate what he has. It is pretty strange that Ron would ignore all of the things that he and Harry exclusively share, then turn on his best friend at Harry's darkest moments (TWT and Horcrux Hunt). Why? What would possess someone that should be able to empathize with his best friend like no one else to turn on them when they are at their lowest point?

Simple - it's because JKR wanted personal drama within the Trio, and wasn't a good enough writer to pull it off organically. So she made the 'Joe-Average' part of the Trio a dick just to stir things up. Once I realized that, I was able to write Ron the way he should have been - loyal, trustworthy, sometimes-insensitive but funny, comical, and emotionally mature (he has 6 siblings! How is Ron less well-adjusted than two 'only-childs' like H/Hr?!?!?).

So? Do you like Ron a little more now?

** I don't think anyone should be downvoting you for having an opinion. Sheesh.

I don't like them either. Although that's mostly because they remind me of my aunt and uncle and we've all been wondering for decades why they don't divorce. They tolerate each other on a good day.

But also it just seems unrealistic to me that Hermione would tie herself to someone who devalues the things she loves.

** I think that given her goals in life, Hermione could do much worse than Ron:

- Among the men close to her in age, the ambitious ones are either Slytherins (whose ambition is quite questionable in the first place) or Percy; so she doesn't really have anyone with whom to form a proverbial "power couple". This means that her husband will have to be someone who would work mainly as a prop.
- Ron is a pureblood, and she takes his name when they marry. That makes her less threatening to the proverbial old guard who, while not Voldemort supporters, likely harbour implicit anti-Muggleborn prejudice. (Think Slughorn.)
- Ron is a war hero, but not in a way that would overshadow her the way Harry would. No matter how illustrious her Ministry career, her achievements are unlikely to ever be as famous and popular as Voldemort's defeat, and Harry would get 80%+ of the credit for that.
- Ron is a known quantity, and we know that she finds him physically attractive. He is also a rather talented wizard, given that he does significantly above average while putting in the least amount of work she lets him get away with; as is his whole family. So, he clearly has good genes.
- She has few interests in common with Ron, but that's not necessarily a bad thing: it means relatively few demands from him on her time, so she can focus on her career.

*** The moment Ron gets over his toxic jealousy and poor communications skills, he would actually be quite good for Hermione. He sounds like the exact kind of guy who'd nag his wife to eat and sleep which Hermione certainly would need.

The better question is would /Hermione/ be good for Ron. Because Ron actually wants a good and proper relationship - something Hermione fails at even at the best of times.

I love Ron and definitely don't see him as forgettable.

** It's okay not to like it, I don't like it either and don't even like Ron and Hermione in general. We can't all like the same thing. You can't ask people to make you neutral because that's just not possible, whether you like something or not depends on how you view it and not on how others do. They can point out some things that you may have not paid attention to but at the end it depends on what YOU think of it. If you want to reconsider your view of Ron / Romione I suggest rereading the books, because that's how JKR portrayed the characters. Fanfictions tend to be out of character or make them behave how the author wants them to, which brings me back to my 2nd point. While reading the books you have a small glimpse at Ron and Hermione's relationship and it's up to you to imagine the rest. That being said you shouldn't feel obliged to like a character/ ship just because the fandom does, feel free to dislike them, I do to. It's totally normal they are fictional characters after all. As long as you're not disrespectful to people who like them, just enjoy the books and fanfics and stick to your pov.
