Sirius is alive. He is Harry's regent or proxy in the mot. Harry gets the goblins to ally with him and declare blood feud on riddle. Goblins act as his hand to find and destroy the horcruxes and riddle.

** If it's a specific fic, please flair it as Fic Search. Also, this is so generic, the only thing that stands out is that Sirius is alive, which makes it slightly more uncommon. Still probably hundreds of fics that match.

  My own response to Reptilia28's challenge. Harry died in the battle with Voldemort. What happens when he meets the Grim Reaper? Especially when the Reaper isn't happy with him. Rating changed to more appropriate one. HHr. Other pairings as they come.
