I'm writing a fanfiction and the Wizarding World is much more Victorian than canon, in everything. I find difficult writing conversations, extracts from books and letters in a Victorian style (I can write the behaviour/clothing ecc. well because I've always near the Victorian etiquette). I know the do's and don't of conversation and letter writing, but I can't figure out the exact words that are being said and wrote. I have particular difficulties with Snape.

So I'm asking for fanfiction set in a Victorian world (or even before the Victorian Era, like the Marriage Stone's 1600's society) for inspiration. If you can suggest other sources that can be helpful, that would be fine as well.

Thank you and sorry if I made mistakes, English is my second laguage (I write in Italian). I'm also on phone, if there are formatting issues.


** The thing to do is read actual Victorian literature to absorb the style. Charles Dickens is classic. I read fiction written in the 1920s to get the right tone for my 1920s fic.

** Your best bet for gaining a sense for authentic Victorian language use isn't going to be from fanfic. Even if you can find some well-written fanfiction set in the Victorian era, chances are the language won't be authentic.

Jane Eyre would be a safe option. Anything by Thomas Hardy. I would say avoid Dickens, but that's probably just my personal bias showing.

** I think you might find some luck reading some Dramione fics. There are quite a few with a historical setting that take inspiration from Jane Austen.

Here's all the 1800s ones I've read and liked:

Muggle-born Magic by Musyc linkao3(A Muggle-born Magic)

Arrogance and Ignorance by AnneM.Oliver linkffn(4218150)

A Kind and Generous Man by AnneM.Oliver linkffn(4956465)

The Making of Draco Malfoy: Love, War, & Marzipan by bionically linkffn(13263378)

Of General Incivility by attica linkffn(12445454)

Persuading Draco by LeanaM linkffn(11990596)

**** You're welcome! Dramione tends to play heavy on the 'rich boy, poor girl' trope, so I tend to think of them as romance novels rather than fanfiction

#+begin_quote
  Regency-era AU. Physician's daughter Hermione Granger finds herself in need of a way to pay off her father's debts after his death. Draco Malfoy, retired from the politics of the Isolationists, a group of pure-bloods bent on separating 'true' magic from lesser folk, finds himself in need of a tutor for his son, Scorpius, who appears to be incapable of magic and must learn to survive in a world without it. Draco also needs a wife and mother for Scorpius, to satisfy a promise to his unwell father. After she saves his son from an attack by Isolationists, Draco hires the Muggle-born Miss Granger for the former, and after a riot in Vauxhall Gardens and a scandalous discovery made by his mother, weds that selfsame Muggle-born for the latter. While making the best of her marriage of (in)convenience, Hermione discovers that Scorpius' history of wild imaginings and dreams is more than just imagination. As she attempts to teach him about magical abilities no one expected he would ever have, she and Draco work together to raise Scorpius and learn to trust each other.

  Magical Regency AU. Many years ago, Draco Malfoy made a mistake when he let Hermione Granger walk away. But then circumstances bring them together again, and he realises that he never really got over her. But can she forgive him for his choices? Can he forgive himself? Jane Austen's Persuasion meets Harry Potter.
