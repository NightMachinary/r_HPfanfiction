The vast majority of wizards are one thin and fragile piece of wood away from getting their ass handed to them by anyone with a solid physique or a halfway decent understanding of any number of unarmed or armed self defense skills alike..

Has anyone got stories highlighting this?

This story features a character who incorporates some muggle fighting techniques into his wand fighting style.

Other than that I can't really recall any. I must say I really think you're underestimating how godlike a wizard is in combat. How's a muggle even going to get close enough to snap their wand, let alone know what the wand is in order to snap it, you know?

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.
