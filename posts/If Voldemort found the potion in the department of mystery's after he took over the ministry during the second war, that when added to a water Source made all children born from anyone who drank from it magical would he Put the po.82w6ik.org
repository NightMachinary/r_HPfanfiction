Pretty much what does Voldemort hate more the Muggles or Muggleborns?

As for the story of how the potion was created. I like the Idea that it was created by a Wizards who's wife and young children were kill by muggles.

The Wizard was not the most magically powerful but he was a Genius at potion. At first he wantrf to kill the muggles but he Decides that its not enough he want to do something worse he wants to make them suffer the way he suffered. SO he created a potion that he puts into the Water well in the Village where his family was Killed and Watches as The Children and Grandchildren of the people who killed his family are born magical.

Some people would be confessed about how giving children of his enemies magic would be a curse worse than death to them. But The wizard being muggleborn knew just how deep the Muggles irrational hate of magic was. And so he lived in The village of his enemies knowing that each of The children would be eventually found out as magical so he sat quietly in the little village watching the Anguish muggle who murdered his family would go threw as there own children were Killed by the other muggle in the village when they showed signs of Accidental magic.

eventually the Village would Die out and the well would run dry and The Wizards notes on his Potion would Eventually end up in the Department of Mysteries


** I doubt it. Voldemort doesn't actually care much about blood status, he just claims to so the purebloods will remain loyal to him. He /does/, genuinely, find Muggles despicable, but then, he finds /most/ people despicable anyway, so Muggles are only slightly worse. The rest is posing, plain and simple. At the end of the day, Voldemort would probably keep the Potion's existence a secret, keeping it around just in case but not letting on to the Death Eaters, because he'd rather not have a higher magical population who'd stand a better chance at overthrowing him.

** In my opinion he most certainly would not. Voldemort sees himself as "special" and better than other people. He hates everyone, really, even most of his followers. He only seized on the pureblood prejudice because those are the people who have money and power in the wizarding world. I don't know if he even hates muggles so much as he likes killing people, and muggles are easy to kill. He wouldn't want to give more people magic, because he likes being on top, he likes having people to terrorize.

** Voldemort, no. But I could see Grindelwald doing it, since his whole deal was destroying the Statute of Secrecy to have a wizard-ruled world.

** I like the story behind the potion but don't see Voldemort using it.
