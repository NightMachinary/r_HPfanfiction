  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

** Yes, Ginny.

I think about 95-97% of all the fics I've read have had her as a main character. She happens to be my favourite character in canon, but has some missed opportunities, as a result of the books' "Trio-focus". For example, her possession by Tom Riddle and her leading of the DA along with Neville and Luna in /Deathly Hallows/. Fanfiction permits me to fill the gap with regards to her character in canon, but also wonder how things could have happened differently (what if she was sorted into Slytherin, what if she remembered some of Tom Riddle's memories, etc.)

** As a /The Protagonist/?

I don't really care much for pureblood and wizard-raised points of view. Magic to them is /ordinary/. Ron, Draco, etc. for the most part just wouldn't be able to keep my interest in longer fics.

So Harry, Hermione, OCs, crossovers, etc. with a male lead bias.

As a group of protagonists? It varies, but nearly all of the ones I enjoyed had Harry as /a/ lead if not /the/ lead of the group. (counting this as "these three/five/whatever people are the main characters from the very start")

I don't much care for Marauders/Founders-era fics that don't have Harry or at least someone from books-era as a protagonist. Post-books can be interesting but the epilogue rubs me the wrong way, so using it for much more than a stepping stone to a crossover/timetravel/whatever tends to get skipped.

My favorite story archetype overall, though, is "Harry does something Harry-ish and makes everyone go 'WTF?!' and 'How the hell did you do that?!' and sometimes 'teach me!'"

** Hermione, Ginny, Harry. Hermione because so much of her backstory can be interpreted in different ways, and likewise her mental processes. Harry because he's great for AUs with little things changed because of his broad connections to most of the characters in the series. Ginny because canon gives us a tantalizing glimpse but isn't fully developed, and she is from her bare bones a very interesting character with familial pressure, interesting relationships with her parents and siblings, her own desires separate from her family's, traits of various Houses, unashamedly interested in boys, and also having a unique history of trauma and demon-possession, so there's lots of places you can take her character.

I prefer fandom Hermione to canon Hermione, who was kind of a mean person on a number of occasions. In fact, many of the canon characters are assholes. I don't want to read about people like that. Fandom Hermione tends to be a nice person.

Harry has the least personality in canon given how present he is in it. I've also found that most fanfic protagonist Harrys tend to be people I want to punch. It got to the point that, when I read [[http://www.yoonhalee.com/?cat=9][Yoon Ha Lee]]'s [[https://amazon.com/dp/B01EBE05X2/][hexarchate books]] recently, I was shocked that there were male characters who weren't jerks.

** Dumbledore, Snape, Ginny, Sirius, Molly, Petunia.

Dumbledore, because he is endlessly fascinating. He's such an interesting mixture of kindness and coldness, courage and cowardliness, confidence and self-disgust, emotion and emotional distance. There's so much ambiguity in his canon actions that you can interpret them forever and still find delight in it, and not to mention - that wonderful, wonderful backstory. Plus, you can't deny - Dumbledore's got style.

Snape, because he has so much anger and bitterness and emotion at the forefront, yet he also holds so much back, unknown to anyone but Dumbledore. He is bully and victim, he loves and hates and holds on to these feelings forever. His dynamics with Dumbledore and Sirius and Lupin and Harry and Draco and Death Eaters and his family - all are ripe for rich exploration, and his spying days are a naturally fascinating area for fanfic.

Ginny, because she is brash and bold and headstrong and confident. There is always an undercurrent of strong emotion beneath her skin. She has a perpetual chip on her shoulder regarding the way she is perceived, and it seems that she is a constant state of struggle with her family regarding her individuality and capabilities, which she fiercely defends (often upto the point of self destructiveness). She can be absolutely vicious when provoked, like when she unleashes her anger on Ron in HBP. She suffered trauma early on in her childhood that she seems to have overcome (except when she hasn't). She is flirty and unabashedly interested in boys, and I find explorations of her sexuality fascinating. There is no other female character in the series quite like her.

Sirius, because like Ginny, he too has heaps of barely restrained emotion just bubbling underneath his skin. Like Snape, he is bully and victim, and his flaws are laid bare in such a self-destructive manner. His story is endlessly tragic and just begs for both exploration and fix-its.

Molly and Petunia, because I find them to be really interesting explorations of gender roles and societal expectations. Molly, the loving, fussy homemaker, who accepts an orphan boy into her overcrowded home and heart with barely a blink, who is overprotective to a fault, who can be equally kind and malicious when it comes to protecting her charges. She is amazingly talented with a wand and yet refuses to work despite their need, who suffered huge loss of family in the first war, who seemingly married to from a well-to-do family to a poor one (even as she has to borrow her old family relative's tiara for her son's wedding). Petunia, who both longs for and despises magic, who holds to her bitterness with as much fierceness as her old mate Snape, who seeks escape in marrying the most boring person and living the most boring lifestyle imaginable, who hates Harry for who he is but still keeps him in her house at a risk to her family. There is very little fanfic about either of them, but whatever is there I cling to fiercely.

** Among characters whose personalities we know something about, I'd say *anyone but Harry or Draco*.

Harry's problem is that he was designed to have the setting revolve around him, and without that he has little to offer. Take away the Prophecy and the destiny (even if he is still an orphan), and Harry would be content to spend his time hanging out with friends, playing Quiddich, and maybe occasionally standing up for someone being bulled: a wholesome character, but a fairly ordinary one. He is Horatio, not Hamlet, in other words. There's a reason why fics that do something non-Voldemort-related with him tend to rewrite his character to the point of being unrecognisable.

Draco has a similar problem (snobby rich kid archetype), and while he might be given an interesting character arc, there's a good chance that his isn't the most interesting story in that setting.

If I had to pick one protagonist, I'd pick *Hermione*. Basically, she is generally curious, proactive, methodical, and occasionally ruthless, seeking out things and people to fix (even if they ain't broke in the first place), while being flawed enough that her actions will often blow up in her face in interesting ways. So, you don't need to give her an adventure that revolves around her, because she'll make her own. (This is, of course, assuming canon-ish Hermione. The flighty ingenue that shows up in a lot of Dramione fics is not, IMO, an interesting protagonist, for example.)

Harry was the perfect viewpoint character for the original series, but is rarely what I'm looking for in fanfiction; the original novels and films show us the broadstrokes of the HP world, and I want fanfiction to expand on all those background details and make all these potentialities a reality. Hermione's curiosity, Gryffindor drive, and mugglebornness make her an excellent audience surrogate to explore the HP world, point out its shortcomings, and seek to improve it; Harry's story is /his/ story, whereas Hermione's story is the story of her exploring the Wizarding World.

Harry (the canon Harry, anyway) isn't /curious/ about the Wizarding World; past book one, he mostly takes Hogwarts and magic for granted like any pureblood wizard and only studies enough magic to get decent grades (except for his favorite subjects). Hermione's curiosity and thirst for knowledge resonates much more with what the average HP fan would do if they found themselves at Hogwarts one fine morning of September, and thus she's a more identifiable lead.

While I like Hermione, I'd not agree with that statement. Between rapey centaurs, rigging the Quidditch tryouts, her misguided attempts at SPEW (Hogwarts has to be one of the best places for House Elves, why target it?) and not believing that Draco could be a Death Eater (she must know about the Hitler Youth and the Volkssturm) there are quite a few situations where her moral compass is questionable.

**** The problem with SPEW wasn't that she started at Hogwarts -- Hogwarts was the best place to start it, in fact. It's Dumbledore's domain, and the elves weren't owned by an individual, making it the safest place to start. If she changed policy for the better at Hogwarts alone, she still would have helped dozens of elves. And a precedent started at Hogwarts would get more eyes on it than one pureblood family's single house-elf becoming free.

The problem was that she didn't ask the house elves what help they needed, or how she could make their lives better within their moral bounds. She was treating them like objects, even as she was campaigning for the law to see them as people.

***** Look, I like Hermione, I really do (even the part where she leads Umbridge to the Centaur rape train), but the whole House Elf issue was half cooked at best. We don't know how they got to being bound servants. It could be the symbiosis thing, they could have lost a war they started and their servitude is their form of reparations, perhaps wizards created them to serve (like the Geth) or maybe they were brutally subjugated. Either way, for Hermione to immediately go to "DELIVERANCE TIME" is not really sensible. Perhaps no one really supported SPEW because they knew that the issue is not as black and white as she makes it out.

House Elves are generally eager to please, and it is not just conditioning because I doubt that the headmaster takes Hogwarts contingent to a punishment chamber once a week.

Do house elves require protection? Definitely. But liberation? What Hermione is trying to do reminds me very much of the Arab spring, where people fought for freedom at all costs, but things were far better while they were not free. Libya, Syria and Egypt have turned into shit ever since the revolution. The standard of living worsened significantly, the government became ineffective (with the exception of Syria, where you can actually live decently in Assads part, even if you are not free). The same thing happened pretty much anywhere where there was a recent intervention for freedom.

The House Elves are obviously not ready to live in freedom and forcing them would probably do more harm than good. She should have pushed for rights and education, not freedom at any cost.

They irritate me. I don't hate them, I just find myself disagreeing with the direction so many of the fics take and so I struggle to bring myself to read them.

*** For me it's quite the opposite, I drop any story with him playing a prominent part. What exactly do you like about him? Because to me he's just a coward who let a sickness define him instead of trying to live with it. He ran away from his pregnant wife, which is inexcusable in my book under any circumstances (marriage vows have an "in good and in bad times" clause for a reason) and then dumped part of the responsibility of raising a baby on a 17 year old virgin while he never took part in said boys life besides a short time where it was part of his job (and he also came close to killing Harry due to his sloppiness).

I fail to see what there is to like about Lupin. I mean, yes, being a werewolf is not easy, no argument there, but he was not locked into a cupboard for ten years after his parents were brutally murdered. Unless your name is Weasley or Malfoy, you are guaranteed a shitty childhood in the books, so he is not outstanding in that regard. At least he had two parents, which is more than you can say about quite a few characters.

What would you say are his redeeming/outstanding qualities?

**** I can honestly take or leave Lupin, but your comment seems to be on the order of 'Dumbledore is a manipulative bastard'--a possible interpretation but not a common or readily apparent one--and a rather strange way to respond in a question essentially asking someone their favorite character.

-ran away from his pregnant wife also equals trying to save the world his son will grow up in by helping the person prophesied to save it. Not his best moment, sure, but it's not too difficult to imagine someone wanting to leave their family because they think their presence could endanger them. (their marriage vows are kinda irrelevant since we don't know what they were)

-'dumped part of the responsibility of raising a baby on a 17 year old virgin'. To me this was more giving Harry the family connection he always wanted. 'Godfather' often is a ceremonial term and I know my parents made their will so my aunt and uncle, not godparents would take me in. It's pretty clear that Tonks's mother would be raising Teddy. (Whether Harry is a virgin or not is kinda irrelevant--for all we know Sirius could have been a virgin)

-never took part in said boy's life. I think most people would agree that telling someone stories of their parents, spending hours privately tutoring them in a notoriously difficult spell for extracurricular reasons, and covering for them with a colleague that is looking for reasons to see you sacked goes beyond 'part of the job description'. He also was friendly in the brief times they were able to meet and, IIRC, sent him letters and such.

-came close to killing Harry due to his sloppiness. And if he hadn't interrupted and Sirius was evil, or they somehow knocked Sirius out and Pettigrew got hold of a wand, they could have ended up dead too because Remus didn't show up in time.

Remus made time for Harry when no other adults did, listened to his concerns, and sacrificed a great deal of time to help him do something productive about them. He was kind to all his students too--remember bogart Snape?

He accepted the part of himself he hated and feared to infiltrate werewolf society for Dumbledore. He's quiet and mild and bookish, but he has a sense of humor and is willing to fight when he thinks it necessary.

For what it's worth too the things you mention in the first paragraph mostly happened in the 7th book, a book which had a major theme of adults being flawed and one which kills the character in question. Most of the (admittedly little) Remus fic I've read predates the 7th book.

**** What is great about him? Even if we exclude running from his pregnant wife, he did pretty much nothing but mope and be generally useless besides the thing he was paid for (and you can argue that he was a shitty Defence teacher because his explanation for the Patronus has big holes in it and he nearly killed/infected three students due to his own negligence).

Yes, he has a shitty life, but who doesn't in the HP series?

***** 1) Positive queer representation

2) A good and kind teacher

3) A good student, as a young man

4) Kind to outsiders

5) Reached out to and was a support for Harry, even defending him against Snape

We clearly have very different interpretations of the character though, and I'm not super invested in going through an argument to try and 'win'.

******* Yeah, but I feel that's just JKR backtracking on editorial wishes. Both Lupin and Tonks when introduced were /very/ strongly queer-coded and JK still holds to using lycanthropy as an analogy for AIDS. The character introduced with it? A single, unmarried man who shows no interest in women and has no canonical history of dating and is in a profession where he can be caring to children, and isn't particularly masculine, and has no male friends except Sirius Black which is only revealed at the very end of POA. Okay, JK, okay.

******** Tonks I definitely see as queer. I mean, if you can grow a pig nose, then you can grow a dick. We can only speculate how functional it would be from a reproductive point of view, but the ability alone qualifies as queer.

However, you should remember that Lupin didn't get his curse from participating in unprotected gay orgies in a werewolf nightclub during the full moon, but was infected at age six by a serial murderer. That would be more like getting raped as a child and contracting AIDS that way. Which admittedly sucks even more, but doesn't make him necessarily queer.

Sirius and/or Remus turns into Marauder wank and slash (Sirius/Remus) quite often, Malfoy/Riddle are out by default since those are usually "the Death Eaters did nothing wrong", the Longbottom ones are Neville wank and the ones involving Andromeda Tonks have him going to the Tonks at age 10 the earliest (and usually it's not straight up adoption because Dumbledore keeps meddling).

**** No. I don't really like first year fics. I just want the Harry to at least have the Dursleys background. I'm pretty flexible with what kind of personality he has, even if he's unrecognizable. It's super weird, I know, but even with a different personality, as long as he has that Dursleys history, I can connect him with /Harry./

** Harry, necessarily. If you don't have him as the main character, you're either writing something unrelated to the actual HP plot (which is totally fine, mind you), at which point every character can be made to work, or you're trying to force "maindom" on a plot that utterly relies on Harry to work, and I've never seen that working well.
