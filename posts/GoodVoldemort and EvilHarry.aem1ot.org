In all of the Good!Voldemort fics I've read Harry is still good, and In all of the Evil!Harry fics I've read Voldemort is still evil. Are there any fics where Harry and Voldemort's roles and the antagonist and the protagonist are completely switched?

​


** That's an interesting premise! Now I want to read this too! Maybe their moralities or some such switched places when the killing curse backfired?

I can just imagine Voldemort possessing Quirrel just so he could get into Hogwarts to talk to Dumbledore.

/...Quirrell entered the Headmaster's office. Dumbledore looked up at him through his half moon glasses, intrigued./

/"You wanted to see me, Quirinus?"/

/"Y-Yes, Headmaster, there's something of absolute importance regarding the Phy-Phylosopher's S-Stone that we must discuss!"/

*/"Let me ssssspeak to him!"/*

/Dumbledore rose up from his seat cautiously, his wand at the ready upon hearing the disembodied voice. Quirrell started to unravel his turban, his hands shaking. As the fabric fell away, he turned around. A twisted, humanoid face looked back at Dumbledore from the back of his head. The eyes were slitted and red./

/Dumbledore raised his wand, a spell already on his lips, when Quirrell raised his arms to stall him, his joints bending backwards in an unnatural angle./

/"Wait! I come in peace! I have searched far and wide for magic that finally allowed me to reach you... I must warn you! We must protect the stone... from Harry Potter!"/

/Dumbledore's hand stilled, and it was only by years of practise that he did not drop the wand. He trained it on the alien face carefully./

/"Are you the one I suspect you to be?"/

/"Yes, it it I, Lord Voldemort. You were right not to think me dead. But there are things even you do not know"/

/"Tell me everything."/

**** Glad you enjoyed it :)

I'm thinking Harry would have to be secretly (or not secretly) very cunning, actually well versed in magic, and aspire for world domination for this setup to be anywhere near interesting about two paragraphs on. Otherwise, we're a little unbalanced with two REALLY powerful (now mostly) light wizards on one side and a 11 year old naive scrawny boy on the other. But what would his driving force be? And where would he get the practise in if he's still underage? Would he be able to bypass magical monitoring at home that early on? What would happen to the Dursleys? Wouldn't that ruin any power-curve before the story's even begun?

But there's a possibility he flies under the radar and becomes so sinister and threatening that Dumbledore and Voldemort have to go on a quest to activate all of the horcruxes to defeat him with sheer number of Toms... huh. Maybe because They'd decided to just watch him and provide gentle guidance early on, and then all hell broke loose?

Where even would Harry be sorted? Gryffindor? Slytherin? Or the ever so not-suspicions Hufflepuff? (talk about a master plan) Who would Harry's friends be? Surely not the regular suspects?

/"But Tom, old friend, surely you are mistaken. Young Harry is a bright, reasonable, well adjusted boy. Wouldn't hurt a fly. Why, he's brilliant with the other Hufflepuffs!"/

/"Hufflepuffs?"/

/"A whole gaggle of them! His new group of friends follow him everywhere, and it's only the second week of term!"/

/"A band of... loyal, devoted... friends, you say?"/

/After all, Hufflepuffs are loyal, and unafraid of toil... And ridding the magical world of vermin sounds like a gruelling job. But young Harry makes the future sound so promising! Brotherhood, unity, and equality for all.../ */who survive./*

***** Maybe a sort of time travel thingamajig where older evil harry was transported back to his younger body, and that's how he knows the magic? As a baby he imperioed his mother maybe? Last time I saw a "good" voldemort against an "evil" harry was a fic I forgot the name of, and I don't remember much, but I remember it ended with Voldemort and some other survivors including Hagrid doing a last stand on Azkaban against Harry, who turned into a monster after he was bit by the basilisk i think?

****** I completely forgot about the option to time travel because it's so whacky in canon. But yeah, a self fulfilling time loop could work I guess. That fanfic you mention sounds pretty badass too. So many options!

*********** There was this guy called Prince Arthas. His kingdom got infected by this strange plague. He went to investigate and found out that the plague turned his people into the undead. He purged the city of Stratholme to prevent the plague and the undead from spreading. He later learned that a Dreadlord Mal'ganis was behind the plague. Arthas gathered his forces and went north, to the icy cold lands of Northrend. There he attemted to kill Mal'ganis but his vast undead forces proved to o tought to even get to him. Arthas' friend told him of a Legend of an increadibly strong Blade called Frostmourne. Luckily for Arthas the blade was nearby. Upon accuiring the blade, Arthas found that it sliced through the undead like a hot knife through butter. He found Mal'ganis and killed him. Before dead Mal'ganis told Arthas that the voice of Frostmourne Arthas was hearing was the Lich King speaking to him through the blade. Lich King then had Arthas butcher his father. Later on Arthas met another Dreadlord who told that quote.

Keep in mind that this was as brief as I could make it. I skipped over some things

This isn't exactly what you're looking for because there's still a good Harry, but it's close. A good Harry gets thrown into an alternate dimension with another Harry as the dark lord, and Tom Riddle as the boy who lived. Unfortunately, it's abandoned, but what's there is pretty good. The alternate dimension has quite a few other characters in it who also switch from good to evil.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
