hey,

Can anybody suggest complete, but long stories? I'm a fan of the longer stories. I currently enjoy time travel ones, but I'm open to almost anything.


** That is a rather vague request, but I recommend the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/DLP-5-Starred-and-Featured-Authors/84507/][DLP 5-Starred Archive]]. You can filter the contents of the C2 to display only complete stories with large word counts, and most of the stories have been vetted by a community of discerning readers. You should also spend some time exploring this subreddit, as folks are always posting great story recs here, like on this [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1m3awb/time_travel_fics/][thread about time travel]].

Also, read the [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity]], because I consider it to be the pinnacle of what fanfiction can be.

*** I did not like the Alexandra Quick series at all and stopped after the second book. Would not recommend to anyone.

** If you enjoy slash (and I'm fully aware that not everyone on this subreddit does), you can sort searches by word count on [[http://www.ao3.org][AO3]]. You can filter by pairing and if you check the box labelled "complete" it will return only those. FFN is not the only game in town.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4324404/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Pendant-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Pendant of Slytherin by Neednotknowtheirname]] is the longest single novel of HP I've read that I've thoroughly enjoyed.

Wonderful 6/7 year story. It follows the logic that it's the Chamber of Secret*s*, meaning more than one, and he finds many, including an artifact that allows apparition inside and out of Hogwarts, the founders library, and a very unsuspected friendship (I will say it's not voldy, and it's somewhat guessable from the title and knowledge of canon.) among other things. No slash in it.

** DH. Neville, Ginny, Luna and the DA versus Snape and the Carrows. 7th year at Hogwarts. Some people seem to dislike it, but IMO it's an AMAZING story - just really great, even if it makes things far more dangerous even than they seemed in DH, with an extremely gory final battle. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledore-s-Army-and-the-Year-of-Darkness]]

AU of Philosopher's Stone. Before first year, Snape sees 'The Cupboard Under the Stairs' on Harry's address and goes to investigate. Features Mentor!Snape, non-Gryffindor!Harry and a somewhat Manipulative!Dumbledore. Really great AU of Philosopher's Stone with some lovely friendships and a very satisfying Flamel/Stone/Quirrelmort plot as well. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The_Best_Revenge]]

A redo of DH, mainly canon-compliant, but 'fixed' by a fan to be more awesome, with less camping, less Expelliarmus, and a Harry with a plan. My verdict: great fun, and really feels like a Harry Potter book. Love the way they enlist the help of lots of different people and travel a bit more. Also liked how the whole Petunia/Lily fallout was fleshed out, and the deeper insight into Voldemort's mind. And yay for some great characters avoiding death! Two issues I have with it: the ending falls a little flat, and it cut out some of my favourite parts of the original book. [[http://m.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/dho/a/0001.html]]

Snape/Lily, AU. Mulciber pranks Lily instead of Mary Macdonald, which is the catalyst for Snape turning away from the Dark Side. Amazing story with believable Snily in the first half and an epic war/battle plot in the second half. I love that despite being Snily, there's a fair and balanced depiction of James as well in this fic. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4026081/1/The-Wrath-of-the-Half-Blood-Prince]]

Lupin/Tonks, AU after Bill and Fleur's wedding. They follow a different and darker path to canon. Due to certain actions in the heat of the moment, Lupin is forced to stay with the werewolves as he has lost his place in the Order. He decides to take over from the inside and ally the werewolf army with the Order and gain werewolf rights along the way. AWESOME fic! [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4764695/1/Lord-of-the-Werewolves]]

Andromeda/Ted. The definitive fic on their relationship, even if the timeline is messed up (they're the same age as James and Lily - and Remus!). First-person Andromeda's POV, starting pre-Hogwarts all the way until school finishes. This story is wonderful - it's so much more than just the romance: it's also about what it means to be a Black, the relationship between the 3 sisters, and Bella's slow descent into darkness. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2489360/1/A-Keen-Observer]]

Merope survives to raise her son Tom. Multi-chaptered AU. Unfortunately this one is incomplete, but it's just so GOOD that I had to include it. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3221511/1/The-Right-Hand-Path]]

AU. Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours. This one is dark, violent and utterly fantastic. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute]]

One-shot, but it says so much in so few words that it is absolutely worth the read. Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war. Simple and absolutely beautiful - only downside is it has me wishing the photos were real so I could see them. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]]

A Regency era Draco/Hermione fic featuring a marriage of (in)convenience. Rated R (for a single scene). Draco Malfoy has in recent years stepped back from the politics of the pureblood extremist group the Isolationists, as he suspects his son might be a Squib. He needs someone to teach his son how to cope in the Muggle world for a non-magical future, and to this end he hires Hermione Granger, Muggle-born, in need of employment. Absolutely brilliant, and so enjoyable. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/21214]]

HBP missing moments. Dean/Luna, background Harry/Ginny. Dean's taking the break-up a little hard, for some reason he keeps running into Luna Lovegood, and he's lost a rather compromising painting of Ginny. AMAZING, just lovely, and very in-character Luna and great fleshing out of Dean. Chaptered, but not incredibly long. [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/heronmy_weasley/TTTA01.html]]

Harry/Draco, rated NC-17 (but with a strong plot). This is one part of a dual story where Harry/Draco and Albus Severus/Scorpius is going on at the same time. Fully DH-compliant, believe it or not. Really brilliant, though I preferred the Harry/Draco half. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951565/1/The_Slytherin_Gryffindor]]

The Albus/Scorpius half of the above. I read this one first, but I think it makes more sense to read the Harry/Draco half first. Still works either way though. NC-17, but with a plot. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951559/1/The_Slytherin_Hufflepuff]]

Harry/Draco. Draco has found and fixed an 'If Sieve', a magical device which can show alternate realities if people had made different choices. He tries many combinations to see if he could ever have been friends with Harry Potter. Absolutely brilliant - and heartbreaking how much Draco wants to be friends with Harry. This may be my favourite H/D ever. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78806/chapters/104944]]

Harry/Draco. One-shot sequel to the above. Makes the open ending of 'The If Sieve' a little more complete. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78822]]

Harry/Ginny, written post-OotP. For once Ginny is the target rather than Harry. When a malicious Portkey transports them away from the Weasley's new safe house, they barely escape and must spend the rest of the summer with Ginny's crotchety Aunt Martha. Really great story with a beautifully developed friendship and romance between Harry and Ginny, and a great plot with a mystery to solve and bad guys as well. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=4384]]

Written post-GoF but set post-Hogwarts/post-Voldemort. Dudley's contacted Harry for the first time since he left Privet Drive to tell him that his daughter is a 'freak' whom he wants nothing to do with. Harry decides to adopt her. Just really fun, sweet, and with a gripping plot as well. [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=106&chapno=1]]

** I really liked [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] by GreenGecko on fanfiction.net. It's a Snape adopting Harry fic but it's really long and even has two equally long sequels. Very well written.
