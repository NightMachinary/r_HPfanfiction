A good portion of magical Britain ends up witnessing the graveyard scene.


** But wouldn't Voldemort through "Moody" be aware of that and take steps to disable the cameras?

*** An idea would be to have Moody just disabled or "break" Harry's camera. Not expecting him to go together with Cedric.

So everyone would be seeing, or hearing, it from Cedrics point of view, starting with the killing curse.

*** Cedric? The body cam probably wouldn't be disabled on death

** There's this long and AU fic which somehow addresses this. It's been a long time since I read it but basically, Harry Potter was brought up by Sherlock Holmes and John Watson from BBC's Sherlock. A TON of new characters are introduced so a lot of changes are made. One of these was the introduction of television to the Wizarding world. Harry isn't a Triwizard champion here but he's one of the MWN's cameramen. Here's the relevant chapter: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/80/]]

** This is exactly linkffn(13197260). It is really hard to come up with something original in the HP fanfiction.

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

**** No, it is not. My mum (now long time retired) was a book editor all her life, and when reading fanfiction stories I can now fully appreciate how important her job was. 90% (to be generous, it might be worse) of all stories could be cut to half (or more, some a way more) with huge improvement in quality as result. Yes, this is one of them. I appreciated non-smut fem!Harry though.

***** Yeah i do too, and with the name of the fic, and the whole premise of the story, i really just wanted to get to the final task. To find out the fic basically wnds with the final task? I feel cheated.
