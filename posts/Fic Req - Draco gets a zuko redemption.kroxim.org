Looking for fics where draco get a zuko (tLA) redemption. My idea is along the lines of,

- Draco want to join DA in yr5 but doesnt want to openly, so he and harry begin a casual meet up to discuss/hang.
- Harry and Draco kinda become friendly, but then Draco is sort of forced to join the inquisitorial squad, and breaks the friendship he and Harry were making.
- this loss of trust continues in yr6 where harry is adamant Draco up to something.
- but all is redeemed when Draco helps Harry and Hermione escape Malfoy Manor, and joins them cause he realised he didnt want to be like his father.
- he fights for hogwarts in the battle.

Doesnt need to have a pairing/is fine if there are pairings.


** Zuko's redemption arc sits on a plinth where all other redemption arcs may gaze upon its greatness and aspire to its perfection.

** Draco getting a Zuko redemption arc is literally what I look for in every Draco fic I read haha. While I don't know if I've read something as specific as your request, it sounds interesting!

** linkffn(A Matter of House) has a few of these elements, but not as an overwhelming focus.

** It's funny but honestly Recnac Transfaerso and the sequel Flawed Perfection have a very solid Zuko redemption arc for draco, in my opinion. There's even a similar element of confused/conflicted feelings like when Aang asks if he and Zuko could have been friends once. The arc is extremely convincing, and maybe best of all, draco doesn't immediately get the trust of Harry's friends as soon as Harry trusts draco (same way katara takes extra time to trust zuko even after everyone else begins to accept him). For the non-draco elements, recnac transfaerso and flawed perfection are fantastic fics. I have yet to find another fic that matches up to the quality of these, but I'm keeping an eye out.
