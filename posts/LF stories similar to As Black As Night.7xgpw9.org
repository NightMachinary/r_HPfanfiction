Hey everyone.

I am looking for more stories similar to the titled. ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7936530/1/As-Black-As-Night]]). I guess it's politics? I love the way it's written.

I really would love more stuff with Sirus in it, or any black family members. I don't care about bashing / sexuality of people / time travel etc. I'm not fussed if the main char is not from the original series. I don't care about its rating. I'd /love/ for it to be complete, but if it's long and has a good story, even if I'll be frustated it's not finished, I'll consider reading it. Doesn't have to be from a Blacks point of view. They can be evil (I've actually yet to read a story where the main story is based around an "evil" character, except for one ages ago where Harry was raised by Voldemort) or it can be "light".

I also love me some history, so bonus points if it's historical.
