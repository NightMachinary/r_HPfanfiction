Hey guys I am looking for similar fics to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5087671/1/Runic-Animagi][Runic Animagi by Kassien.]]

It is a post OotP fic in which Harry takes up his role as Lord Potter but without the usual political stupidity. The fic has no bashing and a Harry/Daphne pairing.

It was pretty funny and well written for the most part and I would like to read something similar.

--------------

*Requirements*

- No bashing or very little

- No slash

- No H/Hr (Sorry Hermione lovers but I see them as siblings not romantic interests.)

- No sooner than GoF

- No Severitus (I think that's it.. I don't really like Snape so I don't like it when they both forget their hatred for each other and become friends or God forbid have a father/son relationship.)


** The Grass is Always Greener (sorry for lack of Link I am on Mobile)- Harry/Daphne. This is one of those standard Harry/Daphne. To Fight the Coming Darkness- I cannot recommend this fic enough. It is probably one of the best written pieces I have ever read. Basically anything from James Spookie is good. The Lion series of his is another Haphne series that is great.

*** Yeah I have read both of these specific ones and all of James Spookie's. All of them are great.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]] is another amazing Harry/Daphne

  Daphne Greengrass always had a plan. She liked being organized. But the Dark Lord's return at the end of her fifth year derailed everything, and now she must decide who will best help her find the life she always wanted.

**** Not the only redhead, is also really really good. (Harry/Susan) I would also recommend the Fourth Champion. finally I know it has nothing to do with your post, but I just finished A Black Comedy and Taking Control both of which were really really good.

***** Yeah I have been here for a while so I have read all of these.

At this point I am even reading abandoned fics.

After reading James Spookie's fics about 10 times each they lose their touch, although it has been a few months... Well I'm off to binge read James Spookie.

Here's another generic recommendation. The amazing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9510186/1/Terminal-Justice][Terminal Justice]]. One of the best fics I've ever read.
