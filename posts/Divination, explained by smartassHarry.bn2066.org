"Well, that was a fascinating experience, don't you think, Hermione?"

"Harry, I've always thought of you as a rational boy, why do you suddenly seem to believe in this superstitious nonsense?"

"Because it's not?"

"Seriously? Predicting the future is impossible! And by drinking tea? How would that even work?"

"Hermione, you know more about future events than anyone else in the castle during Arithmancy on Monday and Runes on Thursday. You of all people should know it's not impossible for information to exist before the event that creates it."

"That's completely different! And how do you even know about the time turner?"

"Ah, so it's called a time turner? Good to know. I just figured out that you time traveled because it says so on your schedule. And Divination isn't that different. Didn't you read the advanced theory?"

"Uh.... I didn't, I wanted to use my valuable time with something more logical."

"Well, I did, and here's what I found: When you perform Divination, you basically create a spell, send it into the future, the spell grabs some random bits of information and travels back in time to the moment it's cast and releases the information."

"Wait, casting a spell? All we did was drinking tea!"

"That's because it has no incantation or wand movement, it's cast wandlessly and silently through the intent of wanting to see the future."

"And the tea?"

"The spell has to return the information somehow. The tea, or the crystal ball or whatever you use just creates a random pattern. The returning spell influences the randomness and dumps the information it gathered into it."

"That makes sense, I guess, but why didn't Professor Trelawney explain it that way instead of all that inner eye nonsense?"

"I guess because time travel is supposed to be a secret. It also gets the students to focus on their mind, which is basically the same as with any other wandless magic. I guess that it's the easiest way to explain it to people who haven't read dozens of books about how wandless magic works."

"And why didn't she use tea or a crystal ball when she made all these vague predictions during class?"

"She probably used an advanced version where the spell dumps the gathered information directly into her mind. From what I've read it's similar to Legilimency. It's still just as vague as the normal method since without knowing the future, it's almost impossible to direct the spell to the important information. I guess most of her predictions will come true in a way nobody expected. That's why Divination is relatively easy but getting actually useful information is incredibly hard. True Prophecies are a bit different, they are triggered by the event in the future instead of by the diviner in the present, which is why they appear randomly and their information is usually somewhat useful."

*** I agree about the theory, but disagree with you on characterization. A smarter Harry would have meant more sarcastic gems. Plus, canon Hermione's best trait is her loyalty. Open-mindedness isn't really something she embraces. Frankly, I love these oneshots because I feel Hermione's opinions and decisions should have been challenged.

Personally, I'd love to see an interaction between a smart Harry and Hermione that isn't bashing or romance.

  Alchemy is the art of permanently turning one element into another. That's something muggles can do, too. One-shot where Hermione kills Voldemort by nuking Malfoy Manor.

That was only in the initial hardback version of HBP. It was corrected in a later version -
