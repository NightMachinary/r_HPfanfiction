I just finished reading the books and noticed this. Harry is the descendant of the third Peveral brother and voldemort's materal side, the gaunts, are descendent of the second brother.

Thought this is a very interesting fact which is never explicitly mentioned in the books.


** As inbred as the British Wizarding world is, Harry is probably distantly related to everybody who's not foreign or muggle-born. (Unless you think Muggleborns are from sqib lines, in which case he's related to them, too.)

*** What I meant was that you can track back their lineage. And by your logic everyone is related to everyone else, including us, which is true.

***** On the old-style reddit, it's on the sidebar, just below where you subscribe(at least with RES installed). I'm not sure where the setting resides on the new reddit layout.

EDIT

OK. On the new layout, it's under "COMMUNITY OPTIONS" just below the "CREATE POST" button

***** Oh, on the side where it says "Community Options" under the large "Create Post" button, just hit the arrow and then click the pencil. You have to make your own flair and you can't use the custom badges from [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]. I just copy and pasted a snake emoji in.

** Yes.

This could also possibly mean that Harry's is technically the heir of Slytherin by not only being Voldemort's closest relative, but also by conquest. (I think, I can't really find anything about defeating someone in a duel and winning heirship or lordship.)

*** I've read a few stories that have used the rite of conquest. Most of them had Harry become Slytherin's heir by defeating Voldemort three times (as a toddler, Quirrell, and the diary), but one took the position that TMR died in 1981. Sure, he didn't pass on, and Voldemort was resurrected some years later, but Tom Riddle was dead, and thus, no longer the heir of Slytherin.

Not that long ago, I read one that had Harry become the heir of Slytherin, and stated that the inheritance had to be tracked up from the Gaunts to the second Peverell brother, then back down through Ignotus back to Harry.

** I remember one fanfic I read had Lily explicitly being Voldemort's /cousin/, as she was descended from one of the Gaunts that was /actually/ a squib, and booted out of the family for being even more muggle than Merope.

#+begin_quote
  On Halloween 1994, Harry learns his mind isn't his own. On Samhain morn, he vows to question everything. Armed with logic and an unlikely ally, Harry makes a last ditch bid to reclaim his life. The goal: survive at all costs.
