Given that there have been several requests for that pairing recently, I've decided to share it here.

It is a collection of several scenes with Katie's personality inspired by a classmate I knew at school who was great fun to be around but probably not someone you'd want to introduce as your girlfriend (or to your parents at all). It also includes several scenes from my own school days which probably seem a little too outlandish to be believable.

Rated M, I have to say that the rating is mostly for language.

  Looking back, Harry had to admit that he might have missed a cue or ten. But to be fair, some of them might have been a little unusual.

** Loved it. Ever since I heard of this pairing I've wondered why Harry didn't pay more attention to the girls he knew best in school aside from Ginny and Hermione: his teammates

*** I'm glad you've enjoyed this fic. If you want more with Harry and his team mates, look for Quaffles and Broomsticks, which is a smutty yet plot driven Harry/Angelina fic which I can't link here due to rule 8.

** Ya know, reading the Cho segment kinda makes me want to see a perspective where Cho, regretful over her accusations and a little annoyed at Marietta for basically being a fuck up herself, finds out that her actions pushed Harry and Katie together and lost her boyfriend.

*** Cho with an almost Snape-esque arc would definitely be interesting.
