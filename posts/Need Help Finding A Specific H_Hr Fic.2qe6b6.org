I read this particular fic over a year ago, but it's since proven extremely difficult to search for on ff.net.

Here's what I remember: H/Hr, Post Hogwarts, rated M, longer than 40k words, it's complete but I don't know if it's listed as such.

Plot: Hermione comes home to the apartment she shares with Harry (and Ron I think) after finding out that Harry has a job as a stripper.

That's all I can remember. I don't even remember if I liked it the first time I read it. I've plugged every combination of variables I can think of into ff.net's search function, but I can't find it. If someone could help me find this one, I'd be grateful.

Thanks in advance for any help you're able to provide.
