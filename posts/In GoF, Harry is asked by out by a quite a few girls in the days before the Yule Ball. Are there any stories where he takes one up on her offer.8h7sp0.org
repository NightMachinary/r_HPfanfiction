  A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so taken aback he said no before he'd even stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean's, Seamus's, and Ron's taunts about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.

The paragraph in question. Obviously no slash pls.


** I'm more curious as to the description of the fifth year girl. Is it because she was being intimidating, or was she big/muscular like Bulstrode?

So a not straight ship is a romantic relationship with not one man and one woman.

****** Well, 100% of fanfic porn is written by fanchildren who want excuses to write whatever the fuck pairing you want. 98% is unfair. Hell, all het romantic fics are just excuses to write guy on girl romance. Slash may have a higher percentage of porn compared to pure romance, but imo that's just a personal preference. I could give you all my theories on why that might be the case, but then this would go on forever :P

*** From the very early days of Star Trek fanfic, when it was circulated in (badly) mimeographed fanzines. Kirk-slash-Spock stories, shortened to "slash" stories. Sufficiently popular (by the standards of the time, most zines had a /tiny/ circulation) that there sarcastic remarks about the matter in the novelisation of Star Trek The Motion Picture. Eventually became genericised to all same-sex romance and/or smut fanfiction.
