I was reading one of SS/HG fanfics and suddenly I got this idea. I want to read fic or fics where Snape and Hermione time travel to Marauders era in their 16 year old body. I want Snape to have romance with Hermione and not Lily. Maybe it would be kinda awkward because Snape was so confused by Hermione's sudden appearance but they got along and determined to end the war as soon as they could. Of course their relationship would grow along their adventure.

If anyone knows or wants to write this, please tell me. I'll gladly wait for you. Thank you

Edit : Both Snape and Hermione did time travel


** There are several fics out there that involve Hermione traveling to mauraders era and having a teenage romance with Snape...

Edit: her minor auto changed from Hermione

*** I think you meant that Hermione time travel to Marauders era. I wanted fics where both Snape and Hermione did the time travel. Thank you though
