Are there any fics where Harry AND his partner travels back in time. NOT Harry/Ginny! Pairing that no one in the past would expect would be preferable, like Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Fleur... ect.


** Here's the only fic I know of where both Harry and Voldemort accidentally go back in time together:

  */Flight/* by Miraculous and RedHorse | 76k+ words | Complete

  (on Archive of Our Own)

  A magical accident in the Time Room leaves Harry and Voldemort stranded in the past. Harry learns that nothing about the magical world in the 1940s is truly familiar, and Voldemort discovers there's much more to Harry than he ever suspected.

It's an eventual HP/LV fic and has some unique worldbuilding about Tom Riddle's past that I found interesting.

**** That depends on which parts of the fic you want to see more of.

Here are some more 'Harry travels to the 1940s' fics (these are both WIP HP/TMR):

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13377375/chapters/30637173][The All Seeing Eye Glass]]

Here are some HP/LV fics with similarly dark themes:

I might be able to recommend some others if you tell me a little more about what you'd like to read.

***** First of all thank you for the recs. I love well written Harry/Voldemort fics and I actually already read "In Somno Veritas" a few times. I'll take a look at the other fics for sure. I also love MoD Harry fics as well as time travel fics. Drarry and Tomarry are probably my favorite ships. At the moment I'm also quite into Dean/Seamus fics as well as Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint fics (which is a really good pairing that I only recently discovered) so if you happen to know some good fics I wouldn't mind getting some more recs since you seem to know some pretty good ones.
