I realized i'm being a bit stifling to myself looking for specific elements so I decided I'd ask for something broader, specifically good writing in regards to the characters.

PLEASE reply to the categories listed as I hope to see a lot of good responses here.

*** A) I am incredibly impressed by the work you put into this post.

B) The best characterization of two utterly minor and nearly non-existent characters from canon are Sturgis Podmore and Mulciber in linkffn(Lesser Evils by ScottPress). They have their own goals they are working towards, interesting dynamics with other characters and they feel like an ogre (which, as you should know from Shrek, ogres have layers).

*** I feel like this one is hard since there are so many different characterizations of him that I get seriously confused as to what is actually canon and what is not. My suggestions are not exactly canon, but generally very consistent with in their own AU's.

linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) I really like Harry's character in this one. He is such a good mix of sassy, sarcastic, rebellious, not overpowered, just a teenager with a heart of gold trying to get by and do what he feels is right. I like how kind he is and how he still has a thing for saving people.

linkffn(The never-ending road) Fem!Harry fic that I feel really stays true to Harry's character if Harry was born a girl. Harry has that sassy humour thing going to deal with problems, often talks back to authority figures and often goes off to do things on her own, but also wants to trust adults around her such as Dumbledore and Sirius. Has a sweet friendship going with Hermione.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) Very AU Harry character, but very consistent with the slow influence of Tom Riddle Horcrux in his head.

*** Nonjon writes a very consistent Harry (in each fiction), who is definitly almost always "chaotic good".

In most cases he's witty, powerful (and knows how to use his power and his limits), not afraid, and faces problems head on - with not really being angsty or whiny.

He really crafted his own Harry and writes him really well.

While his Harry does come closer to canon Harry than most I think nonjon deliberately changes his Harry a bit - but he does so consistently.

I may just not be remembering correctly since I only read a few chapters of some, but Harry in his fics doesn't seem close to canon Harry at all. From what I remember, he has this kind of assholeish behavior sometimes, a lot of the humour is so vulgar and sex based and his character seems completely different.

***** Yes, his humor is certainly different, and often he is a jerk, I agree. I enjoy the stories even with that, but I can totally see why it could put someone off.

However, in nonjon's stories he still (mostly) does the right thing because it is the right thing, and just pretends he does so because fun (which gets mostly more obvious towards the end when he has difficult decisions to make).

And that part to me is the core of canon!Harry: He tries to be as good as possible.

Also, while Harry is often a jerk, he very obviously tries to avoid harming people who didn't earn it, and even then he isn't particularly cruel.\\
This is a better characterization than in any Lord Potter or indy!Harry story, where he is hurtful and cruel, which doesn't fit Harry at all imo.

All of this makes him kind of similar to canon which is wby I wrote it - and certainly within the story nonjon's Harry is consistent.

*** /I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love/, linkffn(11923164) This one doubles as a good Luna fic too. Strictly a friendship fic, very much in line with canon. Somehow manages to have fairly in-character Snape, Luna, and Harry, which is an accomplishment. Read it thanks to seeing a recommend in this sub.

/A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles/, linkffn(7937889), is a Snape-centered fic that details his life. I'm currently reading this one and haven't finished it yet, but the characterization is pretty decent. It's generally from his POV, so he doesn't exactly see Harry & co. kindly -- not bashing, just his own warped lens with which he sees the world. There is some downplaying of a few traits/motivations, but it never really seems to go into full-on whitewashing. There was also one thing that rang very, very false for me, [[/spoiler][namely Snape being physically abusive towards Lily, wtf]], but other than that, it's been one of the better characterizations of Snape that I've read.

That second fic was also from a recommend in this sub.

*** "To Know You Is To Love You" is about Ron and Hermione going through a somewhat unorthodox couple's counselling, in which they both get to intimately examine each other's lives, from their early childhoods and through their Hogwarts years, the war with Voldemort and beyond. Features excellent characterisation and development for both Ron and Hermione, but keep in mind there are some sexy parts here...

"Eternal Sunshine of the Scourgified Mind" sees Harry, Ron and Hermione as amnesiacs; after the last battle with Voldemort they've all forgotten anything and everything tied to their magical lives, including each other. Fic sort of focuses on all three of them, but Ron ends up as the main character in the later parts of the story. Technical writing isn't the best, but Ron is GREAT in this story.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

After Voldemort's fall, Draco is forced to live without magic, for five years. As he runs, both from Wizarding society and his past, Draco must survive in the Muggle world. I particularly like Draco's characterization in this fic because it's very slow and gradual. He doesn't suddenly stop becoming prejudiced overnight, it's a process that takes lots of time (with more than a few steps backwards).

*** I personally was a bit disappointed with how Voldemort seemed so black-and-white in the later books. From what we know he was a brillant student, but as Voldemort he made so many stupid mistakes... A lot of it can be explained as him going mad because of the horcruxes and all, but since I love him as a character I enjoy reading about a more "sane" Voldemort - still a psychopath, murderous saddest, but an intelligent one. So some stories by Lady Miya (AO3) are really interesting to me. It's not everybody's cup of tea, but I love seeing him portrayed as a genius, manipulative, evil guy who can still feel emotions - just uses them. Especially in Hermione pairings, when she grows as an equaly intelligent and manipulative person, they can complement each other really well. Shared Flame by Lady Miya is my absolute favorite for this reason.

  Neville's seventh year at Hogwarts presents many challenges, but he is his parents' son. This was originally written for the springtime gen exchange on livejournal. Thank you to kennahijja for beta-reading.

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor. I hope she laughed at them, hard. Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

*** "Before I Knew" and "This Is Where" are slice-of-life companion stories which both look at Harry's school years as seen from the POV of his Gryffindor year-mates. "Before I Knew" centers on Dean and Seamus, while "This is Where" centers on Lavender and Parvati.

Keep in mind, both stories eventually end up as slash (femmeslash in the case of the Lavender/Parvati one), but it's not graphic and characterisations are excellent, and I'd say the stories are worth reading because they have some of the best, mosth three-dimensional and sympathetic presentations of these four characters I've ever seen in a fanfic.

The writer really captures the feel of growing up and struggling with the idea that you might be attracted to people your own sex.

  When she was small, Susie's aunt Amelia had taken her to work whenever her parents asked her to babysit. She toddled around her office. When Susie was older, she got to sit under her aunt's desk in court and listen to her give out rulings, verdicts, decrees. There was tradition there, scripts and structure, and Susie had felt herself lean into them, comforted, strengthened. Over the years, she saw so many ways the system could be corrupted. Umbridge used it like a blunt weapon and blood purists had snuck into it for years like burrowing termites, undermining the foundations, making it their own home.When Susan Bones was twenty-three she would look across her steaming mug and the Ministry breakroom table, and see Hermione aching to burn it all down to ashes. Susan wanted to scour it to its roots, instead, wear it down to its rebar and concrete, and then rebuild from the old, worn foundations on up.“Your parents died for you,” Susie told Harry Potter once. “My aunt died for this. Now either shut up and get me a fresh cup of coffee or try to drag me out of here before I finish this.”But that was a war away. That was a childhood away from now.
