As the first story ends the author talks about the sequel. Has it ever been posted anywhere? Also does anyone know if the author just uploads complete stories instead of chapter by chapter?


** AP1 is currently undergoing a pretty major rewrite, which is necessary before the sequel can get underway.

*** Are you the author? Good work if so. I can't wait for the sequel. I'm already on chapter 2 of "The One He Feared" after learning about it on this thread this morning. :)

As far as I know it's not written yet. Taure's main focus now is The One He Feared, a fic where Harry gets all the knowledge and skills of Dumbledore.

**** It is starting to get interesting. I had no idea where the story was going at first -- I thought it was going to be Dumbledore in Harry's body but that fortunately turned out not to be the case -- but I liked the last two chapters. It is now clear to me he's going not for an AU, but rather a skilled Harry fic where the simple fact Harry is not the passive idiot he was in the official last book is driving all the changes.

If you liked Alexandra Potter, this very much has the same style so you'll probably like it.
