** I believe that Dumbledore is a few things listed here:

a) Dumbledore is a succesfull politician and in being so, necessarily, also a manipulator. He knows how to bring people to his view of things and how to use clout.

b) A well educated and philosophically inclined idealist.

c) An extremely powerful mage.

d) A genuinely good person.

We've gone through many threads about this, but once again I'll argue from a point of view that /includes/ the "necessities of the story". That means that I keep in mind that Rowling needed Harry to be the hero, and nobody else.

So argument number one: The traps to the mirror room were never meant to keep Voldemort off, but only functioned as fancy alert systems. The real trap was the mirror. And we know from the book that Voldemort would have failed at that stage. He wanted the stone for himself, and therefore he was completely locked out from it. It was a perfect safe for the stone against one singular thief.

And who is to say that the Flamels /personally/ protected the stone for so long? Maybe it being in Gringotts was par for the course in terms of its safekeeping. But Dumbledore knew Gringotts would not be adequate - and was proven right. An adequate safe place for the stone was a) close to Dumbledore and b) behind magics Voldemort lacked knowledge of, or was incapable of dismantling. And their survival had gone on for long enough, we were told as much. Or "bringing their affairs in order" is just code for Nicolas making another stone. If he could make one, why not make another one?

Sirius' conviction is, honestly, to blame on the Marauders as a whole. Who the secret keeper for the Potters was, was key information to have for their dedicated leader in this fight. But instead they let their General believe that Sirius was the secret keeper, which opened up every opportunity for the actual traitor Peter to fudge the dices. When it was time to throw Sirius into prison, Dumbledore was steadfast in his belief that Sirius was the secret keeper, and therefore the traitor. Sirius even "confessed" to it, to some degree. Enough at least to be proof within the war tribunal he had been subjected to. Which is another thing many people forget about this: Not a single Death Eater had gotten a trial according to british muggle standards. The magical justice system is prone to manipulation anyway, but Sirius was judged under Barty Crouch's authoritarian war tribunal that had no patience for the defense of the accused, or a multitude of evidence and witnesses. Sirius was a man who would have needed a psychologist and then a good lawyer, caught in a situation where society wanted vengeance.

When we talk about Malfoy, thats where Dumbledore's idealist side definitely shone through the most. He believed so much in the redemption of the guilty, that he sometimes forgot about their victims in the process. He understood that Draco Malfoy was in an impossible situation. He either did as he was told, or he would bring Voldemorts wrath upon himself and his family. Unimaginable torture and a crueling death were assured if he didn't deliver. Dumbledore knew that he had to die not so far in the future. So his decision was to *let* Draco succeed once he had gotten enough information to Harry. Until then he set Snape onto Malfoy to control him. We know that didn't work well, but in the end even Dumbledore is only a person, and not infallible. He even said so himself. He makes many mistakes. He made many mistakes. Its just that when he makes them, they tend to have horrible consequences, proportional to his power and influence.

****** You mean it was a mistake to tell a completely lost young man - barely not a child anymore - in his face, in one of the most stressful situations of his life, that there is no redemption for him and that there is damage done he can never rectify? That now he is on the side of darkness and there is no return, no matter what he does?

Dumbledore is a bit more intelligent than that. He tried to use the situation to tell Draco one last time that there is a possibility to turn his back on this path he walks. None of Draco's victim would have any benefit from Dumbledore laying into Draco right there.

If Dumbledore knew one thing its people. And he was sensitive enough that he understood that judgement was the last thing Draco needed, or would respond well to after that year, in this situation. Any judgement would have pushed him towards the reasons why he did it. But Dumbledore told him that whatever he had done and does, he is forgiven and there is redemption to be had. And /that/ is the only way to talk to someone like that, in such a situation.

Justice can be brought upon him later.

Dumbledore showed far more consideration to Draco than to Harry and the other innocent victims of Draco in that moment - with Harry listening and watching.

And /that/ isn't what you do to your friends and allies. You should never, ever value the guilty more than the innocent. At the very least, he should have informed Harry far in advance of this plan - not spring it on him like this.

Not that he should have ever considered saving Draco instead of Katie Bell, Ron and Draco's other victims anyway.

** Dumbledore: Plot device is my take on it. During the early books, he is struck with the "adults are useless" trope so kids can be the heroes saving the day. And in the later books, he's not allowed to derail the plot by acting in character - like everyone else forced to become an idiot and acting OOC to keep the plot going.

You can't really make sense of his actions in a Watsonian way; it's all pure plot device.

Other than by reading him as deeply, deeply damaged in ways that give the deep, abiding lie to the fanon notion that Mind Healers are a thing. The man was barely out of his teens before he was culpable in his sister's murder in ways that, with even an ounce of hindsight, were very avoidable. That /has/ to leave a mark. Then he spends the next half century trying to hide away from it all, and they keep dragging him back in, until he ends up having to join in a war he wanted no part of and they declare him a hero for subduing and imprisoning a man who was in many ways already beaten, a wreck of the young man he'd loved, who had failed before he had even begun because he clung to the grand vision of an over-excited teenager.

The sensible thing for him to do - for his own sanity - was retire in about 1946 and go live quietly somewhere else under an assumed name, but under all the damage was still the Albus that wanted to conquer the world For Their Own Good. Sure, he knows it's a fool's errand now - even if Gellert had won, there's nothing about being a wizard that makes you any good at government, as the Ministry proves on a daily basis - but sometimes he just thinks that if he /really/ cut loose he could stomp some sense into the blighters. And there's that tiny little whisper from the slice of Death in his wand-holster that says he has the power to do it.

So he ends up with a bad case of decision paralysis, the lassitude that comes with the bone-deep weariness of a chronic depression that he knows is /all his own fault/ and then young Tom - who has clearly read his Mao Zedong - devotes his followers to making Dumbledore look ineffective with classic guerrilla tactics and Dumbledore is starting to believe it...

**** No, it's not enough. Making Dumbledore into a barely-functional mess ruins the character even more. And such a mess wouldn't have been able to fight Voldemort in two wars, much less done what he did to Harry. "Decision Paralysis, apart from when the plot needs Dumbledore as a plot device" is not in any way better than "pure plot device". Not only do you need everyone around him - McGonagall, Moody, the entire Order, the entire school staff, and all politicians to be stupid enough to miss that Dumbledore is a mess and, arguably, a fraud, they have to miss that he's responsible for all the screwups as well, and still blindly follow him as "the best of all the leaders" resp. "fight him as the most dangerous of our enemies". Effectively, you need to lobotomise everyone to keep Dumbledore as an ineffective (outside plot needs) mess.

**** *Watsonian:* Harry would never have been able to take Snape on in a fair fight, but he could easily beat Draco. Dumbledore needed Draco to disarm him, so Harry could get mastery of the Elder Wand, but he didn't want Draco to kill him, as Snape killing would be more useful. Dumbledore's words to Draco shook him badly, badly enough that later on at Malfoy Manor he decides not to identify Harry Potter to the rest of the Death Eaters, saving his life. This leads Harry to decide to save Draco in the room of requirement. Draco being alive is what makes Narcissa lie directly to Voldemort's face, allowing Harry to escape detection until their final confrontation.

Dumbledore also needed Snape to utterly prove his loyalty to Voldemort if he wanted Snape to remain safe to work his plans. So the DEs needed to witness this confrontation. Snape killing Dumbledore convinced Voldemort and the DEs so completely that they never suspected anything until Harry told Voldemort after Snape was already dead. This shook Voldemort badly, giving Harry another edge in their final confrontation (not because Voldemort cared about Snape, he had just killed him, but because he's a paranoid maniac).

*Doylist:* Dumbledore did have risky, illogical, unlikely to succeed plans, but magic and magical society in canon seems to embrace this. So much about the magical world is risky, illogical and unlikely to be successful.

"Public safety" doesn't seem to be a concern in the Wizarding World, so to criticize Dumbledore for not caring about it is a bit unfair. They have a school with moving staircases, a forest of dangerous creatures next door where detentions are served in and a lake full of potentially dangerous Merpeople that first years that don't know any magic cross yearly with only a half trained groundskeeper as protection. Even magic itself is unsafe. Floo travellers and callers are one batch of bad powder away from severe burns instead of transportation/communication, apparition requires strong concentration or you leave body parts behind, wands are essentially dangerous weapons given to 11 year olds. A Triwizard tournament has dragons and other fatally dangerous creatures involved, as well as binding people whose names appear in the goblet to compete, whether they want to or not.
