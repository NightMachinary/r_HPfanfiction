  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

** Here is my take on the Wizarding currency:

A currency's most important function is to facilitate transactions of goods and services. It needs to keep up with productivity, or else risking perpetual deflation and economic depression.

Gold had worked fine for thousands of years during our agrarian age, but failed miserably when mass production began in early 1900s. Today, with all the global labor arbitrage, automation, networking, and declining population growth going on, the deflationary pressure is still increasing. Any country that tries to use gold as its currency will immediately commit economic suicide.

Wizards are magnitudes more productive than Muggles. Now you can see why gold standard is totally a poison to their economy. Maybe it was a grand Goblin conspiracy after all, with the goal to keep Wizarding economy in perpetual depression and preventing them from realizing their full potentials.

But it's not to say that paper currencies are all that great. They are IMHO only a lesser evil than gold. Given Wizards's ability to duplicate things easily, paper currency is definitely not an option for them, and that leads to the next topic: crypto currencies.

In the magical world, they will use magic as opposed to electricity to create new 'money'. For example, if Wizard A is good at enchanting items, he can offer his service on some of kind of exchange or payment network to generate magic credits, which he can use to buy goods and services from others. The price could be determined by perhaps an auction system, where it is regulated by supply and demand. This is of course only an idea, but this system should encourage definitely productivity and favor those who are truly good at magic people needs.

Are they?

It was my impression that the wizarding economy wouldn't even be comparable to ours, simply because it is pre-industrialization. The biggest companies we know (Nimbus, for example) have to be producing at best on manufacturer size batches, if we don't severely inflate the magical population of Britain and the world as a whole (assuming the worlds population is in a 1:1 relation as it is for muggles).

Then don't forget that "Reparo" exists, which means only the magical equivalent to high-end technology is beyond endless repair circles. Brooms, Wands, enchanted objects. The rest is a flick of a wand away to be as good as new.

And so on and so forth... my question is really how you deduce that wizards are more productive? It seems to me that its quite the opposite, simply because of a lack of need to be so.

**** Individually speaking, they have the potential to be magnitudes more productive, but that's obviously not the case in Magical Britain as you stated.

Their attitudes, their economy, and their society don't seem to encourage optimization and striving for the best. The prevalent sentiment among Pureblood establishment is that of arrogance, complacency, and ignorance.

***** Individually speaking, yes. Which also means you never get to a point of industrialization. If you have countless individuals producing their own stuff, there is no need for industry. What there is need for is manufacturing and small batch craftsmanship of high-level products. Neither of those require a complicated currency system.

#+end_quote

I'd argue that there is optimization and progress, just not at the breakneck speed our modern muggle society performs at. Its like comparing a car driving 50km/h with an ICE superspeed train.

The wizarding economy is not that performant simply because it doesn't need to be.

Maybe an interesting point here is to bring up Reparo again, and on the muggle side the "Right to Repair" bills floating around various governments. The bill IRL would harm seasonal-product sellers like Apple a lot, since they can no longer profit of their shitty designs (small rant, sorry). In the wizarding world /literally everybody/ has the possibility to repair something immediately. That alone makes it impossible to compare *modern* muggle economies with wizard economies. In the back and forth of supply and demand, wizarding economy will /never/ reach the demand necessary for large scale industry, while being faced with unlimited supply for a massive variety of products you'd see upholding muggle economies.

#+end_quote

It isn't comparable to ours because large amounts of it are either post-scarcity or close enough to it to count as such for all practical purposes, by virtue of the fact that conjuration and transfiguration exist. If it wasn't for the fact that food can't be conjured or transfigured from non food* then wizards would be completely post-scarcity and would only need money for low-trust transactions for magical services between wizards.

* because transfigured or conjured substances brought within the morphic field of a living being by eg. being eaten will rapidly revert. Which isn't canon but a plausible way the exemption to Gamp's Law could work.

*** Here's a thought that's been floating around in my head for a while, but we know that goblins can identify their creations and distinguish them from fakes at a glance (including leprechaun gold), and each galleon/sickle/knut is stamped with a serial number based off the goblin who minted them. In this way the economy is protected from counterfeits.

But more importantly, I believe that the wizard economy is not actually based on the gold standard- it's a fiat currency, backed by Gringotts, but with gold as the material used for physical objects rather than paper. (And also I think that a credit/debit system would be entirely doable, built off the same sort of system the House points at Hogwarts work on but that's neither here nor there).

You can even look at the exchange rate with muggle money. The goblins have magical mining/refining/forging techniques that lower the cost of supply, which explains the seeming low value of gold in the wizard economy. Now some fics (lke HPMoR) have brought up arbitrage- exchanging muggle money for galleons and selling the gold on muggle markets for profit- but I think that fails to consider that you're not dealing with gold, you're dealing with /goblin enchanted/ gold. They might have certain magical properties (ie, rust/tarnish proof, heat resistant) that would break the statute of secrecy, as well as lower their value to muggles (if they're heat proof, then you can't reforge them into something more useful or... meaningful?). Point is, trading Galleons to muggles could very well be illegal, and both Gringotts and the Ministry would be monitoring the muggle economy for unexpected spikes in gold trading. Additonally, as seen with the sword of Griffindor, goblins seem to consider any exchanges with wizards to be simple lending, rather than actual sales. Who's to say that they don't consider this to apply to their coins, as well? Any money you possess is simply a /loan/ from gringotts, and if sell something to another wizard, you're just buying their debt. Removing the coinage from the system (by selling it to Muggles) breaks that understanding, because now the goblins can't collect. And anyway, Gringotts, as far as we can tell, is both the central bank and a monopoly supplier of their gold. Whatever exchange rate they've set, there is a reason for it. Not to mention their ability and willingness to rescind any cooperation on their part if you do manage to take advantage of them, if not retaliate.

** I like the idea that gold is their races version of a wand. It's what they use to perform their magics. They don't need to own it, they just need to have access to it.

I also like the idea that Galleons aren't actually solid gold but rather a magical gold-alloy that's about 40% gold but still works for goblins as well as natural gold. Goblins turn as much gold into galleon-metal as they can because of this.

Leprechauns hate goblins because while they can both make use of natural gold in the same way, only goblins can use galleon-metal.

Isolationist, warlike, good at handicrafts. When they're not fighting humans they'd be fighting civil wars.

** Honestly, after one too many stories where they are the solution to everything because Harry remembered a name and says some stupid greeting, I can't take that depiction anymore.

Given that they control the whole financial market, it is reasonable to assume that they won the Last rebellion and the whole narrative is just revisionism. And since they are a historical enemy, they need to be dealt with. The stories where everyone takes their gold somewhere else and ruins them are a guilty pleasure of mine.

Also, after reading "FemHarry becomes a goblin (sexual) slave to pay for the breakout" and it ends in Stockholm syndrome instead of a murder spree, I am very partial to wiping them out completely. Starving them out in their tunnels, flamethrowers, mine warfare or even Voldemort slaughtering all of them, not just the men, but the women and children too.

** My own preference is that Gringotts is a penal colony.

The /real/ goblin culture is two miles underground and doesn't give two shits what goes on in the surface world, so long as their trading post for getting stuff from up top isn't disturbed. Said trading post is, to the average goblin-in-the-tunnel, what a customer service job on top of a 10,000ft mountain would be to you and me, if the customers you had to serve were all racists who hated you. (Yeah, yeah, #notallwizards, but it's the disagreeable 90% getting the rest a bad name.)

It is, in short, a hardship posting for the guards and otherwise a dumping ground for criminals and dissidents who would otherwise disrupt life down below. This is why goblins have such a bad name on the surface: humans only ever meet their criminals and squaddies.
