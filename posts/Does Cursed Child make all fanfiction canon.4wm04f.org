Now that Cursed Child is out and has proved the existence of Alternate Timelines in HP universe, can we take that to mean that all fanfiction is canon? After all, each fanfiction can be said to be happening in some alternate universe of its own.

Could that possibly be Rowling's subtle nod to fanfiction? Her little way of saying, "Thank you. I appreciate you" to the fandom?

P.S. I know its a wild shower thought at best, but its still a thought that I quite like.


** There's nothing subtle about it. It's my opinion that the whole thing is not a 'nod' to fanfiction, but a parody of it. And I'm pissed off about it. Enough from me.

** How I have chosen to interpret this cow pat is that while it does not make all fan fiction canon it makes every fan fiction AU a possible and valid outcome of canon. Splitting hairs I know but even so it works for me.

It means it is valid to build your own canon from the material that speaks to you and pass by that which doesn't.

That's true if we consider CC a possible and valid part of the canon... ;)

** Fanfiction is not canon by *definition*. But if you want to view it that way I won't stop you.

** Just a thought. A story about fanfic characters who would invade canon universe to take the places of their counterparts (Canon being more legitimate...). Maybe some sort of HP/Body Snatcher crossover.

Does someone know about something like that?

*** I have been working on a plotline to add to my story for a few months now that's pretty similar. Only its that Canon Harry invades my own world of fanfiction.

As for already completed fanfiction, nothing comes to mind at the moment

**** Still interesting. You're writing Harry Potter and the game, right? I've start reading it but I'm not that far yet. It's enjoyable so far.
