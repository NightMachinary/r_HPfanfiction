Mine was probably a Remadora fanfic in which Tonks was raised by Bellatrix, but escaped to the Phoenix order... I wrote a lot of weird Remadora fanfic and still do.

The funny thing is, that weird concept turned into my most read story, and also the one I consider my best.

So, what are your weird HP story's?


** Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Power of the Atom)

What's the most powerful thing that Voldemort does not know? The mighty power of Uranium-235 fission. It's the only way to be sure....

** When I was 11 (so in 2004, I think) I wrote a story focusing on Hermione. In it, Hermione had suddenly become an orphan because Voldemort had killed her parents. It also included a bunch of other ridiculous things, such as: everyone acting wildly out of character, random spells I made up, lines directly from the books/films, terrible spelling and grammar, Harry becoming petrified and Hermione secretly being in love with him, and the entire thing was written in a script format.

I took it offline years ago, but due to HarryPotterFanfiction being up again thanks to some fans....it's still out there online.

This comment is written better than the entire story, haha.

*** Oh god, I feel you so much. When I was eleven I wrote a terrible sailor moon fanfiction, with so much random shit happening...

I mean, sailor moon has a bunch of random shit happening anyway, but still...

Also, I wrote a 400 pages long Remadora fanfiction at twelve... That fanfic is so cringe. Tonks was acting like a whiney little kid, and Remus like an complete air head. Kingsley hated Tonks, because she reminded him of his ex (Don't even ask, I have no idea how I came up with that one...) Sirius wasn't dead, he was in a parallel universe of some sort... And a bunch more shit that I don't remember happend. Everybody has fanfictions like that... I'm so glad I never published that one, lol.

The sad thing is, it wasn't even that long ago... I'm sixteen now, it's only been four years...

** All of them.

Like bitter cold in Canadian winters, once you get beyond a certain degree of weird, there's no point in comparison.

Or to be honest - the one where not-exactly-girl!Harry gets mutated by alchemical interaction between Basilisk venom, Phoenix tears, Philosopher's stone fragments, an allergic reaction to Polyjuice potion and the underlying problem of Lily's soul being merged into Harry's body.

** There was a prompt here to write a "Hermione is pregnant but there are several possible fathers" scenario. I decided to take the piss out of it by making Hermione a lesbian accidentally impregnated through Veela magic (using the Asari from Mass Effect as inspiration). She does not realise how she was impregnated at first.

Harry in a Soul Bond with Molly Weasley (at one point sharing headspace with Molly, Ginny, and two versions of Tom Riddle).

Hedwig as action hero.

The Harry Potter story told only with anagrams of "harryjamespotter".

Harry as Snape's son and Snape as Harry's son (simultaneously).

My stuff is pretty much plain vanilla fanfiction.

But the weirdest would be the third in a series, it was a crossover and I was gearing up for this huge war right? Well Voldy kidnaps mc side, murders her and they're unborn child and uses that as blackmail to make mc and Draco join him. I never wrote it but I planned to go full throttle. Voldemort goes around kidnapping anyone who disagrees with him, tends to force people into complete submission. Murders the potters before harry was even conceived.

Yeah it was gonna be odd
