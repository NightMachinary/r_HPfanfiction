We all know that moment. You open up a Harry Potter book to a random page, read the first line, and it feels like coming home. What fic do you think best matches that feeling, like it could have been written by JK herself?

Could be from 500 words to 500k words, complete or incomplete, anything goes.


** The One He Feared, Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince, some sections (Ron/Jasmine/Hermione interactions) of A Long Journey Home, some sections of Ectomancer. The last two are qualified with the fact that /overall/ they aren't exactly canon-feeling, just some parts.

Also, let's see... Hogwarts Houses Divided is up there. /semitroll but I think it's a better 8th book than Cursed Child.

Forging the Sword is another one, though I should really re-read it again, it's been too long.

Why? I've always felt like Inverarity captures the tone of Rowling quite well, though I might be blinded a bit by the narrative structure.

Edit: On a separate note, do you recommend Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince? I've looked at it in the past, but I'm not inclined to invest in any fanfic without a dlp thread.

**** Yeah, I do too, which is why I gave that fic in particular a shout-out, but it does feel a little wonky saying something would be a better 8th book than the thing that the actual author considers canon. I'd hate to become one of /those/ people ;)

I'd recommend Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince if you're in the mood for something that feels very canon. It's basically the last couple books from Ginny's PoV, straight up, no chaser. Ginny's voice comes through very strong, the writing's smooth and polished, and there are some really great emotional beats, but there's nothing at all surprising about it. It's exactly what it says on the tin.

Oh really? So it covers DH, and life under the Carrows? I'm now /far/ more interested. I'm really enjoying Annerb's take on that period, and this sounds like it might give me a tide me over :)

****** It does, but it doesn't spend nearly as long on them. IIRC the fic covers DH as a series of "missing moments"; it's been a long time since I read it though. This is what I meant by there being nothing surprising about it; don't expect it to get really cool and in-depth with Hogwarts under the Carrows. Expect more along the lines of some expansion on what you could logically infer from canon, filtered through Ginny's perceptions of what would be important to her.

******* Ah, well that's disappointing. I'll probably read it at some stage, still. Canon retracing doesn't annoy me too much if I know it going in and the writing is good.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8634751/chapters/1980191]]

(NSFW Trio ship fic, but I came for the shut, stayed for the plot and the feels) Not necessarily the best, certainly one of the more memorable ones. Starts off with a humorous and witty exchange between Harry and Ron that most writers can't quite capture. Would generally recommend reading more trio fics so you get to read more Ron without the bashing

** Probably the single best in matching overall canon feel would be linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure). When it comes to catching the whimsical nature of the first 2.5 books, I'd say it would be linkffn(What You Leave Behind).

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.
