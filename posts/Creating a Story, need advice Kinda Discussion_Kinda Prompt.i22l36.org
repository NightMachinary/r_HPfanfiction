Hi all,

I recently got a major rush of creativity over the past week, am super invested in Harry Potter, bling blam now I want to write Fanfiction. I want to write a Romance/Drama kinda coming-of-age story with a gay original main character. So essentially this character will be a Slytherin, a few years older than Harry Potter, naturally he's going to be in Harry Potter's story at some point but he will have a lot of/mostly his own adventures, trials and tribulations. One major aspect is that this character is an Irish Pureblood, and I'm going to be exploring a lot of territory that the Harry Potter world just doesn't cover, not to mention all the Hogwarts characters that are literally blank slates.

Given this information, I'd like to know what mistakes I could make that I should AVOID, people who are Irish who could educate me on the time-period for a background, tips and tricks, etc.

â€‹

thank you so much :)


** Avoid the mindset of "fixing canon". I can always tell when the writer thinks that /they/ would have done a better job writing Harry Potter. They wouldn't have and their fics reflect that.

Avoid bashing. It's frankly boring, overdone, and almost always reflective of a writer that poorly understands canon or has the above mindset.

Avoid muggle-wank/forcing science in. People frequently read fantasy for fantasy. Besides the canonical nature of wizards simply being superior, a wizard grabbing a sniper rifle and shooting death eaters feels like an arm chair warrior who's watched too many action movies. Harry Potter is a world where souls exist and magic recognizes a secret stored within a soul. I don't doubt that wizards study the world around them but muggle theory like the body of knowledge of physics ais overruled by magic.

Avoid unidimensional characters, especially with your OCs which seem like you will have plenty of.

Spent 10 minutes editing each chapter. Unless you're writing with a style like Realignment, editing's important. No one expects perfection but no reader likes random capitalized words and missing periods.

*** Thank you so so much for taking the time to type this out! Thankfully these aren't really the issues I'm going to be dealing with, except for the uni-dimensional character point, that one is going to be a real heckler.

** Another comment here already addressed a lot of main concerns. Just a small nitpick of mine, the characters are children. Children have pride and embarrassment issues, along with many others. The thing to remember is that they're human, not just villains or good people. What I'm hoping to communicate is that characters can develop over time, they can hope for forgiveness for past issues even if they can't articulate it well, and an insightful character will (hopefully) pick up on this.

In my opinion, a reference on good characterization is The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter on FF.net

*** I'm so glad you mentioned this! Because my story is going to be heavily romance coming-of-age, I'm going to get to explore these features in full! But regardless I do appreciate it, because this helped me stir up my creative juices even more!!

I'm not Irish, but please try to avoid talking about the IRA. Broadly speaking, it's best to leave these political/recent history subject to historian and researcher, and depending of how faithfull you are to canon, your character should not care about it. Canon pureblood are fully integrated to Magical Britain and their only separation is about National Quidditch Team, they also should not care about Muggle troubles.
