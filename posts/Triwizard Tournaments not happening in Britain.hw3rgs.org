A recent prompt post about a pushed-back Tournament hosted by Durmstrang got me curious - are there any fics where the tournament isn't hosted by Britain? I literally don't think I've ever seen any.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

*** From the upvotes, I'm assuming you're right - I've read the fic before and remember nothing about it though. Might be time for a reread to update my memory. :D

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

  What if Petunia wasn't so poisoned by jealousy her sister's magic, and when her orphaned nephew appeared on her doorstep chose to treat him as family rather than a burden? Sorted into Hufflepuff, how will the Wizarding World react when their saviour finally returns? And is being fair and loyal really as good as people say?
