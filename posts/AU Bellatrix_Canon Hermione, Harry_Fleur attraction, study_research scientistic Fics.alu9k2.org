Are there any Fics that have Bellatrix and Hermione as Scientists or students and do themself together to work efficiently? Bellatrix would be here from an AU and Hermione would be rejective or reluctant, but grow warmer with her, because her Partner ist not like her Canon Pendant. Crazy maybe, but not in a Threatening/insulting manner. I would like Bellatrix to fall for Hermione or atleast be attracted to her.

I have no idea, why a AU Bella would be in the Canon universe. The idea was, to show Hermione, that this Person (ar not all Versions of her) is not a Danger, like her "Original", but in fact a good partner....ok, a Canon Hermione in an AU would also be ok.

​

As for Harry/Fleur, same environment, so they study or work on something. But the more time, he spends that close with her, the more he starts to get attracted by her. Fleur can either be with Bill (or someone other) and so her "Obligation" is keeping her for going any further or she is single, but not romantically involved with Harry, although she appreciates that she is attractive to him.

​

I dont know, if potential sex scenes would fit into such Fics, but im open for it.
