** The earlier chapters of my story Flying Colours shows the Order reforming from the summer between Goblet and Order onwards - it's a Remadora romance, following canon (forgive me for the self-promo but it seemed to fit the brief!) xx

** If you haven't yet, I recommend checking out [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian/works?fandom_id=136512][The Divine Comedian's]] Lupin-centric fics. In particular, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279/][Still Life With Skull]] is a well-written exploration of what Lupin might have been thinking/feeling during his ride in on the Hogwarts express in Harry's 3rd year.

  September 1974 and Remus goes a bit loopy, what with the moon, and the teenage wolf, and his friends who are not Animagi yet, and the creepy dead thing that is following him around.Sirius had a horrible summer, too.
