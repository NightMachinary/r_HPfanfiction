:END:
Hey guys. I'm looking for a fic where Harry uses his blood quill injuries, and makes them worse, to go to the Hospital wing for treatment. He uses that as an alibi to go and kill someone. I think it's the Dursleys but may be Umbridge. The Aurors question him the next day and clears him. Thanks guys.


** This happened in a Harry/Blaise story once. Is this the one?

  AU. Voldemort cursed Harry in the graveyard so that he can only speak Parseltongue. Harry embarks on his fifth year alternately furious and despairing and trying to learn faster writing, British Sign Language, and nonverbal casting all at once. It turns out that not all Slytherins are Malfoy or Snape, and not everyone is frightened of Parseltongue.

** Who's to say he did it by phoenixgirl26 might be the one you're looking for. He's definitely in the hospital wing and umbridge dies but I'm fuzzy on the details
