Yes I am going to make a LORDSHIP Harry fic where he gets like a billion gold and properties and has to deal with politics and social circles and stuff. :) But I'm not making it easy for him because I wanted it to be different from what people always do complain about here: it's actually going to be more trouble than help, and he won't like it most of the time, but he goes through with stuff because he feels obligated and emotionally invested due to his parents and his ancestors being so invested in it - he doesn't want to let them down by being the random one Potter to come along and ruin it! And also because he wants to make them proud of him.

I will yes post a link to it when I have enough to upload to FANFIC.NET! :) I want a bunch of chapters done before I do. :)


** I'm looking forward to it! :) A deconstruction of the lordship genre of stories is something I'd definitely welcome in the current state of the fanfic landscape. I think my biggest complaint with the usual lordship stories is that there is little to no actual challenge for Harry; any actual opposition is easily taken care of by his immense wealth and power, so the whole story comes off as just a power fantasy.

*** Same here. Deconstructing these tropes is something fun and interesting and I very much look forward to seeing what you do with it. :)

A few pieces of advice from an actual Brit, since I very much second CalculusWarrior's complaint. Doubly so since any actual Lordship in Rowling's Magical England would have originated with or been heavily influenced by those in the Elizabethan and earlier eras (due to the intensely slow cultural change from people living one to two centuries meaning it's only been about three or four generations since the Statute was actually implemented), thus would come with some bizarre fucking conditionals and titles - we have a 'Lord Snape', a 'Baroness of Old Scone', etc. Especially since William the Conqueror took over. After him, every parcel of land given to Nobility was technically a 'gift' from the Crown, so if a Noble is not fulfilling their duties properly or with sufficient nobility (see Noblesse Oblige), the land and properties could be removed and given to someone else. Possibly a second interesting reason for Harry to actually take his Titles, since they'd be given to someone else if he didn't do them properly. Add in Magical Contracts and Vows or whatever and there's less room for him to bluff or manoeuvre too. Those duties would be related to whatever parcel of land or property was attached to the title, so think about what titles you give him and play around with the responsibilities.

You can be very weird with these responsibilities, mind; the Peerage and Nobility system in England is utterly mad due to having been invented on a whim by Royalty or stolen/integrated from the continent when we were invaded or invaded someone else. For instance, we have a position called 'Groom of the Stool', a fellow who helped the king go to the bathroom. He was also director of the 'privy purse', and thus controlled the finances of the entire country. King Henry VIII (the guy with all the wives) actually made his Groom the Sheriff of three counties and Chancellor of Ireland. So, yes. If you really want to make it hard for Harry, play around with those responsibilities. Make him have to escort a herd of Cows in an elaborate dance through the local village, or have to do a morris dance at some local festival, or have to provide mediation for his serfs (people who live on his land but don't technically own any of it).

**** With magic involved it could be compulsory...like, if all the cows aren't perfectly brown...violation enforced by magic!

***** That'd be fun. I imagine him panicking to Dobby about it and the little guy just browns every cow in the area - leading to some weird news reports on the Muggle TV. :D

*** Also, nothing about Harry's character says that he'd go along with being a snooty SOB just cause a couple of goblins said so. He's stubborn and contrary and loyal and would probably be all those things even after inheriting a peerage.

** It's an interesting idea, although I think I need a clearer picture of how Harry's lordship is going to cause trouble for him.

I do have one piece of advice, which is that it's a pet peeve of mine when Harry has some ridiculous amount of money like a billion galleons (even in otherwise-decent fics). The magical world is far too small to support that kind of wealth disparity no matter how medieval it is because a billion galleons would be enough to buy out all of magical Britain. At the canon exchange rate, I think I'd give Harry ten million galleons at the absolute most.

** I hope it won't be a harem or political mastermind Daphne or Susan Bones whose greatest use was introducing Harry to her aunt.

Please no bashing. In most of Lord fics Harry gets 'cool'(aka rich and spoiled) purebloods as friends and starts bashing weasleys and Hermione. And ofcourse he and his girls suddenly becomes more intelligent than Hermione, Dumbledore and Voldemort combined.

*** This. It would be a very refreshing change to the usual tropes if Harry, Ron and Hermione woul work together trying to figure out what to do, instead of the usual Slytherin OCs stepping in and Harry spitting on his mother's origin as he goes all "pureblood fuck yeah".

**** Oh my. Now I really want to see a Pygmalion/My Fair Lady of Pureblood Traditional Etiquette (because "Imagine what you could do with it; rights for the elves, equality for the centaurs, representation for the goblins!" Granger insists they can change the system best from inside it) given by Ron and Hermione.

It'd be a delightful balance between "No mate, your expression isn't quite 'You're all worms I shall step on for more gold and power' enough" comments from Ron and "Well, I read a book by a woman who died three centuries ago that said you should use three forks at lunch and sixteen forks at dinner and twenty six knives at both. Apparently it's bad form to stab two dinner guests with the same utensil, so she believed in being prepared." comments from Hermione that I can see going hilariously wrong when Harry actually tried to put any of it into practice. :D
