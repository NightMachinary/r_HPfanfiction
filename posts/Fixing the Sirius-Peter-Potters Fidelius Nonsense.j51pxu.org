I'm thinking on changing some parts of that Halloween of 1981, I want the same effects (Sirius wrongly imprisoned, Peter on the loose, etc...) but I want them to make sense. Maybe people can help me or maybe just setting these ideas out will be helpful. So here are some of the issues that many people are familiar with:

- Sirius is way too daft. I understand that he feels guilty and doesn't want to fight too much back. But his phrasing and not asking to speak in court doesn't make sense. He would like to expose Peter, I guess.

- Dumbledore takes this for granted after knowing Sirius. I think it can work having him be convinced of Sirius guilt, but he needs more. More proof that he witnesses directly. Or talks to Sirius and something doesn't add up to him.

- Peter. It is said that he remained hidden to avoid DE revenge, however, Peter being a traitor doesn't seem to be common knowledge among DE to be a problem for him. Snape doesn't know, Karkaroff doesn't seem to either, otherwise, he would have given his name at his trial.

- Also timeline, of attack and Harry getting to the Dursleys but that's more easy to solve I think.

So a few ideas I have played with:

- Peter not being Ron's rat? Not afraid of DE, but maybe takes the stage in 3rd year for some other reason? Maybe the events of the chamber of secrets were public enough for him to decide to go to Hogwarts and look for Voldemort? Though timing would have to work for Sirius to see him in that newspaper picture.

- Sirius having a trial but dismissed? It would make Sirius more credible, but would have to do a hell of a job for Sirius to be sent to prison without anyone doubting his guilt. Also, if there's Veritaserum, the unregistered animagus totally becomes public, which would ruin everything.

All in all, I think I need some extra piece of evidence against Sirius. Something that can make people doubt don't believe him even if he's explaining himself. Maybe Sirius tries to hide something in trial (animagus for some reason, perhaps)... and then a new evidence comes halfway through the trial revealing he has been lying about a bunch of stuff. Maybe Crouch is specially tough with him for some reason (though this part wouldn't help explain Dumbledore part).

Thoughts?


** I've seen your first point (Sirius' "confession") explained away as an overpowered jinx Pettigrew placed on him, to make him laugh hysterically and babble incoherently. That explanation appeals to me.

One way you could run with this is to give Sirius a wartime tribunal rather than a criminal trial. Enemy soldiers do not have the same rights as citizens. Plus, their justice system must have been overwhelmed at the time between officers of the court being killed and having too many cases.

So, Sirius is arrested under wartime circumstances. Simply having him in front of the tribunal implies that he is an enemy soldier and could easily lead overworked and grieving judges to, unintentionally, skip over the bit where they figure out whether he was a Death Eater at all. That means, from the judges' POV, all they're really trying to figure out is whether this specific Death Easter slaughtered these specific civilians. A couple of people say yup, the Potters told me he was their Secret Keeper, a couple of Obliviators say yup, here's what the Muggles heard Pettigrew yell before he died... everyone was so overworked they couldn't even give their testimonies in person, the tribunal had to make due with written statements and follow up questions would be more hassle than they're worth... suddenly this "trial" is just rubber stamping some paperwork.

Dumbledore and the Order investigate later and see that respected people testified and there was lots of paperwork (surely that's the same as lots of evidence). They see that Sirius received the same tribunal as all the other Death Eaters and think "the tribunals were so lenient Malfoy and others were able to slither out, surely they wouldn't have convicted Sirius if there was the faintest possibility of his innocence!" Without realizing how subconsciously prejudicial it is to see Lucius Malfoy who turned himself in, wearing an expensive outfit, with impeccable hygiene, speaking eloquently versus Sirius Black who had to be arrested, wearing torn and blasted robes, with three days worth of stubble and sweat, babbling incoherently about "it's my fault".

TLDR claim that wartime trials weren't as thorough as peacetime trials

*** Thanks a lot. This is really helpful. I think laughing curse can work but will only go to a certain length. I actually had forgotten about Lucius, he might be the key. Maybe I can hit 2 birds with one Rock here and manage a convincing explanation for Lucius being believed without Veritaserum at the same time that Sirius is framed.

Maybe putting Sirius trial after the begging Barry Crouch Jr? The attitude of Sirius could make people think he can't look more innocent than Barry Crouch.

Will need a lot of attention for Sirius to not reveal he was an animagus though...

**** Maybe Veritaserum is expensive and time consuming to produce. The Ministry used up their supply during the war and hasn't been able to get more yet. Lucius generously donated the cost of the Veritaserum used in his trial ("see how committed to the truth he is") and since he's paying for his own trial it's only fair to let his attorney preview the list of questions he'll be asked under it. Or maybe Lucius bribed someone to use low quality Veritaserum, where you can't lie directly but you can still tell partial and misleading truths.

Or maybe it's illegal to use Veritaserum on someone without their consent. The tribunal never offered and Sirus wasn't coherent enough to ask for it.

Maybe they only asked him basic questions, trying to rush through and get it over with. "Are you the reason You Know Who found the Potters? Are you responsible for the deaths of Pettigrew and the Muggles? Next!"

Maybe they never asked about his Animagus form. Why would it come up? There's only seven registered. And yeah, the reader knows that of the five Animagi that appear on page, four are unregistered, but a) the Ministry doesn't know that and b) even assuming the number of unregistered Animagi is ten times that of registered, that's still a really rare ability that's beyond most people. I mean, I don't think they'd have time to go down the list with every suspected Death Eater. "Are you an Animagus? Are you a Metamorphmagus? Are you a Parselmouth? Are you a Seer?"

** Peter needed to get into Hogwarts. And he had just the plan. Replace the Wesley's Rat... /Que the epic vermin fight of claws and teeth/
