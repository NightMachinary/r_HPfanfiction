Don't get me wrong, I /do/ ship HGSS, but I've read almost all the worthwhile ones and occasionally re-read favourites (Post Tenebras, Lux, The Problem With Purity, Pet Project, etc) but I've recently had a real craving for good, platonic Snape and Hermione interaction. Whether in the form of student and teacher, master and apprentice, colleagues... I'll take anything at this point.

Complete preferred but not essential!

And failing that, I'll take some nice Snape and McGonagall friendship too.

*** I blasted through this the other day (via one of the many Dark!Hermione rec threads) and very much enjoyed it; just the inevitable wait now.

*** I tried this once and couldn't quite get into it; the scene-setting dragged for some reason, but I'm giving it another try, thank you!

** Do you have any other recs for HGSS, it's my second favorite pairing but I seem to stumble upon the same stories over and over

*** I have a couple of links that have a ton of SSHG recs on them. It's on a LiveJournal page so I'm not sure if you need a LJ account to see the page or not. The rec page was created in 2010 but there are a lot of links there so hopefully you'll find something you haven't yet read.

** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9565529/1/Resonare-Mortis][Resonare Mortis]]. It won second place a few years back in a fan-based LiveJournal poll for best Drama/Angst. It's not a fluff piece by any means, but it is entertaining if you enjoy the angst.

*** Hmm, I have to be in the right mood for angst, but I'll bookmark it for the future, thank you!

EDIT: Ugh, first person. Pass. I just cannot get on with first person POV.

** I rarely (almost never) read HG/SS and I liked this one a lot.

***** The first time I read it there was definitely only the one ending; I've just skimmed through and read the second one, though, and I think I like that one better. Happy endings and all.
