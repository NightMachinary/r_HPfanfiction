  And then. We have THE ship.

  THE SHIP. THAT NEVER. SAILED.

  Harry/Fleur

  A LEETLE BOY HAS TO IMPRESS A FRENCH SEX SYMBOL FROM A DIFFERENT RACE WHO HAPPENS TO SHARE A PLACE ON THE 0-10 SCALE WITH A VICTORIA SECRET'S ANGEL WHO HAPPENS TO BE THREE YEARS OLDER THAN HIM AND IS THE MOST COMPETENT STUDENT IN AN ENTIRE SCHOOL WITH THE POWER TO MAKE MEN FALL HEAD OVER HEELS BY EXISTING.

  /Good. Fucking. Luck./
#+end_quote

It's a pairing that makes no sense in canon, their personalities and ages are just too different. So writers have to twist, rip and manipulate the plot and the characterizations to make them make sense.

I love the /idea/ of Harry/Fleur but I'm not sure I have seen it executed as well as most other ships.

*** For me it's like Snape/anystudent, Tonks/Harry, etc. This makes no sense in canon. Not due to a personality clash (well a bit but its minor), but due to a strong age difference (not in years, but one is a child) and sometimes a teacher/student status, the idea of a relationship should not even exist in those cases. Once JK said that fans were mistaking Draco for Tom Felton... you have shades of this here, people rewriting personalities to serve their "ship".

** I don't really see it, honestly. I don't dislike it and I wouldn't refuse to read it if it was good, but I've never seen an argument for it that didn't come down to, "Fleur is hot and Harry is the hero so he should be with the hottest girl (even though there's no indication he's even interested in her or her in him)." Sorry, but that's not really good enough for me. You say they complement each other, but I'd like to hear a clearer explanation of exactly how they do so.

I also want to note that I think "stuck up and spoiled but beautiful" is a pretty shallow reading of Fleur's character. You make some mention of her talent, but it seems like an afterthought and that's not really a personality trait. Fleur is very brave, devoted to her family and loved ones, and not actually shallow despite what you might think (her love for Bill is not remotely affected by his deformity).

And, well... if being older than Harry and very talented is all it takes, Dumbledore/Harry should be the most popular ship in fandom. He's even older and more talented than Fleur!

** Well guess I'll be the one to disagree here. I actually enjoy a few Harry/Fleur stories. I think this is, in part, due to how little we know of her character in canon relative to Hermione and Ginny. I feel as if many of the best stories in fanfiction require tweaking certain aspects of a characters personality and highlighting it to maneuver their story in the direction they want it to go. This is clearly seen with H/Hr. She is portrayed as being bossy and stuck up but when written in fanfiction, other qualities are highlighted and brought to the from to make her a great pairing for Harry when in canon, she wasn't necessarily the best in many people's eyes. This brings me to what I enjoy about Fleur/Tonks/Luna/ etc. there is enough foundation into the character so that everyone knows them and can feel them in the story (the issue with OC characters is the lack of knowing them therefore they feel awkward), but their existence is not as set as say Ginny or Hermione which gives the author tons of room to develop the character how they see fit. With Fleur, there are fewer restrictions on her character and as such she can be adapted to fit any mold in relation to the story. want to make her someone who is a spoiled brat? Easy. Want to make her a relatively normal albeit beautiful woman, who struggles with relationships due to said beauty? Done. Want her to be a bimbo? Just as easily done. She can fit your story however you want because you can develop her better than say Hermione or Ginny.

** I don't mind reading the occasional Fleur/Harry story...though they're aren't really a "ship" of mine. Still, if it is well written I'll probably like it! I think Fleur becomes pretty likable after she's shown to have some depth beyond her shallowness. She really grows as a character and I especially feel for her when she's taunted in the 6th book...especially by Ginny. UGH.

Fleur is magically-enhanced in her beauty, but at the end of the day looks are subjective. People will be drawn to what they like.

** I'm not so sure. As other people have said, most of the time, Harry/Fleur really comes down to the fact that Fleur is really fucking hot and not much else. Most authors just look at Fleur and go: "Well, she's the hottest girl that's reasonably older than Harry, so they should do the stank". Which is a shitty way to write a romantic relationship.

That being said, I can see many ways to work it out in a fic, Sure, Harry and Fleur don't compliment each other that well, based on their canon personalities. But he doesn't really work with any other major female character either: Ginny is the most believable, but despite H/G being the canon pairing, Ginny doesn't have enough development throughout the series to really compliment Harry; Hermione's too boring and bossy for Harry; Tonks is far too old for Harry; and Luna's too loopy for Harry.

However, that doesn't stop people from writing pretty good, believable fics with these pairings (such criteria is decidedly rarer when talking about H/Hr fics, but they do exist, I swear!): proper character development in your fic will always supersede the canon interpretation, so long as it's believable development from the canon start point. So Harry and Fleur can be "made" compatible, but it'll take a lot more than three or four chapters to do so.

Tl;dr: Harry/Fleur isn't all that believable. Nor, in my opinion, are H/G, H/Hr, H/T, and/or H/L. But they can be, if you put a whole lot of work into it.

Edit: elaboration.

** I don't see Fleur and Harry working. For one, Fleur lives in France, Harry in England. The reason Fleur eventually moved to England was Bill. The impression Fleur had of Harry was him being a little boy at first. Understandable, since he's only 14 and she is 17. That changes when Harry 'saves' Gabrielle during the second task.

This makes her grateful for Harry and she respects him. I didn't read anything about her being attracted to Harry. Harry thought she was beautiful, but only because she is part-Veela. That's not a good grounds for a healthy relationship.

I like Fleur as a character, and I think you could write a very good fanfic about them being friends, maybe even about them having a big sister and little brother type of relationship. But I don't see them having a romantic relationship.

** My biggest problem with Harry/Fleur stories is that many of them rely on some funky veela magic to make it happen. I'd like to see more that don't focus on that (The Lie I've Lived does a good job in that sense, while not being good in terms of what else is required for them to get together).

I'm definitely not opposed to the ship, but I'm not fond of a lot of the stories. I have the same issues with a lot of Harry/Gabrielle fics as well. Plus, the 6 year gap is a bit much at that age.

Unfortunately, they're all terrible. Though like 99.99999% of H/F is terrible (as opposed to 98% of all fanfiction in general), so that's not too surprising.

** I'll just drop it: imo Harry/Fleur is a more believable pairing than Harry/Hermione.

Hermione is like a sister to Harry, there was never ever any chemistry between those two, it just feels so wrong. I definitely agree with [[/u/DeeMI5I0/]] that H/Hr shippers [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3ie4vr/lets_discuss_harryfleur/cufs8mk][just feel like movie watchers]]

Harry/Fleur on the other hand while full of discrepancies can make sense. Not really in 4th year where the age difference is remarkable (and yet, Krum/Hermione?) but Harry is full of talents and qualities and he's not subject to Veela's charm, that makes a difference! I can totally picture an older (and handsome, obviously) Harry courting a not canon single Fleur after Hogwarts.

*** Harry most definitely is subject to the Veela charm. During the quidditch world cup he tries to jump off the stands to get to the Veela, and pay attention to the description of Fleur from Harry's viewpoint. He repeatedly thinks of her as an incredibly beautiful woman, overwhelmingly so even. Only towards the end of the series, when he's in love with Ginny, he's not really affected anymore.

Yes, compared to Ron, Harry has a mild reaction. But remember that Ron has the worst reaction to her you can imagine.

** I personally always liked the character of Fleur within the original series. With 17 she acted like she was 17. She knew she was pretty and talented and made that very clear. With the addition of Bill and a few years of extra experience, she became a bit less "Prettiest Girl on the Block" and only that much more likeable.

And, heres also the problem. I don't see Harry working with Fleur when she's 17. For one, he's 14 and barely grasps the concept of sex, but also, by all measures except beauty, she's not his type.

What I do see working is a grounded Fleur. The post-Bill Fleur, so to say. Already breaking curses for Gringotts, making her own money, her own friends and her own life. Also, by this time she lives in England and is therefore somewhat within grasp.

So basically, the time between her first day at Gringotts and the wedding to Bill is the most "realistic" time for this relationship to happen. Everything post-wedding comes with the added stigma of breaking a marriage. But hey, not that that ever kept an author from doing it.

Writing this, I realized that I would love to read a story where Harry snatches Fleur just before the wedding and goes Horcrux hunting with her, Ron and Hermione.... or something.
