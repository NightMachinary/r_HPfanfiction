Lately, I've been really into Tom Riddle fanfictions but I can't seem to find any well written one to keep me captivated. I need fresh ideas, dark and gritty plots with subtle romance, power plays that dwell more into the universe. Frankly, I don't mind reading about the overused time travelling theme as long as the characters are original and the story doesn't feel rushed. The main character could also be a villan like Bellatrix. I'm honestly open to anything!

The last one that I remeber enjoying was "Blood and gold" by obsidianpen. I didn't think I would enjoy it that much but the writer had a way with words and I found myself really liking that version of Hermione and Tom.

Any suggestion is much appreciated. Thank you!


** Not with an OC but there was a pretty decent fic that I read that has Tom Riddle with a Lavender Brown that ends up in the 40's. I enjoyed it a lot more than expected. Linkao3(Unfogging the future)

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** Have you checked out any of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Atypical16/pseuds/Atypical16/works?fandom_id=136512][Atypical16's]] stories? They have several completed longform fics that diverge from canon due to events in Tom Riddle's final year at Hogwarts.

In my opinion, the author is skilled at portraying a fully fleshed out cast of OCs that don't fall into any pitfalls of Mary Sue tropes. Like many of ObsidianPen's stories, Atypical16 takes a deeper look at what it would be like to live in a world seemingly teetering on the edge of darkness, where the rise of violent extremism is coaxed on with honeyed words.

  Welcome to 1947: Gellert Grindelwald has been defeated, Albus Dumbledore is dead, and Tom Riddle is hired for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post at Hogwarts. It all goes downhill from there.

  It is 1945 and the staff and students at Hogwarts are anticipating Gellert Grindelwald's rule extending to the UK. Whether they are celebrating or panicking usually depends on their blood status. Usually - but not always.
