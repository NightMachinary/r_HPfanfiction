** Cold winds of a Scottish December. Dread, howling in the trees. Panting, the creature kept moving. It had started /hours/ ago, maybe more. Pure instinct kept him going.

-”You have no place in this forest”, the horse-man had said, aiming his bow with a scowl.

If only they were the only ones after him. But the /faceless/ were chasing, always. A rumble in the leaves, far ahead. No time to stop. Freezing paws, frozen breath, burning snout. There is an image in his head, messy dark hair, a laugh and a brother. He keeps running.

There is a hissing over him. Something is lying in wait no more. He didn't smell it, he couldn't smell. Silk works to entrap him as he feels sharp and pointy /things/ contact his hind legs. He growls ferociously, ready to bite and to claw. Contorting himself to get free. Suddenly, he stills. He doesn't feel the cold any more. Contentedness infuses in his blood, one drop at a time. His eyes close. Is that a Christmas carol in the distance?

-”Thank ye for all yer help professor, he woudda' been lost without ye”, Hagrid said, the back of one of his big hands wiping at a tear of worry on his round cheek while the other gently petted the slumbering dog.

-”Of course, you are quite welcome Rubeus, it was no trouble at all”, Dumbledore said genially.

-”Oh look! He's wakin' up already! Aren't you a though /little/ feller?”, the giant said, smiling warmly at the altogether deer-sized black dog, “Oh professor, can I keep him? only, I'm sure he wouldn't hurt a fly this one, it's all in the eyes that, I can tell!” he babbled.

The wizened man considered the dangerous-looking mammoth now standing at his full height with lost and pleading puppy eyes. He then considered the dog, which was much the same.

-”Well... certainly... yes, certainly. I don't see why not.”

-”Oh thank ye headmaster, bless ye!” Hagrid said, delightedly pressing his hands together on the front of his chest.

The dog barked once, and the giant's eyes could have warmed the great hall on their own.

Duty accomplished, the headmaster headed back to his office to see to his correspondence with the minister for Magic. In truth, he had been glad for the interruption.

-”Ye must be hungry after all these emotions. Come over here”, the big man said, leading the dog near the side of the crackling fireplace. ”Now see, this is Fang's plate, he is a good dog just like you, I'm sure he will be happy ter have a friend. Ye will have ter play nice now, yes?”

The dog whined softly.

-”Atta' boy”, he said, scratching the dog behind the ears, “Now, ye will need a name and a plate too, won't you? I found ye bein' attacked by an Acromantula, so... how about Silky?”

The dog barked happily, the sound almost resembling laughter. For the first time in many, many years, Sirius had a feeling that better days migth be ahead.

** *The Forbidden Forest*

<Just a moment, fellow canine.>

Padfoot turned; there, casually watching him, was a large greyish-white wolf, perched on top of a boulder.

<You do not come from this wood, called the Forbidden Forest by magic humans. From where did you come from and where will you go?> it asked...well, wuffed. Approximately translated from dog noises with a bit of artistic license.

<I human in canine shape. I go to castle. Hunt danger rodent.> Padfoot awkwardly barked back.

<...Your capacity to express yourself in canine terms is somewhat lacking.> the wolf snarked.

Padfoot grumbled.

The wolf leaned forward, <But you say you are a human...a magic human, disguised as a canine? And that you seek a...presumably, another transformed human who is your enemy, in the castle called Hogwarts by humans?>

Padfoot nodded, before barking again, <Rodent human bad. I kill rodent. Rodent pack of big danger human, make trick, trap me 13 year...>

*Some time later...*

<I see...> the white-ish wolf made canine noises, <So this human masquerading as rodent served a 'dark lord' who killed many humans and threatened the magical world. The rodent tricked everyone into believing you served this dark lord instead and faked his own death, leaving you to be captured and tortured for 13 years. Now that you have escaped, you want to kill this rodent-human in revenge. Is that correct?>

Padfoot barked his affirmation.

The big white wolf started to pace around, <Furthermore...you believe from the mutterings of other followers of this dark lord, imprisoned like you, that this dark lord is not truly dead, and if this rodent-human escapes, he could find and heal this dark lord, endangering the entire world once more...including us.>

Another bark from Padfoot.

The wolf thought a bit more, <...Well...even though you're obviously insane from being tortured for over a decade and are planning to break into a castle and murder someone's pet rat based on a picture you saw in a newspaper article, I've decided that I believe you completely, and furthermore that I shall rally my entire pack to join you on your quest to slay this terrible rodent.>

Padfoot raised a disbelieving eyebrow.

<...Okay, the truth is that while you've obviously been starved and mistreated by /someone/, and therefore it wouldn't be a good thing to turn you in, I'm pretty sure you've gone round-the-twist so we're coming with you so you don't end up killing anyone except for that rat you're so obsessed with.>

Padfoot dramatically fell over.

The wolf raised a thoughtful paw, <But then...we would need food and shelter while we find your rat, and I doubt there's much to hunt in a castle...>

--------------

*Hagrid's House*

Knock, knock, knock went the door.

"Huh, who could that be?" Hagrid muttered, turning around from the fireplace and slowly standing up.

Carefully putting aside a thingamabob on his way, the half-giant made his way to his front door, slowly pushing it open, "'Ello? Is that you, Harry?"

Then he stopped and stared. Over a dozen dogs...no, wolves, and make that one and a half dozen, were sitting in his front garden, staring at him expectantly...Wait, that one wasn't a wolf, it was more of a black dog.

Hagrid blinked, "Blimey, I know you lot. You're that [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Forbidden_Forest_wolf_pack][werewolf pack in the Forbidden Forest]], ain't ye? All of yeh, by the looks. What do yeh lot need with me, is it something to do with the new pup there?"

There was a pause, then one of the wolves stood up and quietly padded forward, a handwritten sign (or, judging by its sloppiness, possibly paw-written) of bark and plant gunk held gingerly in his jaws: 'Doggos looking for good home. Smart, gentle, toilet trained.'

Hagrid took the sign and studied it carefully before letting out a booming chuckle, "Blimey, I wasn't expecting something like this today! I guess the dementors on the grounds are getting to yeh too? Sure yeh can stay, and I'll ask the students in me classes if they want to keep yeh, at least until this Black business is done with..."

**** Hee hee, thank you. I know it technically didn't meet any of the requirements (and only implied one bonus) you outlined, but I think it's a good start to a lot of pet-Padfoot related shenanigans anyway.
