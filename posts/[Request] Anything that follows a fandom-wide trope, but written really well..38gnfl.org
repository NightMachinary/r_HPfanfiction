We all know those stories. Harry comes in to a huge inheritance after Sirius dies, trains, and defeats Voldemort with everyone living happily ever after.

Or! He goes to Gringotts and discovers that he has 100+ irreversible marriage contracts- so he's got a Harem! Oh no!

Well, does anyone here know of those kinds of stories that are written well?


** Out of the Night, by Raining Ink. It has Harry becoming independent, going to gringotts and inheriting a title etc as the fandom-wide trope, and is also one of my favorite pieces of fanfiction.

I don't have a link ready because it was deleted off ff.net (and is abandoned), but I'm sure you could find it on DLP or around.

** Several authors have subverted the soul bond trope. A couple notable (complete) longer stories of this type:

Darth Marrs's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood][The Bonds of Blood]].

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]].

*** There's another soul bond fic out there where it's Harry and Hermione that become bonded and it drives them out of their minds. Similar premise to whats described in bonds of blood's byline; lack of privacy, etc.

Can't recall the name atm tho.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]] by Silens Cursor has an excellent take on a lot of tropes, but the one that comes to mind is the Potter Vaults subplot. Basically, he is very wealthy, but the vaults are inaccessible for a large portion of the fic because of various machinations by some unexpected parties (it would be a spoiler to say who, but it certainly isn't a bashing fic), and this creates real issues for him throughout.

Probably one of the best Independent Harry's, as well, although Harry's characterization can grate early on.

** I don't know if this fits your criteria but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][saving Connor by lightning on the wave]] This story is really long. Also slash which doesn't start till year 4. It has a bunch of common tropes, dumbles bashing, severitus, twin brother Harry not bwl, goblin friend, powerful Harry, loving Draco, abused Harry. Etc. It's written pretty well IMO.
