It's been stated that the Killing curse can be blocked by inanimate objects. In the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort in the atrium, the former moves a statue in front of Harry as proof of this concept.

If that is the case, couldn't one simply don a suit of full-plate armour and tank the deadliest of the unforgivables? We see small magical explosions that happens in the movies when the curse is blocked, although surely weathering that whilst in armour is preferable to instant death. The armour could be enchanted with cushioning charms and such for greater effect.

This raises the question of what material, or how deep, can the curse penetrate. As we can clearly see it goes through clothes and fabric worn on one's person.

Apologies if this has been brought up already before, which I'm sure it has.


** If you held a wand to my head and demanded I come up with a magical theory to explain how this works, I would probably decide to create the Theory of the Magical You.

Basically, for a spell cast on you to affect you, it needs to connect with You. The You is not just your body, but includes whatever could be described as being part of You at that time. Clothes are the obvious example. Not only have we seen the Killing Curse affect someone through their clothes, but almost every spell we've seen hit someone has hit them on a clothed part of their body a still had an effect. So your clothes are definitely part of You.

On the other end of the spectrum, if you were sitting in a car, and someone cast a Killing Curse or Jelly-legs Jinx or something at the car, it wouldn't affect you, because the car is not part of You. (Obviously the spell, depending on what it is, may affect the car itself, and thus indirectly affect you, but that is not the magic itself affecting you, so it doesn't count.)

A set of full-plate armor, while useful against indirect damage, would not, I think, protect you from an Unforgivable, because it's still part of You.

An Iron Man-style suit is ambiguous and requires further testing. Perhaps it depends on if you are more likely to say "I am Iron Man" or "I am in an Iron Man suit." (The interaction between magic and technology is, of course, firmly ignored in this example.)

An easy* way to determine if something is part of your magical You is to perform the animagus transformation. If the object in question disappears as you become an animal and reappears as you turn back, it is part of You. If you transform and find yourself continuing to hold/wear the object in question, it is not currently part of You.

Another easy, if perhaps less reliable, way to determine if something is part of You is to imagine yourself as an RPG character. If the item is equiped in one of your equipment slots, it's part of You. If you are just interacting with it, it is not part of You. If it is in your inventory but not equipped, the situation is ambiguous, and may depend on how your inventory is stored to begin with.

In summary, asking Tony Stark if you can borrow his suits to fight Death Eaters would be awesome, but may not provide the protection you want. But asking the Power Rangers if you can borrow their Megazords (or whoever is in charge in your favorite Mecha anime) to fight Death Eaters has absolutely no downsides.

*Well, easy in concept, if not execution. Asking someone else to transfigure you into an animal and back may also work, if you can find someone whose transfiguration skills you trust. Apparition with the object may also work, if you can distinguish between performing normal and side-along Apparition (assuming there even is a perceptible difference).

*** An interesting theory, one that seems plausible in the face of this awry conundrum. Even in dnd terms, it would be awkward if a mage cast a touch attack on a knight and it didn't work because 'Aha, t'was my armour you touched'.

But then this raises another potential problem. If the basis of You constitutes as something that is a part of you, and something that is not. A suit of detachable paper could be used to float up in front of your person, removing it from You and blocking the deadliest of curses.

Going off the equipment slot theory, this also bungles the notion of shields. Physical ones, that is. If I raised a tower shield in front of a killing curse, I couldn't imagine it would would have the same effect as it striking my person/armour. It's the very basis of a substantial inanimate object that can and is used to block. However, theoretically, it should fail according to the Law of You?

Either way, brilliant response!

Well, if I had a detachable slab of granite (or even a thick ream of paper) on my chest that I removed and levitated in front of me, would it block spells? I think so, so why would paper not do the same? Or what if I was standing behind one of those Japanese paper screens? Could that block a curse? I think that in all of these situations, the spell is being blocked by something that is not part of You, so we're good there.

However, we instead have to deal with what spells (particularly ones intended to be used on humans or other living entities) do when they hit inanimate objects. The statue Dumbledore used to block the Killing Curse was destroyed, but the Killing curse leaves no mark on a living target. There may be other examples I can't think of right now, but that should be enough to prove the point. However, I think it is likely that the exact results varies depending on both the spell being used and the material it hits. Perhaps Materials Science is a field in the magical world.

Actual physical shields were one of the major gray zones in my theory that I didn't know what to do with. A large tower shield seems like it might be able to block a killing curse, but I'm not sure that a small buckler could.

I think that the animagus method is the most reliable way to identify You, and I think that a shield would transform with the user, which would suggest that they would not be able to block a Killing Curse.

Perhaps the fact that no one in the books ever carries an actual shield could be taken as evidence that they don't work. This doesn't seem like an oversight that could be attributed to the Magical World's lack of logic, as shields would have been common in the times of the founders and Merlin, so their usefulness should have been known then, if any existed. So perhaps there is a reason we only hear about Gryffindor's sword and not his shield. Even Sir Cadogan, an actual knight, did not use a shield, as far as I can tell (I haven't checked the text of the books, but the wiki makes no mention of a shield).

So I think I have convinced myself that shields are in fact part of You, and are thus not useful for blocking spells like the Unforgivables. This may seem counterintuitive at first, but magic is known to not always make sense.

***** The usefulness of carrying a shield is low even if it works, because the vast majority of duels don't involve killing curses, and when they do then your opponents likely won't stop after their first killing curse destroyed your shield.

** First, let's examine the possibility of any sort of armor or material offering enough magical protection to block or negate the effects of a spell as strong as the killing curse.

There are two references to anything that functions like magical armor in Harry Potter.

Fred & George sell clothing & accessories with shield charms attached, but those quite obviously only have the effectiveness of a common shield charm and are useless against more serious curses such as unforgivables.

Dragon hide (and basilisk skin, similarly) is also mentioned as being magically resistant, and is commonly used as the magical world's equivalent to leather. Common work gloves for handling potions ingredients are made out of it, and widespread fashion accessories are also dragon hide. While some amount of magical resistance remains in this material, it is a reasonable assumption that it would only thoroughly protect against minor spells, or else we would have heard of it being used much differently. The word resistance is thrown around, but never immunity, and mere magical resistance is simply insufficient to defend against the killing curse.

If there was some sort of material that exhibited full on magical immunity, like Nth metal or something similar, it would be a candidate for magic-proof armor, but no such thing exists in this world, or we certainly would have seen some hint at it.

So now that we are able to conclude that no armor can negate the magical effects of the killing curse, we have to turn to the questions of "what is armor," "what is clothing," and "what counts as a spell actually hitting you."

We know that spells hitting your clothes fuck you up just fine.

We know that spells hitting inanimate objects completely separate from you obviously can't effect you. Or, wait a second, do we really? Every time we've seen a major curse blocked by a physical object it's been really substantial stuff like statues or big chunks of stone. If there was a piece of paper floating in the are between you and someone casting an AK at you, would that stop the curse in its tracks, or would it tear through the paper and keep on going? Spells seem to go through the water just as easily as they travel through the air so what's so special about solid objects? Well, perhaps even the smallest, lightest solid object could block any curse, but if you're just floating around a few pieces of paper, it would be trivial for your opponent to disperse them all with a little bit of wind or fire and leave you defenseless. The more substantial whatever you're blocking with, the more your opponent has to do to remove it.

And then of course, does "armor" count the same as any other clothing? I would argue that it does. For no other reason than the fact that nobody has been going around wearing heavy armor in magical battles already, and because overall wizards seem to put very little care in to what they're wearing. Even the likes of Dumbledore & Voldemort just wear ordinary robes like anyone else. Certain types of armor or clothing might offer specific physical protections, but when your opponent is capable of casting any type of magic at all, agility would seem to be the best option your clothing can possibly offer.

So overall I would conclude that the best one could wear would do a little, but not a lot, and the AK is something that requires even more than a lot to defend against. /Maybe/ if you wore 100 layers of dragon hide you could tank an AK but the mobility drawbacks would obviously make that strategy useless. There could theoretically be less absurd possibilities, but any additional thing that you attach to yourself is going to add on new vulnerabilities for a clever opponent to exploit.

It seems like Voldemort & Dumbledore really did have the right idea in the Ministry battle. Animating many large statues and conjuring massive & intricate shields. Beyond that, you're best off simply not getting hit.

** I think the statue worked because it was not hollow and made of stone. I think it can debated that an armour would be too thin or would not protect you simply because your are inside. A hollow armour jumping in front of you would be effective.

Maybe do simpler: raise a wall of stone and hide behind it

** I figure that inanimate matter is treated as "conductive" for lack of a better term, so that anything you wear or hold will channel the AK through to your body. Then again, I just think of the Unforgiveables as ranged touch attacks in D&D 3.5 / Pathfinder rules.

** My guess is that if the curse comes into a certain range of your body, it kills you instantly by attacking your soul. So, its less physical, but more some kind of soul-magic at that moment.

On the other hand, I genuinely wonder what happens if somebody else gets hit by your Killing Curse, instead of your intended target.\\
Isn't the curse only working if your really want to kill your target? And shouldn't it become non-leathal if someone body-blocks the curse for your target?

** There's plenty of evidence from other contexts (e.g. the Fidelius Charm, the food exception to Gamp's Law) that the rules of magic in the Potterverse lean heavily on /concepts/.

Some [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gaquik/magical_cores_or_the_limits_of_a_wizard/][great analysis by Taure]] of how magic works notes the importance of factors like /will/, /concentration/, and /understanding/.

As such, I agree with the other posters that indicate armour would be ineffective due to it being a part of "You" (similar to your clothes), but I think your perception of it matters somewhat. A wizard/witch who believes they are "inside" a suit of armour (whether metal, dragon-skin, or something else) would probably have some protection from spells, but probably not enough to stop a Killing Curse.

Conversely, /any/ object that a witch/wizard causes to intercept a spell before it hits them will work* *if they use magic to put it there*, as their intent is to block the spell.

* You probably also have to take into account factors like power-differential between the caster and the defender. For example, Dumbledore could use a feather to block a Killing Curse from Random Death Eater Mook #47, but needs something more substantial (e.g. blocks of masonry, bits of statue) to block one from Voldemort.

*** So throwing a rock into the path of a killing curse by hand would not work? What about the ceiling crashing down on its own into the path of the spell? Or something being moved into the path of the spell with magic but without the intention of blocking the spell (e.g. thrown by a third party at another third party)?

**** Hmmm... good questions.

I think if a witch/wizard was the one throwing/moving the object, it would count (in terms of getting the magical "defence +1").

Otherwise it's a pure physics-based defence, so it works if the object has enough density/heft/momentum/etc to deflect/stop the curse. So the ceiling would work (effectively there's now a wall in the way), but a rock thrown by a muggle would be a million-to-one shot*.

***** That all sounds rather wishy-washy. And the idea that an object moved by magical power with the intent of protection works to block the killing curse but the same object moved non-magically or just happening to be in the way would not is somewhat at odds with the idea that there is no magical counter to the killing curse.

****** In my defence, HP magic is rather wishy-washy. It's literally convincing the universe do to what you want by waving your hands around the right way. :)

Maybe there's no /known/ magical counter, as it's not something the Unspeakables like the idea testing (it would similarly not apply if the curse wasn't going to hit you in the first place). But I support the concept that the object should be something that /conceptually/ would block a spell (so a sheet of parchment isn't going to do any good either way).
