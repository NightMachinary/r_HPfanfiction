Mine is that some authors just /have/ to call Dumbledore an "old coot" every other line. Like we get the point already, just use a thesaurus to find other words! What's yours?

** Evil/dark = power. Um, no. If that were true, dark wizards and witches wouldn't keep getting their butts handed to them by teens.

*** Voldemort in canon only lost due to deus ex circumstances which make little sense if you think about it since Harry never won the Elder Wand itself from Draco. He might have thrown most of his death eaters away, but if you read the description of his fight he's killing people all around him while outnumbered significantly.

And there's the simple fact that if one side shoots to kill and the other does not, the result is inevitable.

** It is more a Slytherin!Harry peeve (though the 2 tropes are often put together), but the Slytherin Dorm. While the Gryffindor are sleeping together in dorms like /paysants/, Slytherins get personal bedrooms, a reserved library, a potion room, a /dueling pit/ and so on.\\
Like, I get that the Dark Side is sexy, but maybe there should be some equity about how the students are treated.

**** What I meant was in almost every Dark!Harry fic. Harry always says to Dumbledore, when he calls him harry, to call him mister potter. Usually quite angrily, it's just one of those things that gets to me. Sorry for not explaining it properly.
