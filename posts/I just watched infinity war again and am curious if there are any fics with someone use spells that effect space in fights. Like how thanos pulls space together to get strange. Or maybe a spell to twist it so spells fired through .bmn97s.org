#+TITLE: I just watched infinity war again and am curious if there are any fics with someone use spells that effect space in fights. Like how thanos pulls space together to get strange. Or maybe a spell to twist it so spells fired through that space miss because it turns space. Stuff like that.

You could read, if you haven't already, A Black Comedy. Harry is a master of Accio and Depulso to such a level that he basically has 4-6 "hands" that he uses to move shit.

As for a zone that twists, I have no idea, the closest thing I know is deflection, similar to how it is in Honour Thy Blood.

*** What I'm trying to go for is exactly the kind of thing thanos does it's not just doctor strange that's moved it's the entire area between doctor strange and thanos. Ground and all.

** In this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]] Dumbledore uses what he calls an unbound spatial expansion to move himself and another from 1 location to another. I've always imagined it happening the same way Thanos pulls strange to him but much quicker.
