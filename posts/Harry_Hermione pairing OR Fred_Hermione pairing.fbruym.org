So, I'm wanting to step out of my comfort zone a bit here. I have only ever read Draco/Hermione ships, and I mean read extensively. So, this is a very big change, and I'm still reluctant ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è That being said, can you recommend THE BEST fanfics from the above pairing. Ones that will be able to persuade be to actually read something else üòÇ I like dark, angsty, mature fanfics üòÅ

Not dark or angsty but it is a good bit of fun, basically Hermione falls asleep in the common room and rather than wake her Fred just takes her back up to bed sleeping but gets caught by her roommates. Chaos ensues when roomies assume they're having a secret relationship and being Fred he goes along with it. Like I say, it's fun, a bit fluffy but I like it lol

** One of my favorite, very canonesk fic is Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire. Hermione gets selected for tri-wiz instead of Harry. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

** It is Hermione/George, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/993900][Arithmancer-Verse by White_Squirrel]] is a good stuff.

And for Harmony, first let me suggest [[/r/HPHarmony]], and then it is the third time this morning I am suggesting linkffn(11916243;12373273).

Summary-Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become Animagi. H/HR

** I recently compiled a big list of HHr fic recommendations into a doc found [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juV1sSMBpPdab-FgoAntz4XxOOg8gpM5nL-GZlrjrHo/edit][*here*]]. I'll probably add another list for one shots in the future.

** I highly recommend unlike a sister by mad harmony

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister]]

Warning its unfinished, but one of the only good harmony romance fics out there.

Post war, angsty, with a beileveable relationship, does not leave off angsty or a cliffhanger.
