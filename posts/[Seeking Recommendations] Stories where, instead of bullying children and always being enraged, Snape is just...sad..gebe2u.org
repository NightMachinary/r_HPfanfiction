Wanting to read a decent Snape fic (centric or just playing a decent-sized part) where after losing Lily, Snape just gets and stays SAD instead of being canon Snape and bullying little kids. That's basically my only criteria, that he's sad instead of mean. It can be a redemption fic, mentoring, even do-overs/time travel. Any pairing, or no pairing, is fine. Thanks!

EDIT: I should say that I'd PREFER no bashing, but as this is kind of a rare one (I think) I know I may not have a choice.

** Snape: Mr. Potter, can you tell me what I would get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

Harry: No, sir.

Snape: /sighs/ Pity... For your information, it would create a powerful sleeping potion known as the Draught of Living Death. It's mentioned in the foreword of your books. I sincerely hope that you the rest of you had the foresight to read ahead. Our first lesson will be on health and safety. While I understand it is not exciting, it is nevertheless important. I dislike Madam Pomfrey chastising me for potions accidents that could have been otherwise avoided. The first rule...

/End Of Class/

Snape: Mr. Potter, a moment.

Harry: Yes, sir?

Snape: /Grabs a book about the language of flowers./ Remember my question at the beginning of class. /Gives book to Harry./

Harry: Sir?

Snape: Tell no one what you find. You may leave.

Harry: /Confused expression. Leaves anyway./

****** Seems to me like it depends how it's used. As Snape trying to get a message to Harry? Yeah that's out. But in between the Evans' seeming flower naming tradition and both Lily and Snape's skill at Potions I could see them communicating "in code" that way. Normally for fun, as nerds do, though perhaps in real need as well as tensions rose. And Snape's "message" is just him giving into an indulgence, saying a final goodbye to Lily. (Granted that makes a relatively sappy and sentimental Snape which I imagine is something of an acquired taste)

** Sounds like a plot bunny that I'd love to right but doubt I'd ever find the time. Which helps OP not at all, but here it is.

Snape get so overwhelmed with his double agent duties, on top of teaching and Head of House, that he gets burnt out and depressed. There may be a triggering event, like a student is killed or joins the Death Easter's; another one he can't save. He feels that he is doing more harm than good despite his best efforts. This may even be worsened by an offhand cruel remark from Dumbledore that he overhears, which makes him feel that he is not valued. He shuts down emotionally. It's like he has stepped outside himself. It's actually a relief to dull the emotional pain.

It looks to be a good thing on the surface. He becomes more logical and less driven by personal vendetta. When Black tries to bait him, he just gives a weary look and makes a comment about petty bickering. When Slytherins and Gryffindors cause a disaster in the classroom, he looks disappointed and tells the offenders on both sides to clean it up. He stops stalking the halls during nightly patrols. When he has a quiet moment, rather than reading a book or a Potions article, he just stares into space. The man who is always in fluid motion is now preternaturally still. His Slytherins are terrified for him. They know that something is badly wrong. Neville, for all of his fear, starts to worry too. Finally, even the Order can't ignore the downside. Snape loses the ability to cast a Patronus.

During a Summons, Voldemort looks into his mind. His shields aren't functioning as well as they usually do, but that's a blessing in disguise. Voldemort can only see Snape's black despair over his failures and the unfulfilling role he is trapped in. Thankfully, Voldemort sees this as someone who has been fighting for his side and has been driven to the edge by Dumbledore and his followers. It increases Snape's loyalty and devotion in his eyes. He rewards Snape for his sacrifices. This makes Snape feel even worse, but he manages to fake some weary gratitude and escape back to Hogwarts.

There will eventually be some action that snaps him out of it, where someone he cares about is put in danger and the despair fades away. I haven't thought that part through.

Skipped ahead, because I'm not about to sit around for a trope that's heavy handed at best. Ding ding ding. There we have it folks. And the author was thinking they were being quite reasonable, and understated! That's what boggles the mind.

There's a few scenes where they kinda lay into Dumbledore - but really, he's portrayed as "an old man who makes mistakes and has trouble believing family could actually hate each other", a far cry from the usual "he's pretty much deliberately setting everyone up to fail".

Skip over the yelling-scenes if you must - heck, skip until Chapter 15 if needs must, the most negative scenes all happen before that point.

******* Ohhhh fancy! I'll give it another shot and skip to 15 and see if things improve. Basically any time where they have to veer wildly off course to make a character into an asshole gets me irritated. It made sense in the books, because Harry never said anything. It's a bit of a reach to expect adults to be so clues in to that sort of thing when the child is actively hiding it. To ignore concrete evidence smacks of really trying to make someone seem like a villain for the sake of the mentor role being an “us against the world” thing.

Like. What even is the motivation to be wilfully ignorant? Fudge? He was more concerned about status quo and getting re-elected. You can see his motivations to try to pretend nothing is happening. Scrimgeour? He's trying to clean up the mess Fudge left behind. Crouch? He's trying to protect his son. This one? Seriously? You done !spent all the kid's money!. “Oh well, he'll survive.” And then you got an adult who's corroborated! the evidence that your next in command suspected all along. HURR DURR FAMILY!

And while I kinda get what you're saying, there's an explanation for at least the money-spending. That is explained as mostly being due to the war effort - war is expensive as heck, and James was assuming they'd survive to earn it back eventually.

It sucks for Harry that he's not loaded (though he's still said to have enough to sustain him through Hogwarts and indulge sometimes - he was never "buy a racing broom without making a dent" levels of rich in canon), but I kinda agree with the reasoning of "better poor but safe than rich but dead".

The abuse, I will /kinda/ give you - but then again, everything the Dursleys do to Harry happens in canon as well, and Dumbledore doesn't do a whole lot to stop it.

** Reminds me of In which Snape befriends an old grey donkey by Plenty o' Custard. A Harry Potter/Winnie the Pooh crossover. Enjoy.
