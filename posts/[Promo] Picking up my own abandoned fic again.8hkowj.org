I started writing a fic a few years ago, based around the idea that Harry really didn't know much about his mother and deserved a chance to find out ordinary things - a friend of hers (because it seems *weird* to me that we don't know any of her friends but Snape) is giving him access to memories, and this is how he gets to know her. I got three chapters in, and then got stuck.

I want to start working on it again.

I'd appreciate other people's assistance in this. If anyone has any feedback, or thoughts about the kind of things they might like Harry to see...

** Damn. That's actually really good. I was expecting... far worse. It's a hell of a good start; if it was on FFN I'd gladly drop a follow.

Colour me impressed. :)

*** Thank you. I try :)

The trouble with writing something like this is I have to keep thinking of things Harry would ask to/want to see. Harry would probably love to know his family, but he never asks shit!

**** It really depends on the role the OC takes. What would she see Lily doing?

Perhaps Lily is at James' quidditch games.

Maybe Lily gets news of her parents being killed/dying.

Allow Harry to see multiple sides/emotions of his mother. Have him confide in someone about these revelations. Neville is a good one for this, as he is an orphan as well.

***** They were good friends. Not Marauder-close (because breaking the law for a friend is /exceptional/) but very close.

Weirdly, I'm 99% sure they were in different houses. Lily seems the type to have cross-house friendships. I'm not sure which house Tess was in yet, but there's a reason she never turned up with the Order in canon - she's not Gryffindor-brave, and one war was enough.

I wanted interactions between Harry and Tess to be a bit awkward. Fundamentally kind, but awkward because they don't know each other at all yet. Did this work?

Really? That's weird... I'd certainly expect my friends to break the law for me. Like disregarding speed limits if my house is on fire or we have to get to the hospital quickly. Or, I don't know, lying to the police for me (as long as I didn't murder someone). Of course there's a line /somewhere/: Some people would expect their friends to help them hide a body... that's maybe a bit much.

I assume you're talking about the Animagus thing, right? I never felt that was as altruistic as it was made out to be. Being an Animagus is really cool and it would appeal to the Marauders either way. That they can help a friend sure plays a part and made them do it maybe earlier than they otherwise would have. Also being an Animagus is only illegal if you don't register. They could still become Animagi and help Lupin if they registered. Being *illegal* Animagi has nothing to do with helping Lupin.

******* If you're not going to hide a body for me than you're not really my friend are you?!

I'd think Harry would like to see how bad ass his mother was with magic, and maybe (I know in canon she didn't have a job cause l o l why have a job when your husbands father is rich and you can buy a house right out of school in the middle of a war and still have a baby). but if you aren't following canon maybe show her working if you could I think that would be good. Something other than wallflower perfect lily which I see a lot.

Nah. If you're in a position where there's a body to be hidden you're in serious trouble either way. Just because you're my friend doesn't mean that hiding the body is really the best option or that I'm going to agree with that course of action (you're probably just making things worse). Unless we're in some kind of thriller you're probably not being framed and all the police is corrupt.

Some people seem really confused with the concept of loyalty, they seem to think loyalty is always agreeing and going along with whatever instead of telling you to fuck-off and get a grip when you're about to ruin your life.

******* They risked Azkaban and the Dementors, which is not a normal jail like you would go to. They risked having their wands snapped, which means being permanently cut off from both their abilities and from a large part of their whole world. Most wizards who get their wands snapped are probably not as lucky as Hagrid...how do you think those scions of wealthy magical families, James and Sirius, would cope without the magic that's their birthright?

I agree it wasn't entirely altruistic, but the scale of the laws they broke is a lot bigger than breaking a speed limit or a quick lie to the police.

They were exceptional.

I doubt even the ministry would send children to Azkaban. But that's besides the point, being an Animagus isn't illegal if you register. They - presumably - just did that for their pranks and because it is extremely useful.

********** Okay sure, the Ministry - just for the sake of argument - is going to throw James Potter or Sirius Black into Azkaban at age 13. Sure. Whatever. Even better reason for them to just register. They are not risking Azkaban /for Lupin/.

Edit: Just for the sake of posterity. [[https://xkcd.com/1989/][IMHO]] the friendship between the Marauders has been completely [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization][flanderized]] within the fandom. Pettigrew set up a young family to be killed (how well did they really know him if he was capable of that?) and Lupin had no doubts that Sirius would have set up a young family to be killed (how well did he really know him if he believed him to be capable of that?). Everyone thought that Lupin was a traitor (how well did they really know him?) and James&Lily didn't trust him enough to tell him that they switched secret keepers. Also Lupin was apparently not even close enough to James&Lily to see it as his obligation to have some kind of relationship with their surviving orphan boy. Arguably the whole tragedy preceding the events of the books could only happen exactly because the Marauders weren't as good friends as they could have been.

*********** Those kinds of paranoia were not uncommon in Eastern Germany where everyone could be a Stasi informant. Maybe your friend is one and nothing happened when you mentioned a drunken escapade, so you tell him about your stash of Western literature only to end up in prison because that crossed a line in his mind.

Also it is easy to think nice things about your friends, but when there's a mule and people start dying because SOMEONE is leaking information, you start suspecting people. No one suspected James, Pettigrew seemed too innocent, so Lupin only had Sirius to suspect and Sirius only Lupin.

You're completely going over the top here. Yes, people were afraid of their neighbours or acquaintances being Stasi informants, but that doesn't mean they were paranoid all the time and didn't trust their friends. In a tyrannical regime a retreat into privacy is very common, which heightens the importance of friends and family, because that's the only space where you can speak your mind. You trust them *more*, because it is seen as sacred and there's a sense of /mutually assured destruction/ (we both have dirt on each other). Relationships are more polarized as opposed what we are used to (we tend to trust strangers/acquaintances more and don't ask as much from our friends - because it's not dangerous to be friends).

Being paranoid about someone in this scenario is a sign that you're more of an acquaintance than a friend.

************* I did not live during the Stasi reign, but did talk to a couple of survivors at Hohenschönhausen and a common theme was that everyone could be turned. Either spy on your friends or go to prison.

And the first war with Voldemort was even worse than an authoritarian regime.
