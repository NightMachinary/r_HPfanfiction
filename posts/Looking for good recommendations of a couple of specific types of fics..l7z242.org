As the title explains, I'm looking for something specific.

What I'm looking for that I'd like to check out, is a fic that revolves around “Circumstances beyond our control” that sees the Wizarding World forced to repeal the Statute of Secrecy. And to unite and fight alongside Muggles. With the end featuring Wizards and Muggles coexisting peacefully and fully aware of the other.

The second, is a crossover-type fic. I'm a long-time big Halo nerd, and I'm only a Potterhead as of the past few years. And I'd really like to see a Harry Potter-Halo Crossover that sees Aurors and ONI working together to wage war against the Covenant, Innies, and a Dark Wizard. (You-Know-Who) Before eventually discovering the Halos, and the new parasitic threat that is the Flood. I don't know, something about Harry, Hermione, and Ron being in the same room as the Master Chief just tickles my Hype Bone.

I'm very curious to see how such fics would play out.

Edit: Unfortunate that such a fic does not seem to exist.

**** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantai_Collection][Kantai Collection]]. It's a japanese online Card Battle/Waifu Collector game with the spirits of WW2 warships as the waifus.

***** I've never even heard of that, and... quite frankly, that sounds like I'm good NOT knowing it. O_O

With ‘No More Statute of Secrecy', I was really just looking for an HP-Only fic, not a crossover.

****** KanColle has pretty interesting lore (although most of it is fan-created). Give the fic a shot, the autor is really good. He's the same guy who wrote [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/3819/the-wizard-and-the-lonely-princess][the Wizzard and the lonely Princess]]

******* I've only started to get into fanfiction within the past few years, and I've been very slow to explore what's out there. Which is due in part to me trying to get my own off the ground. (Which won't truly feature the Potterverse like I plan until later.)

I haven't heard of that one either. I likely haven't heard of nearly all of these because of that.

Hm, slowly lost interest in MLP over time. Hung on to FIM purely to see how it ends, and then, that was that.
