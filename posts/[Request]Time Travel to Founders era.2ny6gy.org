A year or so I was completely into HP fanfiction, and I read this fanfiction with Harry going back in time because of some science experiment, and then finding himself in the founders era, and you see him growing up(? somewhat) and he befriends Salazar and the other founders. And then he find his way back and the author stopped writing I think.

Anyone know the one? Also, tips on similar ones would be awesome! Preferably ones where he goes back by himself.

** Umm...H is for Helga and S is for Slytherin are pretty entertaining. It's slash however (more in the second one than the first), but both can be found on ff.net.
