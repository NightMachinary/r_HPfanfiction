** This one is very AU and also involves time travel though not in the "usual" sense.

TIMELESS by Solstice Muse

Author's Summary: Dumbledore kept him exactly where he was supposed to be all his life. When Ron turned 18 Dumbledore's spell had run its course. Now he learns to deal with a very unique problem...Time Epilepsy.

Notes: With elements from “The Time-Traveller's Wife” by Audrey Niffeneger

Link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2812800/1/Timeless]]

Opinion: I'm not sure if people who haven't read “The Time Traveller's Wife” or seen the movie will still appreciate this piece of fanfiction. The main features of this story are Ron and Hermione and the unique relationship that they share due to Ron's problem. It is a romantic yet sad story that brought me close to tears.

Solstice Muse, is probably the only author I know who really fleshes out Ron's character and gives him depth. This is a refreshing change from stories that feature a person who was never able to get over his childhood childish envy and insecurity. Likewise, we see a Hermione who mellows out and finally gets to adjust to the people and world around her. It may sound as though the characters have drastically changed but believe me they haven't.

The author has written a whole lot of other stories featuring Ron so you may want to check these out, too.

** If you are ok with crossover, then I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), in which Ginny and Sirius are building an empire in the Land of Ice and Fire. It's generally pretty good, although Rhaegar is hyped up somewhat.

**** Not really, this fic takes place well before the rebellion of Robert Baratheon. You don't need to know anything that happened in the TV Series, only the background story of that world.
