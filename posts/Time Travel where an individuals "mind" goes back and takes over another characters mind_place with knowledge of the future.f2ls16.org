I have always loved time travel stories, but usually, they have Harry (and/or friends) going back in time either physically, or taking over their younger self/selves. However, I am looking for ones where someone's mind is sent back and takes over someone else's place in cannon. An example story would be the Half-Blood Emperor where an OC takes over Snape's mind at the age of 11 with full knowledge of whats to come in the future.

I don't care if its Harry Potter, an OC, Hermione, Bellatrix, Tonks, or whoever who goes back. The main point is that the individual has future knowledge and adjusts things as such, although arguably its more interesting if they go back to earlier times than when the books take place. I also don't really care if they adjust things for evil, perhaps taking over Voldemorts place but doing things in a smarter way, or perhaps becoming the next Dumbledore, or simply becoming wealthy and powerful, or even simply working behind the scenes to change the future.

But I will say that I prefer mature-rated fics, with a strong/powerful main character, who tends to keep things pretty close to the vest. I also generally don't like main character slash, but side-character slash is fine. Smut is not an issue. Romance/Relationships of some sort preferred but certainly not required. Not really looking for 1 shots.

Hopefully, there are some more fics like this out there.

Thanks all!

******** I'm sorry, what? If someone is looking for one-shots /specifically/, yes, they generally specify it, but if you don't specify what fic length you're after (eg. "prefer at least 50k/100k/whatever"), then it means that you're alright with anything. 'Anything' includes one-shots that fit the themes of the request. It's hardly anyone else's fault if you're not able to communicate what you want.

Well, because I wasn't sure why you expected more than 4k from a one-shot when you didn't specify that you didn't want one-shots. Wasn't that clear? After all, I asked it about 3 comments up. I was also considering recommending some fics, but nevermind.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

****** Thanks for finding it. Ill have to take a look.

Also I noticed your flair "I <3 time travel".

Mind if I also ask for suggestions for lesser known quality time travel fics? (If you have any to give) I also love time travel but mostly have just read the more well known ones.

*** I mean, i guess it does not have to be a full rewrite. They could still remember the other lifes memories and stuff, but I guess I mainly just wanted the characters conciousness in anothers body, even if memories of both remain.

I actually have this on my too read but I always hesitate with ANYTHING Lockheart related as I hate him as a character in general, even ignoring a mind switch lol.

Thanks.
