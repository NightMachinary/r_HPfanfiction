#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** It's a plot point in a Supernatural crossover: Sam's girlfriend (Jess) realizes that her roommate is /that/ Hermione. It's been ages since I've read any of it and I don't really remember what it was like, but it's apparently been updated recently?
