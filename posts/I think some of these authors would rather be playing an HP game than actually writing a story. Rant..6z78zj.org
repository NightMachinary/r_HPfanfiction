  and the goblins are ever so helpful with his little Horcrux problem
#+end_quote

I would like to see a fic where the Goblin Horcrux Removal Service involved an axe to the face.

Speaking of harems and Fleur isn't it funny to see Fleur characterised by the fanfic author, as a haughty ice queen who wants to be seen by her own merits not as a sex toy due to her veela nature, who then proceeds to join Harrys harem as side girl no. 3?

******* I am not implying that at all. It's not about how strong she is. Instead it's about her personality, her preferences and what she cares about. In harem stories what women care about and their preferences don't matter they all end up in the harem

Moreover submissive does not mean that she would be willing to share. A woman can be possessive and submissive at the same time

But in a relationship, in any relationship the wants of both the individuals should matter. Ots sucks when writers ignore the core characteristics of women ( or men especially in slash) just to fulfill their fantasies

**** Stories are about conflict. Harry ending up with a girl that is both three years older than him and the hottest in canon shouldn't be easy, it should be hard. When stories hand wave away any obstacles to Harry/Fleur, I think it cheapens them.

Harry is well aware Fleur is engaged, and he is well aware if he somehow managed to obtain her interest he'd be damaging his relationship with the Weasleys if he went through with it. These conflicts are a big part of the appeal to me, and far more interesting than veela bonds or other shenanigans.

The author said he has finished the first draft already, so he must have a resolution mind.

** don't forget stories where he inexcplicably gets pregnant!

Most of these stories are self insert wish fulfilment of adolescents. They are probably angry because their moms told them to clean their room.

And who wouldn't want to be rich, powerful, influential?

One can only hope that people who write that tripe grow up and maybe start writing something more interesting. I've seen few really good stories and when I check author's earlier work ... I'd recommend trying to leave a constructive & critical reviews.

What is really sad though is how many of these stories have "BEST EVAR!!!" style reviews. I guess some young writers get overly encouraged to write that shit with reviews like that.
