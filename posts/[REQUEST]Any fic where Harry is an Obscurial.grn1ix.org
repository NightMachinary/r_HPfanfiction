Preferably less depressing and less drabbley than linkao3(Darkness, Old Friend).

No bashing.


** I can recc obscurial fics, but I don't think any of them will fit your criteria. An obscurus is formed through abuse so all of the fics are going be kind of depressing? And I think most of them bash Dumbledore for leaving him with the Dursley's but I'd have to double check that :/

  There were rumours that Harry Potter was a squib. Harry smiled and laughed it off because he was actually so much, much worse.(Or in which the Dursley's harsh treatment didn't left Harry unscathed and his two best friends were the only ones who knew.)Edit: An epilogue is added

** This is just part of an abandoned fic that never went further than one chapter but I really liked it: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15271581/chapters/36999738][Strange and Dangerous]]
