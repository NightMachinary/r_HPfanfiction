Albus was devastated. In the two wars he has lived through, his inaction is what caused the most pain.

His unwillingness to fight Grindelwald had led to more people suffering for longer. Him underestimating the threat Tom Riddle posed had been disastrous.

But this time, it had been what he did, rather than what he didn't do. He had put Harry on the doorstep, he had been warned that they weren't good people. Oh how he wishes he had listened.

Once upon a time Albus Dumbledore might have told a small child that no amount of magic could brig back the dead. This Albus wouldn't, couldn't bring himself to believe that. He would fix this, he had to fix this.


** I cant remember the title sadly, but there is one where harry potter doesnt appear to hogwarts when they go find him, they find that he died 4 or 5 years ago and they try to do beter

** Ironically, this would make things much easier for Albus, as now Tom is fully killable. All he has to do is what he should have done 30 years ago and find and destroy Tom's horcruxes, instead of sitting on his ass.

*** you refer that as sitting on his ass.

I would say he was researching all the possible ways voldemort could have ensured his return

and then after seeing the dairy he confirmed it was horcruxes so started working on that angle heavily

**** Thank you! Just because Harry wasn't privy to everything the illegal counterterrorism commander and crew were doing doesn't mean they were lazy.

** I remember one story where Harry dies at a young age, but remains as a ghost that eventually relocates to Hogwarts, driving home to the Magicals just how badly they screwed up.

Sadly, I can't remember the name of the story, but I /think/ it was on FFN.

*** This wasn't a request, it was a prompt for a dark necromancer Dumbledore fic. Having said that I'll give your link a try.

edit: after commenting this I realized you probably meant to reply to the other guy.
