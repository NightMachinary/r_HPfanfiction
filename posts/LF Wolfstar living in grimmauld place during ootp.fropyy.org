Oneshots, super long ones, it's all okay. Preferably canon compliant. I want all the angst. Give me Sirius and Remus trying to rebuild a relationship, after Sirius spending 12 years in Azkaban blaming himself for James and Lily dying, and Remus spending that time thinking Sirius sold them to Voldemort. Sirius dealing with being locked up in the childhood home he ran away from. Arguing over how to deal with Harry who certainly deserves better than this whole situation where these ill-fitted two are the closest he has to parental figures. Or whatever you can find.


** Not quite what you are looking for but it's such a good series. Angst with a hopeful ending. Sirius gets spat out of the veil after Remus married Tonks. I highly recommend the series. It's one of my favorite works. This is the first work of the series. Linkao3(Howl by shiftylinguini) Tell me what you think of it if you read it.

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.
