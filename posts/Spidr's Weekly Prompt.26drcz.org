So this subreddit could use more prompts (and more writing!), so each week I'll give a prompt, and y'all will proceed to write a fic for it. I'll choose the best every Saturday.

This week's prompt is:

*Green looks beautiful on the unwilling..*


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10375464/1/Green-Looks-Beautiful-On-The-Unwilling][I suppose I'll start this one off.]]

Be warned that I haven't written anything other than formal essays and reports for a few years now. I'm sure I'm somewhere beyond rusty.

It's only ~300 words, just something quick I banged out after work.

Let me know what you think!

*** Ooh! Pretty good for a quickie. Reminds me a tad of a fic called Unintentionally Yours that went around the same premise; only it evolved into mushiness after two minutes.

**** Thanks!

I currently have HP/LV on the brain and the prompt reminded me of a fic where Harry was forced to marry Sirius so I just combined the two.

*** It's cute, and very cute at that, but I feel like I'm missing the whole "unwilling" bit. Really nice though!

**** Thanks. I actually wrote this more from the viewpoint of Draco being unwilling to let Harry down, no matter how nervous he is to see all of the Weasley's.

*** Very beautiful. Kind of a dark undertone, which I enjoyed immensely.
