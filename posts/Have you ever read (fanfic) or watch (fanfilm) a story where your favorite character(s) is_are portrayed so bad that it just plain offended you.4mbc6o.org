** I don't understand the massive hatred Ron has. I mean, I get that if you want to pair Harry and Hermione together you need to get that whole canon business out of the way somehow, but do you really need to accomplish that by making Ron into a lazy sexist incompetent blowhard of a Death Eater who gleefully rapes Hermione and kills her kids?

***** Indeed, that's the actual problem with that pairing - Harry often becomes wipped (sure he studies and learns etc. - but it's to please Hermione, not because he wants to) and it's Hermione who's suddenly the hero (reminds me of the last book somehow - must be because of Rowling who dismantles her hero totally, while giving Hermione more "screen-time"...Harry only wins because of Dumbledore's stupid plan, loads of help and a shit-ton of luck -.-))

****** I would blame Rowling's own poor writing skills on that one. She wrote herself into a corner, and when push came to shove, she had a deadline to push out a seventh book, but basically every character is flying blind in that book. They wander from scene to scene with very little idea of where to go next, or what to do, and there's tons of filler, but my point is that book seven was a mess, and it's not really Hermione's fault.

She's fairly passive, just like the rest of the heroes, and the 'proactive Hermione who actually solves problems' thing is largely a fanon construct. It's one I happen to like, because someone likeable and competent in this damned series would be a godsend, but it's fanon. She's kinda a dick, canonically, and on an even footing for 'not doing stuff' with Ron/Harry. I think part of the reason people make Harry passive ('whipped' as you put it) is that his canon role is as an observer/follower, rather than a leader. He's our viewpoint into the Wizarding World, so he naturally has to be somewhat detached from it, necessitating him to be somewhat passive in his approach. It also makes him less likeable as a character.

******* You might be spot on (Rowling ain't Shakespeare after all!) mostly, but I disagree with - supposedly - having to make Harry a passive observer (she didn't need to, but she just did anyway and what could have been a great series (still isn't bad - I just like fanfiction a lot more because the world's just great for that!) with a tried and proven formula (the heroe's journey!) becomes "how to fail yourself to success" -.-) - if Harry had been more active, smart and interested in shit then the world might be even more fleshed out etc. because he'd have asked questions (for starters: "Tell me MORE about my parents" "Can I see my parents academical records?" "Tell me about my family" etc. - later on branching out into magic, government (when the ministry is slandering him at the latest!) etc.) instead of just taking what he got on the way (unless his fun - quidditch - got interrupted, I bet that he'd not have learned the patronus if the dementors didn't disrupt quidditch games!)

******** Yeah, he's pretty much suicidally uncurious about the world. It's a damned shame, and why I mostly read Hermione-centric fanfic nowadays. Suemione may be kinda annoying at times, but at least she usually asks the kind of questions I would want to, in her position, without including the icky sexist shenanigans that indy!Harry is rife with.

And yeah, I think you're right about the quidditch thing. It's pretty much his sole defining interest, and frankly, quidditch was stupid as all hell (from a sporting perspective). People wiser and more eloquent than myself have dissected the stupidity of quidditch over the past decade and more. Harry is, in many respects, a bit of a jock stereotype, actually. He's friends with a nerd, and passes off a decent chunk of his work onto her throughout the series, but never actually gives a fuck about /magic school/, because he's honestly a bit vapid like that. You know, despite this being a series about *fucking magic school*. How do you manage not to give a fuck about screwing the laws of physics with your mind? Well, if you're Harry Potter, /quite easily/, because it doesn't usually involve a broomstick.

The point behind all of that bile I just spewed is that it boggles my mind how we have a series about magic school where we learn so little about how magic even works in the Potterverse. As in, there is no real underlying rules to how (or why) magic works or anything, and the best we can infer is that some magic is partially based on emotional state during casting. But not all, and not evenly, because... reasons. Potions involve mixing bits of magical creatures together in a ritualistic manner, with a technique so precise that it would never be discovered naturally, and this works because... reasons. Oh, and there's an ill-defined ritualistic component where certain acts have deep magical significance (drawing Gryffindor's sword, lifedebts, alchemy like Voldy's return, etc) because... reasons.

I don't particularly mind Harry as is, but I weep for all of the things we could have learned had he (and many of the other supporting characters) been more curious and proactive where we can see it. The Weasley twins, while horrible bullies, do so much experimentation during the series, but we (the reader) learn jack shit about magic in the time being. The most concrete thing I think we get in six damn years is that you can't transfigure food, and that was only because the idea that Wizards didn't need to worry about food scarcity bugged Rowling so much.

********* Indeed, in Harry's shoes I'd probably turn into a kind of Hermione 2.0 (I'd learn magic just so I can screw around with reality, to make stuff I always wanted to have, like say a HOVERBOARD (they made a broom fly, so why not make something like THAT?) among other things and to be able to defend myself against everybody and everything possible!)...with less social awkwardness of course ;)

I do mind, because his parents are always lauded as being so great (come on James might have SQUANDERED his talents on pranks, but the guy was a genius in transfiguration, a teenage animagus and made one of the greatest things in the series (with the other Marauders): The Marauders' Map! Not to mention that Lily was kind of a better version of Hermione (more attractive and supposedly smarter))...I bet his parents would SCOLD him, LOUDLY if they were alive and treated school etc. like he did (I mean the guy is practically SUICIDAL (!) because he doesn't learn/train to really defend himself (it's only because of innate talent that he's this good in defense!))

On the other hand: All that applies to MOST of his classmates (the only ones openly CURIOUS about magic are the twins - and only if it's prank-related -.-)

ps: I'd like to read some of those Hermione centric fictions (note: Not Hermione/Ron if possible and not Draco/Hermione either (I'll read them if really well done, but only then!) - oh: Hermione/Snape (or Dumbledore, or Lucius Malfoy or Tom Riddle!) is TOTALLY OFF THE TABLE...sorry, hate those pairings)

********** Yeah, his parents were kinda sueish at times, though mainly because everyone in the Potterverse seemed to know/like them until the 5th book. And it was... /okay/, for a childrens' book, where the orphan's dead parents were seen as almost universally good people, I guess. It's cliche as hell, and kinda boring from an adult perspective, but it's... okay, I guess, because early Potter stories really are Scooby Doo tbh.

And yes, Harry squanders his talents, because he's pretty much the epitome of the rich, vapid white guy. Despite his upbringing. Which makes no fucking sense, but Rowling wrote it, not me. He pretty much always acted like it, snarking mentally at the Dursleys and generally acting like a bit of a dick, but the moment he gets his money... that's the point that he never worries about his position in life ever again. Because being incredibly famous for rather shaky reasons wasn't enough. It's kinda sad. Ron can be similar, but not quite so obviously. Ron using magic to cheat on his driving test in the epilogue pretty much sums up their attitude, tbh. I think the lack of curiosity (especially on the part of the muggle-raised) is a failure of imagination on the part of JKR, because it applies to all of the characters fairly evenly.

Anyway, fanfic recs... linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) is a decent place to start, if you haven't read it already, and expounds upon the canon emotional element to magic in what feels like a logical way.

I'm very fond of linkffn(Those Gilded Chains We Wear by KuraiBites), though it's more romance than anything. Fairly exotic premise, and it pretty much single-handedly persuaded me that lesbian!Hermione was worth reading. There's a little Hermione/Ron, but it doesn't last.

Some might recommend linkffn(The Arithmancer), although I found that it got boring at times, mostly after Hermione was pulled out of Hogwarts. Apparently there's a sequel now, so I might give it another shot. Definitely worth a look, either way.

If you don't mind crossovers with a (generally) bad anime, linkffn(Effloresco Secundus) was excellent.

I have more, but not sure on your preferences with regard to femslash. I'm kinda hesitant to read het romance these days, largely because the HHr fandom put me off it (bashing too stronk. I think I've developed a nervous reaction to the word 'Dumbles'). I seriously started reading femslash because romance where the woman isn't treated like a fashion accessory to god!Harry was apparently too much to ask for :/

************ No, she never did. He seems to have N-1 galleons, where N represents an infinite quantity. He has exactly as much money as is required by the plot, but not actually an infinite supply, not that he ever does anything with it anyway. Snape had a point, even if he was a colossal douchenozzle. Honestly, a lot of Harry's traits can be summed up as 'exactly as much as required by the plot', his curiosity for instance, or how famous he is at any given moment.

Omniscient narrator is something I basically never see, not that specifically seek it out. As in, I could count the instances I've seen on an amputee's stump. I'm not overly fond of it, because most people can't pull it off, and the field of Hermione-centric fanfic isn't huge either. Especially considering the pairing parameters you specified (do you have any idea how popular Hr/SS is?). Basically, if I've read any with an omniscient narrator, I don't remember it, I'm afraid.

Since you seem to dislike the idea of her being in most of the popular setups (bar H/Hr, I guess), how do you feel about shipping her with another woman?

Edit: Is Hermione/Dumbledore really popular enough for you need to specify? I'd never even considered them, tbh, although I guess time travel is probably involved? Dat generation gap would be hellish for writing romance.

************* I know that HP/SS is VERY POPULAR...almost as much as Harry/Draco (and in theory I'd have nothing against said pairing as both of them are academics (He's not a potions-master because he hates studying, is he?), both are often under-valued by their peers etc. - it's just that I don't think Hermione would EVER date someone who's as much of an asshole as Snape, not to mention someone who's so much older than her...de-aging or time-travel might work here of course!)

Yeah, that position (all knowing narrator) is hard to pull off :) (but it's great to read if the author knows his stuff!)

Yeah, Harry has money but he still often enough plays the "I am a poor orphan"-card sadly (I mean in his shoes I'd do what many fanfiction-writers have him do: Go shopping for clothes (and other much needed items)...and I dislike shopping for clothes, so that IMHO shows how bad I think the situation is!)...pisses me off, too

Female-Slash? Don't care (meaning: I don't hate it - I don't look for it normally, but I don't have a problem with it...I am usually very tolerant toward LGBTs, I just don't read slash normally, especially if it's between characters that HATE each other in canon (not only in Harry Potter, I'd never read similar pairings in other universes either...just squicks me, I mean not only do you mutilate the character's opinions but you also have to change their sexuality and then pair them with one of his/her enemies...really? Still, as I said: Female-Slash is ok!))

ps: What would be those most popular pairings bar Hermione/Snape, Hermione/Ron (note: I'd love to know what attracts her to him...they are like matter and anti-matter IMHO...the academic and the slacker, the cultured, well read and the buffoon etc.) and of course Hermione/Tom (or Voldemort)?

Well, I don't read Hermione-Centric stuff normally (might change now!), but I've seen fictions that pair her with Dumbledore (!), just like I've seen Harry/Sirius or Harry/Remus (!)

************** I'm not sure how well HHr and RHr are doing atm compared to one another, but Hermione/Ron is pretty popular, yes. I just tend to notice HHr more because of the egregious amounts of fail that come out of that fandom. I used to really like the pairing, but the rampant bashing and general stupidity of a large portion of its proponents has put me right off. I'm honestly swinging more toward Bellamione now, crazy as that sounds, because Hermione really /does/ have a prominent nasty streak in canon, and seeing Bellatrix developed more was always interesting. Those Gilded Chains really changed the way I look at them, certainly. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Go read it, btw.]] It's very slow development, and they /do/ hate each other for a long time, especially at the beginning, but people have a capacity to change, and Bellatrix isn't as flat as she was in canon, so the romantic angle sort of creeps up on you. There's no character mutilation that I've noticed, although Bellatrix is a good deal more complex than the lol!Evil character she was in canon. This doesn't particularly change the way she behaves, at least at first, though it weakens her bond to Voldemort in one particularly crucial way. Basically, she's not as /mindlessly/ fanatical as she appears, and has reasons for following him that he inadvertently damaged in the leadup to the battle of Hogwarts. Hermione has no idea she's into women for ages, either, so I wouldn't say it's 'changing' her sexuality, more like a slow realisation that she's not sexually interested in Ron. In many respects, it reminds me of my own realisation that I was bi.

I think with Ron and Hermione it's their joint sense that bickering is natural. Ron bickered with his family, and presumably Hermione did with hers (from what we see of her), whereas for Harry that means 'abuse', and he doesn't really get it. For them, it means they're comfortable with the person. At least, that's how I've seen it put by others. Also, Hermione could be really intimidated by someone as smart as she is, at least until she grew up a bit. See how she reacted in HBP, although I always felt that it was a character derailment on Rowling's part to have her treat Harry like this over a stupid book. Ron always needed outside reassurance of his own worth, and Hermione provides that. They're not divinely-ordained lovers or anything, but I could see it working in theory. I just happen to think Rowling is shit at writing romance, and the books would probably have been better had she stayed well away from the attempt. She's actually written other books besides HP, some of which contain romance, and... well, I wouldn't shred them for my hamster to piss on, tbh. The poor little guy might get some kind of rash.

I misread when I started talking about Hermione-centric stuff, because you were mostly just talking about pairings that involve her. That's my personal biases slipping in there, I think. I mostly like them because they subvert the Harry-centric nature of most fanfiction, and often take things in directions Harry is not wont to touch. But yeah, I could definitely see Snape, because Hermione can be pretty dickish herself, canonically. I mean, if I can picture her with Bellatrix, it'd be hypocritical to say I couldn't see it working with Snape, y'know? Draco/Hermione? Meh. I always thought he had more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did, if only because Ginny wasn't developed enough, and their mutual obsessions. Pairing him with Hermione seems like it would be quite mediocre.

Rape and becoming a DE? I don't know if done right it could happen (look at PETER PETTIGREW, the "Ron" of the Marauders!), but it's been done to death, so maybe just a jealous slacker who doesn't amount to much - is that too much to ask for? ;)

You're reading this as an adult? Don't project adult behaviors onto the teenagers.

**** Man, you really need to go through the books again. The amount of fanon crap you're spewing is staggering.

Someone being a lazy slacker is no reason to not befriend him. Ron didn't mock Hermione for paying attention in class (only for being patronizing in a very insulting way), and he didn't bully Harry into taking those classes, Harry was just ambivalent about what classes to take and thought it would generally be better with Ron.

And considering how rarely Arithmancy and Ancient Runes are used in canon (about once each), I don't think his choice in classes is bad at all. CoMC is important considering all the dangerous creatures Harry encounters (as well as useful creatures, like Hippogriffs and Thestrals), and Divination, while it won't make Harry a seer (debatable, actually), certainly gives, for instance, an insight into magical symbolism.

****** You didn't use any quotes. You might think you remember the books well but it seems you get little details wrong, and your interpretation of what's going on "between the lines" is very liberal.

The passage about choosing the subjects is thus:

#+begin_quote
  "But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he'd have someone friendly to help him."
#+end_quote

Ron has absolutely no direct input here, certainly not bullying.

I don't think Hermione used Ancient Runes or Arithmancy in creating the DA parchment, and we're told she used the Protean charm for the coins, so it's obviously not those subjects.

About Divination, Harry had some dreams that seemed prophetic from time to time (for instance: /"Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realised he had forgotten his Firebolt./" quite resembles the first task). McGonagall belittled Divination very early (which turned out to be bullshit), so Harry's approach to it was nonchalant, but if it wasn't, he might have taken those dreams (and Trelawny's prophecy about Pettigrew) more seriously, and used them to prepare for the future.

** Honestly, any characterisation of Lucius Malfoy usually makes me WINCE. The guy's a politician with a temper problem, but the way people normally characterize him is ridiculous - he's normally some sort of bumbling idiot, the evilest monster to ever live whose son is terrified of him and doesn't love him (I blame the movies for this one), or a flat villain in the background.

I love exploring Narcissa and Lucius as Arthur and Molly's mirrors, and all four of these characters are more complex than just cardboard cut-outs of Good and Evil, but moreover, the idea that Narcissa and Lucius don't love Draco is just... It's not even insulting to me, it's just ???

What a mess.

Most Snape characterizations I despise for the same reason as you. He's either a goody-two shoes who totes loves Lily and would never do a darn thing wrong, or he's the worst most evil bat monster of the dungeons.

Marauder characterisation usually hurts me for the same reason - Peter Pettigrew is my favourite of the four, but he's either portrayed as the fat useless one in the background or the member of the group that everyone secretly dislikes.

With James, Sirius and Remus, I think people struggle with the idea that the three of them can be good people while also having been bullies at school, which they were. Snape aside, they were known to do big nasty pranks on various Slytherin kids, and that doesn't mean they weren't on the Light side, or even that they weren't mostly good people.

But they were bullies, pure and simple, and they enjoyed causing other kids pain and discomfort for a good laugh, just like Fred and George.

Generally my issue is the black-and-white mentality a lot of fanfic authors tend to take - if they like a character, said character can do no wrong, and if they don't like them, that character has never so much as pet a kitten without an evil ulterior motive.

It's sad more than anything else.

** God yes. Anything by Robst, for instance, in which /everyone/ is OOC to the point of absurdity. Whitewashing characters mostly just makes them boring, not that the canon characters were super complex to begin with, but doing it to Snape just makes no sense. I mean, doesn't that just destroy his appeal? Aside from his association with the late (and 'smexy') Alan Rickman, what would you have left?

Anyway, generally speaking, character bashing is one of the things I dislike most about Potterfic. I don't even really like the Weasleys that much as characters, but 'Weasley Bashing' fics utterly destroy my immersion in a story. It's like... they replaced the entire cast of characters with brain-damaged political caricatures, and I can't form an emotional attachment to that. Dumbledore bashing, likewise, because I have difficulty believing a villain that stupid has a place in literature. Evil Dumbledore, I could maybe see, but I've never seen it done well. Hermione, with bashing, usually gets to be a minion of 'The Man' or else gets to be Harry's simpering cheerleader, both of which are severely OOC and not even interesting to compensate.

The most effective way to bash Harry is to make him super powerful (but only in a boring, DBZ sort of way) and change his name to Lord Harisadrian Potter-Black-Ravenclaw-Emrys-Uzumaki-Slytherin-Aozaki-Gryffindor-le Fey. Then everyone will hate him. It's already too late.

*** Well there is a difference between a Snape fan and a Snape apologist. Honestly, the apologists aren't even fans of his character, because they twist him so much and turn him into someone barely recognizable from the books.

** Came here to say Severus Snape and the Marauders, I couldn't even watch past 5 minutes because I was so angry at how out of character everyone was. It just frustrated me so much!

** I generally just treat every story as a different universe to save on some annoyance. But I'm bored of evil Dumbledore, yes harry had issues with him in book 5, yes he wasn't perfect, but some people are just so black and white about it. In fact any character that is black and white evil/awful all of a sudden or desperately sappy and teenage romantic out off nowhere bores me. Complexity and depth please. Although I enjoyed that Snape fanfilm despite its pro-Snape angle. It was just nice to see something with such good producion values and I though the casting was excellent.

** I know!! I just don't understand all that excitement around Snape. I saw this fanfilm months ago and I actually liked Peter and Remus actors, but that's all there is to like in my opinion. When I started reading fanfiction, it confused me why people often put him as Harry's mentor or father figure or Hermione's lover, etc. I just can't imagine it :) I actually liked the character much more in books. Now I just avoid fics, where he is listed among the main characters. As for marauders, I think a lot of people started to demonise them after book revelation when they bullied Snape in 5 year. But Snape fans take it to some extreme levels, portraying him as some misunderstood hero... He is not a hero, but I respect his character, because in the end, he chose the right thing and stuck with it even if it was difficult. Personally, I don't find his love for Lily that touching, and I don't think his actions completely redeem the fact he is a bully himself and that he actually told Voldemort the prophecy (so what if he went to Dumbledore to save Lily, what would have happened if it was just Neville?), but that is just my opinion. (sorry for my English, I don't speak that well)

*** I think of Snape as a really sneaky Slitherin bastard, who just realised he had one thing he cared about, and his story is more of revenge, not redemption. That's how I like this character:)
