Harry, the weasleys claimed the burrow during the first goblin war seven hundred years ago the burrow was a goblin stronghold before that but William Weasley lead an assault and claimed the Stronghold as his home, Ronald explained while leading Harry around the house, 'My dad was actually from a poorer branch of the family Dad was not set to inherit the burrow, but grindalwalds war and the dragon pox epidemic had killed off a lot of branches of the family and then voldemort got the rest, Great great Grandpa Will decided to make dad his successor and here we are

** Hmm...I'm imagining it, I'm imagining it...

With their incredible wealth, Arthur and Molly don't just stop at Ginny; they go on to have 12 more children (including another pair of twins and one of triplets). And the numerous orphans they took in after the Voldemort war.\\
Between their large immediate family, adopted family, married-into family, and numerous servants (house-elves, humans, even a handful of other beings like veela and goblins), the Weasleys are more often labelled as a tribe than a family, without any irony.\\
Actually, maybe the Weasley tribe is so big that it subdivides into multiple family groups; Gryffindor, Prewitt, McKinnon, whatever other magical names they have claim to...

Hmm, what else...?
