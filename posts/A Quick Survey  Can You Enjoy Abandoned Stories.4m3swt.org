*** Same for me. Out of my top ten favorite stories, only three are complete. The rest are either WIP or abandoned.

** Sadly, I cannot enjoy a story without an ending. If I know there's no ending, I can't even get invested.

*** Agreed. I read a few abandoned stories when I first started reading ff and I was very disappointed that they didn't have an ending. Now, I don't even bother to open it if it's not complete or updated within the later month. I do have about 5 stories that are abandoned by still favourited, because they really were that good, but that just makes their incompleteness worse...

*** That's how I feel about it. I was so invested in the Resonance series and then bam, no ending.

** Abandoned stories don't bother me but I'd prefer if the author gave a warning that it was abandoned, so it wouldn't be a complete shock

** The inability to enjoy abandoned stories has always struck me as very strange. Your life is essentially a story that will be abandoned before it is complete. You're never going to get to know the ending to the story of the human race.

For most people this does not stop them from enjoying life.

*** I am similarly perplexed by someone's not being able to enjoy an incomplete story. After all, we all are required do this with our favorite series, /Alex Verus/, /Dresden Files/, /Game of Thrones/^{†} , etc., where upon completing each volume, while we might get a small measure of closure, open questions remain. Do those who cannot enjoy an incomplete story also hold off and wait for a series to be completed before beginning?

^{†} Not a personal favorite; GRRM showed himself to be quite the asshat when I met him, which makes it hard for me to enjoy the series.

*** Some of us read fiction precisely because it is different from real life. Including a nice sense of closure and/or a happy ending. Reading is escapism.

** Sometimes.

For me it really depends on how much I enjoyed it up until the point it was abandoned.

I also think that there's a weird line, which I only found myself maybe a week ago, where you love a story so much, you just enjoyed the time you had with it.

I've almost always had the experience of reading an abandoned Fic, and then being upset there wasn't more, but recently I read one that I just enjoyed so much that I didn't even care it hadn't been updated since '07. Sure I'm sad it won't ever have an actual ending, but I loved every minute I spent reading it, and that's enough.

** It's more the ending of a good story that is sad for me. Whether that came about because of abandonment or completion, the end result is the same: no more story.

** I will only read abandoned stories if they were posted after 2012, and were last updated in past year.
