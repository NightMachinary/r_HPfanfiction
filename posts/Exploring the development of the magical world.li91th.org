** NoahPhantom's Albus Potter series focuses a lot on recent innovations in the magical world such as more powerful spells, the discoveries in wandlore allow for mass-production of wands that are best suitable for one's magic abilities, there is even a class in experimental magic, international transportation in under an hour to any corner of the world and implementation of magic in Muggle technology.

** What developments? Considering wizards stopped developing AT ALL after they split from the muggles, it seems wizards are unable to develop on their own. Perhaps development is the power he knows not? Go cityplanner!Harry

/s naturally dont take this nonsense siriusly :P

*** I actually have a pretty original idea for rapid transport that should be really comfortable, doesn't spin around like crazy, doesn't teleport (which could be great for volatile cargo and/or patients in bad condition) and could go anywhere on Earth in less than an hour. Plus it wouldn't expend single use expensive enchanted objects (Portkeys) and wouldn't be locked to fixed destinations (Floo):

Magic powered rocket spaceships. If you can make a Ford Anglia fly and a fire burn without needing fuel, it'd be pretty easy to build a spaceship straight out of science fiction. Take a large vehicle, enchant it to fly, add a rocket engine that's enchanted to not need fuel, add air freshening systems and anti radiation shield charms, done.

You wouldn't even have to make it fully space capable. Mach 10 flight in the upper atmosphere should be decently fast for international travel, the flight would be super smooth compared to portkeys and you can make the seats as comfortable as you want. Concorde on steroids but less cramped.

Assuming unlimited Δv thrusters and the desire for a decently comfortable ride, London - Hogsmeade should be doable in below 15 mins. Way better than the Express. London - NY in 30 mins. London - Sydney in 1 hour. If it takes a while to get an international Portkey, catching the next flight could be faster, more convenient and possibly less expensive.

Assuming an enchanted rocket rather than some handwavium drive, Earth - Moon is under 4 hours, perfectly feasible. Earth - Mars would be 40 hours minimum, 120 hours maximum, depending on planetary alignment. The outer planets might be a month long trip, offer it as a luxurious cruise with a slalom through Saturn's rings as the highlight. It could be done faster with a more powerful rocket but unless a completely different magical method of space travel is developed, going faster would be somewhat uncomfortable.

All the technology needed is easily available in the spells and enchantments we see in canon (apart from interplanetary navigation, which shouldn't take too long to develop). It could be a seriously profitable business.

**** I like it. You even did the calculations behind it. Better dig into these calculations later.

***** It's the math for a classical newtonian rocket with efficiency = infinity. Not even that complicated really.

Now, for interstellar distances, that's where to gets more interesting because I'd have to open my special relativity textbook and calculate in a Minkowski space. Interestingly, it'd only take a few decades to reach Andromeda, without any handwavium except for the infinite efficiency and the protection against running into micrometeorites at 99%c, both easily doable with canon level magic. Although if the traveler turned around, they'd return to Earth 5 million years in the future.

Another interesting thing I learned studying relativistic physics, if there was any magical method of communicating or traveling faster than light, it'd be almost trivially easy to turn it into time travel. Basic Lorentz transformation. This is actually almost exactly the same as a scenario Einstein himself mentioned in /Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper/ about the relativity of simultaneousness.

So here I am wondering, if Harry destroys the final Horcrux, when exactly does Voldemort turn mortal? Simultaneousness isn't an absolute thing. If the Horcrux destroyed sends a signal at the speed of light that turns Voldemort mortal as soon as it reaches him, all is good and logically consistent. If Voldemort turns mortal before a speed of light signal from the Horcrux destruction can reach him, then Voldemort would turn mortal before the Horcrux was destroyed, at least from a certain point of view. Of course this timing difference would be an indetectable fraction of a second if both are in the same country, but if they're on spaceships astronomical distances (~8 lightminutes) apart it's a different story.
