...He is the one who accidentally sent her back - I believe she was walking away from him in the dungeons and he called her back and she tripped over a staircase or something, and it was a time turner accident. She and the marauders and then Severus become friends, and he at one point tells her he had a dream that he was grown up and she was eleven, and she set him on fire.

Also to make Harry and Ron believe this really happened, Remus and Sirius showed them photos of Hermione hanging out with them.

I read this a really long time ago, during the long summer before OotP, on a site that was not FFN, but I don't remember what the site was - I believe it asked if you were over 17 or not before it allowed you entry, which I was not, haha.

I'd love to find it again. Has anyone read it or remembers it?

Thanks!

*** Those look interesting! I shall explore, thanks! But it wasn't one of those. Specifically, it was written before OotP came out - I'm going to take a stab at saying it was written in 2002 or before, because I think I found it on NYE.

**** I'll keep digging!

E: do you have a rough idea of how old Hermione was when she got sent back? Was she 13/14 like when she had the time turner in canon, or much older but she kept it? Did she travel back pre-Hogwarts or when they were 11, or show up in the middle of one of their years? Also, did it have much cussing or get very sexual (that might help me narrow it down rating wise). Any little bit you remember would help!

***** Haha! Challenge accepted?

I believe she was probably 16 or 17. I think she had been either dating or liked Ron before it happened. She showed up at some point in the middle of Hogwarts. Probably when they were the same age. I think she ended up in their year. It must have been rated M. I don't recall what happened in most of it but after she came back I believe she was like ‚ÄúRon, I can't pursue a relationship with you anymore I am in love with Snape.‚Äù Or something like that. And I was like OMG she's dating a guy twice her age! ü§£

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/524807/1/A-little-of-your-time][A little of your time]] by Serpentina seems to fit the bill. It's on ffn, but could have been moved there or even stolen and posted there maybe. It's in the right time frame, and features Hermione bumping into Snape and falling down stairs, going by a false name in the past, and photos later being shown as proof.

*** Ooh this does have potential! I'm not sure if this is quite it, I think the time turner scene was a little different in my recollection but this one has a Professor Figg! Nice find thanks!!

**** Ok skimmed several chapters, this one is not it, but it has an interesting note at the bottom of the first chapter though.

"I couldn't think of a way to get my Hermione's Time-Turner to malfunction. It is to MPA and her story **/Lost in the Marauders' Time\/** that I (and so many other HG/SS shippers) owe the brilliant idea of falling down the stairs."

I wonder if there are just... a whole bunch of fanfics where Hermione falls down the stairs and goes back in time, and that one was one of them. Shoot.

And that **/Lost in the Marauders' Time\/** one is a Hermione/Lupin, so the search continues. But thank you, this is a helpful hint! It all makes sense now.
