It's so absolutely pervasive despite not being based in canon in any way. Leaving aside the fact that I can't imagine any real couple of a James and a Lily naming their kid Hadrian, even if people did want to give him a more formal name (because so many HP fanfic authors just want to write regency romance wank) surely Henry has more of a basis in reality. Traditionally, Harry has been used as a nickname for Henrys in the same way that Jack was once upon a time a nickname for John.

Honestly, I consider any use of the name Hadrian to be strike one against me reading a fic. It's indicative of the worst kind of copycat writer.


** I imagine it's a teaboo thing mixed with non-British perceptions of certain names. There's that sort of vaguely fetishised 'Britain is Posh' stuff (I think it's an American thing, though I have no idea if it's real or just a Hollywood invention) that concludes Harry is too common sounding a name and thinks that Nobleman Harry must sound more Noble, without really having the specific awareness that we've had a lot of Royals, Aristocrats, Nobility, and Gentry that've gone by Harry or Henry or whatever and very very few took incredibly posh-sounding names like they were Byzantine Emperors. So, they riff on it a little until they go "Omg, Hadrian! Like the wall! That guy was an Emperor, that's so totally appropriate for my Nobleman Harry character!"

I can see the canon-ish logic-basis for the idea of the name though, even if not for the name itself. Rowling is a bit of a Latin nerd (I think she was in school for it at some point?) so there are a lot of Latin-ish names in the series - Albus, Severus, Minerva, Filius, etc. So, there's a general vibe of Latin sounding names that could've made whoever started the Hadrian thing think it would 'fit in'. They just ignore the fact that James and Lily would be very unlikely to have ever given a kid of theirs that name.

**** Exactly. Royal Names are all just like Henry, George, James, John, William, Edward, etc. We even had a king actually named Harold (King of England in 1066, so one of our most famous, too), so that would actually BE a Royal Name. Basically all of our male royals since him have had pretty regular-sounding names. I'm not sure about how posh people would regard names like Isabella and Catherine and Victoria as being, but I wouldn't think they're too much posher than the male names. Not a lot of Fitzwilliams in the actual royal family. :D

And yep, it certainly does. But implementing ideas and not really doing anything with them is a common cliche with Hadrian-type fics. Buy a million things that go on a shelf somewhere, get a name that nobody uses (/cough cough/ Voldemort /cough cough/), and experience a lot of stuff that never really gets talked about or dealt with beyond the spectacularly-talented off-screen-and-never-mentioned therapist. :D

** Snobbery, mainly. Harry is a very normal, unassuming name - it started out as a nickname really. It's perfect for "Just Harry", but not for your "Lord Hadrian James Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Merlin by right of blood and conquest, Goblin Friend, Elf Champion, Defender of the Weak and All-Round Good Guy" powerwank fic.

It also doesn't help that pretty much everyone in Harry Potter has a somewhat unusual name, and in comparison Harry's is very ordinary. Even excluding names like "Sirius Black" and "Minerva McGonagall", Harry has one of the least interesting names. Hell, it wasn't uncommon for people not to know how to say Hermione's name until the first film came out - it was /that/ rare. Ron was, and remains, an old man name in the UK and "Weasley" itself is quirky enough in its own right.

"Hadrian" carries the classical connotations of some of the other HP names (see "Severus Snape", "Remus Lupin" and "Pomona Sprout" amongst others), which simultaneously makes Harry seem like a more cohesive part if his own universe and lends a certain pedigree that "Harry" lacks.

**** Dude, ice cold take. There are tons of reasons someone could be into that. From simple power fantasies (wouldn't it be awesome to be super rich and fancy) to an actual interest in what wizarding culture would look like (the years of history and tradition developed separate from muggle culture. ) I know the books are written as "hurr durr slytherins and purebloods bad" but if examined with some nuance, one might actually conclude that the small isolated wizarding culture is the minority, despite the fact that they hold all the power. People trying to destroy wizarding traditions and make the world more muggle are the colonizers here. I personally think a lot of the problems would be solved with a wizarding primary school for the muggleborn. At least then the problem wouldn't be that they weren't familiar with wizarding society. Then the people trying to keep power within the old families would just be acting out of greed, not out of an attempt to preserve the culture. I personally love the pureblood Harry fics and im as black as they come. I daresay im not a closet white supremacist or anything of the sort.

** Eh, partially it comes from the Roman emperor that was said to be quite a strategist, academic and fighter (not sure about the history, but he is the reason for the Hadrian's Wall having its name). Partially because despite the actual culture and history of Britain Hadrian just plainly sounds posher than Henry.

By itself it is mostly just a minor detail and don't reflect too much on the story's quality - linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries) does it and the quality is top notch - the real problem is that frequently it is used in conjunction with the Indy!Harry trope and the LordWTF!Harry trope which by themselves also frequently bring along manipulative(/cough/stupid/cough/)!Dumbledore, overly helpful goblins, bashing!feasts...in the end the story's quality is generally quite low and many associate it with Harry having other name as a warning about the tropes the story is going to overuse badly.
