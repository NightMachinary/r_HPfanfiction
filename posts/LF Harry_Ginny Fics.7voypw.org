...Where they are equals. Preferably in a situation where they become closer friends earlier on in Hogwarts. During OotP perhaps?

I'm normally a H/Hr kinda guy, but I feel like there's this giant section of the fandom I'm missing out on. I'd especially like to read Harry/Ginny Fics where they have some funny banter going on between them. They both seem sassy enough to be doing that a lot.


** As someone whose favorite girl for Harry is strong!Ginny, it's unfortunate how few good stories are actually out there. You're probably not missing as much as you think, but there is some good stuff. [[http://siye.co.uk/search.php?action=tens&list=reviewedstories][Here is a link to SIYE]], a Harry/Ginny dedicated site, and their 25 most reviewed stories. Among them, I probably enjoyed Normalcy the most but it's been so long since I've read them that I've forgotten what a lot of them are about.

I can also recommend Changeling and its sequels by Annerb. Even though most of the Harry/Ginny romance is in the sequels, Changeling itself is one of the best stories in the fandom.

If you're looking for banter, Anything's Possible is a story about Lily returning through the veil. Lily is clearly where Harry gets his snark and while I don't think it's specifically a Harry/Ginny story, they are listed as the two main characters.

The biggest problem in Harry/Ginny stories is that a large number of them follow canon in telling how they /can't/ be together, rather than them being together against an outside conflict. Or Harry puts Ginny up on a shelf while he does his thing. It's kind of disheartening, really.

***** There's not a whole lot to say about it that its description doesn't already convey. It's a character driven story about Ginny growing from a terrified young girl into a confident young woman that balances her Weasley heritage with Slytherin values. There's nothing unique about the premise; it just has exceptional execution.

The only type of reader that I wouldn't recommend it to is someone who is looking for intense action and/or larger than life characters.

** Linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs)

Linkffn(Unspeakable Things by Darth Marrs)

Linkffn(Elemental Harry by hermyd)

First is a soul bond which is actually pretty solid. The relationship is pretty well done, and the final battle is unique. Bond starts in the Chamber. A good amount of banter in adjusting to the bond.

2nd is Harry, Ginny, and a psychotic Luna are strong. Trained by the Unspeakables at a young age, and very powerful. They become friends beginning of Harry's second year.

Third isn't my favourite, but Ginny is near Harry's equal, both having special powers.

** I've done a lot of Harry/Ginny stuff--they're what I'm primarily writing right now, but just about all of my stories take place post-Hogwarts, so it's not exactly what you're asking for here. To me, there's no way Harry would tolerate a doormat and in my Potterverse, Ginny ain't go no time for that.

** The plotline you describe with H&G becoming friends early on and having a strong, equal relationship while still at Hogwarts is a bit rare in my experience, especially nowadays when most authors tend to develop Ginny after the battle rather than before. I think authors really struggle with teenage Ginny, tbh - it's challenging to develop her without treading on the other characters or making her too OOC.

I can do some more digging and there are tons of great H/G fics overall but I think the ones which fit your request best are in the tiny subgenre where Harry enters professional Quiddith post-Hogwarts and becomes Ginny's biggest rival. There are a few fics in this category but the best example is probably [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=128749&chapter=1][Flying Free]] on SIYE.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/][SIYE]] has several stories of the type you request. They're basically (what used to be) Portkey.org, but for H/G, not H/Hr.

While she's a bit of a Mary Sue and the series ending is a disappointment, the Ginny in SSHENRY's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=5097][Summer of the Serpent]] series might be a place to look. I think it's unique to this site.
