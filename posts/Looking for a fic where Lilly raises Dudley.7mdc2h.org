I was wondering if anyone knew of any fics that had Lilly Potter raising Dudley. I saw a post that mentioned the concept and wondered if anyone had expanded upon it.


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10566861]] The Family Potter Dirgewithoutmusic Summary: When Harry was eleven years old, his Hogwarts letter came by owl. He'd been accidentally blowing windows open and lighting cauliflower on fire for years. James took Harry to go get his wand at Ollivanders, and Lily took Dudley to the Owl Emporium where he tried to convince her they should build an aviary in the backyard. They came home with a fat black cat who hissed at everyone. Dudley named him Spooks, and Lily called him Monster.

"Did you have to?" said James. "That is the meanest beast I've ever met, and I've known Remus unmedicated on full moons and a pubescent Sirius thwarted in love."

Lily, who had ink on her cheek and a ballpoint pen stuck behind her ear, waved vaguely at the living room without looking up from her arrest report. Dudley was asleep in an armchair. The cat sprawled across his lap. Both its front paws were wrapped around Dudley's arm as it cleaned his wrist with aggressive fondness.

"Alright," said James. "Yeah, you had to."

  Dudley wishes he could go to Hogwarts. AU, and written before Deathly Hallows came out. This is a remix, with permission, of a drabble by Lilacsigil.

** I think the classic for this premise is "A different Halloween" in which the Potters escape Voldemort and he goes after the Dursleys instead. Harry, Hermione and Dudley grow up together.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
