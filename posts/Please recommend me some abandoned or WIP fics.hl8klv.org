** How do you feel about in-progress series with several completed books?

linkffn(Innocent) is a "Sirius escapes early and raises Harry" story with a strong element of giving Harry an actual childhood. It's sweet to see eight-year-old Harry using Kreacher to cheat at hide and seek :). Book one is pre-Hogwarts, the following books cover one year each. The latest chapters take place shortly after the Yule Ball. Updates every couple of weeks.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) starts off pretty straightforwardly, with Harriett Potter impersonating her cousin so she can go to Hogwarts. As the series progresses, though, it unfolds more and more layers; a Tom Riddle with ambitions more subtle than genocide, the complications of not just maintaining an identity but having to swap back and forth over summer and meet people who know both identities, life on the streets beyond Knockturn Alley, an interesting exploration of the nature of alchemy, and dangers more horrifying than anything in canon. Book four is in progress. Updates are a little more spread out, but are very large (up to 30k words per chapter).

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3542099/1/How-I-Learned-To-Stop-Worrying-And-Love-Lord-V][how I learned to stop worrying and love Lord V]]

This will always be in my top 10.

Edit to add an excerpt:

"This could just be some plan to get me away from Hogwarts and kill me."

Voldemort did an insane little dance of frustration in which he swooped round with his arms aloft. I watched in nauseated astonishment. "A, there is a nuclear war on, and B, why on earth would I cast a temporal stasis spell just to get you away from Hogwarts?!"

"Because you want to kill me!"

He stopped his dance and gave a hoot of strangled laughter. "Fuck me, boy, I don't want to kill you that much!"

"Is it a difficult spell to cast?" I said doubtfully, privately thinking that he must be telling the truth just because he was being so weird, and that anyway I had no choice but to go with him for the moment, because if I stayed here any longer I would completely loop the loop . "It took me most of 1956," he said sombrely. "Even I encountered great problems. I began to think I wouldn't get it done in time."

** Some of my favorite, non-slash, unfinished fics.

*Not left hanging:*

- Realizations by Wishweaver linkffn(1260679) Some argue that this fic is finished and just not marked as such; it leaves off in a non-cliffhanger.
- Switch by Bearbone linkffn(11769956) While clearly unfinished it ends just as the setup is complete, so not at all unsatisfying to read.

*Actively in progress:*

- Who Dares Wins by OlegGunnarsson linkffn(13182638)
- Harry Potter and the Spiteful Sorting Hat by Evening_Ego (AKA Jinxauthor) linkao3(11660775)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/887097][Harry Potter and the Consequences of the Trip to the Library in Primary School]] series by TheWizzard. Third book just finished but the series is incomplete. First story is Self-Study linkao3(12915570)

*Long time since the last update:*

- Who Is Harry Potter? by BeepKeeper linkffn(13218646)
- Adventures in Magick by PseudonymousEntity linkffn(11671069)
- The Tinest Wish by Brenn.K linkfffn(3319229)

  Since he was punished everytime strange things were happening Harry drew the conclusion that he was causing them. Looking for answers, the librarian sent him to the fantasy section. Harry realized he was a wizard and dedicated all his free time to find the grain of truth in every fantasy book he read. When a magical letter appeared and Harry was invited to Hogwarts he was bursting with joy. He might lack knowledge of "real" magic and the "real" magical world but life lessons from fictional characters, a few handy magical tricks and an open mind would make up for it.
