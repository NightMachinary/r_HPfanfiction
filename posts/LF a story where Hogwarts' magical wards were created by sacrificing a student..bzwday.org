*** The one you're thinking of is /Harry Potter and the Game/, linkffn(11950816). It was the first of the Founders' Clues. But that story only describes the creation of house elves and dementors so far, so I don't think it's OP's request.

** This is driving me nuts.

It's the one where kid who died in the lottery was the Grey Lady's crush right? He swapped out all the names for his so that there would be no chance that Helena would be selected. Gryffindor found out but the kid made him keep it a secret.
