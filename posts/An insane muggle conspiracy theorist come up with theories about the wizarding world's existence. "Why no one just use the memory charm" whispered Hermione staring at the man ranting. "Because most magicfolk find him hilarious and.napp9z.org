#+TITLE: An insane muggle conspiracy theorist come up with theories about the wizarding world's existence. "Why no one just use the memory charm?" whispered Hermione staring at the man ranting. "Because most magicfolk find him hilarious and no muggle believes him anyway," whispered Ron smiling in amusement.

** I am pretty sure I have seen this in various urban fantasy 'masquerade' settings. Various conspiracy sites may have genuinely useful information for characters and/or they actively promote the conspiracy so people pay less attention to actual evidence.

** That's canon. In the introduction to /Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them/, there's a mention of a dragon that got loose from a reserve in Britain and attacked a seaside town. Thanks to the quick actions of several families of wizards who were on vacation there, no one died. The families were awarded Orders of Merlin, First Class for their efforts at preserving the Statute of Secrecy. The Oblivators took care of most of the witnesses, but they missed a guy. To this day, he drinks heavily and tells anyone who comes near him about the "great bloody lizards in the sky, breathing fire."

The Oblivators did not go back to wipe his memory because it doesn't matter. No one believes him, and some wizards think it's funny.

So this is canon. Oblivators do not do a perfect job. There are people they miss. These people then canonically become conspiracy theorists or what most of us consider to be crazies. In reality, they're telling the truth. No efforts are made to patch up these holes in the Statute because nobody believes those people, and because wizards seem to think it's funny when a muggle ruins their life trying to tell the truth and get people to believe them.

So this is explicitly real.

** Actually it's cannon that after a Common Welsh Green Dragon attacked a beach in 1932 Illfracombe, a muggle escaped a mass memory charm. To this day, a Muggle bearing the nickname "Dodgy Dirk" holds forth in bars along the south coast on the subject of a "dirty great flying lizard" that punctured his lilo.

*** I'm picturing a Bewitched type scenario where Martin Miggs is a bit like Agnes Cravits (always trying to get Abner to look when the neighbors are performing magic, but they suddenly stops whenever he looks) but leaves the house more and goes on all sorts of adventures that have him colliding with magic all while he's desperately trying to expose the conspiracy of magic, but even his conspiracy circle friends think he's a hit out there.

** There was a crossover with Harry in Japan where this was explicitly a thing.

All the 'bad special effects' Sentai shows and live action magical girl shows that crop up? Actually partially funded by the magicals so if film pops up, they can doctor it to look just a little more fake and people think it's just cosplay or done for press or art.
