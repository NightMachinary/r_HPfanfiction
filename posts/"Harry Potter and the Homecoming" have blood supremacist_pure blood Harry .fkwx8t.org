Already on the third part of the sequel "Harry Potter and the Year of Broken Chains". Well, Harry is starting to get Dark, as the author promised since the beggining, but until here isnt any trace of pure blood Harry, and im worried because i started reading it just because i want pureblood Harry.

Well, and i saw on that post ( [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9bni9p/dark_pure_blood_harry_or_blood_supremacist_harry/]] ) the author saying that his novel has it.

Please, if anyone can tell me if on that novel really there is a pure blood Harry or supremacist Harry i would be very pleased, thank you.


** Trust me when I say that this has Harry as the ultimate blood supremacist.
