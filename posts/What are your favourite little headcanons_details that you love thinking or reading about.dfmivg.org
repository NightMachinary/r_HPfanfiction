Hello everyone! In the presence of a quickly approaching November-Write-A-Lot, I wanted to hear some of your favourite headcanons or hot-takes in this fandom! Sometimes readers find little details that really stick out to them! Sometimes authors write something that you never quite forget! What are your favourite headcanons, either from fic or your own, that you treasure?

Here's an example! One of my favourite headcanons is that Luna Lovegood has synesthesia (a brain condition where sensory input “crosses wires”, causing individuals to “taste sounds” or give numbers specific feels to them.)

This doesn't hurt anyone! It doesn't change the story! There's no harm here! Come on everyone, what little things do you adore seeing?

(Please be kind and don't start an argument about ships. Please don't insult or invalidate any ideas brought up by others.)


** Harry hears his parents' deaths when dementors are near, not because it's his worst memory, but because it's Voldemort's. Think about it; Harry was a 1 year old baby, he had no idea what was going on. If he couldn't see the thestrals despite witnessing his mother die, clearly he had no understanding of the events that happened. How could that be his worst memory if he couldn't even comprehend it? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia][Not to mention, as a teenager he shouldn't even be able to recall the details of that night.]]

Voldemort's worst fear is death, and what happened to him that night was as close to death as he could get. Thus, Voldemort's worst memory was the night he killed the Potters, and the piece of his soul that latched on to Harry kept that memory.

** - Dudley was a bobby in the London Metropolitan Police and secretly cooperates with Harry (linkffn(6142629) or Bobby Beadle in linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian) are good as well, but this is better)
- Audrey Weasley, the wife of Percy Weasley, is a muggle (I love them in linkffn(12373273))
- I would love to have some conversion/redemption for Petunia
- I really love Lavender Brown as an Auror in the stories by Northumbrian ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/107123][here]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/104579][here]] and certainly linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian)).

*** Audrey being a muggle is excellent! It makes sense & rescues muggles as a character group from their poor showing in canon.

Also seconding Northumbrian's Lavender, she's my favorite.

** Quills are still used because they build up hand strength that is useful for holding a wand.

Goblin coins are nigh-indestructible, and so it doesn't matter that the value of the gold and silver in them is greater than the face value of the coins, because it's not practical for anyone else to melt them down.

Legilimency can be resisted either through self-control and misdirection, or through simple barriers. All of Snape's experience is with the first type, since the second type is obvious to the Legilimens and would therefore be useless for a spy.

***** Heh. There's a point in Chapter 5 where they delve a little bit precisely into that subject.

Here's an extract:

#+begin_quote
  “Questions?”

  Ginny raises her hand. “Why would Occlumency be so much more difficult? If it's just a matter of putting up a mental wall to block the intrusion, that seems like it would be much more straight forward than trying to dig into someone's mind.”

  Snape shakes his head. “Keeping the truth from an invading mind is one thing, Miss Weasley. Seamlessly supplanting the truth with believable lies is another all together.”

  She considers that, gnawing on the inside of her lip. “Because the very lack of access is proof enough that you are keeping something from them.”

  His eyebrow lifts, clearly surprised by her answer. “Exactly.”

  JK Rowling once said in an interview that she thought about having Dudley have a magical child on platform 9 3/4s at the end of book seven, but decided that no magical blood could survive contact with Vernon Dursley's DNA. In a long list of ideas she got wrong about what should happen to her characters post-canon, I've always thought that this was pretty near the top.Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he has an encounter that will uproot the course of his life, change his relationship with his cousin and his parents, and introduce him to some really fun new alcoholic beverages.Mostly non-ship focused, but there are plenty of relationships happening in the background. Despite my reservations, this mostly takes the Harry Potter epilogue as written, but makes a few significant changes the plot revolves around.

** EWE incoming:

- Lucius gets arrested basically immediately and spends the rest of his life in prison; the other Malfoys are tried, but ultimately found to be either not guilty (Narcissa) or to have been acting under duress (Draco); both avoid prison, but the latter is fined pretty heavily for nearly murdering two Hogwarts students

- Umbridge is arrested for her constant abuses of power; she doesn't spend the rest of her life in prison, but she isn't able to rejoin the Ministry when she's released, because of course she isn't

- in general, trials for the surviving Death Eaters go pretty smoothly, but dealing with the collaborators is much trickier, since a lot of them were technically just doing their jobs during the year Voldemort took over; there's no real way to separate the people who were too afraid to stand up from the ones who genuinely supported the new regime

- some of the epilogue ships peter out (not all of them, and they would probably end on good terms, but it harkens back to Mrs Weasley's very good but oft ignored point that people tend to rush into relationships in times of uncertainty)

- after a few years, Harry starts teaching at the auror academy rather than remaining on active duty, and eventually returning to Hogwarts to teach DADA once his kids/nieces and nephews have graduated (to avoid accusations of favouritism)

- Ron becomes the Cannons' keeper (he's the best player they've ever had (not that that's a high bar to clear), and loads of other teams try to recruit him, but he never goes for it; he eventually becomes a coach, and later retires from the league entirely to teach flying at Hogwarts)

- Hermione spends years campaigning for a compulsory pre-Hogwarts education that covers all the stuff fanon likes to complain about Hogwarts not teaching, but she's ironically the only one of the trio to never teach at Hogwarts; she tries to establish a post-Hogwarts college, too, but it winds up being more of a trade school than anything else, and even though it's not exactly what she had in mind, she's content with it

- Andromeda lowkey adopts Harry and is super protective of him once she recognises that he's a walking disaster; half of their conversations either start or end with some variation of "how are you still alive?"

- between her and Mrs Weasley, Harry winds up learning a lot about household charms, and he winds up chiefly responsible for keeping the house in order if/when he gets married

- the surviving Black sisters reconcile after Narcissa decides that family is more important to her than blood purity; she isn't able to just shake off all her biases and bigotry, but she makes a genuine effort and a lot of progress (she and Harry go on to have an awkward sort-of friendship, and while he and Draco are able to treat each other civilly, they never become anything like friends, and both Harry and Andromeda constantly worry about their influence on Teddy)

- Teddy is the cutest child in the history of children; he eventually catches on to this and starts playing it up to manipulate people (the sorting hat places him in Slytherin almost immediately, and Harry is proud that Teddy has no reservations about his sorting)

- if Harry ever gets married, Teddy is 100% the ring bearer, and Ron is his best man though neither he nor Harry have much involvement in the planning, since they both have horrible taste (or so they're told)

- Kingsly doesn't stay Minister for long, since he knows full well that he's not really qualified to oversee the very complicated reconstruction efforts; he returns to the auror corps and is much happier and more effective there

- there are sweeping reforms to the legal treatment of werewolves and muggleborns, mostly to keep them mollified so as to prevent another war, but with some people genuinely concerned with improving their lives

***** We know that Tonks was the only Auror recruit for several years. Which means that at any given time, the Aurors are likely training a maximum of one trainee, and potentially much of the time they are training no one at all.

Which makes sense given that Aurors are a highly specialised team. How many dark wizards can there be to catch in a population which best estimates place at between 3,000-20,000 wizards? I'd be surprised if there's more than 10-15 Aurors total.

So no, there is no academy nor any other kind of school for Aurors under a different name. It's an on-the-job type apprenticeship system - we're told that Tonks is Mad-Eye's protege.

/Auror training is a three year long programme set by the Auror Office that was established by Minister Eldritch Diggory sometime between 1733 and 1747 to train and evaluate potential Aurors. The programme is considered very stringent, and only the best wizards are accepted into it./

Along with that, it's just that so few are accepted into the program, not that there isn't an official academy. There is clearly a training program of some sort much like the police academy in real/Muggle life. The last person accepted, presumable Nymphadora Tonks, was accepted was in 1992, 4 years before Harry finished his fifth year. However, after the Battle of Hogwarts, Minister Shacklebolt relaxed the entry requirements to replenish the auror ranks and so there were a lot more accepted into the training program including one Harry James Potter.

Second, don't you think that allowing a large number of 17-18 year old people to join the Auror corp (I guess the military or police force) would require learning things in an academic setting since you need to learn how to disguise yourself, how to track people, and other things that aren't taught while you're at Hogwarts? I mean, the Auror numbers were pretty badly reduced during the war so it'd be hard to have that same one-on-one training that trainees in the past, like Tonks, had gotten. So it'd be more in line with either an academy or being trained in squads without going directly into the field right off the bat as they lacked the skills necessary to be successful Aurors.

Eldritch Diggory established the recruitment program, but it doesn't seem to say any other Minister of Magic setting up a training program. It's typically implied that when you create a recruiting program, you also set up a training program to go alongside it as the skills for an auror are a little different than what your typical 18-year-old would learn at school.

In fact, MACUSA was created in 1693 and I believe that was when the first President (Josiah Jackson) began recruiting and training aurors. Whereas the Ministry was founded in 1707 so you're technically right in that the Ministry as we know it is younger than the concept of aurors.

Now, the predecessor to the Ministry is the Wizards' Council of Great Britain and as a result did seem to have aurors. I do find it funny that there's a lot of conflicting information as even though Eldritch Diggory didn't create a recruiting program until he was in term in the 1730s, there are sources that state he created it sometime in the 17th century...which means 1600s. Then again, it's possible he suggested the program prior to becoming Minister of Magic.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

** These head canons are limited to the Next Generation. I haven't had much time to write much for them, since I'm committed to writing a Kingdom Hearts fanfic.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Teddy Lupin:
#+end_quote

The son of Remus and Nymphadora, Teddy was raised by Andromeda, with Harry having an active role as godfather. He joins the Aurors, but he is more interested in what it means to fight for a cause than the actual battles.

#+begin_quote
  Rose Weasley:
#+end_quote

Sorted into Hufflepuff

I like to think that Rose has a special bond with Neville and Herbology is her favorite subject. She is somewhat distant from her mother, who is very involved in the Ministry, while Rose despises government and bureaucracy in general. Rose has a habit of falling asleep in the library--though her favorite place to read is outside the Herbology greenhouses. She goes barefoot at every opportunity and carries schoolbooks and storybooks around constantly. Her favorite stories are the Dr. Doolittle books by Hugo Lofting.

#+begin_quote
  Hugo Weasley:
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Hugo is fascinated by story and myth and the name Hugo. He carries around a copy of /Les Miserables./ Due to the size of the book, nobody notices that it isn't a textbook. He is meticulous and organized--his speciality being able to push Rose's buttons, for his own amusement. He knows exactly how to make her scream, how to make her laugh, and how to make her cry. Hugo was able to out-wrestle, out-rough-house and out-tickle her by the time he was six. Their dynamic is not completely antagonistic though--as much as he likes making Rose scream, Hugo is also the one who reads to her when she's sick in the Hospital Wing.

#+begin_quote
  Fred II Weasley
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Despite being fascinated by pranks, he spends too much time on the technical breakdowns for the "perfect prank" that he never actually has time to pull them. As a result, all the professors think he's the most well-behaved Weasley of the lot.

#+begin_quote
  Roxanne Weasley
#+end_quote

Ravenclaw

The smallest of the Weasleys, Roxanne makes observations. She sits still and watches and makes records--she got the idea from Hugo, who records everything that makes Rose scream--but decided to do it for everybody. She grows up to be a historian.

#+begin_quote
  Molly II Weasley
#+end_quote

Ravenclaw

Molly, Percy's oldest daughter, is every bit a mother hen as her grandmother. She also favors some Muggle tools, taking after her mother. She wears glasses like her father.

#+begin_quote
  Lucy
#+end_quote

Percy's second daughter, I must confess I hadn't given any thought to until I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8035006/1/The-Noticing-of-Lucy-Weasley][/The Noticing of Lucy Weasley/]]. So yeah, a girl who idolizes her daddy and acknowledges the importance of pencil pushers.

#+begin_quote
  Scorpius Malfoy:
#+end_quote

Scorpius Malfoy was sorted into Hufflepuff. He yearns to become a Healer. A quiet sort, he is utterly baffled by the antics of the Everyone Else. Being an only child and having no cousins close to his age, the way Albus and Rose and Lily can argue to the point of screaming one day and the next save one another favorite deserts is among the strangest thing he's ever seen.

#+begin_quote
  James Sirius Potter:
#+end_quote

Gryffindor

Given my inclination for Lucy, I find that James is not entirely unlike his grandfather, only with a far bigger ego. Delighted to be the son of heroes, James has a highly inflated sense of self. While popular among his classmates, he alienated himself from many of his cousins. To give him much needed discipline, Harry sends him to spend a summer with his Muggle cousins. Without his wand. The months away are deeply transformative, after James sees one of his cousins take on a gang of bullies despite being outnumbered four to one.

#+begin_quote
  Albus Potter
#+end_quote

Albus was a hat stall, but wound up in Hufflepuff, to his own shock. He's not convinced Rose didn't ask to go to Hufflepuff to keep him company.

He's interested in magical theory, and takes after his grandmothers with an affiliation for Charms. He eventually begins to try to create new spells, with mixed results--one mishap winds up forcing him to walk backwards continuously for a month.

While his relationship with James is strained, he is very close with Lily and is willing to join her in her favorite activities.

#+begin_quote
  Lily Luna Potter
#+end_quote

Sorted into Gryffindor, it takes Lily a long time to learn the difference between "courage" and "recklessness." She has a permanent bed in the Hospital Wing.

Lily looks up to her parents, her assorted aunts and uncles, and the various members of the DA as heroes in the grander sense of the word. Her daddy isn't just a superhero, he's a magnificent knight in shining armor.

She's closest to Uncle Ron, who taught her how to play chess, which is the game of heroes.

** My personal headcanon is that there exists a race of beings that are like the Veela - who possibly share a common ancestor with the Veela - except they are wolves. The original werewolves (True Wolves) which inspired a Dark Witch or Wizard to base a disease (Lycanthropy) off of. They are not forced to shift forms at any point in time. They have some kind of mind-control power like the Veela which aid in hunting (maybe instead of seduction, something like: don't mind me. I'm completely harmless. Don't mind whatever I'm doing. This is completely normal/un-noteworthy). Their accelerated healing factor is a gift of healing that they can share. Unlike animagi, they can access and utilize their magic in both forms. Unlike modern werewolves, the True Wolves are born as wolf pups and shift into a humanoid form later on, if at all. Their bite or scratch does not carry any kind of contagion (you can't spread something congenital, after all). And, because the True Wolves are born with anatomy that is MEANT to shift forms and because those forms can be grown into naturally (unlike the modern werewolves whose bodies break and twist into a form they were never meant to take, and that only one night a month), the True Wolves are at least ten times stronger than any modern werewolf. Like, a True Wolf pup could probably take down Remus and a matured True Wolf could take down Fenrir Greyback with relative ease.

There's a character in the sequel who has that "nothing interesting to see here" power. She can literally suck someone's blood in a roomful of people and have everyone scratching their heads, wondering why the victim is struggling to breathe.

** General world headcanons: * Squibs happen because magic wants to expand and make all people magic eventually, so if a given line hasn't brought in non-magical genes in too long squibs start happening to encourage magic lines to mix with non-magic ones. *Most muggle borns are the result of squibs mixing with muggles for a few generations, with magic re-manifesting (aka, muggleborns) because of any one of several situations: two squib lines with several generations of muggle genes got together, enough of the actively magical population died without reproducing that magic spontaneously flared in squib lines to keep the overall "threshold" of active magicals at a certain level, or an individual in a squib line was exposed to /heavy/ amounts of magic during pregnancy (not always a given, but not unknown either) *Very rarely, "new" magical lines appear, usually because of several very unlikely factors mixed together in basically non-repeatable circumstances. These muggleborns are usually incredibly powerful and often have specific focuses in skills and interests, based on why they became the proginators of a new line. (All magical lines began like this, but as industrialization and monotheism happened these events happened less and less.) *Squibs, including the progeny of first generation squibs, are not affected by anti-muggle charms and passive magic works for them in ways it doesn't for muggles. This is why some "muggles" see ghosts or wander into the Leaky Cauldron by accident.

** -Minerva and Severus had a friendship, not quite best friends or anything but I can imagine even Snape in his first few years of teaching would need help and her helping him out. They had tea occasionally over the year and But Harry attending slowly putted them against each other. When he kills Albus she is utterly horrified because while she questioned him sometimes she didn't believe he was capable of something like that. And then when Harry tells her the truth about how was orchestrated she falls into a immense depression which takes her years to come out of.

-Ginny is a Holly Harpies player longer then people think so. She didn't retire until Lily starts Hogwarts. And she's a reporter until she's badly injured when she goes undercover. She spends a large amount of time traveling and hiking alone and doing lots of trips with the family.

-Hagrid lives at Hogwarts for the rest of his life. While he is a professor for decades he eventually retires when he's but the Headmasters keep him employed at a school counselor and he schedules tea with the students for chats.

-Albus Severus Potter because a full out researcher in both muggle and magical fields and was in Ravenclaw.

-Scorpius becomes a healer returned to do something different in his family.

-Hermione and Ron didn't actually marry until their kids were older. They loved each other fiercely but needed a lot of space and didn't actually live together until Rose was born (Hugo lived with Ron mostly).

-Harry worked as a Auror for about a 16 years until he's critically injured twice in a short time. Ginny begs him to retire and he does so.

** 1. One head canon I mention a bunch but is one I like is in HBP.

Its for the Ronaco ship.

The reason Ron tells Harry to stop worrying about Malfoy is that Ron and Draco are dating and dont wanna go public with it. Its why Draco is actually sneaking around.

Oh sure its tropey but I just love it.

2.Healer Harry. I just think it fits Harry. Also Mentor Pomfrey works a bit too much.

3.Dumbledore and Grindelwald actually had a long and committed relationship and dumbledore even agreed with him. When they broke apart it hurt Dumbledore far more than he realized. Its why he occasionally dabbles in "greater good" he cant let that part of him go because it would mean letting go of that part of him that had a connection to grindelwald. Albus is haunted by Tom because he is just reminded of Gellert and that if only he had paid attention to Tom he could have somehow redeemed Gellert in a way prove that Gellert could be redeemed that if only he tried harder.

This is obvipusly not canon but its something I like that Dumbledore and Grindelwald truly did love each other. More than anything but ideology broke them apart and it scarred Dumbeldore. He is haunted by his past and especially by Tom and Gellert.

Its why he is willing to discard the safety of students during book 6.

He sees Draco as another Tom as Another Gellert even more so because Draco isnt as inhuman as Tom he reminds him far too much Gellert. Which causes him to discard things he should care about. Like the students lives.

This long way of answering "so why the fuck does Dumbledore care so little about his students lives?"

** I can't recall where I saw it, but there was a really great theory on how DADA is meant to be structured: first year is meant to be enough to let kids deal with random Muggle encounters, second year covers magical pests (so the Cornish pixies might have actually been on the curriculum, if handled more competently), third year for more dangerous creatures, and fourth year upward for defence against hostile wizards.
