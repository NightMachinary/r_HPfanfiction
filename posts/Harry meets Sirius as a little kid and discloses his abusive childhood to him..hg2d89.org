Harry walked along the wall with his arms out as he continued to talk to Sirius. “You're very kind,” he commented to the shaggy-haired man. “I don't know why, though.”

“No?” Sirius sounded curious and Harry shrugged before answering.

“Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon---they don't like freakish things. I'm freakish, I suppose. They tell me that all the time. Called me ‘Freak' until I started primary and learned that my name's actually Harry.” Harry frowned as he came to the end of the wall and he peered down at the ground, gauging the distance. He jumped down and continued talking. “They don't like me for some reason. They make me do things that Dudley doesn't have to do; mow the lawn, tidy up the gardens, cook, clean, do the laundry...

“I'm rather good at it all now. I used to get punished a lot because I didn't know how to weed the garden properly and I once pulled out one of Aunt Petunia's gardenias when they were small. She wanted to grow them from scratch but they looked like weeds to me. Course, I didn't really know what the differences between weeds and flowers and shrubs were till I was allowed to read some of her gardening magazines for tips. She hit me round the head with the frying pan before throwing me in my cupboard and revoking my food privileges.”

“Cupboard?” Sirius asked, his voice a low gravelly growl. Harry paused and peered up at the man through his fringe. A muscle in the man's jaw twitched and his hands were fisted so tightly that his knuckles were white as bone. Harry took a few steps away from the man to get out of easy reach before expanding on his comment.

“My room,” he said. “The cupboard under the stairs.”

“I saw your relatives' house,” Sirius said, voice still a growl. “It's big enough to have more than two bedrooms in it.”

“Oh, it has four,” said Harry casually, not understanding what Sirius was so angry about. “But two of them are Dudley's and the guest room's for Aunt Marge when she comes round. She's not my real aunt, of course. She's Uncle Vernon's sister. They tell me to call her my aunt, though. Not sure why since she hates me so much.”

“That seems to be a running theme in your life, Harry,” Sirius said with a frown. Harry shrugged. He didn't really have an answer for that.

“Do you hate me, then?” he asked, stopping and staring into Sirius's surprised eyes.

“What? No! Harry, I would never hate you!” Sirius was quick to reassure. “You're my godson, I'd never hate you.”

“Oh,” Harry said with a frown. “What if I did something bad, though? Like, like, I don't know, pushed someone in a pool? Dudley did that to me once. I almost drowned since I don't know how to swim. It was the deep end, too. Luckily one of the lifeguards caught me. I was pushed into the cupboard when I got home, though I don't remember the reason why.”

“You /are/ joking, right?” Sirius asked, blinking down at his godson. Harry looked up at him, confused as he shook his head. “I'm surprised you're alive,” the man muttered before continuing. “Anyway, if the person you pushed into the pool knew how to swim and they planned on swimming anyway, I'd congratulate you for a prank well done.”

"Would you really?" Harry asked before biting down on his lip.

"Well," Sirius said with a wolfish grin, "I'm not sure how I'd react if /I/ was the one who you pushed into the pool, though if it was someone else I'd laugh."
