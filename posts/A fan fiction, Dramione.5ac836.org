[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11867801/1/Between-The-Two]] I'd appreciate some critiques


** Well, I might suggest that a boy cornering a girl to shame her about her "clit," isn't a K+ rating. That is a very specific sort of scenario that some readers seem to like; you do allude to something sexual happening in your summary, so it isn't like you are giving no warning. But you might get more of an audience who seeks out this specific motif if you are clearer in both your summary and your rating.

** I don't know if you wanted a critique on the plot or your use of the language.

*Plot:*

The carnivorous, sentient tree was an interesting plot point but I haven't figured out how the incident between Ron, Hermione, and Draco with the tree relates back to the first chapter. Did the sap kickstart Hermione & Draco's puberty or elevate their hormone levels, somehow? I do admit that for the last few chapters I only skimmed the reading, so it's possible I missed a correlation there.

I'm also not sure what exactly is going on between Hermione and Ron. I assumed they were having difficulties in their relationship (are they in a relationship? Is this AU?) because he wanted to be more physical than she did, but Draco seems to imply the opposite. I'm left feeling confused.

I'm not sure what year the story is meant to take place or if it's AU. Is Voldemort a concern in the background? Knowing what we do of canon events in sixth year, I don't think Draco would be acting the way he is if Voldemort going to be an antagonist in this fic. I do suggest that sixth year be the youngest you go since your summary and chapters have sexual themes. Even so, that mean the characters are borderline underage and that's a big squick for a lot of people. I would think the age of the characters would also determine how open they are to mentioning sex, especially between genders.

*Language:*

There are a few spelling errors. I caught "outload" rather than "out loud" in the first chapter, and in one of the later chapters "his" instead of "this."

The largest issue I had with the fic was the grammatical errors.

I saw tense changes within the same paragraph as well as problems with subject-verb agreement.

That first chapter has dialogue that starts out attributed to Draco but includes dialogue from Hermione in the same paragraph. It also seems that you're allergic to the normal dialogue tag "said." You don't need to use a thesaurus here. While it's good that you use active verbs rather than adverbs "he whispered" vs "he said softly", dialogue tags are often overlooked. [[http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/keep-it-simple-keys-to-realistic-dialogue-part-ii][Here's a resource about that.]]

You tend to 'head-hop,' where you go from one person's thoughts to the next without identifying who's mind we're supposed to be reading from. [[http://theeditorsblog.net/2011/09/10/head-hopping-gives-readers-whiplash/][Here's a resource regarding head-hoping.]]

There's also a few times when you have direct thoughts.

#+begin_quote
  Why was her face red before? And no one around? He asked himself. Then a thought crossed his mind...

  /"Get off well Granger?"/
#+end_quote

I would suggest you pick a single way of annotating thoughts like this. Whether with single quotation marks or italics. With double quotation marks the line looks like he spoke aloud and I'm not sure if that was what you intended.

Also your use of the interrobang in the quote below leaves me confused.

#+begin_quote
  "I didn't do anything wrong?!"
#+end_quote

Did Hermione shout this as a question at Draco? Does our rule-following, know-it-all Hermione not know if she did something wrong? I would suggest picking one punctuation mark over the other, at least in this case.

*** The original first chapter is like a teaser and the next chapter is a earlier moment from that specific chapter. But I see what you mean
