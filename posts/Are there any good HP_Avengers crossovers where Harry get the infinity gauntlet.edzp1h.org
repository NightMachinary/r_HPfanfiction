** Heroes Assemble is a really well-written one. It's at 120 chapters and still being written; Thanos' goons have just reached Earth for the first time, so there's still some way to go before the infinity gauntlet really shows up

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.

** I know a fic that was written in 2012 I think so before the most recent movies came out but Harry deals with the Infinity Stones and Thanos. It's a slashfic but I could link it if you are interested. It's one of my fav Avengers/Harry crossovers and really well written with a unique storyline and Harry is pretty badass.

#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
