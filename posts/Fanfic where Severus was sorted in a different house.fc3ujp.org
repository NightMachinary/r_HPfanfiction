Very minor. The kids only get a few chapters in the second half. On the Hogwarts Express first year, James, Sirius, Lily and Severus happen to choose the compartment with a sleeping Professor Potter. Harry points out the stupidity of Severus wanting his best friend to join the anti-muggleborn house and Snape takes it to heart. He ends up up in Ravenclaw.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
