I've read a bunch of really horrific variations on this and I'm kinda curious.

On a side note, what's the worst Dumbledore you've ever read?

** My guess would be that it comes from a group of fanatics over-analyzing the inner workings of the mind of a character written for a series of children's books. I don't know why people like fics that paint Dumbledore in this terrible "overlord" persona, but I liked them once, too.

I think it's like a phase. The immediate, post-canon void leads you wanting to read canon compliant fics, "missing moments", what comes after DH, then after a while you enter the rebellious phase. Harry Potter, heir to every house in the history of the Wizarding world, the super badass eleven year old who easily outguns an ancient Wizard ten times his age and with infinitely more knowledge than Harry could have achieved. Suddenly Dumbledore is the supreme bad guy of all things evil in this world.

After a while, you grow out of it, I think, and mature into someone who realizes the many wonderful faces of Dumbledore as a human person, and how well he works as a mentor-type and sometimes even friend to Harry. I'm certainly in this phase myself.

**** They do, because there was a shift in demographic. Children who read the first books became young adults in the later installments.

There are two schools of thought in the fandom: judge all books by YA standards, and determine that Dumbledore is utterly senile, or take a more serious turn from the start, and have him act as he justifiably would had Harry Potter been a YA series all along.

I personally believe most stories that come from the first camp are pretty bad.

This is part of what made HP such a successful series. It's also, ironically, what creates major problems in the HP series. Children's stories - especially the "fairy tale" type which HP clearly is (think Cinderella) - rely heavily on tools like exaggeration and cliches. Leaving a kid on a doorstep at night is a cliche. The Dursleys are an exaggeration.

More mature stories don't rely on such tools; on the contrary, they can undermine a good story aimed at more mature audiences.

But HP is stuck with them. So if you're going to analyze the characters and take them seriously, you can't just ignore everything they did in the first two or three books - too much that happens later on depends on those books. You have to judge the characters in later books in light of their actions in the earlier books. Dumbledore's insistence that he wanted to protect Harry, for example, has to be judged by the means he used to do so - leaving him with the Dursleys. That has to include how he did it, when he did it, what the Dursleys are really like, etc.

And so the character that comes off the worst is Dumbledore, but that's avoidable given that he's doing so much and responsible for so much while all the other primary characters are still so young. When we take seriously his actions, both explicit (like leaving Harry with the Dursleys) and implicit (where's Harry's mail?), he /can't/ come off looking very good. Even taking "evil" off the table entirely, he can't come off looking very good.

I know, I've tried. I've tried very, very hard in my story to give him the most plausible, rational, reasonable, and justified reasons for explicit canon actions, implicit actions, plus a few more to fill things out. He's an antagonist in my story, so not the character you're supposed to cheer for, but he's /not/ evil. But even doing my best to spread out his actions across multiple non-evil explanations (mistakes, misunderstandings, good decisions early on that shouldn't have been continued past some point, etc.), my readers still want him dead.

Anyway, judging Dumbledore by his actions across all the books doesn't require concluding that he's senile (though that would explain a lot), but it does require giving up on seeing him as perfectly pure-white good. He gets a lot of things wrong (which he admits) and ends up causing a lot of harm because of it. But he may also make decisions which he knows will cause harm because he expects an ultimately better outcome - sacrificing something smaller for the sake of something larger.

"For the Greater Good."

Or: the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Or the one.

Or: read up about Coventry and how that city's "needs" were weighed.

Politicians do this all the time, especially in war. Many seem to forget that Dumbledore wasn't just a teacher, he was also a politician involved in multiple wars over his life. Of course he made unpleasant decisions. Of course he made moral compromises in order to achieve larger goals. Every politician does, that's why we often don't like them, especially when it's our values or lives being compromised on.

So it's quite reasonable to treat Dumbledore as a morally ambiguous, less-than-perfect politician who may be a "good guy," but who isn't always a very good guy. And that's probably the best, most positive interpretation of him that can be made.

When i first finished the books back in 7'th grade i binged on these type of fics ; i recently went back for nostalgias sake but literally couldn't stomach the cliche and the sheer amount of suspension of belief required to enjoy those fics.

** Philosophers Stone and Chamber of Secrets were childrens books, not even really young adult. When analysed a lot of things in these stories don't really make sense without some sort of manipulation. On top of this in Dumbledore's speech to Harry after the ministry in Order of the Phoenix he says, 'I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.' At the beginning of PS he says to Minerva as they're leaving Harry at #4, 'He'll be better off growing up away from all that.' Meaning Harry's fame. All of this, plus plenty of other stuff if we're reaching, on top of 'For the Greater Good' from Grindlewalds manifesto points to Dumbledore being a manipulative bastard.

Codswallop in my opinion.

** The "evil Dumbledore" trope has been around a while. That combined with the info in DH about him having a crush on Grindelwald, people have put two and two together I guess. Though Dumbledore said it first, Grindelwald put it into action and used it as a campaign slogan.

As for worst fic, probably literally any of the chan ones involving Harry and there are so many.
