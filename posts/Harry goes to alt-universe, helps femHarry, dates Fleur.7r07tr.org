I'm looking for a particular story I read a while ago. Harry gets summoned to an alt world by Dumbledore. He gets pissed and refuses to help and jumps to another random alt-universe where there is a teenage fem!Harry. Fem!Harry moves in with Harry and he dates Fleur. She eventually moves in too.

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.

**** Being the devil's advocate, it's possible the correct spelling was already taken when they made their user name. Or they made their account before spell check was built into browsers.
