Also should point out he hasn't quite gotten to world conquest yet, and I doubt he'll make it to a full on world conquest.

And since OP mentioned it, this isn't complete, and updates are really slow. Worth the wait though imo.

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
