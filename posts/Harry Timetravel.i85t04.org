I'm looking for a fic where Harry goes back in time to the Marauders era as a first year, and this can take place 1971-1977. I just finished this great one called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10280192/1/][Tumble Through Time]] But sadly, it was discontinued, so I'm dying for any more stories like this one. I really like stories where Harry is much younger than the Marauders, and is like a little brother to them. So if anyone knows anything else like this story, (if you've read it,) pls let me know! Also, I'm exhausted, and can't think straight, so if none of this makes sense, I'm truly sorry ðŸ˜‚


** Here's a story that's pretty good about fem!Harry being sent back into the body of Jasmine Peverell in the Marauders era. It's just shy of 300k and is updated about every 4ish weeks, so that should keep you occupied for a while.
