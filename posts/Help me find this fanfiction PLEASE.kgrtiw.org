Ya know. I can't remember it well, but I think I recall a fic where due to those blood wards conflicting with Lily's protection. It ended up with a Gaara situation where /any/ harm towards Harry was met with immediate, direct, and downright vicious retribution.That's the only thing I remember about it.


** Sounds interesting! Hope you find it

** I'll admit, that's not a whole lot of information you've given, but I do feel like I've read the fic you're talking about. Does a blending of the blood wards and Lily's sacrifice because of a magical explosion sound familiar? Full honesty, I don't know what fic I'm thinking of either, but chances are it might be in my favorites, which would narrow it down to a hundred or two instead 800k+ stories.

*** Yes sounds familiar I think.To be honest I have read a lot of fanfics where lily's sacrifice and the blood wards are taking a vital role in them so i sometimes mess them up, but i think there was blending and explosion.

** linkao3(The Problem With Soulmarks Is by LadyAramisGrey) has this, where the blood protection physically protects Harry so he can't even play quidditch. It's really good, it's a time travel fic soul mark fic with Harry/Tom Riddle, and it was updating regulary.

  The fiasco that is Harry's life could be summed up in two words --- Avada Kedavra. Those words have haunted him for as long as he can remember, endangering him with their very existence. He'd resigned himself to a life without a soulmate, to pain and sorrow... but then the Blacks happened. Or, one Black in particular.Whose idea was it to let a Black woman invent time travel, anyway?
