** Isn't Snape regularly born in the Marauders era? Or do you mean having him as potions teacher?

** Sorry to tell you that, Chief, but Snape was born in the same year as the Marauders. Don't need an Alternate Universe for that one.

** Have you read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11047955/1/One-Step-Forward-Two-Decades-Back][One Step Forward, Two Decades Back by corvusdraconis]]?  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius & Regulus Black, & member of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Now what is she going to do? COMPLETE! // Can't do ffbot here, I'm in mobile sorry.

It's well-written and it's an "accidental" timetravel fic. Both Snape and Hermione are students here. It's a little bit overkill in skills aspect imo, the pace is sometimes a little bit slow, and the character bashing can be a little bit jarring at times, but it's enjoyable all the same. If this is your cup of tea. :)
