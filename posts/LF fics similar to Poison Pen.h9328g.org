This is one I've come back to a few times. I like most of this FF and would like to read others where Harry uses the press to turn the world on it's head. No slash. please.

  At the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament Harry sees his chance to strike down his enemies - and takes it. Here is a Harry who knows how to think and reason. Really Bash!AD, EWE, Clueful!HP Eventual HP/HG/DG/FD NL/HA/SB and others. Unapologetically!AU.
