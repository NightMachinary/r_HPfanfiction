** It's SS/HG or Snape/Hermione because whoever thought portmanteau ship names were a good idea needs to be fucking shot.

(But for the record: Sn*a*mione is what people use.)

** SS/HG, Sevmione, Snamione, Snanger or H.M.S Prudence and Potions

All of which are regularly used, and follow the generic naming convention of male name first (in same sex pairings the older party is usually first).

***** I'm just going on wiki and all the notes I took regarding the standard conventions I made when I started learning about fan fic culture in prep for using it in my volunteer work. So I won't pretend I know it to be a hard and fast "rule" - fan fiction seems pretty resistant to those. :) Also (Yaoi) is a subset all of its own (in my understanding) so again the "rules" would be particular to it? In the final breakdown I don't suppose it really matters.
