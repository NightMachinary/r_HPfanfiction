Throw 'em at me! Points if Hermione or someone else are the victim. DOUBLE points if nice!Slytherins are involved!\\
EDIT: I should add that I'm more interested in it becoming a known thing that a party is being abused, and the fallout after with buildup being much appreciated.No harems please. Thanks!

  Hermione or *someone else*

Should be easy enough. Both of these are about healing and recovery from abuse.

Summary: What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse. Appropriate disclosures will be contained in the Author's Notes above the chapter when warranted.

** I really liked linkao3(Harry Potter and the Pureblood Prince by Obsessionist). Draco is one of the main characters and is friends with Harry. No Drarry/slash.
