Mine is that he is at Hogwarts as an experiment to see if long term expose to powerful magic like the magic around Hogwarts will fix him. I would say that his familiar bond his cat is seen as the experiment working otherwise he would have been disposed of.( in my theory the unspeakables are the ones running the experiment without anyone even filch knowing about it or mabye he does and the quick spell letter was actually a disguised letter giving him an update report)

Edit: any writers wanting to use this idea in a fan fiction feel free


** I think Dumbledore's habit of collecting "strays" like Filch, Hagrid and Trelawny (and even part goblin Flitwick), as well as hiring staff without SOs was part of a strategy to ensure the staff and faculty were completely loyal to Hogwarts. It was their only home.

**** I enjoy it when people have more than one motivation at once. Many good deeds would go undone if they didn't also serve the self-interest of the one doing them. As long as it's a net-positive, why not kill two birds with one stone?

** I would have thought that he was just a squib growing up in Hogsmeade or something like that, and that he just ended up in Hogwarts because that's the only job he could find at the moment or something. Nothing too fancy, really.

Dumbledore's kinda weird you know. I wouldn't put it past him to employ a squib at a magical school. I mean, after the charlatan, werewolf and the crazy old auror...

**** Yeah, that might be the case.

I've been asking myself the same about the Time Turner that Hermione got as well. Whether that was another Unspeakable experiment, that is.

Or McGonagall gave Hermione her spare one.

****** That doesn't make sense though, since otherwise it would be common knowledge, and it's not been reported once in the books that a teacher was in two places at the same time. (Also, Snape didn't even consider Hermione and Harry being two places at the same time at the end of the third year...)

Also, they were being kept in the Department of Mysteries, which hints at it being somewhat experimental.

******* I just figured that was the only way for them to teach all seven years with one Professor per class. At least for teachers that consistently get students in their NEWT Classes. Like Flitwick and McGonagall.

I figure at least McGonagall needs one. She is the Head of Gryffindor, Deputy Headmistress, and the only Transfiguration teacher.

Also, the Time Turners might be kept in the Department of Mysteries because of their volatile nature, and relative rareness, not necessarily because they're experimental. There were quite a few in the Time room during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.

** Probably a charity case that Dumbledore picked up and forgot to ever put back down, so he kept putting him in places where he would be overlooked but not completely out of place. It's inferable from the way that Ariabella Figg also communicated with Dumbledore, to safely assume that he's involved with Squib Advocacy and other such concepts as part of his charity work.

It would also fit the aspect of Filch being angry and spiteful at the students, since he pretty much has to be hand-held through the magical world due to his lack of magical ability, but has been too long inside it to really learn the muggle one where he could compete on an even level. It creates a bitterness of having missed out on all of life due to a genetic flub.

** I think the house elves can't be allowed to act unsupervised and need regular commands to keep them in line (like that Disney magician's mop and bucket). Dumbledore didn't need to employ a comparatively expensive wizard and saw a chance to give a squib that he knew a job and so it all came together as things do in the wizarding world.

** Filch is a former dark lord who made Hogwarts itself his horcrux. Not wanting to destroy Hogwarts, the ministry stripped him of his magic. Keeping him in Hogwarts prevents other from being possessed by his horcrux, so they bound him and his 2nd horcrux, Mrs. Norris, to Hogwarts for eternity, .

** I think that not everything can be cleaned/fixed by magic, especially in a place that's already held together by so much magic. Who knows what hitting a portrait with a cleaning spell could do?

There's canon support for it if you squint the right way, with Snape making them clean cauldrons by hand during detentions. Then again he could just be a jerk that takes pleasure in making them scrub.

** I think he was from a pure blood family, that didn't allow their squibs to live outside the wizarding world. I imagine him growing up and struggling with who he was and what he couldn't do and his family not making him feel any better about what he was, treating as though he were crippled or mentally defected, and not in a kind understanding way. In a way that reminded him everyday he was below them. I think he wished/ longed to go off into the muggle world where he could live a normal life, where no one thought them self better than him, but never could because his family wouldn't allow it. I don't think he chose to work at Hogwarts so much as his family placed him there to work. Another cruelty forcing him to see everyday what he could have been- the child they had wanted and been denied. I wonder if his name is really his or if his father insisted he not have their last name once he realized his son had no magical capability. He's such a bitter person, and he always seemed to wish he could hurt/ punish the other children. Not to mention he had that thing in his office to teach him magic as a squib, to me it sounded like some deep rooted self hate and often times that kind of self hate is taught. I imagine Dumbledore being the one to give him the cat when he first got there, seeing someone isolated and hateful, and wanted him to have some comfort and the idea working. Thus giving him one being in this world that can't pity and look down on him, that loves him and needs him.

Sorry if there are mistakes, on my phone.

** I feel like he's on staff as a warning to the ne'er do wells at the school, look at what could become of you if you don't study and pay attention to your coursework, you could be stuck doing menial labor without the benefit of magic to assist you.

Of course this goes right over the heads of all of the intended recipients of the message. Their magic is obviously a mark of their innate superiority, why should they need to work at it?

** He's one of Dumbledore's charity cases probably (like Hagrid, Trewlaney (note: She's also there so that he can keep an eye on her, but she didn't need to be a professor for that IMHO) and even Snape...funny how all of them have one thing in common: They are unfit to be around children! Filch hates them because they've got magic and wants to torture them, Trelawney is a fraud, Hagrid is a danger to the students (he exposes people to creatures they aren't ready for - as much as Draco is an asshole, I still think that they shouldn't have had that Hyppogriff in class at all!) and Snape hates his students and doesn't teach them the basics of potion-making and he doesn't care if they sabotage one another (Slytherins throwing stuff into other peoples cauldrons!) so he's a danger to the students as well!)

** I have two. One, the Ministry, for whatever reason, decided that equality was the word of the day and required Hogwarts to have a Squib on staff. Filch ended up being it.

Two, Filch is the Avatar of Hogwarts. He's always been there and people just don't remember. He can't use any magic, but Hogwarts accommodates him by making sure he's not actively hindered in his quest to clean up the castle and catch students in trouble. He knows all the shortcuts, even the ones the Weasley twins think he doesn't. He knows the castle's moods and oddities, such as the trick stairs and the fake doors, and what days they'll be where. He knows the castle best, in every way. Even if he can't use magic, he's not really human at this point, either. Thus, Avatar of Hogwarts.

** I think it's that the position of the caretaker is a legacy thing from the time before the stature of secrecy, when there might have been times when someone unaware of magic would have had to be let into the castle, and it lacking a caretaker would have been quite weird. And as for why Filch, since the position clearly is a leftover of a time long past and doesn't really offer any opportunities, it does not surprise me that nary a wizard would want it and thus a squib got it.
