Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13312738/1/The-Granger-Principle][The Granger Principle]], an almost canon like Hermione is thrown into a non magical universe, without a her wand. She tries to get back home over the next 7 years, but new powerful enemies are closing in on her. Fortunately, this world's Harry, Ron, Luna, Ginny, Sirius, and Dumbledore are there to help her.
