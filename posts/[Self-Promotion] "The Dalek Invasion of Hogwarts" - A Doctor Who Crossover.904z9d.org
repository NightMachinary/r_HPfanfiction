Help me! A plot bunny has run away from me while I wasn't looking! I have begun writing a /Doctor Who/ crossover wherein the Daleks attempt to do their thing at Hogwarts in 1991. Naturally, the Doctor gets involved later on, as do a couple of /other/ lovable time-travelers familiar to /Who/ fans...

To keep things interesting (as if Daleks invading Hogwarts and Harry teaming up with the Doctor wasn't enough), I have decided to let go of the tired old 3d-person narrative and chosen a first-person narrator. /Hogwarts/. I think that's a first except for one-shots that were all /about/ the character of Sentient!Hogwarts, so if nothing else I'll have achieved /that/.

For now I have the (rather short) prologue up; expect a proper Chapter 1 some time soon.

** Was expecting a longer chapter than that to be honest, if you want to promote your work, maybe have a bit more than that to offer next time? :)

*** I mean, it's just a Prologue. Obviously the real chapters will be longer.

****** So, really need some more chapters to give an honest opinion. For now it is interesting... not good or bad, definitely something new.

Not sure at all about how you will go about the whole 1st person castle perspective, so good luck with that.

As for plot points I have been brainstorming, Hogwarts, with all its magic messes with technology so perhaps He-who-must-not-be-named, stumbles upon an odd trashcan in the dungeon and realizes there is a living being within it thru legimens*.

He ends up helping the dieing creature, semi bringing it's outer body to functionality thru the use of magic even though it's inner body is dieing. He-who-must-not-be-named realizes the usefulness of the Dalek and his curse resistant armor combined with his quick firing 'Avada Kadavra' weapons and they team up to steal the sorcerers stone to either restore their bodies or the Dark Lord secretly plans to take over the Daleks body (not a fan of this)

Likewise The Doctor need Dumbledore's help since his/her screwdriver is malfunctioning.

I feel like the first book should not be too heavy with Harry (keep him relevant tho) but focuses on The Dark Lord rising to power earlier then normal. Maybe have The Doctor show up towards the middle or end, because let's face it a weakened dalek and Voldemort do not stand a chance against Dumble and The Doc. So they realize all this too late and unable to stop the bad guys.

Dumbledore tells The Doctor about the prophecy and that Harry is the one destined to defeat He-who-must-not-be-named. Can you guess who because The Doctors new sidekick for the summer?

Side notes/ideas

*no time travel. Tardis does not want to leave Hogwarts.

*The Dark Lord, The Doctor, The Master. Do I smell a 3rd Time lord?

*Daleks betrayal of the inferior He-who-must-not-be-named

*out of ideas, sorry.
