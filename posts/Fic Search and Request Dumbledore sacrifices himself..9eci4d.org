I'm looking for a fic I read a long time ago. I'm not sure of the pairing but it wasn't slash. Maybe Harry/Ginny?

​

Anyway, here's what I remember:

- Dumbledore is a mentor to Harry.
- Harry slices off Dumbledore's arm in the Gaunt House to save it from the withering curse. Dumbledore survives sixth year.
- Voldemort returns to the public and the Ministry attempts to take control of Hogwarts.
- Dumbledore raises the wards on Hogwarts and cuts it off from the Ministry, inviting families inside. I specifically remembering Dumbledore transfiguring Fudge's security into marbles before banishing him from the castle.
- Voldemort eventually breaches the wards and a massive battle ensues. Dumbledore and Moody have a heroic last stand against the DEs and Voldemort, with Dumbledore cutting off Bellatrix's head just before he dies. Harry and Co escape.

That all I remember. I think I enjoyed this story and I would like to revisit it.

​

As for the request; any fics where Dumbledore goes out with a bang (or not), really showing off his magical skill.


** That sounds familiar was it a a haphne thing?
