** There's always linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black).

I've written several very long posts about why I was disappointing with the direction this fic took but it's still one of the most ambitious large scale AUs in this fandom.

*** SPOILERS

I still haven't forgiven the author for the time skip where Harry and Elicia's marriage falls apart and we get to see none of it. I mean, their relationship is one of the few story elements that exist throughout the story and yet it essentially ends off screen

**** I agree, I think he just wrote himself into a corner with the Prologue. He probably had the idea of the failing marriage right at the beginning and then couldn't think of a way to make it actually happen after literally having Elicia support Harry's every move before that, even if she didn't necessarily like it.

******* Why?

Ginny is already regretting about not jumping on the imperial bandwagon.

Since her boss Flamel is considering an alliance with Voldemort, I think it's only a matter of time before she defects as well. She had already smuggled out her best friend Hermione into the Empire.

Regardless of what she had done before, her abilities should be highly valued by Harry. IIRC, Harry (or the author?) likes the ancient Chinese Warlord Tsao Tsao, who was very well known to accept former enemies into his ranks.

BTW, she and Harry (or Hughes) would make a great couple.

******** I'm not denying that they would make a great couple, there's some very obvious chemistry there but Ginny just doesn't seem like the type of person to defect.

She chose her side and she sticks with it, even if she regretted it later. She's tenacious and loyal and just as stubborn as Harry is.

Harry respects her for that and while he would obviously accept her if she came to him, I do think he would lose some of that respect he had for her.

That said it's been quite a while since I've read the story and I haven't read the newest 2 or 3 chapters at all so I might be remembering things wrong.

********* Ginny has been pissed at Albion and Order leadership for a while now. I don't think it would take much for her jump the ship. Dora Tonks might join her too.

Daphne Greengrass is another defection candidate as her sister Astoria is very high up in the imperial power structure.

********** Yeah the defection would make sense and it's been hinted at enough that it seems the most logical way for Ginny's story to go. I'm not against a Harry/Ginny in the story at all since it wouldn't come out of nowhere and it fits the characters involved. My only issue is that we just don't get shown what happens with Elicia. She essentially just stops talking to him entirely and then we skip time to Harry randomly considering how his marriage is effectively over, which makes absolutely no sense.

In the end, as much as I hated the way the Jaegers were handled (seriously? Harry can't beat a squib one on one 6 times in a row? That's just dishonest to the character he created throughout the story) I feel that using that as an opportunity to kill off Elicia (and subsequently have Harry snap and lose his morals) would have suited the story much better.

**** Well I can't tell you why you don't like it but i certainly understand how you feel. I mostly dislike it nowadays for what it could have been.

I think the prose is great and it has some fantastic ideas and even more fantastic characters (the Ginny in this fic is still one of my all time favorite fanfic characters) but I think the author just got a bit too ambitious and the story kind of just fizzled out.
