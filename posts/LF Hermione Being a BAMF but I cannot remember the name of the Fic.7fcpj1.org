So below I have listed a few scenes that I remember from fics that I have read in the past and would like to reread but I cannot remember for the life of me the names of the Fics. I am fairly sure I read them all on FF.Net.

+1) Hermione has gone back in time to the time of the Marauders and is determined to change the future. Hermione tries to save Regulus by creating a (I think) ring that has water suspended in it and gives it to him before he goes to the cave.+ (Solved! Thank you AhoraMuchachoLiberta!!)

2) Hermione is working with Sirius (and Moody) to hide all the Horcruxes somewhere in the bowles of the Ministry. Hermione does not trust Albus with the Gaunt Ring. Albus hears about the Resurection stone and asks Moody to see it but Moody lets him take a fake instead. I think they end up burning all of it with Fiendfyre at once.

+3) Hermione is in the Forest of Dean (sometime during the Horcrux hunt in 6 year in the forest) when Sirius comes to help her. She learns wandless magic from him, which we later learn that she taught him.+

+4) Hermione and Sirius try to kill the Horcrux in Huffelpuffs Cup but end up almost drowning before Sirius is able to stab it with either the Griffindoor sword or a basilisk fang (can't remember which). They end up having a heavy snogging session before remembering they are in the middle of the Battle of Hogwarts+

+5) It Valentine's day and Sirius is tired of the attention that he is getting from all the girls who gave him valentines. Hermione asks Sirius to get up and go around the great hall and touch all the girls who gave him gifts. Those who have pustules (similar to Edgecome incident) those are the ones who gave him candy with Amoretia.+ ( 3-5 Solved! Thank you Ermahgerrrd)

+6) Snape gifts Hermione with a gauntlet that disappears into her skin when she is not using it, but can be used to detect poisons and can also be use to physically defend herself. She and Harry go out to see Gwap but Gwap picks her up and roughly squeezes her almost breaking her ribs. She uses the gauntlet to dig into Gwap's rough skin and he eventually drops her.+

** 4 is The Debt of Time. Or at least that has a scene just like that. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10772496/1/The-Debt-of-Time]] (sorry for bad link) #3 and 5 also appear in that fic I believe.

**** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10751447/1/Looks-Can-Be-Deceiving]] this is number 6 and I know what two is but I'm still trying to remember the name. /edit/ this is number 2 as well unless there is another story with a similar plot out there. But this story fits both your requests.
