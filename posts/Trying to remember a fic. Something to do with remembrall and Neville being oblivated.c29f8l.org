:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm trying to remember this fic I read a while ago. I think that it was only a couple chapters focused on Neville. I remember that Neville either lost his remembrall or someone stole it because they were trying to keep him from remembering stuff. Theo Nott was talking to someone (either Harry or Draco?) about how remembralls don't just tell you when you forgot something, but they show when you've been obliviated. Draco and Theo (and most purebloods) have remembralls, and I think the reason Draco made fun of Neville was because he had a really bad/low quality one???? Now this part might be from a completely different fic lmao, but apparently Neville's great uncle Algie had been obliviating him since childhood to make him think he was a squib, and had tried to kill him multiple times. It was super fucked up and I definitely cried. It's probably a dark!harry, slytherin!harry fic bc that's was I was super into around the time of reading this. I think that after this Neville gets his mind “un-obliviated” either at St. Mungos or the ministry and remembers everything that happened and is super bitter/upset/jaded, and then becomes closer friends with Harry. Please help????? It's been bothering me for a while and I finally remembered enough info to maybe have someone know what I'm talking about.


** Its still on going and I am pretty sure that its the one that in the first chapter Snape sirius and dumblwdoor are talking about nott being adopted in black family. Pretty long too if i remember correctly. I will keep searching in my list and hopefully I will find it. Edit:found it linkffn(11191235)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** There are some more that are series that have more. If you are interested i can link you some. The major problems with long fanfictions is that either they are getting boring after some time or they get abandoned. Imagine reading a 1mil ff only to be abandoned after some years.
