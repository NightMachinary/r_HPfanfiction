:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
First one: Hermione is sent back in time and holds to a copy of Beedle the Bard. It either is a horcrux or functions similar to one as her “binding” to sanity. She is in Slytherin & takes on the name of a pureblood. Tom claims her as his so none of the other Slytherins ever try to touch her.

Second: I /think/ this is the one where Hermione is homeless & a thief. It's dark Hermione/Harry. The Diary manifests separately from Lord Voldemort & maintains independence, going by Tom and has an obsession with Harry & Hermione. I know this one has underage, so /please/ just give me the name and don't break Rule 8.

Thanks in advance!


** I don't recognise either of these, but have you tried Tomione Finds in tumblr? They're really great at sourcing fics.

** The second is called “the anti-heroine'

That author, Cheshire_carroll, has several other fics that are much more lighthearted that I enjoyed. The fic you mention is a lot darker
