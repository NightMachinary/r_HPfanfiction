I read a part of this a while ago and don't remember the story exactly, but if I'm not wrong it spans multiple fics, and in the story Harry discovers he is a mage (or something similar, he's basically really powerful) and I think he dies at one point and he travels to another dimension or reality. I think it starts off with Harry and Hermione sharing a house together or something like that. There were a few instances where Hermione is kidnapped and one of the villains in the story tricks him into thinking she dies? My memory is super hazy and I might be crossing two different stories but hopefully, someone here knows what I'm talking about? Thanks!


** your flair for this kind of question should be "fic search", not "request". "Request" is for searching all fics that fulfill a criterium, not for finding specific fics.
