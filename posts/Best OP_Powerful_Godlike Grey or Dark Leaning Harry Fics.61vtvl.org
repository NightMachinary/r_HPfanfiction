Read a fic a bit back where Harry had lost nearly everything, ends up in a different dimension where Harry died as a baby and Voldemort won and became leader of the world. Harry is portrayed as being extremely powerful (absorbs magic), and not afraid of killing or torture or the darker side of things (mainly as it pertains to death eaters), but isnt so far gone he kills with abandon anyone apart from death eaters. There is slavery and abuse and rape involved on Voldemorts side, and while Harry doesn't like that (as it pertains to innocents), he also is not exactly a perfect individual himself, and sex or slavery or torture can be a tool when necessary.

--------------

I am looking for similar fics. Fics where Harry is powerful (or even OP/Godlike), and where he is at the very least grey, if not leaning Dark. Likely where Harry is on his "own side"... not liking the light (Dumbles) or the dark (Voldy). I don't want him so dark hes a mindless killer of all beings, or as dark as Voldemort, but involving things like torture, killing, slavery, and sexual situations are perfectly fine. Pairings are preferred, but not required, same with sexual situations or smut. I just don't like fics that throw around violence and killing, torture and the like, and yet don't even try to bring up the idea of sexual situations, romance, or similar things. I mean come on... lets be real here... and undoubtedly its already a mature fic. No male slash please (with regards to the main characters involvement).

--------------

TL;DR: Looking for Grey/Dark Harry ( but independent leaning... aka not on Voldemort/Dumbles sides), who is very strong... OP/Powerful/Godlike, In VERY mature rated stories including Violence/Killing/Rape/Torture/Slavery/Sex. Smut/Lemons are fine, but Plot must come first. No Male Slash.

Thanks!


** It's not completed, but you're not going to find much better than linkffn(2705927).

Basic "Harry is sent to another dimension" story.

Dumbledore has done evil things but isn't an evil person.

Harry's parents - at least, initially - distrust him.

Harry's "alternate" self is a Death Eater. Kind of.

This is one of those honest, gritty stories.

Author states that there is Angst, but it isn't teen-drama bullshit.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

**** Both Harrys are pretty strong. The writer is oddly good at making the story challenging, though.

You know the fics where the author is forced to one-up themselves by creating impossible challenges where the protagonist overcomes it with ease, only to be forced to create an even more impossible challenge?

This fic doesn't do that. It's refreshing.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(7718942;12040341): The first story is a Star Wars crossover, in which Harry followed Sirius through the Veil and ended up in the SW universe. Emperor Palpatine captured him and successfully turned him into a vicious Sith Lord. Harry returned after 4 years in the SW universe, but only 41 days in his home universe, extremely powerful and terrifying. Hermione and Luna managed to moderate him somewhat, but at cost of becoming quite dark themselves. Together they embarked on a megalomaniac plan of global domination.

In the sequel, their plan was disrupted by treachery and they were forced to leave Earth through the Star Gate. Out there, the power Trio took their fight to the Goa'ulds, and their ambitions now extended to the Galaxy. They generally had benevolent goals, but would not hesitate to use tortures and genocides against their enemies. On the other hand, the Goa'ulds were totally filthy evil scums who made Voldemort and Palpatine look positively enlightened.

*** I have actually read Broken Chains. Its one of the few HP/SW crossovers I have enjoyed . I did not however realize there was a sequel so I will definitely take a look at it, although to be honest, sequels always scare me because i worry they will ruin the first one for me somehow.

Thanks!

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
