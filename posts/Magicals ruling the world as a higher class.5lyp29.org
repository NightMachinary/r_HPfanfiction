I'm bored of magicals hiding away.

Over 100k+ words.


** Rise of Wizards is the only one I can think of off the top of my head. It sounds like Grindelwald's dreams more than anything else so you could see if there are any fics focused around him winning that might help.

** "Emperor", linkffn(5904185): Harry rules the newly formed European Empire with an iron fist. Magicals occupy most senior positions, especially in the military and intelligence services, but Muggles do hold important positions too. His government suffers from factionalism, and it doesn't run across the magical-muggle divide.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

**** Half Blood Prince. The Other Minister chapter makes it clear that wizards have any degree of control they want over the muggle government. Which is funny, because the America of the 1920s is pretty much the opposite. May be Grindelwald actually taught them a thing or two through the course of the war.
