** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]] - focuses on Albus Potter, Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy (and a few OCs). Everybody is well written, the characters are interesting and there is no character bashing. - it is one of my favourite fan fics, but be warned: It is not always a happy story, sad things happen and the heroes don't come out of it unscathed.

Also has a finished sequel ( oh my! Finished? Need to catch up on that) and a second sequel in process. Just look on the authors profile to find those.
