Mostly because after WW2 paranoid wizards would go around and seize the infinity stones and bury them deep in the vaults of the unspeakables and obliviate everyone but the human leadership. And loki would probably get gangbanged by the collective MACUSA auror group + the Canadians and the I.C.W. So in short most of the Marvel/Harry Potter crossover fanfiction would never happen.


** It depends on how the sorcerer supreme fits into everything. Maybe have them target squibs and muggleborns. Maybe reconfigure what squibs are by having their magic form differently? Wasn't mentioned in thor that magic and tech were one in the same? It would show how technology is behind and magic if we can't combine it.

** Although I would be possible that Wizards would view themselves above the problems of the Muggle world/they wouldn't want to be pulled into their shit and called to solve their problems and thus let the Muggles deal with what they can solve on their own.

I imagine there would be a department (Auror special force) that would occasionally be sent to interfere, and all of them would be highly trained in mindaltering spells/obliviating Ã  la Men in Black.

Perhaps they would be connected with the current director of SHIELD on an need-to-know basis, but even they wouldn't be aware of the extent of the Wizarding world.

And since Wizards are connected to pagan religion (Yule and stuff) I find it entirely possible that they knew of the existence of the Asgardians or at least Norse Wizards and were like - no, were not gonna interfere with those godly stuff. And 80 dead Muggles would hardly matter to wizards.

Thanos would be an interfering point I imagine but the other stuff...

** Alternatively, the sheer incompetence of some of the magicals/magical government would likely accidentally give them right to thanos.
