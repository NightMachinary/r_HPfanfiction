In addition to Inverarity's /Alexandra Quick/ series (which has been mentioned), the other "best" story exploring wandless magic is Myst Shadow's WIP [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]]. 150k words, WIP. Updated last Aug.:

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)
#+end_quote

It's a great story for many reasons, not the least of which being its fleshing out of many aspects of the HP magical system (e.g., "Why aren't unbreakable vows more common?") in plausible ways that are consistent with canon. In particular, the author goes to a great deal of effort showing why wandless magic is not a common thing. Also, Harry's learning to cast wandlessly has some serious unintended (and largely negative, at least at first) consequences on his connection to his magic.

  What stories could do a better job of handling this part of fanon/canon?
#+end_quote

One of the classic older stories uses a device for wandless magic I despise: Lorddwar's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][Summer of Change]], the quintessential Indy!Harry Harry/Tonks story. What I hate is that it employs the "well maybe if I knew it was impossible, I might not have done it" bullshit trope popularized by Jeconais in /This Means War/ and copied by many, including Lorddwar. In both stories, Harry's so ultra-mega in the power stakes that he just does impossible stuff because he's ignorant of there being any limits to his magic.

If you're an author and you do have to go the wandless magic route (which you shouldn't in this day and age--after book 7 of canon came out, wands have been shown to be central to HP magic), please do it any way but that.

*** Could you you explain further why book 7 made it clear that wands are central to the magic in the HP world? I believe canon has some of the more advanced magics (animagus, apparition, death love shield, rituals, potions, mind arts, herbology), to be wandless.

I always thought wands were more of a focus. It helps you focus you attention and control/focus your magic into the desired outcome. I agrre that it adds something, but I always thought wands were not required.

(I'm not arguing that Summer of Change was good with how it handled wandless magic)

**** Wands were made into the center of the HP magical world in book 7. Much of wandlore was expanded upon in the book, particularly with the interaction with Ollivander. We also learned that even what had been thought to be wandless magical activities (e.g., Apparition) in fact required proximity to a wand. In the great escape in the beginning of the novel, Harry's holly-phoenix wand was shown to be partially sentient, able to fire upon Voldemort on its own volition. The camping trip from Hell sucked as much as it did because he was using a stolen wand for much of the time, one that refused to work for him properly. Harry's power was broken with his wand in the exchange with Nagini. Confiscation of the wands of non-Purebloods by the Ministry was emblematic of removing their ability to use "stolen" magic. The reveal at the end had to do with his having mastered the Elder Wand transitively (having defeated Draco to earn control of his hawthorne wand).

Basically, while it was indeed a bunch of retconning for the series, it's hard to deny that wands were turned in /Deathly Hallows/ into an integral part of the magical system. If one were to make wands elective, as many wandless magic fanfiction stories are wont to do, then it pretty much tosses out most all of book 7 canon.

*** The reasonably acceptable part of wandless magic in that story is that it isn't unusual for trained members of Tonks' crew to have the ability; Harry is purely exceptional for being fast to pick it up. He's also a powerhouse in terms of spell reserves, but not by orders of magnitude- just some percent. It's what you'd expect a hero to have- an edge over the common soldier.

Fair point. I guess I don't object to the way wandless magic is portrayed (even Hermione could do a bit of it by the end) so much as when it's combined with the tiresome "I can do the impossible because I am ignorant of the limitations of magic" thing.

Actually, Harry's spellcasting power in that story is explicitly orders of magnitude above that of his peer group. Recall his experience in the spell tester thing his first day with the Unspeakables and the scores he was putting up. According to the explanation of the scale Horace gave, they were consistently 10x to 100x more powerful than those of his peers.

** I don't have a problem with wandless magic because most wizard and witches do it. Accidental magic is wandless magic. If little Hermione wanted a book off the shelf she couldn't reach and she summoned it. It is wandless magic. I think it should be explained like children's magic isn't stable or strong but they have bursts of it in high emotional situations.

Wandless magic should be hard for witches and wizards to achieve after they have started using a wand. It's like if someone learned on a qwerty keyboard and used it for five years but then tried to switch to a keyboard that went in alphabetical order. One could do it but they would have to train their brain and fingers to respond differently. Just like that after using a wand which helps you to better consistent magic. Doing wandless magic should be hard and draining.

Also wandless magic should be like a damn breaking free where extra magic is lost uselessly. Where as a wand helps one focus and is like a water hose which doesn't drain you of your magic faster and is much more acute and accurate in spells.

  Sanderson's First Law of Magics: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.
#+end_quote

The problem with wandless magic is that it is often defined only as a relaxation of the (already very nebulous) rules of normal magic. It is rarely limited in any meaningful way. Thus using it to get characters out of danger will almost always feel like an arse-pull for the reader. If it doesn't feel like an arse-pull that's because the reader already knows that wandless magic can solve literally any problem. In that case all you have is a stupid overpowered Harry who cannot be realistically put in danger.

So, basically, if you impose hard limits on what wandless magic can do and why, and you make those obvious to the reader /before/ the big climax then it might work. If you don't then Harry will either feel OP or like his powers are inconsistent and powered solely by plot.

I can't really think of a fic that does this well, off the top of my head. There almost certainly are a few.

** Re-post of what I wrote 12 hours ago since it's been Vanished:

Hogwarts Battle School touches on it nicely- Harry and Hermione seem to be competing on developing the talent. HP and the Summer of Change uses it as one of those 'except for Harry' mini-superpowers, but it isn't considered earth-shaking and adds to the intriguing tactical details in the story.

In general, I think wandless magic should be very short-range, perhaps even limited to touch, and to only be able to make simple things happen. Wands aren't just a crutch- they're as key to magic as a mechanic's toolbox- or a techie's laptop. Magic done without a wand should be crude and exhausting, but sometimes all you need is to hit something the right way to get the results you need.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] by AngelaStarCat handles wandless magic very well in my opinion. Wandless magic requires some sort of ritual or a very mature magical core. It is considered to be a big deal, though not unheard of, and there are still advantages to using a wand.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Empire]] by Marquise Black on the other hand, Harry is able to use extremely powerful wandless magic without any explanation. It is one glaring flaw in an otherwise excellent story.

** Most could do better with that twist, as it tends to poison otherwise well-meaning stories. I often see wandless magic just used as a crutch to let someone write around underage magic difficulties. It seems to be the best indication of an impending powerful Harry fic, and not in a good sense.

Fine, people like that sort of thing. I read those sorts of stories, too. But at least, dear fanfic authors, don't make it a cultural AND racial thing. Just...please, no more (ugh) /exotic/ East Asian magic, no /close-to-nature/ Native Americans, no...god help us, /voodoo black people/.

Making it simply a different /style/ or branch of magic /and also much, much better/ isn't, in this case, much better. The British would have collected them all by now like Pokemon anyway (see: curry, Pokemon). So no oh-so-mysterious and unique (but ubiquitous) Egyption necromancers, no forgotten South American blood magic, no forbidden (christ, really?) /Indian sex magic/.

Just make magic without a wand a different part of magic, something that maybe other cultures express in different ways. But also give them freaking wands, too, and explain why the British don't do it their way if it's so great. And don't just casually make the Harry Potter world even more racist, and worryingly small and isolationist, by having different magics be /genetic/ or something without really exploring what the hell that would mean for the story world.

And don't make it work better than a wand and attempt to remain within canon. That part's firmly AU, if nothing else.

They just wear the same clothes, participate in the same form of government, and drink the same tea. There is clearly a lot of overlap. Why wouldn't British wizards go to Ceylon to learn from Vedda mystics if such a thing were possible? If anything, they seem stuck at that certain late Regency-era period where such things as cultural appropriation were growing most common.

No, there should be a large segment of rich British magicals who have their own asiatic society, studying and experimenting with foreign magic like Arthur does with Muggle devices. And there should be an adventurers club, still trying to chart the origin of the Amazon ley lines. That's much more in the flavor of the canon universe than awesome magic existing just beyond the horizon of the British isles.

I usually don't read fics like this for the same reason I avoid the after-the-war stuff--it just doesn't have much to do with the Harry Potter stories and has to make a lot up that doesn't always make sense.

It'll still need an really good explanation for why magic /X/ isn't used by anyone we see in Magical Britain, though. And it would be nice if the answer wasn't, "because they're all xenophobic shitheads."

I mean, curry and Pokemon are one thing (yes, yeess, buy our food, buy our entertainment, give us moneyyy) but 'buy our strongest weapons and the secrets to our defences'? Somehow I don't think so. And with humans' history of burning books or dumping them into rivers if they don't agree with you, I feel like they would have been well hidden long before imperialists dreamed of popping over to Asia or Africa for some "spices".

Of course, I'm sure some knowledge could be stolen, or a culture could be sold out by some particularly unscrupulous or bitter individual, but I imagine it would be treated as contraband and therefore sold in Knockturn. No respectable shop would be caught with smuggled artifacts or stolen antiques today, right? So I think it would be the same with magic. And since it's only sold in Knockturn, everyone assumes it's Dark Magic , which is Very Bad, and either shuns it on principle or is forced to shun it through peer pressure.

Great suggestion and I would amend this to include Merlin. It's easy to forget that JKR's fictional mage was based off a real myth created by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the eleventh century which was, in turn, based on a genuine Welsh mad-man in the sixth century. An awful lot of the old stories from Wales have made their way into canon Harry Potter, but that's no reason for fanfic authors to compound the problem by making Merlin a demigod.

In contrast to their Muggle counterparts I don't see the magical inhabitants of Britain espouse the same strain of imperialism that much of the rest of the world has come to detest. Unless I'm wrong about that?

**** They have schools run like Regency-era boarding schools and a government run like a single stuffy, overly broad British department--and even so named. This isn't presented as parallel development, either. Some of the culture of the non-magical has slopped over into the magical world.

They drink tea, after all, not a native plant. Do they get their own, which would require traveling magical merchants, or do they use the stuff non-magicals acquire, indicating a closer relationship with them? Seems hard to imagine them /not/ taking advantage of the same situations the non-magicals experienced. Empire wasn't just looting places for spices and artifacts, it was an entire network of travel and the cultural appropriation that went along with seeing the way other people did things.

I'd even imagine the same post-secondary habit of rich young people traveling to some exotic place by boat would also be a thing, even if it was facilitated by a series of portkeys or some such. Just making the history of the British magicals these xenophobic Welsh hicks plus some assorted naked painted men is really insulting to the history and creation of the United Kingdom. And that's what a lot of really detailed fics try to do, for no well established reason.

Could you expand on this a bit? As a Welsh hick, I'm not certain if I should laugh or cry. Most of the xenophobes in the UK are 'kippers' (UKIP party) or in the English Defense League (English nationalists). I'm biased, but Welsh people tend to be pretty easy going.

****** Not as a modern thing, but as the historic tribal victims of Roman aggression or some such. I.e, Pureblood British magicals are descended from the "real" natives, and thus are better than the mongrel invaders that make up the modern UK. Often paired by "Muggle-born are destroying historic magical culture" and other Daily Mail-esque, foreigners are ruining everything types of tropes. Often with a strong whiff of half-understood, modern Wiccan tenants blown up large.

That's pretty contentious as the only written records we have available are from the Romans themselves. If Tacitus wrote that water is wet, I'd visit the ocean to make certain. It was also very likely a local British chieftain who deposed the Romano-British in 383 and ended Rome's influence over much of their northwestern domain.

I've always thought the Malfoys as French-descended which would make them almost as hypocritical as TMR. Greengrass is the only name on the HP Lexicon's list of Death Eaters I believe to be older than William the Conqueror. I think their surname originates from the 7th century, but don't quote me on that.

Very much so. You'll usually see that pop up in "purebloods were right" and other Death Eater apologist fics. Sometimes it is subtle, with only the Old Magic being the true magic, pushed out by those Roman scum. Sometimes it is just straight-up Francophobia and assorted racism. It isn't usually the main point of the story, though it goes along with a lot of other, usually poorly handled tropes.

I don't really have any recs for those. I just read the latest and most popular stuff, and it regularly features in oh-so-serious stories with Azkaban, Dark but Righteous Harry, and Light is Evil Dumbledore. Very rarely, it is well done and makes Voldemort's crew actually sympathetic. Most of the time, it is part of a hard smoking, hard drinking, hard fucking, Harry fighting the good fight against the authority trope that just makes my eyes roll.
