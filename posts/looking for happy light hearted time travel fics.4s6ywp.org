** A Black Comedy - linkffn(3401052)

So this one is not exactly time travel... its dimensional travel, but since it kinda goes back in time at the same time... I figure it counts.

Plus its a comedy, so of course its lighthearted to some degree.

** what's that fic where both Harry and Hermione go back, Harry is crazy but the Grangers take him in, Hermione moves in next door to #4 Privet and raises Harry.. it is rough in the start but everyone heals over time, especially harry.

it's not humor but it's light, gentle.

full disclosure.. my tastes in fanfiction are often at odds with the stuff recommended here. so.. ymmv.. and I don't know the name of the fic.. that's a thing as well.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  The war is won, but at a terrible price. Seventy-six years later, Hermione decides to go back and make things right, once and for all. Time-travel fic. Eventual Harry/Hermione, some mature content. Reviews appreciated! NOT OLD HERMIONE/HARRY!

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)
