So this is a little odd, but the the author ElfCollaborator has a funny crack fic series called Weiss Reacts, linkffn(10061632), for the RWBY fandom. I was wondering if anybody knew of something similar but for Harry Potter.

Thanks for the help


** What you're looking for are fics written in the style of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which is often abbreviated to MST3K or just MST in the fandom world.

There used to be a lot of MST3K reaction style fics before the Harry Potter fandom was a thing and MST3K was still on TV and prominent in the pop culture consciousness.

The reason for MST3K's demise and general lack in the HP fandom is that HP and fanfiction.net were on the rise at the same time. Ff.net became monolithic in the fanfiction fandom and when it banned and deleted its MST3K category for being against the rules in 2002, that was the beginning of the end.

There are still MST3K communities and archives apparently, but you'll have to google for them. No doubt there are plenty of HP MST3Ks hidden away outside of ff.net.

  Our loveable heiress reacts to various fanfictions and the tropes within them. Rated T for themes, implications. Some crossover elements in later chapters. Parody, crack, OOCness of certain characters. RWBY belongs to Rooster Teeth. RnR! Chapter: The Great Antic War Finale! "We'll break through the heavens and all that stands before us!" NOT TAKING RVB REQUESTS. COMPLETE.
