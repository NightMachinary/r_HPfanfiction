Hi, I'm looking for a very precise fanfic, I forgot its name but here's what I remember: - Hermione is the daughter of Bellatrix and Rabastan Lestrange (I don't remember if they adopted her or if she is biologically their daughter) - I think that they got her (back?) after her 1st year of school - Voldemort is inside Harry Potter's body (and he's pretty young physically so I think the story starts after their 1st year) but ruling the Death Eaters - There's something about Krum or Bulgaria in the later chapters - Snape and I don't remember who else drug Voldemort so they can implant thoughts in his head while he's unconscious - It was a rather long story (maybe even over 100 chapters)

Does anyone know which fic I'm talking about? I didn't actually particularly care for the "Hermione as a pureblood" aspect, it was the rather unique Voldemort plotline that really interested me.

Thanks in advance!


** Ooooooh. That sounds really very cool. I don't think the "Hermione as a pureblood" thing really appeals to me very much because I like the "outsider" thing. However, if she was /adopted/ by the Lestranges, that'd be nice...

TBH "Time Heals All Wounds" plays with this - Bellatrix considers this, but decides against it.

*** [[/u/Emmarrrrr]] found it, it was Strange and Invisible History, by Madea's Rage. I actually hadn't read Time Heals All Wounds but it looks pretty interesting, I'll probably read it after re-reading this.
