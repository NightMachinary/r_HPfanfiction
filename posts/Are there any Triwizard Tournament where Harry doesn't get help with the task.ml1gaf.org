I'm looking for storys where its pretty much the same only Harry doesn't get told about the dragons so he goes in blind with the others knowing what there up against. Maybe he doesn't get help for the Gilly weed/egg eather


** Harry doesn't learn about the dragon, walks in blind and gets burned alive. The end. Everybody mourns.

*** No there was a story i read a while ago (i dont remember the name) where harry goes in blind not knowing about the dragons and flips out because the three older kids knew but he didn't and they just assumed he knew also. But In the book harry spent the inter time studying what he could. He wanted to lose but not die.
