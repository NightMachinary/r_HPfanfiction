** There are so few examples of women on man rape in literature, compared to the reverse, that I personally don't feel particularly comfortable with erasing one of the few examples there are.

** While your explanations could have worked in other settings, I think HP canon made it pretty clear who the victim of rape was here.\\
We know 3 things about the situation in Little Hangleton.\\
1) Merope Gaunt was fascinated by Tom Riddle, and would spy on him when he passed next to her house, on the other hand, Tom Riddle could not care less for the Gaunts except to be wary of the mad people.\\
2) In the 6 months her father was in jail, Merope Gaunt changed her relations with Tom from "Stranger I ignore and dislike by principe" to "Let's run away together and be married". It could be one of these romance novel trope of true love between the rich and the poors, but in most of these cases the girl is beautiful. Way more chances magic is involved.\\
3) Tom Riddle broke up with his girlfriend (fiance) to be with Merope Gaunt, and left his house with her to London. He came back one year later claiming to be bewitched. Since Voldemort killed only 3 Riddle 20 years later, the girl probably never forgave him.

We don't know a lot about Tom Riddle since the canon didn't expand on him or his family. But the few is said made it impossible for him to BE the rapist. While staying canon compliant, the worst you could say about him was that he left his pregnant girlfriend/wife behind when he came back. And while it may makes him a bad person, especially concerning the child, his desire to stay away from the girl that can litterally bewitch him may be understandable.

*** While I agree with most of this, I have to correct one thing. Escaping from a kidnapper does not make someone a bad person. People have no obligation to care for a baby who's the result of rape.

*** First of all I don't care that much about canonicity, so this might be slightly AU. However, the funny thing, is that your statements can be in my opinion explained away to fit my story.

1. First of all, we have only a testimony from the reconstruction of modified mind of mentally unstable hateful brother of hers, who suspected her of something wrong anyway. Moreover, initial infatuation of victim with his future violator is nothing extraordinary. It just makes a victim easier to get. And of course, the violator won't flaunt to everybody his plans.
2. I don't see where you get that “Stranger I ignore and dislike on principle”. Even the memory of Bob Ogden mentioned that “/She likes looking at that Muggle”/ (yes, you can claim it is again a testimony of the same unreliable Morfin Gaunt, at least here it is recorded by the impartial government official). And yes, it is a sad reality that to many rapists natural beauty of their victim is irrelevant. Especially, if he was from the rich family, he wasn't planning to show up with her anyway. Other aspects of her body and her personality would be more important.
3. Again, I would question the quality of evidence, but there is more than it. I could clearly see the situation when Cecilia broke with him from unrelated causes, and he enraged and with contested masculinity takes it out on Merope by raping her. Again, it wouldn't be the first case like that. In the highly status-oriented (he was a lord, she was a commoner) patriarchal society, she might go with him after the initial rape more or less out of desperation, because her options were then almost none. He might promise her some money, but after she was found pregnant and not willing to let him “take care of the child” (which she was obviously not willing, because she carried the baby up to the birth), he might kick her out and let her be on the streets of London.
4. And yes, he might suspect (or even know) that Gaunts were wizards (after living for some time with a witch), also it could be common knowledge in the village (that dead snake on their door is a bit of giveaway), so accusing her of magically seducing him could be the easiest way how to get away with his crime.

I am not saying that it is how it happened, and as I said I don't particularly care to be canon compliant, but the funny thing is that I could very well be and still fit my story into it.

**** How do you go from 'the crazy people living in that unsanitary, broken down shack with dead snakes on the door, to "magic!" On the contrary, the Gaunts living standards would disabuse anyone inclined to think magic exist from suspecting them of being magical.

Even with the extremely unlikely answers you have found to the points made above, Tom Riddle SR. and Merope were away from the town for months. The Muggle had no reason to stay with his victim, presumably living in lower standards than he is used to. Your idea of the character suggests someone with zero compassion, someone who would have no trouble with the morality of killing Merope.

Sorry, but unless you go AU, the story is unbelievable.

** She was described as er... ugl- I mean unprepossessing, so...

Most likely the other way around.

In addition to that, JKR said herself that she used love potions.

**** Voldemort considered him the bad guy, but is this view popular? In general, people seem to acknowledge that a person who's raped has no obligation to care for a baby who's the result of that rape. Even people who oppose abortion accept that a rape victim would probably want to put the baby up for adoption.

****** Yikes. I see that victim-blaming is popular whether the victim is male or female.

In my story, he didn't even know she was pregnant when he escaped, but it wouldn't matter if he did. He escaped from his kidnapper and rapist. He had no obligation to care for a baby he hadn't willingly created.

** It's very common for a rich man to rape a poor woman, but Tom actually married Merope. That happens only when the poor woman is beautiful or otherwise attractive, which Merope wasn't.

Even Morfin, who hated muggles, said that Merope was attracted to Tom, even though his bias would have led him to believe that it was Tom, that filthy muggle, who wanted his pureblood sister.

** Considering she's a witch, can make potions, and Tom Riddle Sr. already had someone beloved who he was going to marry... It's the only explanation there is to why Riddle Sr. up and left the person he was supposed to marry for another.

Given what we know about Riddle being a member of the higher echilons of society and his family being disliked by the lower class as well as magic existing; I agree with Dumble's deduction. Keep in mind the power dynamic between a magical and a muggle. It's not equal. If Riddle had loved her he wouldn't have left her as soon as he stopped consuming love potions. If he had raped her, there would've been no marriage.

** Unpopular opinion, but I always felt sorry for Merope. Not excusing what she did to Riddle Sr., but she never even had a chance. She grew up in a horrible abusive shithole. Without going to Hogwarts, what interactions did she have with external world, wiches or wizards other than her family? Because she definitely wasn't allowed to interact with muggles. Who taught her about life, about right and wrong? Marvolo Gaunt? What were her prospects in life? Most likely getting raped by her brother (or even her father) to continue the pure Slythering line.

And then she was pregnant and homeless on the streets of London in winter, taken advantage by the pawnbroker. Dumledore's dismissal of her death always irked me. As if it was really her choice to die during chilbirth when she must have been emaciated and malnourished and freezing, without proper (or any, really) medical care. Not to mention her being the result of many generations of inbreeding probably didn't help.
