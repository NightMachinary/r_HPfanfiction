Hey there fic readers,

Do you like alt upbringing fics?

Do you hate tragic misunderstandings as a plot device?

Do you wish that they were comedic understandings, instead, and that there were more of them?

Do you think a long-form "Who's on First" gag is a great idea for a fic?

If you said yes to the above questions then my new fic may be for you:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12906362/1/Wyrd-Son]]

It's currently sitting at an imminently digestible 8K words and desperately needs reviews to let the author (me) know if it makes readers giggle as much when they read as I do when I write.

Or I could learn that my own sense of humor is a unique and isolated thing, like a great turtle hurtling through the cosmos with no elephants in sight.


** I've Just read the first chapter. It starts out well, and you've done a credible job with capturing the style of Pratchett's humour.

One thing, though: please don't use Americanisms. Both Pratchett and Rowling are British. Harry doesn't have a "Mom", he has a "Mum".

I shall read more, and look forward to your forthcoming chapters.

edit: finished the available chapters. I really like this story!

** I didnt know i needed this! First chapter was a little confusing on who was speaking (though it wasnt that important) but the lack of indicators of scene changes was confusing. Unless they all did the adoption ritual in the same house next to each other.. xD But very well written! I want more! Hope for longer chapters too ^{^}

*** This is great feedback. I'll take a look at chapter 1 and clean up the dialogue/ perspective breaks.

I'm working on beefing up word count with more description, I just want it to be actually important when I do.

Glad you enjoyed it!
