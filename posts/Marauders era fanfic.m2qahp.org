** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5385554/chapters/12438575][*Divergence*]] *by abovetheserpentine:* In an effort to escape her captors, Hermione Granger attempts to go back in time two hours. However, she ends up in 1977, confused and alone. How will she navigate the past when she knows the future? Can she sit idly by and watch those she begins to consider friends succumb to their horrible fates? Timelines are tricky things. EWE. /(Hermione Granger/Remus Lupin. Complete. FYI that there's sort of a teacher-student relationship in this one.)/

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1124404/chapters/2266336][*One Hundred and Sixty Nine*]] *by Soupy_George:* It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. /(Hermione Granger/Sirius Black. Complete. FYI that Sirius definitely has era-typical views on gender roles/traits in this one.)/
