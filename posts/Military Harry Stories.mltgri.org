Howdy,

I am interested in most stories that involve Harry joining the Muggle Military in some fashion. Crossovers are okay. Would prefer no slash.

A couple that I have read are Old Soilder's Never Die and Mayhem's Messenger.

Thanks

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

** I had read all of the stories mentioned so far except Mayhem's Messenger, so I happily went off to read that.

I thought you said this was a military story. I'm on chapter 9 and so far it's all been about setting up a harem/possible orgy story involving both Hermione and her mother, along with Tonks and Susan Bones (and probably Luna although she's not actively in the story yet). Tonks has masturbated and Susan had an orgasm in her aunt's office---without even touching herself---both getting off on the memory of Harry's aura. Hermione has given both Luna (mentioned only) and Tonks orgasms through a targeted "tickling" spell---and at 18 is openly having exuberant sex with Harry (and both of them walking around barely-dressed in Harry's case and naked in Hermione's) with her mother's full acceptance and not little envy. Her mother even moans Harry's name in her sleep, and Harry has thought of her as a MILF while ogling both her and Hermione's asses while shopping.

Yeah, Harry went to a military academy and packs guns everywhere he goes, and has the interest/protection of higher-ups in MI-5 and -6, but there's been absolutely no "military Harry" as of yet.

Edited to add: two chapters later (now starting chapter 11), and still no military. However, I've learned that Hermione is completely shaved, Tonks masturbated AGAIN while peeping on Hermione and Harry in the shower, and Emma did the same while listening through their mutual bathroom wall. Hermione has given both Tonks and her mother (eww) permission to ride Harry's train---Tonks as part of a threesome but I hope Emma's not the same---and at the end of the chapter the four of them were in a Roman bath (think swimming pool with hot water), Emma and Tonks both wearing white swimsuits that are see-through now they're wet. Hermione's meeting with Susan in a few days to negotiate Harry knocking Susan up to continue her family line.

~@~

Edit 2: Chapter 11 might as well have been named "Enter Luna." First there's the magical creation of the rings (yes plural) for his apparently two future wives, one of which is decorated with crescent moons. I felt my suspicions were confirmed at that point. Then at the end of the chapter he finds Luna in a secure building on his protected property, and she greets him by name even though they've never actually met.

I really liked all the other military stories mentioned so far in this thread. I keep hoping that this story will eventually become of the same caliber, but so far it's still just a lame harem setup that includes a bit of potential mother-daughter incest just to be different. I can FEEL that there's the bones of a good story here---no pun intended---but eleven chapters of sex and sexual innuendo while barely setting up what would perhaps take a single chapter of "real" plot is quickly becoming a matter of diminishing returns. And the story isn't even finished! I'm currently starting chapter 12 of the 26 that have been posted---does the focus ever shift out of everybody's sex lives?

~@~

Final edit because I'm just done with this fic. Two more chapters, that I skimmed over because it was all about Emma acting like a cat in heat, the three women (Emma, Hermione and Luna) naked sunbathing, Luna returning Hermione's "favor" of orgasm via tickling charm, more shopping with proprietary!Harry, Hermione taking Luna out of the house and telling Harry to go shag her mother, one small scene that actually advanced the plot, and Tonks being assigned as live-in bodyguard so I guess the harem is complete now. Oh wait! The Susan Bones issue hasn't been decided yet because they're "getting to know each other" first.

I've given this fic 13 chapters, and can definitely say this is NOT a military Harry fic. This is Harry sleeping with Hermione while every other female around teases him (with the understanding they'll all be riding the Harry train eventually), and Hermione is sexing up Harry AND every female in sight fic (but not her mother so far; she's just pimping out her boyfriend to her so far), with a little bit of plot and car-wank thrown into the chinks between all the sex.

**** Or fewer, if like me they were really looking for military Harry stories. Read Old Soldiers Never Die, No Fate, or Who Dares Wins, although two of those are still in progress. They're pretty brilliant and worth waiting for the updates.

Harry is a student cadet (and plans to join the air force) in Harry the Weapon by Slytherinsal. It's not straight-up military Harry, but neither was that story. linkffn(12834497)

  Vernon gets the smarts when accidental magic in response to a bellow breaks the compulsion to be mean to Harry. He is well sore with the magical world which is making a child soldier by grooming Harry, so he decides to turn the weapon back on them by teaching Harry all he needs to survive.

**** Also, to be fair, it's more heavy flirting so far. What sex there is has only been referred to, not shown in detail. Sorry if that's a deal-breaker. Doesn't change that everybody in the fic seems to be thinking with their private parts. (And no, that doesn't make it "military.")

***** Well, I gave it a try but I'm afraid didn't get as far as you. The know-it-all Harry and the icebox put me off straight away.

I'm a big fan of No Fate and Who Dares Wins, but unfortunately neither have been updated for a while.

****** I gave it longer than I usually would, because of the the company was in. I really liked all three of the other stories, and since it was mentioned by OP I kept hoping it would get better and be worthy of being lumped in with the others.

It never did.
