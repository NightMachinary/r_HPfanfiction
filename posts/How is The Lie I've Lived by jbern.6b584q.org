I've seen it recommended many times, however I'm not a fan of first person fics, but it gets recommended a lot so I was wondering if it is still worth a read?

** It's a jbern story, so you'll love it and be ostracized or hate it and be welcomed.

** Juvenile fun. Truly great "if you don't take it seriously".

Bonus note: I noticed that stuff that's way more juvenile and hard to take seriously gets taken seriously by many people here. Examples: Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches or For Love of Magic. I guess Lie being old news makes it easy to write down.

** I like to think of it as a pulpy, B-movie tier of fic. If you view it that way, it's pretty entertaining. If you take it seriously, not so much.

**** Maybe, maybe. But my main point still stands: TLIL is entertaining, but not necessarily good.

***** Actually, now that I think about it, it pegs more like daytime tv.

** It's a great fic if you don't take it seriously. While it hasn't aged as well as some similar fics from its era, it is still of higher than average quality.

** It's on my favourites list and there aren't many of those. It's not quite as funny as it thinks it is, but it's still pretty funny, well-written and worth reading.

** It's entertaining, but not phenomenal. I'd read it just to get a good grasp of certain fandom tropes that are now considered no-nos. Saying which would be spoilers, but after you've read it I think you'll have a good idea of what.

** It's pretty bad. I think if the sorting hat wasn't in the story (which I found to be tedious), then there wouldn't be that much of note within it. Though I guess some people really like the thought of Ferrari sponsored brooms...

*** lmao you've made me realize that there's nothing that I, personally, find noteworthy in that fic /aside/ from the Sorting Hat.

I opened this thread like, "What is this? Name is vaguely familiar, but no idea what this fic is. Hmmm."

And then I read the summary and you mentioned the Sorting Hat and it all clicked together that /this is the fic where the/ */sorting hat/* /taught me new insults./
