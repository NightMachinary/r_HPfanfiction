Hey! I was wondering if any of you knew of any good fan fictions between Draco and Astoria?


** I posted mine in a recent thread: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322009][Dreamscape]] (but mind that it's not yet complete) where Astoria is Draco's psychologist as he faces post-war nightmares. My fav writer of D/A is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=179718][peppersweet]]. She's written four, two of which are complete: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290059][Memento]] which inspired mine and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317854][Rush Hour]] which I haven't had the chance to read yet.
