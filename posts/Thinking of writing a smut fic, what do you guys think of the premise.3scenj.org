** Voldemort has always seemed rather asexual to me, even if he used his charm to get valuable antiques from older women. Perhaps the result of the destruction of Voldemort's first horcrux is that all of Tom Riddle's base urges got absorbed into Harry. He might have all of Riddle's memories and skills as of when he made the horcrux at 16- just enough to make him dangerous as well as hormonal. Add in some uncontrolled Legilimency and Harry might get funky in a Jekyll/Hyde fashion, seducing the awestruck witches of other Houses while he maintains a veneer of respectability with the Gryffindors he's known up to then.

Now it's a story- smut will happen, but there's a progression and tension and a question to be answered- how far will he go, will he get caught, what happens to the fight against Voldemort?

It's even better if you figure out the answers to these questions ahead of time so that you can write an actual story with a beginning, middle and end.

EDIT: to delay the onset until Harry's closer to adulthood, you could say that the Riddle/scar part of him didn't wake up until Voldemort possessed him at the end of the Ministry battle. Or perhaps Harry was grabbed by a brain tentacle like Ron, but never told anyone due to evilness awakening.

** I think:

A. This is an overly involved plot for smut. While some measure of build-up is good, the build-up works best when it relates to the developing relationship with the person-to-be-sexed. A "Voldemort's memories" plotline is completely unnecessary for that. It's just going to weigh down the fic.

B. You still don't have a "smut premise" i.e. a unique and interesting way to get two people into a sexy situation. This works best when you use a unique location (e.g. Quidditch showers) or scenario (e.g. Hermione teaching Harry to swim), or at the least a unique personal interaction (e.g. Harry and Pansy).

C. The best smut feels realistic. Authenticity is sexy. Of course, there's a limit beyond which it's no longer smut and has become smut-comedy, but there should at least be a token nod to the practicalities of sex. In particular, it's boring to ignore the partners' sexual experience, personalities, and the actual physical logistics of the damn thing. Your plot seems designed to turn Harry into a sex god overnight. That's just dull. There's none of the joy of discovery to it.

If you haven't read it before, I highly recommend this fic as a good example of well-written smut, both in terms of build-up and the sex itself.

** That doesn't sound like a premise for a smut fic though.

Just a premise for an overpowered main character who seems like he would have barely anything to challenge him.

advice 1 - don't do overpowered MC. If you want to write an MC that is really smart and devious, give him some serious penalties. A good writer can make surviving a day of classes be a thrilling adventure in of itself.

advice 2 - don't just throw in smut scenes simply to have them. Merge smut with plot. Perhaps even try Dues sex machina trope - like MC needs sex because... (random ideas for 'this MC needs smut to live')

a) he found that Voldermort's forays into dark magic inevitably twist the mind to aberrant behavior. Voldermort quickly turned into a violent sadist and not wanting to follow suit, Harry is trying to channel that downside into something harmless - like becoming the most perverted boy in the world. (his knowledge and power is balanced by a steady stream of crazy that keeps subverting his thoughts and plans, often self-sabotaging - unless he takes control and directs those crazy impulses into kinky sexual escapades)

or b) something more simple - Horcrux is useful, but is also a metaphysical concentration of dark, deathly magic that was never meant to be used on a living body, it's killing him by draining his lifeforce and the only consistent way to counter this effect is to constantly excite and channel positive, life-giving energies which happens for magic folk during sex. (this Harry may be smart and powerful, but he literally needs to convince people to willingly sex him up often or he sickens and dies)

or (c) a variant on the first one, turns out Voldermort was a deviant pervert who couldn't go a minute without fantasizing about sex - he went seriously crazy trying to repress his urges. Merging with the horcrux Harry got that aspect of him but is not willing to repeat the same mistake by trying to practice self-prohibition and is instead trying to make it work in a way that will allow him to somewhat function. (you can make MC seriously powerful, but just way too easily distracted by anything remotely related to eroticism - enough to make it a serious problem for him)

********** No, that is not what I'm telling you.

Yes, on both counts, the /craft/ of writing has to be on point to be considered good. Grammar, punctuation,... Thats just standard. But thats not what makes writing good. Those things also have to be on point when you write scientific papers, articles or Birthday cards.

What I am saying is that the /Art/ of writing, of creative writing, is without a doubt where we can see the difference between smut and other fics. Sure, some art theorists would split me in half for saying it, but I hold the opinion that Art that focuses on the higher endeavors of man is above Art that discusses, or merely soothes our primal urges. The objective of smut is just that. An abstract outlet for our urge to have dirty and frequent sex in every form and figure imaginable.

On the other side there are stories who discuss things like power, guilt, revenge,... . Subjects that /require/ vast research in and out of story as well as detailed and thoroughly designed storylines. And heres the kicker. Smut does not require these things to hold its readers. The reader is not reading smut for the plot. Its a nice gimmick there to have a compelling story linking the sex scenes, but it is not required.

But at the end, let me backpedal a bit. I take a well written smut over a shitty drarry fic, as you put it, any day. (Not to mention that a fic that identifies with being written to support a specific relationship first and foremost is already on my shitlist, so theres that.) But Smut will never reach to, lets say, an "Elizium of the Sleepless Souls" for example. Because the moment you make sex the prime objective of your story, you loose what makes good fics, great.

** How about having toms diary found during second year (after being thrown away by Ginny) by an enterprising 15yr old hufflepuff and rather then being subsumed by toms personality, with the power of (self)love he manages to break the entities psyche apart and harvest the remaining shards of his memories.

The now somewhat more mature 15yr old is wiser and a little more wicked, but still being assaulted by teenage hormones and ready to do something about that.

You could also perhaps play on Toms search for immortality started in early puberty and most rituals in fantasy to extend ones life involve giving up the ability to procreate and become asexual, so horniness/lust/love etc actively hurt diary!riddle, after a connection had been made and despite trying to control the hufflepuff it was almost impossible to stop teenage boys doing what they do and he was destroyed.

Cue lots of hookups, dating and misunderstandings as Riddlepuff explores the many paths love and sex can take.
