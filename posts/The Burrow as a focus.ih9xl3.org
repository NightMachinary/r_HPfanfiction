Like the title, I was wondering if there were any fics that really centred around The Burrow, and had it be a big factor in the plot or just as a backdrop. I've been feeling really sentimental about it as a home and I just want to be immersed in it! Not fussed about pairings for this request, just anything with good interior design content!


** I looked at the title and my mind just asked "how does someone use the Burrow instead of wand"?

** I don't know if this might interest you, but it focuses on the construction of the burrow. linkffn(10349064)

  The Better Burrow arc from my Lone Traveler compendium: The Lone Traveler encounters the Burrow before it was expanded. Maybe it can be made into a safer and more comfortable home for this version of the Weasleys. It's amazing how much a building can change history.
