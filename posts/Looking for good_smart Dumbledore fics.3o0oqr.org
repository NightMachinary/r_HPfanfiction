Trying to find fics with Dumbledore mentoring Harry and having more depth than "Harry m'boy", twinkling eyes, and greater good. Stories involving DD as the main character are fine as long as there's no slash.


** I tend to write Dumbledore as smart, wise, benevolent and a tad more ruthless than in canon.

In "Uncle Quentin's Spy", Dumbledore's a main character, using both his diplomacy and skill at magic to keep the Ministry and the Watchers from fighting each other instead of Voldemort, and does his best to keep Harry and co. safe. He's not directly mentioring Harry though. And he gets to show why he's the only wizard Voldemort fears. linkffn(11102515).

In "Patron", he's handling the war against Voldemort with moves and counter moves, and plans that do not rely on coincidences and luck. While he's not on the frontlines, he's still ready to do what's right instead of what's easy, even if it means dirtying his own hands - better him, or so he thinks, to carry that burden, than someone else. Again, not directly mentoring Harry, but he's sharing more with him and Hermione than in canon. Linkffn(11080542)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

** linkffn(Journey through the dark by earl)

This is a fourth year story, and it is not Dumbledore centric. But there is at least one scene where he gives Harry some 'political training', and he was pretty badass there. (And no, there are no 'My Lord' or whatever tropes.)
