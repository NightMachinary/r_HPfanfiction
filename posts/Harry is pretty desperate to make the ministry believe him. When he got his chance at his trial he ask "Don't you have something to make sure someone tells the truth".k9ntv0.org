With the Ministry incapable of denying that Voldemort is back, they give an official statement that the wizarding world is at war again and recruit anyone who has the potential and will to fight against death eater. The security standards get higher and to make it easier to see who is a death eater and who not, everyone in the ministry has to wear short sleeve robes, shirts and so on. They furthermore declare Sirius as innocent.

Dumbledore reveals the prophecy, in a fit of common sense, at the trial and they decide to help Harry, Ron & Hermione, getting stronger through lending them tutors for DADA, Charms, Transfiguration, Potion and fighting tactics. (They know it is inevitable that it is Harry who has to kill Voldemort)

The trio themselves start teaching what they learned to the others in school, even to the Slytherins. They want everyone to be prepared to fight.

What else would change now? How will be the tactic of the ministry to fight against Voldemort? What is with the Slytherins? Will they use the trio to spy for Voldemort? Or is that THE chance for some to get out of the toxic environment they have to endure in Slytherin and help the others to fight with teaching a bit of cunning and resourcefulness?


** I can't really see all of this playing out with not just regular government red tape and the whole veritaserum isn't applicable in court, although I don't know if that last one is canon or fanon. Not to mention that Fudge has his strings pulled by Malfoy, who absolutely wouldn't want things to go that way. Maybe without Malfoy, say later in the year when Malfoy is arrested, that might work, but not when Fudge is desperate to shut Harry up.

*** All we know from canon is that Veritaserum isn't /used/ in the court cases we see (though it is used in Barty Crouch Junior's interrogation in Book 4, that's not a government call), we don't know if it's admissible.

Government red tape, /hell/ yes that'd be an issue. The Minister doesn't want to /admit/ the truth, and his Undersecretary /orders a Dementor attack/ to squash it. I think a plea for Veritaserum would just be framed as negatively as possible - "mistrusting the Ministry? That's treasonous thoughts you're harboring..."

Malfoy is arrested in the same event that /undisputably/ puts the truth out there, which makes it difficult to say whether his arrest would make Fudge more willing to admit things. I think it'd outright take Fudge being out of the picture to get the Ministry to take action earlier - if he was attacked by Barty Crouch Junior before the latter gets outed as impersonating Moody, it might happen.

All of which, of course, is assuming fully canon compliant characters and situations - but this is a /fanfic/ prompt. If this is one of those fanfics where the Head of the DMLE has final say over what happens in court (in absentia of the Chief Warlock), she'd probably overrule Fudge and Umbridge for it if Veritaserum was admissible.

** I'm pretty sure that stuff like veritaserum would work based on what you perceive as true and not a universal truth (made it sound weird but bare with me). I mean if you think it to be true, veritaserum will spill it out. If you don't think it to be true,, veritaserum won't speak it out (consider you 'know' as a fact that Everest is lower than Mt. Fuji, so according to veritaserum Mt fuji is the highest mountain peak as per your truth).

Thus it is easy to fabricate a thought in your mind which you absolutely believe as to be true but in reality its not. That's why veritaserum is not admissible for stuff like these especially when you have magic that can create fake memories and obliviations.

** "Of course Mister Potter. Do you consent using Veritaserum?"

Harry nodded. Quickly, a small wizard came from behind him, and gave him a vial. Harry swallowed and quickly drank it.

"Well, Mr. Potter, let's start with the obvious: what can you tell us about Sirius Black's hiding place?"

**** Just going of canonical Umbridge:

#+begin_quote
  He raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping his mouth tightly closed. Umbridge's smile widened.

  “Good,” she whispered. “Very good. Now then ...” She leaned forward a little. “Where is Albus Dumbledore?”

  “No idea,” said Harry promptly.

  “Drink up, drink up,” she said, still smiling. “Now, Mr. Potter, let us not play childish games. I know that you know where he has gone. You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning. Consider your position, Mr. Potter. ...”

  “I don't know where he is.”

  Harry pretended to drink again.

  “Very well,” said Umbridge, looking displeased. “In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.”

(OOtP, Chapter 28, "Snape's Worst Memory")

She first asks about Dumbledore, than about Black, when she /thinks/ he took Veritaserum. The Dumbledore question wouldn't happen, because Dumbledore didn't flee yet at that time, but the Black question? I bet Umbridge would ask it, if she had the slightest suspicion that he would know.

**** The oaths are a highly exploitable thing, they would likely work based on the user's perception, in canon none of the options you gave would work because they would make fixing conflict too easy. But if you want to write it go ahead.
