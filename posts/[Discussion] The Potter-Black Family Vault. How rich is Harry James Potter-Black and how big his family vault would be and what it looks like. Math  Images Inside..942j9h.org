I have been reading HP Fan Fic for a few months now and one trope or scene that I really want to read that I haven't found yet is a vault scene. I am in the middle of writing my own so it hits all my toe wiggles and needs but basically I want a through trip with maybe his pairing partner or class mates and family members or friends that really shows off how much he has going through gold and items. A trip to basically make everyone wow at how much he has so it sinks in that he really IS THE richest wizard in England

So far from most of the fics I've read the consensus is he is or has the following

- He is the richest wizard.

  #+begin_quote
    Most put the combining vaults of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Potter & The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black into his worth. Each separately might be under malfoy level of rich which is like around 1 billion. When I read stories where they are combined when he gets his Potter-Black lord title and vault condensing they put him not only AS THE richest wizard but he would most likely be in the top 20 of richest person in England.
  #+end_quote

- They give him a low vault number like 23 to maybe signify his family being the 23rd or whatever oldest original family. They also say he has the largest vault for all his gold galleons and family heirlooms, diaries, trunks, clothes, gems, armor, weapons, school books ect.

This brings me to my point. How big is this massive vault. I know in the movies his Trust fund fault is fairly small. Most likely a 5x5 sq foot room or less. I know Bellatrix's fault was more like 4x10 or something maybe larger. Hers held all sorts of valuable items but I personal don't know how much wealth the lestrange vault held and I don't think that was the family vault by any means. Back to our thesis. Lord Harry Potter-Blacks vault is going to be massive. If he is worth as much as people make him out to be putting him as the richest and top in England also that puts him about 2.250 billion as his net worth in pounds. You are going to need a large vault to store over 450 million Galleons. Not only just the gold either you are going to need a very large place for all the Potter-Black heirlooms and items to be stored and looked at, all the art and gosh everything I listed before for both families.

 

The Math Each Galleon is roughly 40mm wide and 3mm thick according to the Harry Potter Gringotts Bank Coin Collection that is officially licensed. Piles of gold are going to varry having larger piles in the center with them flowing down around the big stack so I decided to make cubes of gold. Specifically 3ft by 3ft cubes or 9sq feet cubes. I figure most stacks will at least be 2 feet and the highest at 6 feet. I had 9 sq feet so I made 9 different numbers to give that avg stack a more realistic look and feeling. 2ft, 2.5ft, 3ft, 3.5ft, 4ft, 4.5ft, 5ft, 5.5ft, 6ft

With the size of the coins being 40mm round and 3mm thick you can put about 57.94102 coins per sq foot so I took those coins and put them to the height of the 2ft, 2.5ft, 3ft, 3.5ft, 4ft, 4.5ft, 5ft, 5.5ft, 6ft to get a idea of how tall the piles were and how many coins were in each pile.

2 ft - 609G 2.5 ft - 762G 3 ft - 914G 3.5 ft - 1066G 4 ft - 1219G 4.5 ft - 1371G 5 ft - 1524G 5.5 ft - 1676G 6 ft -- 1828G

So I took the combined total of the cube of galleons and then once I got the number I took a percent off to account for human error of stacking not evenly and throwing coins just to make room for other things. 10,669 High 608,113* -91,216 = 15% Gradiant Loss 516,897 Galleons avg per 9sq foot 57,433 Galleons per sq foot avg aka 5#

Harry has 2,250,000,000 #'s 2,929,687,500 USD

I also Took the remainder of all the decimals and put that into a overflow showing that around gems or items or just stuffed on shelves or in boxes that he ended up having a extra 172 thousand ish Galleons thrown around everywhere. Harry potter is rich and this vault is going to be massive. 2,584,485# per 9sq feet 870.57963 of the 3 The Remainder = 299,609 Galleons aka 1.73889 sq feet or 1.8 = 3 sq feet

870 3x3 cubes of galleons + 3 sq feet of galleons (172,329G/861,645#) on the shelves as the remainder overflow.

 

*Ok-Ok-Ok*

So how big is his vault going to be exactly? .... That's the question because no one really ever talks about it in any fic i've read. First lets talk just about how much space the gold is going to take up all by its self. I am from America so I used a football field as my example. I measured the field, and with a cloth tape measure on the image to make sure i got all the percents right. Spent about 2 hours on it trying to make it right. Not only is the pile of gold in the middle of the vault going to be huge but each cube of 3x3 stacks is going to varry in size for each sq foot of gold pile from 2 ft to 6 ft.

#+end_quote

In this picture you can zoom in and really see the size of it. The gold lines are the pile lines for the gold. If you zoom in on the red box that is what the 3x3 sqft cubes look like, each black line in the red box is a sq foot. The pink line shows how high from 2ft to 6 feet the gold piles will be. Its squeaks in just under 1/7th of the football field. And that's just the pile of Galleons, that doesn't count for the overflow that's on the shelves or in trunks ect. Also all of that is to 100% scale, so if you re watch harry going to his family school trust vault again and then go look at the football field you really get a idea of how filthy sticking rich a Lord Potter-Black would really be. Puts him in the top #20 richest in England and top #300 Forbes richest in America.. Hes Oprah Winfrey rich. Seriously go look at it.

I could imagine his vault being like 1/3 of a football field, or a small convention center dome under the ground. With all the stuff from both family's.. going to need isles for the gold maybe and places to put everything.. you end up with a massive room. And this is why I wanted to do all this because no one really describes the vault in flics and now I'm going back to writing.

Ideas, Comments, Have a Fic to post because they have awesome vault scenes? =D

TLDR: Harry James Potter-Black is Oprah Winfrey Rich and his family vault is probably the size of a small convention center.


** Okay, so I'm unclear from your post on how much you realise this is all made-up fanon. You refer to these as "tropes" which would seem to indicate that you understand it's made up by fanfic writers, but then you describe matters as a "consensus" as if this has some kind of factual weight, rather than just a load of fanfic writers with little imagination copying each other.

So, a few canon reminders:

1. There's no such thing as the Potter "trust vault". The vault we see Harry access in canon is his one and only vault.

2. There's no particular evidence that the Black family were super rich. Moderately wealthy (the term Dumbledore uses in HBP is "a reasonable amount of gold"), yes, but not Malfoy-level by any means. Probably not as much as Harry already had from the Potter inheritance, since the Potter wealth is described by JKR on Pottermore as a "fortune", after which it was "quadrupled". That sounds more than a "reasonable amount" to me.

3. Bellatrix, once she is married, is a Lestrange, not a Black. Harry does not inherit her vault, nor is its size indicative of the size of the Black family wealth.

4. Harry is never referred to as the richest wizard in Britain, nor indeed is he even hinted to be even near the top. He's comfortably wealthy but again, not super rich. Indeed, in PoA it's noted that if he bought a Firebolt, it would mean that he'd struggle to pay for the remaining years of Hogwarts. This is probably an exaggeration but at the very least it shows that he's not rich enough to buy a Firebolt lightly.

Honestly, I would put Harry's wealth at maybe around 5000 galleons before the Black inheritance, and perhaps around 8000 galleons afterwards.

Recall that 1000 galleons was sufficient to start a business, including renting some prime real estate. Prices are different in the magical world - money goes a lot further (which makes sense, as so many basic needs can be supplied by magic). Which in turn makes the "comparison to Muggle wealth levels" analysis quite weak, I think -- even if you were going by the premise that Harry was the richest wizard in Britain.

To make some general points about the magical economy:

One must be careful in assuming that you can translate prices between wizarding and Muggle worlds using the official exchange rate, because purchasing power of currency can be different -- not to mention the host of other economic differences.

Some of those economic differences:

- The wizarding economy is small in absolute terms due to the low population.

- The wizarding economy does not have a banking sector in the sense of banks which create money as Muggle banks do, nor a central bank which prints money. It's true that you can get loans (see: Bagman) but given the nature of wizarding banking as essentially deposit boxes, it is likely that these loans do not expand the money supply because they probably are a literal transfer of cash rather than the crediting of an account with money that did not exist before (as in the Muggle world). It seems that the only way money is created is by the discovery of treasure (and, I suppose, mining). The money supply is therefore extremely stable, meaning there will not be a trend of inflation as in the Muggle world.

- The wizarding economy appears to still be on the gold standard.

- The wizarding economy does not have mass production and is not inclined towards it, given that you cannot automate the enchantment of objects. Innovation is common, but tends to stay on the scale of an individual craftsperson rather than becoming standardised (with a couple of notable exceptions, namely brooms and beauty products).

All these add up to a very stable economy with almost zero inflation and low growth, and a moderately fixed money supply, as well as no "wealth creators" of the kind who in the Muggle world create billions worth of economic value where before there was nothing.

In short, the wizarding economy does not have the capacity for billionaires - the money supply is simply too small. I doubt there's even a billion galleons in circulation. What extremely wealthy individuals it does possess will likely have their wealth tied up in illiquid assets like land. This fits with what we know of the Malfoy family, whose wealth derives from the gift of land given to them by William the Conqueror.

On the other hand, wizards can use magic to satisfy many of their basic needs for themselves. They have no gas or electric bills, no internet or phone bills, potentially no water bills. Because the population size is stable, many of them will inherit homes so they would have no rent or need to buy a house.

In short, the main expense on necessities for most wizards would be food and clothing, and rent for those who do not have a multi-generational home. Most everything else is a relative luxury. That means the majority of their wages will constitute disposable income. This allows wages to be quite low, relative to the Muggle world, while still allowing wizards a high standard of living. It also allows prices for most products to be quite high relative to incomes, because they are luxury goods rather than common necessities.

*** As an aside, although it may just be the Malfoys because of their pre-SoS views about Muggle social class, JKR mentions on Pottermore that some Pureblood families have had great wealth generated in the Muggle economy as well. But there's no way the Blacks would do this from what we know of them.

** this is sort of an aside, but i always preferred the stories where his vault is only enough to pay for his schooling or his fortune gets claimed by the goblins postwar. it just feels more relatable than super rich harry

*** The weird, gross consumerism that gets heaped onto these fics is such a turn off. I get that it's a power fantasy but... blah. I'm so uncomfortable with the whole thing. I'm not even sure uncomfortable is the right word - maybe cringey?

People. Being rich does not make you interesting. In this case, it doesn't even make Harry impressive, as it's always via inheritance rather than any kind of achievement.

** My argument would be this - Harry is as wealthy as necessary to serve the plot.

Yes, the unlimited funds can seem like a cheat. Yes, the convenient DO NOT PLACE HARRY WITH THE DURSLEYS GODDAMMIT line in the mysteriously un-read will is like a brick. Yes, the unusual journal written by Lily Potter (and it is ALWAYS Lily) that has her notes on some esoteric discipline of magic for which Harry remarkably has an affinity can be a crutch.

But if the plot benefits from those details, and they serve the story, then there's no problem.

It's interesting that it's always Lily. Do we even have /any/ idea of what sorts of magic she would be excellent at? I seem to recall her being good at charms, but I've 0 idea if that was fanon or not. And I think Slughorn refers to her as 'one of the brightest I've ever taught'. That doesn't necessarily translate into any neat skills or particular affinities. Hermione is described similarly, and she's more or less just excellent at researching and studying.

Whereas James is, in canon, impressively good at transfiguration. And he has a pretty unique skill in being an animagus.

No idea why I've never read anything where James writes a 'guide to being an animagus' and Harry gets ahold of it somewhere. Unless the guide in question is just Sirius.

Sorry for the double ping you're likely to get- I accidentally posted this on my main account, not my ff one.
