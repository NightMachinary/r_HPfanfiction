** Title: Harry Potter and the Bodacious Bodyguard

Author: MazzyStarShip

Rating: M

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13065793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Bodacious-Bodyguard]]

Something I loved about the original books. Missing in a lot of fanfiction. Is the concept of a group of plucky kids. Overcoming the odds, defeating evil and creating lasting friendships. All while the adults twiddle their thumbs.

I get why there aren't many stories, with this concept. It is really, really, hard to write. Sure, a story can have the right elements. But without solid understanding, of how to portray the adult characters correctly. It quickly becomes a by the numbers, bash fic. No one wants to read that.

Harry Potter and the Bodacious Bodyguard, I feel, gets it just right. The story just oozes this new generation marauders vibe. Of kids facing down evil and doing what is right.

And a bonus on top of all of that. Without spoiling anything. This is my favourite version of Tonks in a long while.

So, try Harry Potter and the Bodacious Bodyguard. I thought it was thoroughly entertaining.

** I'm reading New Blood by Artemisgirl ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13051824/1/New-Blood]]) and really enjoying it. Hermione is a new blood, destined to start a new wizarding family, sorted into Slytherin. Very enjoyable read so far and updating regularly.

** I skimmed through the [[/r/HarryAndGinny][r/HarryAndGinny]] megathread. Lots of the summaries didn't grab my interest, but I did quite like a few.

For lighter reading, there's linkffn(A Friend Indeed by kb0), where Ginny approaches Harry when Ron isn't talking to him after the Goblet incident, leading to them going to the Ball together, and so forth. Ron's redemption is much longer and harder than canon, although he does pull up his socks in the end.

For a much darker read, but very thought-provoking, there's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129228][For Love of Family]] on SIYE, where Harry is attacked on the job and suffers a spinal injury. The villain is seriously creepy, and rehabilitation is a hard road for the Potters. It does have a good ending, eventually.

Oh, and on the flipside, I came across an up-and-coming Harmony fic that does a good job of keeping everyone in character and neither retconning nor bashing. I'll be interested to see whether Ron/Lavender actually works out in the end. linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift).

I've never read anything about Lucissa, but now I want to read more of them! Also I usually tend to read fics about the death eaters who eventually go to the side of good, and it was so refreshing to see the story that walks you through the First War from their POV.

** Pyrite by Geoffaree, third part in a very slytherin Harry series. At first I liked it because it's a slytherin Harry that doesn't immediately go all child politician or mini dark lord. But by the end of first year I started feeling like it was just canon Harry minus the courage, now I'm at the end of second year and it seems like he's lacking courage, willpower and common sense and possibly magical talent compared to canon Harry (which I don't think I've seen before) so kinda unsure of I should continue.

Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge by kmfrank One of those "Harry gets voldemorts memories" fics. It's a pretty okay read.

It's kinda like a classic smart harry meets Master of Death. The fic is an AU where Harry finishes the battle of Hogwarts, learns about serious manipulations, and with Death's helps, goes back in time. It seriously bashes Dumbledore and Ron. It's incomplete, and although it's rated E, so far in the fic there hasn't been any smut content really. I really like classic smart harry ones where he notices the manipulations. Plus HP and Draco are friends. :)

** I'm reading Peace not promised by Tempest Kiro and my godddd it's a fantastic fic it's so bloody good. It's like 600,000 words++ and still ongoing and honestly since I started reading it I can't put my bloody phone down, there's mostly no cliffhangers or anything but they keep making the story so engaging and interesting that I can't help but keep reading it. This fic makes me wish I had no responsibilities and could just sit down the whole day just to read it, any free time I get I'm reading this fic. I feel like the author keeps true to the characterizations and I love how they developed the side characters they are awesome. The relationship dynamics between Snape and lily is so well developed, doesn't make them into perfect characters, they have their flaws and the author gradually shows them growing into themselves. I love the alternating POVs and how the author delves deep into their thoughts and motivations, that's what makes me love this fic. And of course the details they put into the hogwarts subjects esp alchemy omg I've never read anything like that I'm so astounded on how complex all of it sounds, a bajillion kudos to their effort. Honestly I just love every single aspect of this fic and I really don't know how to express it it's just so amazing and I love it ansjsjwjsjjdd

I love Snape's characterisation throughout the story. Obsessively devoted, as canon asserts he is, yet oh so flawed. While still being clever, and patient, and hardworking. And proud, too proud to easily be helped and healed, and abrasive, and resentful. But being back in Lily's life brings him too much happiness for him to remain entirely hard-hearted.

I'm glad that it's only on a minor cliffhanger right now. There could have been much worse places to stop.

** Started reading Harry Potter and the Twisted Timeline, and it's surprisingly good once you get passed the world building opening.

The first five or so chapters are honestly jarring to the point where I almost quit. It's a lot of information to get through with characters having new/swapped last names, mixed up houses, relationships that are just odd. I love a really long story, so I pushed through hoping that it was just a sloppy info dump, and it was worth it.

Once it gets into actual story, things start falling into place. The weirdness is explained as a butterfly effect of something changing the time line. The more I read, the more I get sucked in.

  First in Series. A return to the past fic. Manipulative Dumbles, Harry's got a BWL twin, Eventual Sort of Mentor Severus. Everything's going to change from the canon we know and love.

**** Looks like it's on hiatus now, though :|. I'm not sure about starting something so big if it won't be finished.

I do follow With This Ring (not HP), which is even longer and has been going since 2013, but that one is still actively updating, not quite the same.
