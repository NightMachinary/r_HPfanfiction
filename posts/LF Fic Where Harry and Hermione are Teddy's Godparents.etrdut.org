:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok so I'm looking for a Fic and I thought it may have been Meet the God Parents [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7207871/1/Meet-The-Godparents]] (It wasn't)

What I remember: Harry and Hermione are Teddy's Godparents, Andromeda just died (I think). Tonks and Remus leave memories which let them know Teddy is in Danger. Prophecy (I think) that states because Teddy is the son of a Werewolf and metamorphmagus he's real rare.

I remember a scene where Hermione and Harry are in a cabin, its raining and Ron comes by for some reason.

Lots of people hunting them because of Teddy.

If you guys could help this would be sick, been after this fic for a while and can't remember it.

:D


** You might want to post this in [[/r/HPHarmony][r/HPHarmony]]. From your description it might be a Harmony fic and they might know about it.
