A lot of terrible crap has been going on in my family health-wise so I'm looking for a distraction. Throw a short story prompt in my face; it'll be appreciated.

I can do most characters well (Weasley twins are tricky but doable) and all genres are okay. However, I won't do smut. I don't have the experience in that sort of writing. It will undoubtedly suck.

If this is against the rules, I'll remove it.

EDIT: I was not expecting this many responses. Thank you guys! I'll try my best to get to them all. ðŸ˜Š Unfortunately, it might take a bit due to how many prompts I received (some are fairly detailed) and my laptop keyboard got fried.


** After the Battle of Hogwarts, the Shacklebolt Ministry rectifies many oversights of previous administrations as to the guilt or innocence of various wizards and witches. As such, it has been decided to rescind the Order of Merlin originally given to Peter Pettigrew. Someone has to inform his mother as to why.

'Someone' in this case, is junior Auror Ron Weasley.

** The prophecy specifically calls out the one with the power the Dark Lord knows not having a loyal subordinate of immense magical power, raised as a brother to the Chosen One, and passed over until his hour of need.

Nobody knows what to make of this until Dudley Dursley's Smeltings Academy field trip to Little Hangleton toward the end of his fourth year starts getting weird when they pass by the old graveyard.

After Cedric's death and Harry's less than empathetic behavior during their ill-fated romance, Cho Chang begins to undertake various activities to take her mind off her grief. As time passes, she develops an inner calmness that cannot be shattered.

Little does Cho know of the prophesied fate awaiting her, for the Dark Lord must be vanquished by the Cho-Zen One.

** A rewrite of the epilogue where "Harry" is actually Dumbledore who took possession of Harry's body in the Forbidden Forest (during the /King's Cross/ chapter in DH). He thinks about the steps he took to ensure that Ron and Hermione are "happy", Malfoy is "redeemed" and that his dear Severus is honored as he should be.

And that, in the end, /all was well/, no matter that the small and now easy to ignore voice of the boy in his head was screaming in despair.

** Don't worry, you're breaking no rules that I know of!

How about... hm... I know! The Brazilian Boa Constrictor returns to Britain to congratulate Harry after the Battle of Hogwarts, having struck it rich in Brazil and integrated himself into the magical community there (more or less), which isn't as prejudiced against snakes and Parselmouths as Britain. People freak out when a large snake with a bunch of attachÃ©s strolls through Diagon Alley, assuming it's Lord Voldemort coming back somehow. Things ensue.

** Luna helps create the Nargle uprising and takes of the ministry of magic to become the new minister.

Pairings or not are up to your discretion but I don't picture them to be necessary in length.

You can determine the length but it mustn't be less than 3000 words (if a short story is much longer than that then by all means write more).

This is of course if you choose this prompt.

Let this thread know when you publish a story!

Cheers.

Only, after dealing with Voldemort, it turns out that even the worst of the worst in their society just aren't that big of a threat. At least to them. No one else is quite sure how to react to this.

** Lily & James's sacrifices combine to endow baby Harry with powerful protection against death, turning him into an instinctual phoenix animagus (or, maybe a benedictus? Opposite of a maledictus?).\\
Raised by a choir of wild phoenixes, on his eleventh birthday (in two senses, given phoenix rebirths) Harry is located by Hagrid and successfully convinced to come to Hogwarts to learn human magic.

But, there's a catch; Harry's entire adopted family of phoenixes is coming along too. We're gonna need a bigger Owlery.

Consider the following scenes:\\
* Harry is bright and cheerful and quite intelligent, but he hasn't learned to read and write yet. How do the various professors handle this obstacle?\\
* Harry's family, the choir of phoenixes, are quite interested in Quidditch matches, and Lee Jordan thinks it'd be awesome to have them play. How does a flying phoenix match up to a Seeker on a Nimbus 2000?\\
* Professor Quirrell and Voldemort are made more than a bit uneasy by the presence of so many phoenixes, but they can't just abandon their plan to get the Philosopher's Stone. Or maybe they can; how do the two adapt their plan to get Voldemort a new body?
