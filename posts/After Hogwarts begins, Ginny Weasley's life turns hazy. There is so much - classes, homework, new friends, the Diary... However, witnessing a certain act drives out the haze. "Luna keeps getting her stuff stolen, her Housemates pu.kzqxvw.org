** "Murder."

"What?"

"Murder. Or set their things on fire."

"Tom what the fuck."

"I used to bring my own bullies to this one super cool cave full of corpses, if you have a free weekend you could try to Floo them there, I set up a chimney and everything. My side grotto ended up pretty cozy."

"Tom I swear to Gandalf."

** Going straight to murder sounds over the top. Original Tom only started murdering in fifth year, after all. I bet there's all sorts they could try before murdering anyone.

On the other hand, Tom was "making people do what he wanted" before Hogwarts, so his advice for a first year might be more like, "do accidental magic", which isn't helpful.

I read a fic where Pansy comes across Luna with no shoes and gets frustrated with her for being so passive about it, so teaches her to hex the shoes to bite anyone trying to steal them. Maybe Ginny could do that sort of thing?

**** If you mean "source": I think the bit with Pansy was in Coven, and Tom being able to get people to do what he wants was something he said to Dumbledore in one of the memories in HBP.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. Plot takes a while to appear but it's there) See last chapter for fan art and translations.
