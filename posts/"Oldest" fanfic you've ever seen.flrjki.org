By that I mean, story that takes place the most years before canon. So founders era is 1000 years ago, Herpo the foul is older than that (I think?), etc. Any HP in the time of the dinosaurs?


** The earliest HP fics I've ever seen are ones that focus on the Founders well before they created Hogwarts, and delved deeply into who they were. It was kind of cool to see them fully fleshed out and shown as humans rather than plot devices.

** Well, I suppose [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/][A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh]], its not all in chronological order but significant portions of the story take place during the height of the Egyptian empire more than 5,000 years ago.

** 1. linkao3(7155281) is from the time of the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, and a nice little story it is.

2. [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil by celticbard]] is from the Puritan Massachusetts around the time of the Salem witch trials. Not that early, but really good story ;).

3. [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]] is from the year 382 BC, and it is really nice story about the discovery of magic and the real founding of London.

4. Confusingly, almost same named [[http://www.mugglenetfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=93428][Makers of Fine Wands by CanisMajor]] is from the Ancient Athens in 382 BC, with the founder of the Ollivander's family meets with Plato and everything related to that era. Very much unfinished, unfortunately.

  The year is CE 476. Cenau Redhair is a very long way from home, and she's in prison. While she doesn't want to die in front of the crowds at the Flavian Amphitheatre, escape seems impossible. Does her friend Rhea the falcon have a plan? This is a story of the early days of magic, long before the founders.

** Story: Basilisk-born [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411]]

Starts in 1995, but Harry time travels back to the time of Merlin. I don't exactly remember how far back was that, but it was pretty ancient.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?

** I know of the amulet of time series, where, in the first book Harry travel back to the founders, then to WWII/Grindelwalds war in the second book, the first wizard of war in the third book, back to their own time in the fourth book, and then travels back to the time to ancient Egypt in the fifth book. The last one is unfortunately not done, and last updated in 2005, the one who is â€˜oldest' in the series
