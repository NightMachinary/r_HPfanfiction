** The Arithmancer and its sequel, Lady Archimedes both focus more on magic itself than canon. Hermione solves problems through the power of spellcrafting and maths.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

This is a very popular fic so you might've read it, but its exactly what you want. The magic is all canon compliant but delves much more into it.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
