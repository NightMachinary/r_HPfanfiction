** Damn I thought there was a new chapter again! You're a tiny bit late but thanks anyway.

Someone made post about this update the day it came out. If you don't have one, make an account to follow it's easier if you read a lot of different fanfics

#+begin_quote
  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.
