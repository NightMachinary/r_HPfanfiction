** If you don't feel the need to read fan fiction and drink heavily in mid January then we approach life from very different places.

For the drinking I'm going to recommend Absinthe, but I'm going to be a horrid, uncouth American and recommend the fire ritual instead of the traditional one. Get a glass that you don't mind having a little fire inside of it. Above the glass on your absinthe spoon (or on the tines of a fork if you don't own one) place a sugar cube. Pour 2 oz. absinthe over the sugar cube into the glass. Have 2-4 oz cold water ready to hand. Light the sugar on fire (don't use the tip of the match, let it burn down a bit and use the flaming wood). Watch it until the sugar starts melting, bubbling, and dripping down into the glass, then dump the sugar into the glass. Admire your flaming creation for a brief moment, then add the water. Stir it up, fill with ice, and drink up. It only recently became legal to produce absinthe using the traditional methods again, and there are many fine outfits who have been churning out wonderful products since then. I think my favorite is Combier's Absinthe Jade 1901, but I own quite a few and really they're all nice for larping that you're Hemingway in Paris. Assuming you can handle the strong anise and fennel flavor, I rate it 1/1

For the fan fiction, I haven't read too much this week. As usual on Wednesday a new chapter of Loose Cannon by manatee-vs-walrus has come out. It's still a wonderful story, and really improves my Wednesday nights. Post-DH canon compliant (no epilogue), and filled with funny scenes, interesting characters (both OC and canon), and excellent emotional moments. It's a really great one, and I can't recommend it enough (even though I will recommend it every Wednesday until it's complete). 1/1

I also started but did not finish a fic confusingly titled Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by AidanChase on AO3. This is part 1 of the Harry Potter: Everyone Lives AU, and as the title suggests most people who died are still alive. Peter Pettigrew had a change of heart and sacrificed himself to protect the Potters, so Voldemort is gone but James, Lily, and Harry are alive and well. The issue I have is that everything still plays out exactly as it does in canon. Harry is friends with kids before Hogwarts, but on the train he sits with Ron (who he doesn't know) instead of his actual friends and basically beat for beat reenacts canon from that moment onward. Partway through first year the author switches to, if a chapter would just be a straight recap, having it summarized in the letters Harry sends home about the events. While that switch helped some, I still felt like A) it was a tremendous waste of time, and B) the chapters that weren't summarized in letters still played out exactly the same as canon. It's so frustrating to see an AU where Harry's life was completely different pre-Hogwarts in such a way that he would be a completely different person, and yet somehow he still has exactly the same personality and goes through the exact same events. The author makes a few attempts to justify keeping things the same in A/Ns, but the justifications felt completely shallow and blatantly fucking wrong every time. Just a frustrating waste of time that I spent way too long reading hoping it would get good. I wish my scale wasn't binary so I could give it a lower score, but I don't make the rules, I just follow them. 0/1

linkao3(1746629)

As a palate cleanser for that waste of time, I reread an actually inventive fic, The Many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT. I love this fic for taking an AU concept and running with it to the end. If you like Worm, ShayneT's Worm fics are also mostly good (I didn't care for the Magneto one so much, but A Wand for Skitter, the HP crossover, is excellent). But anyway, TMDoHP has the premise that every time Harry dies he resets to an early time in his life. It's an AU where the forces of evil are much more active, so he gets killed a lot early on. This forces him to train, work hard, learn a lot, and become very paranoid and ruthless. It's a really fun, different take on the story. The only downside is that the author seems to forget earlier details of the story as they are going. As an example, Harry meets Rita Skeeter in third year when he is trying to get the dementors removed from Hogwarts, but then in fourth year when he is at the wand weighing ceremony the author appears to forget this fact and Harry all of a sudden has never met her. Still in spite of a few continuity errors like that, a long complete time travel fic where the MC actually makes use of their time travelled knowledge is a rare and wonderful thing, and if you haven't read it you should check it out. A very solid 1/1.

*** I feel the same way about fics that just rehash canon. What the hell is even the point? Why would an author just rewrite an existing story, beat for beat? It's just the original story, but worse, with a few extremely minor cosmetic changes added on. I can't stand that, especially when the premise is really interesting.

I really should have known, but I try to give people on this sub's recommendations an honest chance.

The worst for me is time travel stories where the time travelers decide they can't change anything. I just don't see the point of the story if you aren't going to use the premise.

I remember one where the characters (Harry and Ginny, maybe others too) went back to first year, but they decided that they needed the sword of Gryffindor to be imbued with basilisk venom, so they invent some new Uber-occlumency that will enable Ginny to still be the heir of Slytherin while hiding her future self from the diary. Such a waste of time. If it's that important just time travel back to the third book instead of the first. Or do something smart to get the sword coated in venom anyway. Literally the last thing you should do is voluntarily fight a basilisk.

This, so much!! I read one once where Hermione had to go back in time to year 1, and the thing she wanted to change was in the */final battle!!/* So she couldn't change anything out of fear of butterflies. Other than that, it was actually a good story, but to get through it, I had to force myself to read it with the headcanon that this was just a Ravenclaw!Hermione (I think) AU where she didn't have future knowledge. It came up so rarely that I often forgot about her future knowledge, which worked well for my enjoyment of the story. But yeah. What the hell is the point of giving your character future knowledge if they are just going to stand around and watch the same shit happen? They are sure to change some stuff just by accident, so you might as well just have them use their knowledge to solve problems a different way from canon from the start. Rereading canon, except through the lens of someone agonizing about all the bad shit they're deliberately allowing to happen, is not fun!

****** God, I can't even imagine that shit. Do you think that people who write those 100k words of “oh geez, I better protect the timeline by doing nothing” angst have read another fic that did that, and if so, did they set out to reproduce it? Like do people actually like that stuff, and we're the weird ones for hating it?

And yeah, I don't write shit, and if it did it would probably be even worse, so I'll just say for anyone about to come at me for being mean to people who actually contribute something to the community: I know I'm a worthless, drunk, sack of shit who adds nothing to this community.

******* I do think that's about what happens, yeah. Like, 90% of time travel stories involve the main character attempting not to change things, so that they continue to know what's going to happen next. Which is valid if done well- the decent ones will have the main character changing small things but trying to keep large events the same, until making some drastic act and completely changing everything.

That said, there is one absolutely haunting fic where Harry goes back in time and changes absolutely nothing, because it was an accident and "bad things happen to wizards who meddle with time" . It's just a one shot though, so much less frustrating than reading a longfic with that premise.

The best, however, are when time travel fics change things and something goes wrong. Somewhere out there is a fic where Harry is redoing Hogwarts and when the dementors show up at the quidditch match during 3rd year, a stampede happens and a student dies. Since it didn't happen in the original timeline, Harry feels all this guilt about it being his fault (Something he changed led to that result and he doesn't even know what) but since no one knows he time traveled he can't explain why he feels so guilty about it.

So yeah, I agree, time travel fics that are basically just canon rehash are duuuuumb

****** That sounds like Six Pomegranate Seeds, which I actually enjoyed despite the fact that Hermione was spending time trying to avoid making any large impacts on stuff and not interacting with the trio (and especially not with her non time traveled self). It helped that most of the stuff she was getting up to wasn't connected to what the trio was doing, and you can kind of take it as a different perspective on bits of canon that weren't shown.

** Read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387?view_adult=true][ATYD]]. It's genius, deserves the hype. ‘Nuff said-it's been mentioned a lot here.

Read the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/84554][Years of the Rat']] which is Pettigrew turning traitor. It's very good, and I thought including the different definitions of ‘rat' was clever. Short, though.

After being in Marauder-world I thought reading about the kids would feel like a step-down. But then I stumbled on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2009130/16/Harry-Potter-and-the-Battle-of-Wills][“Harry and the Battle of Wills”]] in this sub. It's quite good, not the best fic I've ever read but I *would* recommend it. Harry feels canon-like but it's a nice Hogwarts ensemble piece. However a big flaw is its tendency to lapse into patterns: for ex, adults tell Harry not to do something dumb/Harry does it anyway/Harry gets scolded/Harry promises not to do it again but does it anyway. Rinse, repeat. Harry faints a lot-for good reason-but there are points where he seems to wake up in the hospital wing in every other scene.

It's quite a serious fic but there's a funny scene where the kids tease Ron about quoting a book--it's not Ron bashing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2009130/11/Harry-Potter-and-the-Battle-of-Wills][Ch. 11]] about halfway down. I wish this scene were in canon although it'd be OOC.

** Read linkao3(Harry Potter And The Firestarter) An ongoing WBWL story with an actual valid premise. Other WBWL writers take notes. The writing itself is good but characterization feels mediocre. Harry is a bit of a manipulative sociopath who lies and misdirects when it is profitable. First fic where the other twin is more likeable. His twin Willow is essentially an unabused!fem!canon!Harry. Zero Bashing.

LINKFFN(Devil take the hindmost) Fem!Harry who grows up with wraith!Voldemort in her head since the age of three. Surprisingly fluffy for the premise. One of the most Sane/Competent Voldemorts in the fandom. Gets a bit darker later on. Probably abandoned sadly. I love the interactions between them.

Linkao3(How Fred and George Accidentally Befriended a Wannabe Dark Lord) Twins find the diary. Highly recommended. Light-hearted Weasly twin Shenanigans meets Moody teen Dark lord. The part where Harry accidentally sets the basilisk on random students is creative. Loads of original ideas.

Linkffn(Never A Monster He Couldn't Love) A Fantastic Beasts cross with Tolkien's Silmarillon. Some background required specifically the tale of The Sons Of Feànor. Beautiful characters and prose. Newt and Maglor are well written. A unique appearance by Dumbledore just after Grindelwald's defeat.

  Fred opened the book and began to write. He only got a few words down before the diary absorbed them, the ink vanishing without a trace, prompting George to lean in closer to observe.“Maybe this is some elaborate joke on Ginny's part to educate us on proper brotherly behaviour?” George mused, just as new words began to appear on the empty page. Well, that seemed a bit ambitious for a first year...‘Hello. To whom might I be writing?' Or: The Weasley twins are the ones to obtain Tom Riddle's diary.

** I've been binging all of *TheDivineComedians* work. Holy crap that author is something else. They focus mostly on Sirius and Remus and the struggles each faced in their various situations. Their Regulus is also my absolute favourite version of Regulus. Royal and cocky and caring and wonderful!

Reading their stories is like doing a jigsaw puzzle. All of them are subtely linked so its really fun to get see all the little peices slot together. I cannot recommend this author enough!! This is the story of the mystery why Sirius can see thestrals linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]])

I also read *Break by K1toftheworthies (Kittheworthy)*. Which is a look at what Remus and Sirius did during the 12 years Sirius was imprisoned. A few dark moments. Wonderfully written by jumping from time point to time point and the buildup to when their stories collide is totally worth is. It took me a bit to get into it but it was worth it. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5252627/chapters/12651236]])

** Per [[/u/Lantana3012][u/Lantana3012]] ‘s [[https://reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/kwfyoe/what_are_you_reading_weekly_post/gj4ifmd][comment]] from last week, I have completed linkffn(8045114), A Marauder's Plan. (Though I did read it on AO3 as that is my preferred platform.)

I agree for the most part - perfect Harry Potter abounds and some preeeeetty cliche tropes definitely make their way into the story. I admittedly did skim parts of it due to the cliches - it was just very easy to see what was going to happen next. The writing was excellent and it was an easy read, especially because the good guys win, so there is a decent amount of satisfaction at the end of the story.

On AO3, the author also includes a “commentary” fic as the next work, which explains a bit of the thought process behind decisions, the plot, etc. I admittedly did not finish this (despite it being only 6k words) because of how many tropes made up the story in the first place. I didn't really see the need to read into plot point when they were so tropey that they didn't need explanation.

All in all, decent read. I enjoyed it as an easy, guilty-pleasure type of story.

(Side note: the new Reddit scheduler posts these from my account, not AutoMod. Which means that I get notifications every time y'all recommend a story. I don't have time to read all of these good fics!!!)

But hey, that's the point of subreddits like this-different perspectives.

** I finished rereading linkffn(thé à la grenouille), which I hadn't read in so long that I could hardly remember what it was about. It was okay. The premise is very good, but it's not a very exciting read. There's a relative lack of energy in the fic, a problem that marred my enjoyment. The dialogue while natural sounding is punctuated by far too telling in between. Instead of a whole conversation the author will write out some of the character's thoughts frequently in between the dialogue. The rest of the writing also doesn't feel exciting or filled with energy. I didn't feel a sense of wonder Harry should have felt seeing magic for the first time, nor the full extent of his frustration while trying to learn French. Descriptions of things often seem too calm too. The First Task in this story is pretty much the Third Task, and when he realises that he just wasted time on the sphinx's riddle for a tunnel that was just a loop the writing doesn't convey much feeling. It tries to go for him being focused and calm but irritated, but the emotion feels a bit dampened. A lot of characters also are very focused on honour, which is a bit annoying to read about when it's a big focus for them yet again, feels lacking in energy when described. I guess my big problem with this fic is lack of energy. Similar complaint to how I felt about Harry is a Dragon and that's Okay that I once complained about long ago. I'd give it 7/10.

*** Argh I thought I could enjoy it but being French I can't help but cringe really hard at certains things. Sucks, it seem to be an interesting premise.

***** I read a few chapters and the French is actually quite good ! It's grammatically correct but sometimes convoluted, like everyone is referring to others as « Lords ». It's just one of my pet peeves, when the story considering the time period and culturally is very awkward. But frankly most should enjoy the story just fine, it's just that it kinda slow paced and lack energy/excitement in the writing.

  In which Harry goes to Beauxbâtons instead of Hogwarts. Butterfly effects ensue, with Voldemort reviving without opposition from Harry, Dumbledore trying to save the situation and Fudge making everything worse. Meanwhile, Harry learns French.

** Hi,

I'm looking for a fanfiction. It was about hermione and severus snape. In the fic they are kidnapped (I think sev was kidnapped first and than hermione). They end up in a cell together and they find comfort with eachother and have sex etc. They are always in the dark, they are there for a couple of months, they get tortured, i'm pretty sure Draco saves them. It is after the second war. They are saved, but they are kept separate. I dont know the rest because the fic was not finished yet. I really want to read it again though.

Lucius tasks Draco with a special mission: "You will seduce the Granger girl. I don't care how you do it, I don't care how long it takes. Tell her you renounce your family, tell her you want no part in the Dark Lord's plan...tell her you need her help. You will make her love you Draco. You will win her trust, and then she will lead us to Potter.”

(latest chapter just posted)
