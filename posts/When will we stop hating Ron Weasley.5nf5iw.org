So recently I got interested in Ron-centric fics. Ron-Bashing has never really bothered me. I never enjoyed it but I tolerated it as it was something the author chose to do. Now don't get me wrong I usually dislike any sort of bashing in sub-par fics but if I see a story that is decent enough and it contains bashing I don't really mind. If the story is very well written and the author does a good enough job at making us dislike Ron, then I also take out my pitchfork and start screaming for his head. But that's rare. Usually the author jumps the gun and suddenly Ron is worse than a death eater.

Lately if I see any sort of bashing I just stop reading. My questions is, Have I grown up? /Gasp/

No, that's not the question..

Why hasn't bashing gotten old and especially in regard to Ron? He is a main character. People have woven bashing into the plot of their stories. Truly shocking because it's such a shame. Kinda sounds hypocritical coming from someone who just said he didn't mind reading bashing but really, I read because it's out there. My opinion is that it's considerably easier to bash the characters rather than build them up.

“Dark times lie ahead of us and there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right. -Albus Dumbledore”

And it would be great if you could recommend Ron-centric fictions. If he's in Slytherin or interacting with them. Bonus.


** Ron represents a lot of qualities that people hate in themselves. Laziness, envy of others, less intelligent (than Hermione). It's easy to go overboard when bashing things you want to change about yourself.

** Ron was the boy brave enough to sacrifice himself for his friends in book 1, risking his life against his greatest fear in book 2, and standing on a broken leg to defy a supposed mass-murderer to protect his friends. And then... he stopped shining. Fans took his falling out with Harry in 4th year and his leaving in book 7 and exaggerated it. It didn't help that the movies stole many of his best lines too. And of course, some authors think that Ron needs to be bashed for a Harry/Hermione relationship to work.

I like Ron, and I tend to write him as a good guy, usually a hero, in my stories. He's a central character in my story "The Dark Lord Never Died".

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** The reason why there is so much Ron hate in the fandom is because the vast majority of people are like Ron, the everyday, "normal" guy. We aren't satisfied with that, so we "strive" to be someone "better" and more "exceptional", like Harry or Hermione. It took me a long while to realize it, but Ron hate mostly is about fundamental insecurity with one's situation in life.

However, it's not like the films don't have their share of the responsibility. Before the advent of the films in 2001, Ron was pretty much Hermione in terms of their popularity. Everyone simply loved Ron, and being an H/Hr shipper and a Ron lover was not mutually exclusive as it is pretty much the case now. But bit by bit, the films put his popularity into question, particularly with PoA and GoF, where Ron's characterization is placed in a much more negative light (Ron's reaction to Snape calling Hermione a know-it all, Hermione saying "kill us before you get to Harry" instead of Ron, etc.).

** I used to gloat over Ron bashing when I started reading fanfics.

One key reason why so many Book readers hate Ron was because he abandoned his friends during the worst of times. I was pretty upset about that too until my reread, and I now think his leaving was mostly caused by the Locket Horcrux. Just minutes after taking that thing off, Ron regretted his decision, but then he ran into a snatcher squad and was held up. By the time he got free, Harry and Hermione already left and their protections were too good for Ron to find them again.

It was Harry who got that brilliant idea to wear a Horcrux around their necks in the first place. It was utterly insane IMO. Why the other two didn't object was beyond me. Harry had as much to blame for Ron leaving as Ron himself, and he seemed to feel partially guilty about that. In the subsequent weeks, he was constantly worrying that Hermione would leave him as well.

*** Honestly, it's Harry's behavior in the whole affair that seems strange, and not just in deciding to wear the locket around their necks. If Ron was really influenced by the locket, it's excusable, but Harry is the once who claims otherwise:

Hermione: You wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

Harry: Yeah, he would...D'you think I didn't guess you were thinking this stuff?

So Harry actually believes the worst of Ron in-story. But then, when Ron comes back, Harry does his whole forgive him on the spot routine like he did in Book 4. (Admittedly, Ron did just save his life):

Ron: He must've known I'd run out on you.

Harry: No, he'd must've known you'd always want to come back.

So Harry is.../still/ believing the worst of Ron, in a way. He /knows/ Ron is a flake and forgives him anyway, as opposed to recognizing that it probably was the locket influencing both of them given that Ron wanted to come back immediately upon leaving its influence.

Ron leaving hurts when you read it for the first time--and the second time, in my experience. It's easy to lose sight of the fact that he's a mostly good guy who's probably not in his right mind despite what Harry says and keep on hating him after that, which I suspect is why so many people bash him.

I agree, people tend to side with what the protagonist is thinking at any particular point of time even if objectively it is wrong or biased. The fact that Harry kept hating Ron after he left instead of considering how they got there in the first place doesn't make me sympathetic towards Harry to be frank.

**** Looking back it definitely seems weird. How could have Dumbledore known. It was simply too specific, he gives him a device that can teleport him back to his friends. Weird. No matter how well you know someone, can you really predict their actions. And what if Ron had never left? The delluminator was obviously a contingency so in the case of never leaving Harry and Hermione, Dumbledore's gift to him would become useless.

So Harry got the sword and snitch. Both useful items to help him with the quest. Hermione got a book about the Deathly Hallows. Another useful item.

AND Ron got a device that is only useful for switching lights on and off in the case he never leaves his friends.

#+end_quote

Hermione overcomes her authority worship over the series, at least partly.

I've seen a Hermione (specifically, /Voyage of the Starship Hewidg/) where she's a good analyst but lacks creativity. Luna fulfils the creative role in that story, which provides a reasonable balance.

Having Ron be the creative person would be another opportunity to make him more useful. However, that would require a lot more work on the author's part: you have to make situations where they come across a problem, Ron can imagine a solution, and Hermione can turn it into reality. You have to come up with a reasonable setup for them to have that interaction. And, for canon, they'd have to do that in front of Harry.

It's totally doable, but it's a lot easier to go with the tropes.

#+end_quote

Yes, Hermione suffers from her flaws. It's her bossiness that drives her to be an outcast during the first year. Which leads her to the bathroom attach where she almost dies. She suffers from her 'stubborn thirst for knowledge' in the third year where she ends up sick from fatigue. Her utter dependence on her logic doesn't allow her to believe Harry when he tells her that Draco is a Death Eater, no matter how many times he tells her - leading to a disastrous sixth year.

Yes, Harry suffers from his flaws, more than his two friends. He has always been stubborn and he is so independent (fault of his childhood) that he almost always refuses to ask help from adults. Which ends with his godfather being killed. He's so stubborn that he doesn't listen to Ron when he tells him that the name Voldemort is taboo-ed which leads to their capture and Hermione's torture plus Dobby's death.

It's ironic that in an attempt to fight against Ron-bashing, you start bashing Harry and Hermione.

I think some people just could not accept Ron's flaws and instead pretended his friends had no flaws. Harry made plenty of bad decisions due to his reckless and stupidity and yet he was almost never called out on it by the fandom. Other examples would be his stupid and reckless behaviour at the Ministry in DH that lead them to losing the Grimmauld Place as a home and his insistence on everyone wearing the Hocrux. There is also the fact that Harry was the only one who casted the Cruciatus curse and everyone seemed to be OK with it?

** Oh baby:

Hundreds of years ago, a dark wizard placed a curse on the Weasley family, for reasons still unknown.

This curse originally was thought to have no effect; and indeed, it had no physical one. It's effect was on a much greater scale.

You see, this dark wizard was aware of fanfiction. His spell was designed for a singular purpose... the Weasley family must be bashed in fanfiction.

Very few authors are able to escape this curse, for it was so powerful it never deteriorated. It stayed at full strength for years, never ceasing in its quest to bash of Weasley family.

Ronald himself, however, is a strange case. Originally he was born without the curse. Bashing? Never affected him. But, an evil author created what is currently known as... Lord Potter!

This creation brought back the curse a hundred-fold, and only the most powerful authors escape!

** While a lot of people will want to be righteous and talk about how Ron is just the everyday person who couldn't hack it anymore for one brief moment when he runs out on Harry and Hermione in TDH, Horcrux influence, jealousy, injury, etc. How bashing is us trying to excise the parts of ourselves that we don't like by using Ron as a scapegoat... The truth is a little more complex. Ron is the representation of betrayal and the tendency in human nature to take the easy path in Harry's generation, in James'/Lily's generation that was Peter, and to a lesser extent Severus. JKR's writing is filled to the brim with cyclical themes and representational characters, Ron is no exception. That's not to say he ONLY represents those things. But in at least the contexts of GOF and TDH he represents the worst parts of human nature, and while he's not the only one to do so (the entire school bar Hermione turns against Harry in GOF and arguably the country turns against him in TDH.), he is the one closest to the issue who does. To then compare him to Hermione, Harry's other close friend, or Ginny, his canon love interest, it paints him in a particularly bad light.

Hermione never truly abandons Harry, even in HBP when she's rowing with him about the potions book, Draco, etc, she's still his friend. She and he still have a close relationship as evidenced multiple times by the way they comfort each other in a way harry never does with any male in the series, or even Ginny, who is mostly auxiliary to the plot.

Ginny, while as I mentioned is a tertiary character, is also perhaps the most loyal of any of Harry's contemporaries, even more-so than Hermione. There's never a significant argument between the two in canon (I've not read the cursed child so I can't speak for post the original saga) she doesn't once question him, or doubt him in any way, even when he 'breaks up' with her at the end of HBP she already knew it was coming, braced herself for it, and even while he was breaking her heart she supported him. The only time she ever even shies away from him (barring weird moments where a teenage girl would flinch around her crush for other reasons) is in COS when she's been unwittingly consorting with his mortal enemy.

I don't particularly like the Harry/Ginny ship for reasons best left out of this thread, but it can never be argued that she wasn't good for him in canon. I've seen a few people argue that she has no personality, but it could be argued that her personality is simply less bombastic or assertive than the rest of the characters in the series. her personality can be described as infinitely loyal, supportive and fierce, willing to do whatever she can to stick up for those she cares for, and to stick up for herself. She neatly avoids being a damsel in distress by removing herself from dangerous situations, or scrapping her way out of them with a desperate ferocity often seen in passionate women.

Now contrast all this with Ron, who for all intents and purposes is a relatively funny but lazy and flaky friend. He's not particularly magically gifted, and as far as I know there's only a handful of instances, even in the books, of him actually achieving anything with a wand or his mind. And those moments are noted as being particularly rare.

It sucks to think it, but Ron is a below average human being. He scrapes through school mostly on Hermione's brutal study routines, has no particular talents bar perhaps chess and Quidditch, and twice abandons the person he claims to be his closest friend at times of dire need.

How does this relate to what I was saying earlier? Harry is a painfully obvious Christ figure (as many protagonists end up being in modern fiction), Hermione is representative of the best parts of human nature, platonic and unconditional love, compassion, academia, loyalty. Though she's made human by her stubbornness, her jealousy, her tendency to panic and overwork. Ginny is representative of safety, homecoming, passion and other romantic ideals. I could go on. Ron is the representation of laziness, mediocrity, betrayal (though not of the same caliber as other betrayers in the work), and in many cases failure to succeed. He's given the short end of the stick in JKR's writing and I'd argue that he was meant that way. He's an outlet for the negative instincts of the reader; 'Things are going badly? Channel your grump at the person who walked out on Harry and Hermione in the wilderness, get rid of the grump and focus on my narrative'. It's an old writer's trick to include a character in the primary group of the story that you can't help but get angry at every now and then. It refocuses the reader on the protagonist and their struggle.

Why do we bash Ron? Because JKR put him there with the express purpose of making him an emotional punching bag.

There's nothing stopping you from redeeming him in your work as writers, but the canon Ron has been built from the ground up to be torn down again and again.

He's given several redemption arcs, because at the end of the day the Harry Potter story is about success and victory. A more realistic tale involving Ron's character as is would have seen a permanent break of the 'golden trio' after Ron abandons them on the run. The weird thing is though that it wouldn't have made as compelling a story, because even though Ron has been designed for us to hate, even in small portions, he's also there for us to love. Because in the end he does get the girl, he overcomes his shortcomings and he becomes a better person.

We just need to remember that, rather than focus on the person he was for the majority of the story, in the end Ron becomes a sympathetic character, but it wasn't always that way.

*** LGreymark, you made some very good and interesting points for everyone to think about even if I don't agree with everything.

  Ron is the representation of betrayal and the tendency in human nature to take the easy path in Harry's generation, in James'/Lily's generation that was Peter, and to a lesser extent Severus. JKR's writing is filled to the brim with cyclical themes and representational characters, Ron is no exception. That's not to say he ONLY represents those things. But in at least the contexts of GOF and TDH he represents the worst parts of human nature, and while he's not the only one to do so (the entire school bar Hermione turns against Harry in GOF and arguably the country turns against him in TDH.), he is the one closest to the issue who does.

#+end_quote

No I disagree because staying mad at your friend for a few weeks in GoF or leaving for a few minutes during the camping trip because of one's anger and turning to the dark side are two completely different type of actions. Also hasn't Harry done lots of regrettable things because of his anger as well?

I think it said that all students except Hermione including Ginny believed he entered the Tournament himself in GoF? Well you can say Ginny didn't turn against him in GoF but we cannot know for sure as the story did not focus on her.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione never truly abandons Harry, even in HBP when she's rowing with him about the potions book, Draco, etc, she's still his friend.

#+end_quote

Well by this logic Harry ‘abandoned' Hermione as well when she handed his broomstick over to McGonagall in PoA. Why should he get a free pass just because he's the protagonist? Hermione did not behave very well when she repeatedly ignored Ron's request to keep Crookshanks away from Scabbers and did not even feel sorry when all evidence showed Scabbers was killed.

What about that time in PoA when after handing Harry's broomstick to McGonagall without even consulting him and then trying all the time to justify her. What are your thoughts on that?

You are right about Ginny here.

Well he was able to perform the Leg Locker curse in PS and the slug vomiting charm in CoS and both of these spells are supposed to be rather advanced for his age at that time. He was able to stun a Death Eater while flying in mid-air so they are really as rare as you think. As for achieving something with his mind, it was also his idea to use the Felix Felicis to secure the memory from Slughorn and him who found a way to break into the chamber of secrets to destroy the Hufflepuff cup and him who understood intuitively that speaking the name Voldemort seemed like a bad idea. People keep bashing Ron for not providing enough brilliant solutions like Hermione but that is missing the point because that is not his role in the books. His job is to support Harry emotionally just like Hermione is to support logically.

#+end_quote

Why do you include the word perhaps? He does have those talents full stop. Also you kind of forgot many people in the real world only does have one or two areas that are really good at.

Guess Harry is a below average human being then as they got pretty much identical marks both with the help of Hermione's study kit (who was also helping Neville a lot btw). Ron passed his first-year exams with good marks (it's even stated like this in the book), he got the same marks as Harry in the OWLs except DADA where Harry had lots more practical experience. Do you consider a student who mostly got Es as a below average student? Sure he is not as book smart and did not study as hard as Hermione did but then who did? Also I am not exactly sure what the problem is with getting help from a more intelligent friend?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I would argue then that Harry is also a representation of laziness and mediocrity for reasons listed above. He could also be a representation of emotional deprivation because his ability to give emotional comforts to others is practically non-existent.

Interesting points about JKR using Ron as an emotional punching bag and the themes of HP series, you definitely got me thinking there.

As has already been said, if Harry wasn't so stubborn and just stayed in the same place a bit longer, they would have reunited a lot sooner because it is not really betrayal but more a moment of irrational anger.

#+begin_quote

I fully agree.

#+end_quote

I would say Ron was a sympathetic character for the majority of the books because like Hermione said he didn't really have it very easy being Harry Potter's best friend. Anyway, someone could also argue that Harry actually went backwards in someone ways in the last 2 books in that he started casting unforgivable curses in DH and in HBP he started to love the attention he got from being famous. Remember how he happy was he being the centre of attention when he kissed Ginny in front of everyone after the Quidditch match among other things? I do not agree with it but I can see the case it.

** I don't have a problem reading fics that don't bash Ron and put him in a better light, but for my enjoyment it is pretty consistent that I simply enjoy stories that replace him with Neville, the twins or Luna much much more on a quite consistent basis. Especially Luna - if she is properly fleshed out - can serve a very similar role in the trio as Ron, with the added benefit of being much more interesting than the constant "Blimey mate, she's mental". If Ron has been "phased out" in a fic, without any bashing, there hasn't been a single time where I thought 'gee, I wish we could see more of Ron'. He's completely forgettable.

Ron is just so... average. People often say that he is more like a real person and that that's a good thing, but in the genre of escapism I prefer the characters to transcend normalcy in some way.

*** Ron's not average. He's a fucking hero. He has sacrificed himself for his friends and the cause (Book 1), he has overcome his greatest fear to save others (Book 2), and he's willing to fight to his death to protect his friends (Book 3).

Ron's problem is that JKR ruined him in the next books, and instead of staying a hero, he became the comic relief (tentacled brains, hur hur), punching bag (poison plot, love potions), or depressing plot device (look, the trio's breaking up!)

Definitely true. I read once that JKR considered killing him off in Book 7? Might have been the better decision for the character at that point if she had done that... I doubt we'd have as much or any bashing about someone who actually sacrificed himself for his friends (also sweet foreshadowing with the chess thing from Book 1). But alas she decided to write that terrible epilogue and add insult to injury for people who already were wary of the character. It only leaves mockery for those fanfic authors that want to stay somewhat canon compliant.

***** If Harry got to come back while Ron (and Fred?) died a heroic (or even not heroic) death, it would put it further in the realm of Animorphs where the message is war sucks and real soldiers die. The interactions between Harry and Hermione and between them and the Weasley family would be very interesting.

Personally I think if she had killed off Arthur in book 5 and had Ron become a stronger leader for it, it would have made the series much better. Ron never really had to deal with that sort of loss and it made his apparent jealousy and lack of empathy as well as Harry self-pitying stand out through the rest of the series.

*** The twins could work but to be frank they are much more reckless than Ron ever was. Neville and Luna would not really work because neither of them could provide the EMOTIONAL support to Harry that Ron has. Neither of them really has a great sense of humour and really the Trio would be very dull without very few jokes or not much fun time and who will Harry turn to if he needs someone to cheer him up?

If you want to replace Ron with someone, I think it should be Ginny.

** The real question is when will we stop caring that people hate Ron? I just don't care if people do anymore, I've argued on this very sub many many times with people who don't like Ron and it's always the same arguments from both sides "Ron ABANDONED Harry twice!" "But he went to the Acromantulas even though he's terrified!" "He didn't believe Harry in GoF!" "He sacrificed himself in PS!" etc etc etc.

It's the same arguments over and over again, the same points made, it's like arguing about politics; utterly futile. People will very rarely change their opinions on it so what's the point of arguing about it anymore?

Harry's bad attitude didn't help either.

I miss that in a lot of grown up fanfics they don't give you that chill as fuck until you dis his sports team vibe he started to develop in the 6th and 7th book minus horcrux. This is the guy who spent his big coming of age birthday getting love potioned, poisoned, and breaking up with him buxom girlfriend but still didn't pitch a fit about it. If all of that happened on any birthday of mine I think I'd need more than just some mead (which hopefully isn't poisoned).
