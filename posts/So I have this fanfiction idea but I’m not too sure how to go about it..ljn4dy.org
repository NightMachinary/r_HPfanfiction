Basically a Snily fic where Snape makes a potion to go back in time to have his Lily. Only this is during the first war and he has no redemption arc. He goes back in time and manipulates Lily into a relationship.

Lily is oblivious to all of this until she slowly catches on. But at that point their already far too deep in. She is already broken by the relationship. She wonders if people like James or any of the other boys that had crushes on her would have treated her better.

How do I go about this. What kind of manipulation tactics should I have Snape use. How should I go about writing the other Slytherins, Lily's friends and the professors. More specifically Dumbledore, Minerva and Slughorn. I don't want to bash anyone other then Snape and maybe the other death eaters here. Lily says that her friends doesn't understand why she is friends with Snape during the mudblood incident.

Who would Snape notice. I plan to write this mostly in Snape's pov.


** When does he go back in time to? Does he still want to be a death eater?

If not. The easiest way is to go back before sorting. Beg the hat for Gryffindor (S comes after E). Way more time to spend with Lily to get her to fall for him.

If he still wants to be in Slytherin and still wants to join the death eaters it gets trickier but we can take some pointers from canon Snape. In the books, Snape uses some manipulation tactics on Lily. We're not sure if he does it knowingly or unknowingly.

1. Whataboutism - Lily brings up how bad Snape's friends are, Snape immediately changes the topic to discuss the marauders.
2. Emotional blackmail - Threatening to sleep outside the Gryffindor tower if she doesn't meet him.
3. Guilt-tripping (?) - "thought we were supposed to be friends? Best friends?"
4. Downplay/Gaslighting(?) - Dark magic is just a laugh. Nothing harmful.

Mix these in for sure with whatever other tactics you want. Lily wants to hang out with other people? Use 2 and 3. Lily calls out Snape and his friends' behavior? Use 1 and 4. You get my point.

A new tactic for him to use is when Lily says her friends don't like Snape, he should counter that his friends don't like her either but he doesn't care about the opinion of others or some bullshit. Obviously he's equating him being a creepy, unpleasant, death eater wannabe to her being muggleborn but who cares. Lily doesn't have to know that.

Canon Snape can't effectively manipulate Lily because he doesn't want to appear weak. Ignoring what we are told about Lily for a moment, we know two things from what we are *SHOWN* about Lily.

1. She's willing to defend people she's loyal to (defending Snape even though their friendship is close to over)
2. She's got a thing for saving pathetic/misguided people (how else would you explain the fact that she stayed friends with Snape even after she knew he calls other muggleborns mudbloods, is friends with wannabe Death Eaters, and wants to join the Death Eaters himself)

So appeal to her "saving people complex". Appear pathetic. Say he's got no other people to befriend because no one wants to befriend a poor half-blood Slytherin. Say shit like he's only doing stuff to fit in or else life in Slytherin will get really difficult for a poor half-blood. All the usual excuses Snape apologists use to defend Snape. Have Snape actually tell Lily these things.

Another thing from the conversation after the werewolf incident. Lily asks Snape why he's obsessed with the marauders. There are only three possibilities

1. Lily is a horrible friend who knows the marauders bully snape but asks him that question anyways. (Doesn't fit in with what we know of her character)
2. The Marauders secretly bully Snape when Lily's not aware of it. (Possible but unlikely given the Marauders' preference for public humiliation as seen in SWM. Also, James has to be hilariously dumb to bully Lily's friend in front of Lily when he is romantically attracted to her if he's been doing so in secret for years and getting away with it.)
3. The Marauders' bullying doesn't really start until Snape tries to get them expelled and Sirius tricks him to go to the Shrieking Shack. (Most likely. Another evidence supporting this theory is that in the post werewolf incident conversation Lily only says James is arrogant. In SWM, she calls James a bully.)

If you subscribe to theory 2, just have Snape truthfully tell Lily about the marauders bullying him. If you subscribe to theory 3, Snape should escalate the animosity with the marauders earlier and pretend to be the victim so that Lily spend years hating James and view him as a bully rather than just arrogant. (JKR, in an interview and through Sirius, said that Lily didn't really hate James)
