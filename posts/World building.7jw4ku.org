I recently have started to attempt to write my first full length fanfic and decided that I want to focus a lot on building a world. I always felt that most fanfics completely underutilise how little is actually mentioned of the magical world in the books leaving lots to the imagination. However, I can't think of everything myself so was wondering, what in the world do you want to see built on, or even imagined entirely from scratch, in a fanfic?


** I think if you explained that you're trying to supplement JKR's stuff, I think [[/r/worldbuilding][r/worldbuilding]] might be willing to help with the act of worldbuilding.

As for your actual question, I'd say that the point of worldbuilding is to make your world richer. Unless you're planning on explicitly making a globe-trotting adventure, half of the stuff you come up with won't even make a mention in the story.

Let's say you know B and D are both things. You can tell a story and mention A, C, and E, and if you do it right, people can infer that B and D exist. For a more concrete example, if you have ministry person A do one thing and ministry person C do another, it's because they're both acting on policy B. If sometime later, you do get a chance to mention B, /A and C will make sense./

This is actually one of JKR's failings. Her world lacks internal consistency because she adds things whenever she wants without considering how it affects earlier books/chapters. But, if she'd done some worldbuilding earlier she could have dropped hints and explanations to things before they were even needed.
