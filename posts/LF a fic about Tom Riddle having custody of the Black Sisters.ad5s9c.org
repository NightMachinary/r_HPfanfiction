For some reason I can't find this fic and I've tried all the keywords and pairings that I think might have been tagged in it, so I've decided to ask for help. In the story, Cygnus and Druella die in a portkey accident and all the Black girls are left in Tom Riddle's custody because he's their godfather. I remember Andromeda decides to go live with her grandparents and Narcissa and Lucius are really young and cute. Bella leaves school to be trained by Riddle.
