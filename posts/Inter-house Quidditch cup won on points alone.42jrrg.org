I've seen this idea mentioned a few times both in threads and fics and it doesn't seem correct to me. I know that the 3 years Gryffindor won in the books they won on points but that was because no team had a perfect record. I can't think of anywhere in cannon where it states how it works unambiguously but generally in sports the team with the best record wins. If two or more teams have the same record then there is a tie breaking procedure. In this case total points.\\
This seems like the much more logical and likely set up. Is there anything official (Either the books, Pottermore, or quotes from JK) to clarify this?


** It would seem so. The Lexicon is generally a reliable source, and this is what it says:

  Quidditch is always played in a series. Unless you're playing a pickup game in the apple orchard, every Quidditch match is part of a larger series of matches, and accumulated points are what count toward ultimate victory. The Quidditch Cup at Hogwarts goes to the team with the most total points, not the one who has won the most matches. The standings we see in the Daily Prophet for the British League (DP) list the teams in order of how many points they have in total, from Tutshill with 750 down to the lowly Cannons with only 230. Nowhere in the standings does it note how many matches each team won. Although we don't see evidence of it, there must be a similar system for the World Cup, which would imply that Bulgaria and Ireland were the top scorers in the world that year. Would it have been possible, then, for Bulgaria to have won the World Cup with Krum's capture of the Snitch, even though Ireland won the match? Apparently so.

*** ...that's really not doing Quiditch any favors on the ridiculousness front. I mean, I get that it was a foreshadowing device and never really meant to be taken seriously as a sport... but... Merlin's pants, Quiditch is terrible.

*** That just seems so unlikely. It make the mechanics of the game almost impossible. Two teams could run up the score in a 5 hour game, end with a score of 1020-1000, and pretty much knock the other two teams out of the running. It makes even less sense for a professional league. A point differential might make some sense but even that makes more sense as a tie breaker than the actual method for determining standings.

**** Do you really think Rowling put any real thought into the sport at all to begin with? 90% of the action in the game is almost always rendered pointless by the actions of 1 person, who in cannon did nothing but hover above the game and watch.

its easier to just accept that she only created the sport as a plot device, and that in cannon it was quite terrible.

I don't really agree with this part actually. Just because league matches don't count victories as part of their rankings doesn't mean that a bracket tournament like the World Cup would do the same. Indeed, I am struggling to come up with an elimination system where that would work beyond simply getting rid of the bottom half of the tournament every round. But if that were how it worked, Rowling probably would have mentioned it in GoF at least in passing by saying something about how Bulgaria had to beat Ireland by at least 40 points to win or something like that, especially considering that she mentioned things like that for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup.

**** I could see rankings being counted towards the overall season. And then let's say the top 16 teams are invited to an elimination style tournament for the World Cup. During that tournament, it's win or be eliminated. I don't really follow sports, so I'm basing this on my knowledge of the NHL and how they have standings and that determines if they make the playoffs or not.

I think the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup is different than the World Cup or Quidditch league. It's more a round-robin type of setup where everyone plays everyone and there is no final match. I can see points being a better way to decide the winner, especially if two teams have the same amount of wins.

***** Yeah that's pretty much the way I interpreted it.

Hogwarts Quidditch Cup - Most points wins the cup

Regular International Play - Most points with best invited to World Cup

World Cup - Knockout tournament where points only matter in that game
