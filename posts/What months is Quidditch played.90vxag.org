I cannot find the answer to this, I assume with is weather in Scotland that it's seasonal but can find no proof of when it starts and ends!


** In Hogwarts, the first match seems to be played in the weeks following Halloween, and the final seems to +always+ generally be before exams.

PS: Quidditch chapter follows Halloween. (The finals were after Harry's exams in this one.)\\
CS: The first match is after Mrs Norris is petrified. (The final match was cancelled.)\\
PoA: It's after Ron and Hermione went to Hogsmeade without Harry and the attack on the Fat Lady. (The finals were before Harry's exams.)\\
OotP/HBP Didn't have anything Halloween specific iirc, but the finals were before OWLs in OotP; did they even have exams in HBP? (EDIT: Ginny was preparing for her OWLs when they were dating, so yes, exams after final match that year too.)

My headcanon is that the six matches* are played in November, December, February, March, April and May respectively, with an extra match in May/June, should two teams end up with the same total score.

*(There are six combinations: GH, GR, GS, HR, HS, RS)

** Nope, the books have examples of games in all seasons.

** Process of elimination.

Ten months in a full year at Hogwarts (September to June)

Six Quidditch matches.

No matches in September or June for obvious reasons.

G vs S match is always after Halloween, and is noted as /the first/ quidditch match of the season.

Gryffindor plays in November, February, and May. Why May? Because the main character has to be playing in the deciding match, otherwise you would have to show the other quidditch matches.

** I went through the dates of all the known Quidditch matches when I started writing (based on the Harry Potter Lexicon). There actually seems to be a very consistent schedule with the matches always being in the same order (except 3rd year when Slytherin wanted to reschedule).

1. Gryffindor v. Slytherin--early November. (Every time.)
2. Ravenclaw v. Hufflepuff--late November or early December. (Mostly inferred.)
3. Slytherin v. Ravenclaw--January. (Mostly inferred.)
4. Gryffindor v. Hufflepuff--late February or early March. (Except in 2nd year it somehow got delayed to May, and it was still Gryffindor's second match of the year. This was probably due to the attacks.)
5. Slytherin v. Hufflepuff--probably April or May. (Never specifically mentioned in canon.)
6. Gryffindor v. Ravenclaw--late May or June. (Actually the most inconsistent because it has been scheduled both before and after final exams in various years.)
