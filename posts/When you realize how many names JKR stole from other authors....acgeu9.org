**** I think you're skipping some very important steps in your logic.

Ginevra is a variant derived from Guinevere, who is the wife of King Arthur in Arthurian legend. Given HP's obvious Merlin/Arthurian inspirations, I would posit that as the more likely origin.

Diggle is a House name in Yorkshire, Proudfoot is an existing former-noble house in North-East England. Both of these have a crest of arms. Roper is still fairly common in the modern day.

Lupin I'll have to do some research on, but Gamp originated in the UK around the 1800's and Granger remains common.

Rather than attributing names to writers, I think you should have kept in mind that both Tolkien and Dickens were British and therefore, that is probably the more logical common denominator for the origin of these names than jumping straight to accusing Rowling of stealing them from other authors. Although it is certainly possible that their use of these names influenced Rowling to use them, they did not invent or create them...

***** When have I once implied that they were created by the authors? I'm aware they're real last names. All I said was that JKR used a lot of names from classic works (which she has admitted to reading) and that if you ever need inspiration, then you can follow her example.

***** I think you're taking the post in the wrong direction. It's just meant as a helpful guide to other writers.

Also JKR has admitted to taking inspiration from the classics, so I really doubt it's a coincidence.

****** I've had multiple historians spell it either Hermione or Hermoine. I don't know why. I was in high school and between my actual history teacher and the visiting university professors we had, all of which (including the teacher) had PHDs, I saw and heard both spellings and pronunciations roughly equally. The standardised text books we received used Hermoine, but other standardised books used Hermione. Our teacher spoke Greek, as did a classmate, who was Greek, but our teacher was born in Ethiopia and grew up with English and Ethiopian as his equal first languages, so that may affect his pronunciation.

** Those names are not so rare. As for the other, clearly JKR inspired herself from mythology (as did a lot of authors) be it Arthurian, Greek, Roman, Nordic or others. Some are also a play on their character, other inspired by other books or myth. For example

Sirius Black: She decided that his family had star themed first names but also Sirius is the Dog Star, the brightest in the Canis Major constellation. Sirius animagus form is a black dog. Sirius (Dog Star) Black.

Hermione Granger : I don't know for Granger but Hermione is a character from William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale and it's a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger#Etymology][known fact]]

Remus Lupin : Remus is the brother of Romulus, known for supposedly having founded Rome and they were, in the myth, raised by a she-wolf. Lupin comes from the Latin "lupinus" which means wolf-like and it's also a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Remus_Lupin#Etymology][known fact]]

In face she did that for quite a lot of name. The complete name of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore#Etymology][Dumbledore]] for example, or [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Severus_Snape#Etymology][Snape]]. And many others...

She inspired herself a lot from french too (if I remember she speaks french) like with Voldemort.

As for the rest of course she'll inspire herself from things that have a meaning to her. The Ford Anglia was a car from a friend of hers [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1101-candis-renton.html][Read more]], Umbridge was inspired by a teacher she had had and disliked. More so, Dolores Umbridge name is also a [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge#Etymology][play on words]]. A lot of author do this and it's way more difficult to invent a name that it seems. It will most likely be linked to something you liked or disliked. And coincidences are also possible. Overthinking it for the sake of finding link is quite unwise; you could say that Harry's first name comes from the Prince Harry. Look for meaning if you want but do simply look what explanation JKR gave and if none was given, either there was none or it wasn't disclosed (yet?).

You say "stole". Why stole? Is it not allowed? Did the "owner" lost something? It's not stealing. More like borrowing, making a reference to. It may be an honour for the person she inspired herself from or an honour given to him/her. Personally if someone was to use my name of the name of some character I imagined because it was an inspiration to the person or reminded her/him of something I would be quite pleased. If we could only use a name once, we would be quite annoyed right now. Every creative endeavor comes from one's mind but also from copying. It's the cycle of creation. When you draw a butterfly you inspire yourself from something you saw. Not 100% percent of it but there will always be loan from other sources. It's not theft just the natural way of creative works. The use of the word stole is quite hard and that's more likely why you get so much hate. Words must be used with caution. Especially when talking about meaning.

Finally, you say that if we need "HP-inspired names we must look at the classics". Well yes. It a possibility. That or using the same logic she used (the Black family first names). It's not a problem. I would even say it's an advantage for fanfic writers to have such "guidelines" which help in writing something which will relate to the original work. Way more easy than the names in the Inheritance Cycle for example.

[EDIT] before you say it, yes you said last name but the logic is the same. for example I don't think Black is such a rare last name and it could be also linked to the fact that the Black family is dark aligned thus Black. The arguments stand.

*** Firstly, I want to say this community is not what I was expecting it to be, and I don't mean that in a good way. (Don't worry, everyone who just got their knickers in a twist, I probably won't be posting here again.)

Secondly, the person is right. JKR used a /lot/ of the same names as Tolkien (Proudfoot, Puddifoot, Diggle, Roper, Lavender, Lily, Rose, Ted, Tom, Poppy, Pansy, Myrtle, Laura, Hugo, Harry, Bill...) and the same goes for Dickens (/Sarah/ Gamp, /Edith/ Granger, /Mrs./ Lupin, /Miss/ La Creevy is oddly similar to Creevey...). Yes, they're mostly British names, but you can't call that a coincidence.

Thirdly, the person addressed the title issue in an earlier comment. Maybe try reading all the way before you make assumptions, okay? It doesn't need to be brought up again.

Fourthly, the person said "If you're ever needing "HP-inspired" names, just look at the classics." There is no /must/. They did not instruct you to do anything. It's quite clear they intended it to be a guideline for a struggling writer.

Fifthly, they never said anything about JKR lacking creativity. Again, this looks like it's just a helpful tip, yet it seems maybe only two people understood that in this thread.
