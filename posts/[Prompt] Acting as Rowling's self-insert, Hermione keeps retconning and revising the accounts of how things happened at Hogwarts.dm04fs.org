This one is to poke a bit of fun at Rowling. There's the serious route (commentary on government censorship) and there's the silly route (making fun of fanon).

If you have any questions relating to it, feel free to ask.

Stay civil. Constructive criticism welcome.


** "Albus Dumbledore was gay, and he was always in love with Grindelwald!" declared Hermione with unusual emphasis. "Wizards used to relieve themselves where they stand! I got together with Ron as a form of wish fulfillment!"

"Mum, you're drunk again," murmured Rose Weasley, age 6, trying to coax her from where she sat on the sofa. "You need to get to bed."

"There's, a, a, a SUPER Time-Turner in my office. Malfoy has one too. His dad made it to save Voldemort, and then never did anything with it." Hermione's words were slurring as she allowed herself to be pulled to her feet by her daughter. The mostly empty bottle of wine rolled to the ground as she stumbled forward. "Voldemort had a daughter by Bellatrix, she's got blue and silver hair..."

"Come on, Mum," said Rose, as she lead her mother by the hand toward the stairs. "Just a little farther."

Hermione seemed suddenly tired where she'd been almost manic before. "I'm sorry, Rose. Being Minister for Magic is a stressful job, and with your father managing the joke shop..."

"I know, Mum," Rose said. As they passed by the front door, it happened to open. "Dad? Can you-? Mum is..."

"Again, eh?" Ron asked, gently taking his wife's arm to drape across his shoulders. Her wine-blushed skin clung to his Auror robes. "I'm sorry, Rose. It was a late case. You can go to bed now."

Rose nodded, and offered her parents a feeble smile. Her father had explained it before. How her mother, Uncle Harry, and he had once been captured by Death Eaters, and how Hermione had held the attention of the mad, sadistic Bellatrix Lestrange. How they'd only escaped at the cost of a brave House Elf. How Hermione hadn't let anything of the trio's plans past her lips, even at the mercy of the most depraved torturer in Britain's history. For all that she'd managed to keep fighting for the rest of the war, she'd never managed to move on. She couldn't manage a full-time job, and could only get to sleep nowadays when soused.

It didn't make it any easier for /Rose/ to sleep, but at least her father was here now. Her feet pattered up the stairs, while Ron and Hermione had slower going.

"Doing alright, Hermione?" Ron asked, his voice filled with almost as much concern as affection. "Do we need to stop at the loo?"

"I might be black," Hermione mumbled into his shoulder.

"I feel like you'd have been on that daft family tree thing they've got on the wall," Ron replied. "But speaking of gits, Malfoy reckons he's pretty close to another go at a potion to manage anxiety. Properly, this time. I thought Harry was out of his mind when he wanted to spare the tosser from Azkaban, but it seems like he's proving his worth. Actually serious about making up for the shite he pulled." Hermione grumbled wordlessly, prompting Ron to sit her down on the stairs halfway up, letting her lean on him. "Hey. You know I'll be here to protect you, right? It's not like it was in the war anymore."

"You... don't even know which way to hold your wand," Hermione sighed, eyelids heavy.

"I can still whip your arse at Wizard's Chess, though, can't I?" Ron asked, with arched eyebrows, before he realized his wife was asleep. There weren't any more unlikely pronouncements as he carried her in his arms to bed.

**** Same, same. Especially because I once read the first of a series with Hermione being black and meeting Harry at a young age. This happens because he ran away with Lupin to Lily's house. She died, but only for six or seven hears. Anyways, this bothered me mainly because it then just made me have an infuriatingly hard time imagining her.

**** It was a suggestion, not an order. The fact you did something different is laudable.

I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality.

***** Cute. But seriously, you know how he revised photographs, did assassinations, and pretty much absolutely destroyed his enemies systematically?

Yeah, that's how the trio, especially Ron and Harry, feel like to me in Cursed Child. Snape is treated like he's this selfless hero.
