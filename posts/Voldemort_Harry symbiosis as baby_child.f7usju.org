I'm not looking for a particular fic, but any fic that (somewhat) fits one of the following...

*Harry gets full access to Voldemort's memories - including spells, rituals, information about wiz-world, Hogwarts, Dumbledore, his own parents, Death Eaters and about Tom Riddle's life. Practices magic - wandless, even the unforgivables.

*The Horcrux-scar is more active, and Harry talks to it - and is taught about (dark) magic and the wiz-world by it.

*All of Voldemort entered Harry and they share a body - as a whisper in the back of Harry's mind... as a fantasy friend to talk to... as someone who can take control in case of danger (eg. Dudley, Vernon or Death Eaters)... and/or someone who takes controll and leaves Harry as a (horrified or satisfied) passenger in his own mind.

*Harry died and Voldemort moved in. Alternative: Harry is the one left as a rafe - possibly with a horcrux in the scar.

+++

What may then happen - one or more of:

*Harrymort (eventually) start terrorizing the Dursley's and keep them thoroughly under his thumb.

*Harrymort rules the elementary-school.

*Harrymort contacts one/a few Death Eaters about his situation - eg. Lucius.

*Harrymort calls the DE to him, using the Dark Mark.

*Harrymort sends DE to do his bidding.

*Sorted into Slytherin. Rules Slytherin. Showdown with Malfoy. (Don't know he's (also) Voldemort.)

*Rules Hogwarts.

*Helps Voldemort to return. Takes his place by his side.

*Harry/Harrymort becomes a Dark Lord in his own right - in opposition to both Dumbledore and Voldemort.

Bonus:

*Relationship with Hermione.

*Corrupts Hermione and/or Ginny to join "The Dark Side".

So any suggestion for stories that more or less may fit any of this? Any rating acceptable. Preferebly longer stories.


** The Devil You know should meet the brief. It's well written and the interactions that Harry has with the piece of Voldemort in his head are pretty funny.

#+begin_quote
  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.
