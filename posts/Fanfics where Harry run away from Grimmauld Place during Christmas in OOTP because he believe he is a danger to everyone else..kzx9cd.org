In Order of the Pheonix, there is this passage where Harry freaks out because he believes that Voldemort can possess him:

#+begin_quote
  /And then, with a terrible stab of panic he thought, but this is insane --- if Voldemort's possessing me, I'm giving him a clear view into the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He'll know who's in the Order and where Sirius is ... and I've heard loads of stuff I shouldn't have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here. ... There was only one thing for it: He would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at least. ... But no, that wouldn't do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure, what if it was Seamus, Dean, or Neville next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus's empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach. He had no alternative: He was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely. ... Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around./

I was wondering if there were fanfics where Harry does really leave Grimmauld Place and either go back to the Dursleys or leave the Wizarding World entirely and run away. It could be either because Dumbledore didn't tell him (via Phineas Nigellus Black) to stay at Headquarters or because Harry ignored Dumbledore's message.


** I've read at least 2 stories with that description. Can't remember the names tho. What I do remember is how I found them: either go for a dark!Harry tag or a Tomarry tag in Ao3

Edit: a mentor!voldemort/tom Riddle tag should work too!
