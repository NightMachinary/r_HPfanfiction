All I remember is that they are in a secret room connected to Dumbledore's office, I think it is a basement of some kind, and Dumbledore maybe gives them each some kind of gift or weapon or something, that's connected to a specific founder.

Fairly certain it's not Dangerverse.

Thank you!


** Do you remember what the gifts were? That could help with a search if they were unusual. Are there any phrases you might remember?

If you recall "Thank you, Hufflepuff.", or the gifts in question were coloured beads that they could use for wishes of some sort, then it's Dangerverse, but otherwise, I dunno.

...Oh, and which site? Archive of our Own? Fanfiction.net?

*** I say I'm fairly certain that it's not Dangerverse because I binged the whole series not that long ago and don't recall this scene in it. I know all the tokens and stuff given to the kids in Dangerverse, and this didn't feel like that. For one, I recall it to be the first time the kids are "introduced" to the concept of the whole honorary founders heir thing, and I remember them being much older than when the kids in Dangerverse met the founders the first time.

The few things I can distinctly remember are that the trio plus Neville and Dumbledore are there, /maybe/ Ginny too, and that there's a whole scene where Dumbledore takes them through his office into a secret basement.

The website was ffn.

I'm sorry I can't give much more information than that, it was a long time ago that I read it. I think it might be one of those scenes that if you read the fic, you'd know heat I'm taking about, but it's too vague to be properly Google searched, since I can't remember any phrases.

There's some small part of me thinking that it might be the Refiner's Fire series, or the Dumbledore's Army by Bobmin series, since both of those have a more actively helpful Dumbledore than the majority of fanfic, but that could just be wishful thinking.

**** Well, I googled for 'heirs dumbledore harry ron hermione neville -bash -bashing -manipulative site:fanfiction.net'

And that still didn't filter out all the Sturgeon, I did find this though: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471121/1/The-Founders-Intervention]]\\
I don't know if it's any good.
