** "FUCK YOU DUMBLES I KNOW WHAT YOU DONE TO ME" Yelled Harry majestically, his bright blue (A/N I prefer the movies XD) orbs shimmering brightly gave just the slightest hint of the power within. His quidditch toned muscles wrapped around The Ice Queen of Slytherin herself Daphne, Queen of his heart and harem also.

"Oh know he no's" Sobbed Dimblebore pathetically. The rest of the Great Hall looked on their old hero finally seeing him for the pathetic mess he is.

** Harry reached deep into his magical core. He knew the dangers, but fuck it, sacrificing Snape to bring someone back to life was justice. Snape sniffled piteously because he didn't have a wand and all wizards are idiots if they don't have a wand. "COMPLICATED TRANSLATED PSEUDO-LATIN FROM A TRANSLATION WEBSITE" Harry screamed, pushing magic Into the massive runic circle flowing with the blood of his enemies. As Harry collapsed into a pile after exhausting himself, he heard the most wonderful voice. "Dobby is back?"

***** Oh even better would be for Snape to think it's Lily he's being sacrificed for. You could make the story filled to the absolute brim angst over Snape's role in Lily's death and the unrequited love he has for her.

Snape could always refer to the person coming back as Lily while Harry would only refer to them as someone who loved them so much they sacrificed their life to keep him safe.

Then in the end, as Snape's soul is drifting away from his corporeal vessel he looks over for one last glace at the woman he loves and utters "That dunderhead sacrificed me for Dobby?"

** It was but a drop of blood, but what it held for Harry was so much more. "This is what Sirius wanted." Harry sobbed and handed the goblin the parchment. The creature looked at it, a toothy grin on its face as it saw the parchment become longer and longer. "Welcome back Lord Potter-Black, last of the Line of Gryffindor, conqueror of Slytherin House and Harry le Fey first of his name, King of the Fey and Baron of Azkaban." The Goblin produced a sheet of parchment from the desk. "These are your holdings and riches."

Harry gulped as he saw the end sum. "But, it can't be. I'm just Harry" he whimpered.

"You're not just Harry," came a voice from behind him. "You are the Lord Potter-Black." It was Hermione. She wore a tight, pink dress, hugging her curves and greatly developed ample chest. Around here, in dresses just as gorgeous were Susan Bones, Tracy Davis, Daphne Greengrass, Ginny Weasley, Tonks, the Patil twins, Cho Chang, Marietta Edgecomb, Penelope Clearwater, Minerva McGonagall, Alexandra Quick, Bella Swan, Fleur and Gabrielle Delacour, the Queen, Aurora Sinistra, Morgan le Fey's ghost and Bellatrix Lestrange. "Let us give you heirs." they all moaned and started rubbing against each other until Gringotts collapsed with the resoncance of their sighs and moans.

** "TAKE THIS VOLDESNORT! /EXPLIARMUS/!!!11!" the Boy-Who-Lived shouted, thrusting his favorite professor, Dumbledore's, wand at his destined enemy at battle. His jet black hair flew back in its unruly manner, displaying his fateful lightning-bold scar for his slit-nosed nemesis to see.

His faithful servant, the evil Draco Malfoy, tried jumping in front of his master to save him, but Harry's powerful spell ripped through him as well.

"NOOOO!1!!!" Moldyshorts yelled out as the mild-disarming spell disintegrated his body into pieces.

"Oh Harry, you saved us!" Ginny, his faithful firey-red haired girlfriend, and Hermione, the smartest witch of the age, exclaimed simultaneously. They both hugged and kissed him at the same time, and the crowd behind them cheered for the end of evil and the win for the greater good!

** He looked passionately at her. She had on a black dress, with black shoes, and a body that was very beautiful. Her bloodred eyes bespoke to her duel vampire and feela bloodline. Hadrian's eyes devoured her. As the Lord of the resurgent House of Potter and Black, defeater of Dumbledore, and most powerful eleven year old in history, he could have anything he wanted. This woman, this... Thing, he would make her his own.

Her eyes met his, like the Ghostbuster's gun streams crossing, a universe ending in a glorious light. Her right hand clutched the bleeding skull of Ronald Wesley, the impertinent, the idiotic. Hadrian's member grew three sizes at the site. His adoptive fathers, Sirius and Snape, would be proud.

"Lord Hadrian Percival Wulfric Merlin Black Tudor Romanov Karling Potter, I bring a gift" Daphne said loudly. She tossed the skull then, and that was when I named her my queen, to share in my bed and my secrets.

" You are wise" I said with great pleasure.

"No more so wiser than you" she slurped.

In a flurry, Hadrian's clothes had fled his body, and Daphne's clothes joined them on the floor. 'Mione, chained to the ceiling for rejecting him, could only watch with jealous eyes. Hadrian ravished her, and Daphne moaned like the dead ghost girl.

There were many thrusts and many many kisses. Hadrian was happy. Daphne was happy to please her new master.

The Great Hall shuddered with their happiness. The students all clapped as Hadrian spent himself. Just then Snape arrived "My Lord what are you doing"

"Taking what is mine" I said.

Snape nodded. "Correct 500 points to Gryphindoor. There is $500 under your pillow, and a condoms in a sink"

"Thanks dad, I said"

As I left, all the women lined up to have their chance at me. Even the giant squid wanted a piece.

** "... SO FUK U BUMBLESNORE! I'M NOT YOU'RE PUPPET!" the raven-haired gryffindor youth exclaimed.

"b-but harry it's for the GREATER GOOD," stammered the ancient bumblebore, his eyes twinkling, lemon drop remains in his beard.

"EXPLIARMIS!" said harry calmly, and the meddling old fool dropped dead.

"BUT WE WERE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER!" said ginny. but her love potion ran out and she was expelled by harry on the spot (AN: because harry killed dumbles he now has the power of hogwarts (pls don't steal this idea from me or i'll SUE YOU! YES YOU! /looks at you angrily/).

"harry!" hermione gigggled. "you did it!"

"fuck yeah!" HARRY SMIRKED.

all the females in the great hall (including mcgonadgall, who looked young and sexy for her age) were accepted into harry's harem and they all received marauder names like "kitty", "miss clawy paws", "indian delight", "polar panther" and "miss double D doubled D'dness". ron choked on his food upon seeing so many naked women and died.

harry died one day because he was exhausted from all the sex and had a heart attack...

BUT WAIT................................................................

he didn't actually die because voldemorts (moudly shorts amirite?!?!?!?!?!?!) soul. THE END

(The above needs to be bigger font, but FFnet doesn't allow me to do so)

"Dumbledore, as the last remaining descendant of etc etc, I hereby remove you from the Wizengamot, as is my right", Harry declared, as he interrupted a vote count on the sizes of cauldron thickness.

"Harry please. I denied you your trillions of gold, ignored you after dumping you at some random muggle house, and probably embezzled what gold I can, and withheld your bank statements, all for the greater good!" Dumbledore pleaded, wondering how it has gone so wrong. His plan to have Harry abused so that Harry will somehow decide to sacrifice himself and in turn consolidate Dumbledore's political power is now in ruins.

"No! You control me no more, Dumbledore!" Harry declared, as his friends and harem members stood proudly behind him with their wands out, thankful to the boy-who-lived for showing them the light against their headmaster who probably used mind control magic to control their families, and their very lives.

"Power the dark lord knows not... Friendship/Love/Sex?" realization slowly dawned onto Dumbledore, as though a mist has cleared, revealing his past mistakes.

"Harry, forgive me." Dumbledore sobbed, as he fell to his knees. "Forgive me for doing all of the above. All I want to do is to defeat Voldemort, but it is clear now that you are mature enough that he is your enemy, not mine."

Dumbledore then died.

AN: Hey guys! What a chapter! I hope you guys liked it! Thanks to my betas, charlies and gammas for checking everything! Please leave reviews! I'll be back after the summer with the next chapter as life is suddenly SUPER busy for me, like 15 exams in 3 weeks.

(Haha no, I just wrote myself into a corner and i have no idea how to resolve Voldemort's death without it sounding lame even to me. This fic shall die a slow death, never finding a satisfying conclusion even though you have invested the time to read the first 18 chapters and 300k words).
