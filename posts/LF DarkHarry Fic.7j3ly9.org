It was probably about 30k words. What I remember is:

- Harry join hogwart when he is 15/16 years old
- He was trained by Grindelwald or some other dark wizard
- Generally Harry is having lots of fun with Hogwarts witches population (Lavender Brown and Ginny Weasley for sure)
- He Obliviated Ginny as soon as she started talking about getting married and telling her mother about their relationship

Well thats all, I hope you can help me find it

*** That's the one. Thank you :) Though I think I readed newer version with less chapters, also on ffn. Maybe someone tried to steal it.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.
