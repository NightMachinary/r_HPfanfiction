** Sorry, don't know it, but courtesy dicatates that you provide a summary of this fic you're looking for here, instead of sending us through several links to figure out what it is you're after. Most people aren't going to bother clicking that far.

*** Forgive me for that.

Here's the text of the question I posted:\\
I'm looking for a specific fanfic that came out a few months before the actual book was released. It was it's own version of Deathly Hallows, which starts off with Harry at Godrick's Hollow. Zacharias Smith is deemed the missing link to Hufflepuff's Cup, and Neville dies. Also, there's a new character named Julie, with whom Harry has sex at some point. Harry returns to Hogwarts as Head Boy and DADA professor, but the trio often go on outings to search for the horcruxes. The 4 houses are all merged.
