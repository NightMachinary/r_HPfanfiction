I had this idea floating around my head for a while, drank too much coffee one morning, and consequently started writing this story. I recently completed the 10th chapter, 45k words, and I would greatly appreciate any constructive criticism, Brit-picking, opinions, discrepancies or questions you may have to offer.

Some questions and worries I have:

• Is the pacing appropriate?

• How is the show vs tell ratio?

• How do you write like a child but keep readers entertained? Do I balance the differences acceptably?

• Are descriptions often enough, satisfactory and realistic?

• I tried to work in some subplots and foreshadowing. Do you notice them? I thought they were solid.

• If it feels like there's bashing at any point, let me know immediately. The closest I think I get is questioning Dumbledore's questionable actions. But he usually has a good explanation.

Some warnings because I know not everyone will tolerate the story:

• This is, as I think Inquisitor COC put it, a 'slavish canon rehash,' even if I do mess with it significantly rather quickly. But that's fine with me, I'm a beginning writer. Just a heads up.

• That being said, you should know that I know that you know canon. So I try to skim over familiar scenes and make little deviations here and there.

• This isn't a Lord Potter story, nor Lord of any family/house/whatever. He's got two plot-relevant abnormal powers, and they aren't even close to deus ex-machinas.

• There is a single mention of rape. Voldemort is Lily's biological father, via dark ritual and obliviation. I almost didn't put it in, and once I did, almost took it out, but it works well with the plot I have planned.

• Character Death later. Sorry, not sorry.

** You need to fix your run on sentences, stat. Try reading your fic aloud. If you run out of breath during a sentence, break it into two sentences. Scatter short sentences in.

Also Voldemort sounds like a pretentious self-congratulatory twit during the first part. It reads like a Lockhart narration not a Voldemort one. Try making it more bloodthirsty or emotionless or martial.

Your spelling is good; the run on sentences are your only big issues with grammar.

*** Ah, crap. Thanks. I used to do that a lot, guess I fell into old habits.

Your advice with writing Voldemort is appreciated.
