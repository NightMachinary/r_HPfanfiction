I could see this happening if:

1. The timeline is shifted a bit forward, so Harry is born 1999-2003. This would mean that the internet is much more widespread, meaning easier information. I imagine he had figured out Vernon's password to the computer, and found all sorts of stuff on there.
2. He was weaker, magically. This would mean that sometimes, when in canon he had used accidental magic to escape Dudley, this would no longer be possible. He would have to rely on being sneaky, and more forward thinking, which leads to my third point
3. He would have to be more slytherin-ish. He doesn't need to be sorted into slytherin, but he definitively would have to be thinking ahead, and not having the saving people thing as much as he had in canon.

Now, you have a bit magically weaker Harry, who has access to the internet. I don't think he would use it for recreational purposes though, as i described earlier he would search after methods to run faster, jump higher, be stronger, etc. He can no longer rely on his accidental magic to help him. Inevitably though, he would learn about all the injustices in the world, and get to argue with people on the internet. This will be OOC for Harry, but let's say he doesn't hate arguing as much as he does in canon. He doesn't like it, but he likes to debate. He could improve his social standing in the school by a bit, as the other kids have no evidence that he's a freak, because his accidental magic doesn't lash out as much. Now when he arrives in the wizarding world, and met with an old society brimmed with injustice, he aspires to change the wizarding world, to modernize it, and make it a better place.

TLDR: Harry is born later, gets access to the internet, likes to debate, accidental magic doesn't lash out, thinks forward more and doesn't have a saving people thing as much as in canon. Strives to fix the wizarding world in his own vision.

Have something to add, or discuss about how this could happen? Discuss in the comments!

- You said Lawyer. He would have to be Slytherin.
- You would need different friends. Tracey Davis would possibly be a good idea, as she is also a half-blood. Confirmed as canon. Blaise Zabini? He could be either-or with blood status.

- You could explain that away as an infant binding on his magic, or he self-bound it because of the abuse or something. Or even have him get a hold on it earlier, a la Tom Riddle did in the orphanage.
- You can get rid of this after book 2. Have his friends actually know about wizarding culture. Have him go to St. Mungos or something. Let's face it, Ron might have come up with a few tidbits of wizard culture, but it's not like the Weaselys follow into tradition or culture unless it is slapping their face with the obviousness.
- You can use this as a bulletproof way to get away from the Dursleys. Maybe expose the Dumbledore meddling if it is part of the story.

#+end_quote

- He can start with getting away from the Dursleys. This moves into who he was supposed to go there. More dirt digging, more research. Lots of Wizengamot/courtroom drama.
- Insert Sirius.
- Toss in some backroom politicking, greasing, more research. Sirius gets proven innocent.
- With Sirius free, this can expose Harry to a lot of societal functions now. Winter balls, Summer events, etc.
