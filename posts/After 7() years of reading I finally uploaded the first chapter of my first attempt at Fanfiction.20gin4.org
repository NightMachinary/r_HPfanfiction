** I was writing my story for over a year before I mustered the courage to start posting. It also took me a month to ask for a beta. I was just so terrified of rejection. Finally I asked the beta I had been looking at. She wanted to read my first three chapters ( I think she was slightly over whelmed to realize I had so much already written) and she loved it. I still was pretty nervous so I didn't post till three weeks later. I now feel great about my writing, and am improving so much. I have a second beta too and he's really wonderful as well. I've now posted 23 chapters ( it's still not finished) and have over 100 followers/ reviews. It took me a long time to have the confidence to post it, but now I feel silly that it took me so long. I was just terrified people would hate it and I would receive awful reviews etc. but everyone so far has just been really kind. Edit: word spelled wrong.

** I only published a few chapters to test to see what my writing look like and then removed it. I saved my fanfics on my Mac and PC. Hah. I think my writing is better than my first fanfic. I do remember looking back at my first fanfic and I found myself wishing I could disappear...

Problem is I already wrote quite a few different stories with different plots but never dedicated to one of them. Any tips for new authors? Maybe you can share us with your experience so far?

It is a bit frustrating for me to decide which fanfic I want to stick with. My ideas keep popping up - always at beginning - like escaping Dursleys, or Halloween Eve with a twist.

Thanks.

*** Ribe tuchus. Sit your butt down and work. If you seem to be getting stuck, try changing point of view. Or summarize what's supposed to happen in a couple sentences and get on to what seems more interesting.

It's hard.

** I'm a hold out too. But I think our community is so tight and positive and all about the same thing - the story lives on! - that I can't imagine people not being nice. When I read a fanfic that is 'bad' I never tell my other fic friends about it, I don't even like spreading that little bit of negativity.

** All I can say is that I definitely like it, but I know that's probably not the sort of review you're looking for :(

** I'm just now getting around to writing mine. Actually, I haven't even started writing, I'm just doing an outline.

I've been meaning to do it for a long time, but I keep reading other fanfics which give me new ideas, then I try to find a way to incorporate those ideas in my story, fail, change the plot, repeat...

It's been a long process.

*** I've had the same general idea for the story I've began writing for about three years, finally having it started is a big weight off my chest. I already feel very accomplished, even though I haven't done much. Maybe I just like the Ego masturbation?

** Not as long as you, but I have been conceiving of my story for a while, and just got around to writing it and putting a chapter up last month. It's slow progress, but I'm putting another chapter up sometime in the next week.
