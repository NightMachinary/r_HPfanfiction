How good at magic is the average wizard?

A few things to note before we begin.

1) Hogwarts is the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizarding_school][premier magical institute in the UK]], and their is nothing after it; there is no magical college on offer in Great Britain, and no generalized higher education anywhere else either.

2) [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Nastily_Exhausting_Wizarding_Test][N.E.W.T.s]] are the highest level of education offered at Hogwarts, and they are for /job placement/. You do not take your NEWTs to improve your general knowledge, but to qualify for the job you will be working at for the rest of your life once you graduate.

3) [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Weasleys'_Wizard_Wheezes][Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] had a highly profitable line of products devoted to defense, notably shield charm enchanted hats, gloves, scarves etc, which were top sellers because many adult wizards and witches couldn't cast a decent shield charm /literally to save their lives/.

All of this adds up to a picture of the adult population of the Magical UK as being not very good at magic outside their specialties, many of which are likely to be quite narrow. The Auror office was considered a taxing career path because it required 5 NEWTs, 5 certifications of competence in a given field. To be sure, they do require another [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Auror_training][three years or training]], but this still seems like appallingly little education. And yet, the extra three years to become an Auror was apparently so stringent a requirement that they routinely went years without accepting new recruits! Now, the Aurors are the magical equivalent of Special Forces, not general police, but this still seems rather a poor showing. I should think that in the muggle world a rather large number of people would at least be able to /qualify/ for such a program, even if they have no interest in pursuing it professionally, but it appears that the average witch or wizard is quite comfortable coming to a complete and total halt in their acquisition of new magic as soon as they leave school. Molly Weasley, a stay at home mother with /all of her children at boarding school/ still didn't know [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart%27s_Guide_to_Household_Pests][how to handle common house hold pests]].

The truly bizzare thing, however, is the occasional appearance of impressive magic. Consider the Weasleys' [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Flying_Ford_Anglia][enchanted car]], which could fly, turn invisible, and comfortably hold about a dozen people. It was so magical it even gained sentience and wandered off on its own recognizance into the forrest; that doesn't sound like a simple piece of magic /at all/. The [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Weasley_Clock][Weasley Family Clock]] is another example; a device capable of accurately placing the location of all nine members of the family at any given time. Both of these enchanted objects seem rather impressive, based on their utility alone. They also seem to be aligned with Mr Weasley's interests, professionally in the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Misuse_of_Muggle_Artefacts_Office][Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office]], and in private life with his interest in getting muggle objects to work via magic. Apparently NEWT standard in something like Charms and Transfiguration is nothing to scoff at!

But these items seem to be the *exception*, rather than the rule. We don't see the fabulous potioneers or creature keepers doing anything interesting now do we? This could be skewed by our view point, of course. Most of our exposure to the relative competence of wizards comes in the form of their ability to defend themselves. Maybe the general perception of Defense Against the Dark Arts is something like PE; a class you have to take until you turn 15, take your OWLs, and flunk out. Most wizards not knowing defensive charms and enchantments make sense; most muggles don't know martial arts after all.

This explanation seems a bit fishy though, for a number of reasons. Firstly because violence is a real and present danger to wizards for most of the story. In the muggle world [[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/10/us/gun-sales-terrorism-obama-restrictions.html?_r=0][gun sales go up in response to stressful events]]. The sensible thing for wizards to do in the wake of Voldemort, and especially during the course of the wizarding wars, is learn how to cast at least basic defensive measures! The shield charm is only a fifth year spell, they /know/ how to cast magic more difficult, they had to learn it for their jobs! And yet, WWW sells out of their shield charm enchanted apparel. Either no one decided to bother learning the shield charm, or no one was any good at it. It isn't a question of having access or money for such things either; [[http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/123546/what-are-the-costs-of-books-and-materials-in-harry-potter][books only cost a galleon or two apiece]] and you /can/ actually Order books for delivery, as Harry and Ron do in sixth year to replace their [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Severus_Snape's_copy_of_Advanced_Potion-Making][Advanced Potion-Making]] textbooks, which had /also/ not significantly changed in 50 years!

Is nobody in the wizarding world any good at magic? Is Arthur Weasley just a fluke? Does no one ever experiment or play with the magic, sticking only to the handful of spells they learned in school which are directly applicable to their jobs? Is literacy at an ebb amongst wizards?

Why were Voldemort and Dumbledore such exceptional wizards, beyond mere combat, when we know there is no such thing as a magical core or such like? (in canon; there are lots of explanations in fanon of course)

Is it just because they went the extra mile to keep learning without a teacher? To experiment and explore what magic can do? To visit other countries and learn /their/ magic? Why does no one else do this then, if it is so easy and undeniably /useful/?

Or is there something deeper, something unseen, which consigns the rank and file of wizards to the tedium of the everyday and the chains of mundanity?


** I think you're overestimating the gap between Hogwarts knowledge and what is required for competence.

There's no real indication that there's a substantial body of magical knowledge not covered at Hogwarts. If you look at Dumbledore's duel with Voldemort in OotP, the vast majority of the magic used is covered at Hogwarts, with the exception of Dumbledore's mysterious, powerful spell. Everything else is just very expertly cast Hogwarts magic.

Similarly, the lack of ability with the shield charm you point out as problematic is a failing of ability, not of education. It's an OWL-level spell, so it's not that it's a lack of tertiary education that leads to people not being able to cast it properly.

This should not be surprising. It's a direct analogy with the Muggle world. Repeatedly through the series we see the ability to cast magic linked with the ability to understand it, and understanding magic is essentially an academic matter. The vast majority of people are academically weak. I don't have the exact figures to hand, but something like 40% of British teenagers get D grades on their GCSEs (OWL equivalents), where A-C is considered the acceptable level. The lack of ability of people to cast the shield charm mirrors the lack of educational success in the Muggle world.

*** In that sense a shield spell is like a quadratic equation. Doable, especially with continued practice, but not something most people use often after finishing their GCSEs and likely more bother than it's worth if you can buy a hat to do it for you.

** I always assumed that quite a bit of "everyday magic" was either not worth mentioning in the books, or learned on an individual level. Also, keep in mind that after the first book, none of the books spend much time on Harry's classes, nor does he spend a lot of time doing normal, everyday things while "onscreen" so to speak. The vast majority of spells mentioned in the book are mentioned only because they have some sort of relevancy at the moment (Occlumency lessons or learning Accio). Much like if you were to write your memoirs, you wouldn't spend much of any time lingering on the day you learned to write a cursive "F" unless learning that letter was significant in some way.

Combat magic I would say is a specialization. In normal circumstances, you don't need to know how to do an overly large amount of defensive or offensive magic, because you who walks around on a daily basis expecting to be attacked? I personally don't know how an assault rifle works, but that doesn't mean my education was lacking.

The fact that there is occasionally impressive magic shown implies that the magic is taught at some point, it's just not important enough to derail the story to go over it. Remember that the books tend to linger on the /important/ parts of the story. Not every single spell Hogwarts taught should be classified as important. And to answer why we don't see more variety that's simple. We only see what Harry sees, and his exposure to the wizarding world at large is severely limited.

*** I'm less concerned with the quality of the education than with the general populace's use (or lack thereof) of said education. We do get quite a few scenes of the classwork in the books; I recently listened to the sixth book and they show a spell they learn in transfiguration (eyebrow color changing) and charms (vinegar into wine), as well as a smattering of potions.

The thing is, the Weasley car is an example of someone using magic as a /hobby/, being actually interested in what it can do and what you can use it for. Interests are varied though; what I would expect is for the snippets we hear from the Prophet to include things like 'was caught in his home but was able to escape using his krup/manticore cross breed as a distraction'. People /showing/ that they actually *use* magic. It's even the sort of detail that gets thrown in fairly often; we know Armando Dippet died in a broom accident to get his Ancient Age Flying License, so why aren't we hearing about the potioneers using their carefully hoarded liquid luck and so on?

Because none of that was relevant to the plot of the story. We should assume that there's a *ton* of things happening all over the place that aren't plot relevant. Unless Harry needed to speak with that krup/manticore breeder, or wrangle a bottle of a rare potion from a stingy potioneer, there's no reason why that should be included in the books. For the same reason we aren't treated to Harry's every movement of every day. It would make for a really boring book full of unimportant fluff content.

** First, your WWW evidence should be taken with a grain of salt for two reasons. One, WWW was talking to Harry, who taught them how to do Shield Charms and Hogwarts has not had a Defense teacher for more than a year since the 70s, at the latest.

Also, you forgot two things. When you cast a sheild, you cannot attack, you are defending. Yet with the shield apparel, whats the advantage? As long as you wear your gloves, you can attack until you can't anymore, and all you have to do is drop five galleons to buy them? Why not?!

We aren't exposed to the world outside of Hogwarts, nor do we ever see it from an adult perspective. We are exposed heavily to Voldemort and Dumbledore, who are geniuses with a wand. We are exposed heavily to the professors of Hogwarts who are not slouches with wands either. To claim them as anything less would be an insult.

Magic is not a utlilized like we utilize technology. Wizards use magic like an extension of their arms. For example. Wizards apparate and step into fire places and do magic every day as simply as we breath. For them, Magic isn't something that they think of as something to improve but something which is already perfect.

*** That is the conclusion I have come to as well. Most wizards grew up in magic; they don't conceptualize it as something extra which can be bent to becoming powerful. I don't think the students hardly ever actually /practice/ any of the spells they learn. Flitwick actually gives that to Harry as homework one time, implying that without his order they would learn the spell in class, or not, and then never use it again except on a test. The only spell Harry practices for the sake of getting good at it is summoning before the first task.

On shield charms: there is definitely extra utility to having the shield as a persistent effect you don't need to occupy your wand with, but Forge and Gred /say/ that they're being snapped up because the shield charm is 'hard'. The Hogwarts DADA professor /is/ erratic in quality, but out of the six we see three of them are decent at the job and Quirrel was supposedly at least middling, if not very good. Only Lockhart and Umbridge were actually /bad/ teachers. Lupin was good, Moody/Crouch was good, and Snape was good. The Carrows were too interested in Dark Arts, but they at least sound to have encouraged actual spell usage. Even if only one in three professors was any good, that would still mean every student should be exposed to /at least/ one competent instructor, and most of them would get two.

That's not true, magic is utilised as we utilise technology. There are new spells (like Snape's Muffilato) and potions (like Wolfsbane) created, there are new broom models coming out (see Nimbus 2000 to 2001 by one company, and then premiere of competing Firebolt), there are scholarly journals (like Transfiguartion Today).

**** you missunderstand. Can you live without technology? The answer to that is yes. You can live without technology.

Witches and Wizards cannot live without magic. They use it so much that they are stunted by the lack of it. That is why I equate them to arms. Is it possible? Yes you can live without your arms. Will it ever be the same level of life? No...no it wont be. Magic for Wizards and Witches is as natural for them as us using our hands and arms.

Your evidence of use of magic as technology substitutes are valid, however that was not my point. They aren't /perfecting/ magic. They are perfecting the way it is used. Each of your examples aren't innovative because of a new discovery of magic, but because it is a new application of magic. The Wolfsbane did not utilize anything new, but utilized it in a new way. The Nimbus 2000-1 and Firebolts combined charms together in a new way. We can not say what is in Transifiguration Today, but it could be examples of how modern witches and wizard utilize transfiguration. Or it could be experimentation of transfigured objects. Or it could even be Transfiguration experimentation. Yet that would still not change that Wizards view magic as perfect. Unlike with the human (muggles) Technology is always improving NOT humans. That is the difference

***** Actually I will back out from my earlier statement.

In HP magic is another "layer" of reality. It's ruled by its own sets of laws, different from "mundane layer" and it works on higher level.

So wizards study "magical sciences" just like muggles study "mundane sciences" (physics, chemistry, biology). And as muggles use knowledge of "mundane sciences" to create technology, wizards use their furthered knowledge to the magical sciences to further their civilisation by creation of new spells, potions and other magical contraptions. And that's our technology analogue. But for the sake of discussion let's call it magic.

Now to analyse your post.

Unless you are Amish, or live in some god-forsaken place, you and those around you also rely heavily on technology. And since you wrote those posts I assume that neither of those special conditions apply to you. Imagine that your city/group of neighbouring villages/whatever suddenly loses electricity, gas and running water. Unless you are prepper you would be completely screwed. And even if you are a prepper there is a possibility of you being completely screwed by your neighbours. Civilisation is based around technology. Simple tools were early technology, and it followed from here. Without magic wizards wouldn't be wizards, without technology we wouldn't be human.

The rest is some heavy theorising, I would ask for some reasoning. But there is also another matter.

** I would be tempted to argue that you are devaluing some of the professions we do see. Granted we do not see many and the widest view is the Weasley children, but still. You specifically mention creature keepers and potioneers but we know of dragonkeepers who I would argue is a significant job. Also the wolfsbane potion is a good example of a recent advance in that field.

I would also argue that the advancement in broom technology in just the first 3 years speaks to multiple companies developing and producing state of the art magic more than you seem to think.

The department of mysteries is another example for some more skillful use of magic and development of new magic.

*** I would argue that 'improvement' is not at all the same thing as 'advancement'. Making a faster broom may only be an incremental refining of pre-existing charms, not the invention of a new, faster flying charm etc. But point taken.

I suppose the biggest example in the books is potions class. Think about it; you spent a couple hours slaving over a cauldron to produce something which has /an actual, useful effect/, but instead of saving their better efforts they just pour it all down the drain at the end of the day. Now, this is admitedly a somewhat problematic example as potions brewed incorrectly are dangerous and they are /learning/, but some of their potions have to come out a good enough quality to be useful. Why aren't they keeping a little cabinet full of potions around? The students never /use magic/. Why are they /carrying/ bookbags when the very first spell they learn is the levitation charm? Why are they shivering in the cold while they walk to classes when they can summon magical flames and cast the warming charm?

Why, in short, do none of the magicals act like they can actually do magic?

**** As for potions, I would imagine that any medical potions made by students simply are not of a good enough grade to be acceptable due to a lack of practice at making the potion.

If the magical medicine community has any kind of intelligence, they will require medical potions to be made by someone that can consistently produce a standard level of quality. And that's simply not something students can do.

The Wizarding World seems to frown upon using magic for every little thing. And I can see why they might. Let's take your example of carrying bookbags around instead of using the levitation charm. Keeping the levitation charm going requires concentration, and the students are also walking through a castle that seems to rearrange itself sporadically, including moving staircases. Seems kind of dangerous when you consider that, doesn't it?

** In canon (mind you 'cannon' is a weapon), there is a weird dichotomy of trying to sell the average citizen as useless and playing the big players as amazing at magic.

In particular, I have thought about the issue of regular witches/wizards not knowing how to do the shield charm. At first I dismissed it as the same as muggles not all knowing martial arts, but then I thought that's ridiculous. It's a swish and flick and a word. However, with a bit more thought you realise the analogy is very apt. First, using the shield charm requires good reflexes and good aim, which is definitely something that requires practice. Second, a poor or middling knowledge of the charm may be counter productive since a good offensive spell may just rip it up anyway and leave you exposed and defenceless. Third, practice is presumably fraught with issues. One can, for example, practice at home, if one does not live near muggles. And i can imagine reversal spells and presumably the arsenal of reversal spells that exist are quite a feat to be able to wield in the first place. So I can imagine someone practicing may be required to call on reversal squads which likely comes at a cost.

So what then? Training must occur at school. If as another commenter mentioned there is at least a decent teacher of DADA every three years or so, then it is possible to perfect it, however, Hogwarts seems more like a technical college than a general educational school and i can imagine DADA is only really needed for auror/hit wizard/magizoology. And these jobs are dangerous, so they will seem unnecessary/undesirable skills.

And that neatly brings me to the general magical knowledge of witches/wizards and the kind of school hogwarts is. While we only see a snapshot of learning, it does seem like everything learnt early is practical and then it turns into prerequisites for jobs. There does not seem to be much emphasis on magical theory alongside the practical and hogwarts seems to be missing staples like maths, language, science etc. (If Arthur W does not even know the word electricity, is there no static electricity in the wizarding world?)

So, Hogwarts is a technical college at best. I can, therefore, believe that the average magical citizen is not very adept outside of their narrow band of skills.

So what about some of the characters we meet? Dumbledore and Voldemort have a huge range of abilities, including fighting, at their age, so they have undoubtedly practiced and have superior talent to most. Hogwarts professors show an incredible depth of knowledge and confidence in magic. What is super impressive is the kind of wacky ability that someone like Arthur has. He is essentially inventing magic. His twin sons and the marauders and Snape are then even more impressive. Having such a good grasp of magic to successfully invent perfect examples of magic at a young age. Hermione with her large knowledge bank looks positively pedestrian in comparison.

What weirds me out is that when amazing magic beyond the usual person is exhibited (even like the flying car) or the clock, people seem indifferent to the wonder. Elves apparating at hogwarts is ignored as boring when it is unbelievable! The marauders map, goblet of fire etc. Is amazing magic relegated to 'magic nerds'? Are then, these magic nerds not essentially superheroes then?

I think this is why fanon is so varied trying to explain this. It's hard.

Last thought: I find it impossible that hogwarts is GB's only school. It just doesn't fit the narrative. What then do the other schools teach?
