#+begin_quote
  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

**** I have such a difficult time with HPMOR. Everyone says it's good but I find Harry's attitude so off-putting I never make it past the first few chapters.

Why do people like it so much? Especially since the jerk!Harry characterization gets so much hate most of the time?

******* People are different. What works for one reader might be unbearable to another. No writing will ever appeal to everyone. There's nothing wrong with deciding it's not for you and dropping it.

****** I mean, there's a difference between being sarcastic (which I am) and being an obnoxious jerk. My impression seems to be that everyone reads his character differently.
