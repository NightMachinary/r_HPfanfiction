*(This is a little excerpt of the chapter for my fic that I'm currently writing. Tell me what you think about it! Here's the link to my fic for those interested:* [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28119780/chapters/68898909][*Hbi Hr At*]]*.)*

Harry blew out a forceful breath and dragged his eyes back to his Charms text. He managed to read another passage before he slammed the book shut, scrubbing his hands over his face. His skin itched as if he had most of his magic locked up, but he could feel it saturating his room, buzzing with his irritation. Dropping his hands into his lap, Harry looked up. His eyes fell on the grim statue sitting on his desk and an idea drifted through his mind.

He hadn't been using his magic a lot, so what if tinkering with it a bit would make him calm down?

Instead of getting up to get the figurine, Harry merely summoned it wandlessly. It landed in his hands and he set it on the bed in front of him before reaching out to touch it without any worry since he knew that it didn't have any curses on it anymore. His fingertips ran over the detailed sculpted fur and his eyes fell closed as his magic felt out the magic that was imbued in the sculpture.

The magic that had animated it was very faint and worn down, no doubt due to years of use. He almost considered erasing it and trying to figure out how to do the animation himself but decided to study the waning charm. Harry hadn't studied much about animation spells other than what he'd learned in Transfiguration and Charms, which were basic or intermediate at best. He would be relying on what he'd learnt about picking apart spells to help him figure out the charm.

He analyzed the magic in the figurine slowly, making mental notes of the different parts of spells that he could identify. It had the basis of a /Locomotor/ spell, which was the basis of almost all movement charms. It was used in Defence spells like /Locomotor Mortis/ which was the Leg-Locker Curse, or /Locomotor trunks/ which could be used to move trunks (or whatever the object was), and the most notable use of the charm had been during the Battle of Hogwarts. It was a part of the spell that had moved the statues and armour in Hogwarts to attack, though Harry figured that they had been charmed by older Headmasters to move or react a certain way when directed.

/Locomotor/ on its own was typically used to just move something the way you directed it, such as with a school trunk. When you cast the spell on the trunk, it would make it levitate and you could then direct the trunk to go in a certain direction you wanted to. In this way, it was also similar to the spell /Mobilicorpus/, which is used to move a body, or /Molibiarbus/, which could be used to move a tree or wooden objects. Both meant "movement" or "to move."

Harry supposed he could just use the spell /Piertotum Locomotor/, which would move the statue however he wanted to. The spell, if he translated it properly, meant something like "the whole position moves dutifully," though if he used the French word /Pierre/ as the basis of /Pier-totum/, then he would get "the stone moves position," which also fit with what he wanted. However, /Piertotum Locomotor/ was the type of spell that would fade when you stopped powering it or when whatever magic you put into it faded. Harry would also have to direct it what to do, which he didn't necessarily want. He wanted the little statue to actually /act/ like a dog, but able to come to life or "freeze" when he wanted it to.

Other spell fragments that he could detect were merely used to "trigger" the animation spell on the figurine. Probably something like a touch or a spoken word. There was also one that he recognized from when he studied in Egypt. One of the tombs that he had managed to weasel his way into studying had been decorated with cat statues, and when one of the Curse-Breakers had walked into the room, the cats had come alive. The statues had been transfigured, giving them the appearance of actual cats; meaning fur, claws, and teeth. It was the same thing with the grim figurine, Harry realized. The spell was tied into the "trigger," which meant that the grim would assume a dog-like appearance with fur and all. That at least saved him from having to transfigure the outside of the figurine and making it look like a stuffed animal or something.

The spell, Harry supposed, also didn't just make the statues just resemble cats, either, it actually /made/ them into cats. It gave them the instincts and the intelligence---or perhaps /more/ intelligence---of a cat. Now that the thought crossed his mind, he identified the last spell fragment in the grim that was tied into the "trigger." It would give the grim some sort of intelligence, though Harry didn't really know if it was giving it a dog-like personality or something else. He figured that he could just tie that part into his spell-weaving when he fixed the grim, and if it turned out to be something bad, then he'd change it.

Analyzations done, Harry summoned a muggle notebook and a pen to write his observations into. This was something that he'd done ever since he started with his new hobbies. The spellcrafting books he'd picked up had recommended analyzing the spells put into different objects, which he had done since it allowed him to exercise his analyzing skills, and he'd originally made mental notes. His memory was very good at that point since he'd begun meditating every day for his Occlumency training, but he had found that writing down his observations as they came to him and then smoothing them out later helped him a lot. He still made mental notes if his hands were busy or if he didn't feel like writing or he was analyzing something on a mere whim like he was doing with the grim, though he sometimes dictated them aloud with a dictation quill.

He absentmindedly chewed on his thumbnail as he scribbled down the conclusion he made about the original spells put into the grim; the basis of the /Locomotor/ spells and how they worked, the transfiguration spell, the "trigger," and the unknown intelligence spell. A few extra notes were jotted down about the transfiguration and intelligence spell and how they had influenced the cat statues in the Egyptian tomb he'd been in, just for some extra background knowledge on that particular aspect on the spell.

Finishing the last of his observations about the faded spell in the grim, Harry set his notebook to the side and placed the grim in front of him. He backed up a bit, leaving enough room for him to work. If he did this correctly, and he was confident that he would, then the grim figurine should become an actual dog when he finished enchanting it. He would have to add the trigger spell afterwards to turn it back into a figurine---hopefully.

Fingertips touching the grim's head, Harry's magic began to flow into the sculpture. It felt much less agitated now that he was actively using it. He would have to write Theo and see if he was having problems with restlessness, and if so, then he would recommend for him to use a lot of wandless magic; either by destroying stuff to get his frustration out or by doing something else. Despite what some people may think, wandless magic wasn't some super rare thing that only ridiculously powerful witches or wizards were capable of. Almost all wizards were capable of it (the ones who weren't were typically late-bloomers who didn't have as much magic as the average witch or wizard) and most simply didn't put much work into it as other people did.

Since wandless magic was more advanced magic, it was taught in your NEWT Charms and Transfiguration classes. Harry had had to teach himself, though, since he skipped his seventh year and he studied for his NEWTs himself before taking them at the Ministry. Where other seventh-years would be guided in the art of wandless magic, Harry had to do it himself. He'd begun while on the run with Hermione, who had suggested that they use whatever advantage that they could get when they were a wand down, and he'd been able to levitate or summon things to himself along with a few simple spells like /Aguamenti/ and /Incendio/. This was typically the extent of magic that average wizards did since they relied on their wands most of the time. However, with a lot of frustrating and tiring practice, you could get to the level of casting all of your spells wandlessly the same way you would a wand. They were less powerful than using your wand, mind, but using wandless magic worked when you were in a bind.

Instead of breaking the remains of the spell on the grim, Harry instead weaved his own magic into it. He removed most of the old, broken parts, though kept the fragment of a spell that gave the grim it's dog-like intelligence and appearance. It was strangely soothing and hard work to weave his own magic with the spells already there. It wasn't remotely difficult to layer spells on top of one another but to actually weave your magic into older magic, another person's magic, it was slightly more difficult. Some people's magic just didn't /connect/. It was like when a Muggle got a kidney transplant; sometimes the body accepted the foreign organ and sometimes it didn't.

His magic wasn't a match to the old magic imbued in the grim---such a thing wasn't possible unless you took a time turner and there were two of you or you were identical twins (and even then your magic wasn't completely identical, but they matched)---but his magic was kind of... compatible with the old magic. It was like using a wand that wasn't yours but you could use. Like when Harry had used Malfoy's wand and it had worked decently well for him, unlike Hermione's wand which had bucked against his magic. He had to use more power to make any spells he cast with that wand work.

Harry knew when he completed the spell; he would have to be blind in every way not to. His magic seemed to flare and click into place, his bed dipped under the weight of the grim statue growing, and a large mass barrelled into him, making him smack his head against the wall.

"Ow!" he hissed, rubbing the back of his head with his hand. His eyes snapped open as a wet tongue lapped at his cheek. The grim looked exactly like Padfoot was Harry's first thought. It made his heart squeeze tight for a moment and the dog seemed to sense his emotions, jumping off him with a slight whine. It sat with a tilted head, thick furry tail slapping against his comforter once.

He---because the dog was /definitely/ a he---was a large black thing that looked like a mix between an Irish Wolfhound and a Silken Windhound. It was large and had the bulk of a wolfhound, but it had the more thin-face and angled muzzle appearance of a Silken Windhound, instead of the blocky muzzle of a wolfhound and less of the face-obscuring fur, showing Harry the dog's golden eyes. When the grim spotted Harry's eyes on him, his tongue lolled out of his mouth and his thick furry tail wacked against the bed at a fast speed. He jumped on Harry again, snuffling at his clothes and making loud whuffing sounds.

There was the sound of someone walking up the stairs and Harry said commandingly, "Stop!" The dog froze like the statue he actually was and Harry's brows rose slightly as the grim stood still, his muzzle still pressed against his shoulder where the dog was sniffing. "Sit." The dog sat. When Dudley walked past his bedroom door, knocking his Smeltings stick against Harry's door, the dog didn't even twitch. It just sat still as commanded, large intelligent golden eyes staring into Harry's green ones.

"You're commanded to do as told," Harry said, his mind connecting the commands to the intelligence spell that he had analyzed but couldn't identify. The dog's ears perked at the word "command" and Harry's eyes narrowed slightly and he commanded, "Get off the bed," to test out the idea dawning inside his mind. The dog promptly did as told. Harry tested out a few different commands to work out the kinks of the spell; the dog sat when told to sit, stood when told to stand, barked when told to speak, and spun in a circle when told to chase his tail. For a final test, Harry cracked his bedroom door open and commanded to the grim to get the tv remote without being seen.

Harry listened intently as the dog trotted down the hall, his nails barely clicking against the hardwood floor of the hallway. He held himself so quietly that he could hear the TV running downstairs, Vernon talking to someone on the telephone, and Petunia chatting in the garden with the neighbourhood wives. He could feel the grim moving around with his magic and thus didn't startle when a large black nose nudged his door open. If he had his magic locked up, though, he would have surely jumped at the dog's sudden entrance. The dog sat in front of him on the floor, the television remote held in his maw.

Harry couldn't help it---he laughed. It was a short bark of a sound that he swiftly muffled. "Good dog!" he couldn't help but coo, reaching out to scratch behind the dog's ears. The remote clattered onto the floor as the grim dropped it and instead jumped up, his large bear-like paws settling on Harry's shoulders as he lapped at Harry's face. Harry indulged himself in petting the dog and allowed it up onto his bed, where it curled up at his side, large tail hitting the wall and bed as it wagged.

"You're such a good dog, you know, for a grim," Harry told the dog when he calmed down, petting between the dog's furry ears. Said furry ears perked at the last word and he lifted his head, woofing. "Grim," said Harry again and the dog woofed again. "That your name, boy? Grim?" Another resounding woof cemented the dog's new name.

/At least I won't mix him up with Padfoot,/ thought Harry.
