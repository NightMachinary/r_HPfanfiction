Anything where some place has great security and someone comes up with a clever plan to break in anyway. Can be Voldemort figuring out how to disable the DoM's security, or Hermione breaking into Malfoy Manor's basement on an assassination mission, or Cedric breaking into a magical casino in Las Vegas (although I'm pretty sure there's only one like that and I read it already). Break-outs greatly appreciated too, whether it's one of Grindelwald's old followers busting his old master out of Nurmengard or Sirius figuring out how to get out of Azkaban.


** The only one I can think of right now is linkffn(a black comedy by nonjon), where Harry and Sirius rob different purebloods, and then recover some horcruxes. The “ward” stuff is very non canon magic compliant, but decent enough.

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.
