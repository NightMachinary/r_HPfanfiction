I like the idea of a future fic where another dark wizard is starting to rise and it's up to Harry to assemble a force to fight him. But he also acts as a mentor for the new generation.


** In this story Harry is similar and different from Dumbledore. Not exactly what you are looking for but it's a good read none the less.

** Okay so this doesn't really follow what you're looking for BUT Harry's fate does mirror Dumbledore's, and it's incredibly poignant. Somehow beautiful, terribly sad, and just a tad hopeful at the same time. I cry every time I read it. It's one of those essential fics you have to read.

*** If someone out there is considering reading this, please don't skip past the warnings that it's "terribly sad" and "cry every time I read it." I agree with OP and also love this story, but if you read as some form of escapism and dislike having to feel feelings you will hate this fic.

**** Oh yeah, it's very heavy. Definitely not one for taking your mind off things. In fact, it makes me start thinking about my own life and what I'm doing with it.
