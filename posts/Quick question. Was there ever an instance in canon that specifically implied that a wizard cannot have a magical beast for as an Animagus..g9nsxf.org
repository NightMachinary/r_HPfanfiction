** No, but the mechanics for becoming an animagus are never elaborated on beyond:

1. It takes a long time to learn - seen from the fact that the Marauders took 2-3 years to learn working together.
2. Its not very common - there are perhaps a dozen or so /known/ animagi in canon (seven registered plus four more unregistered), along with a few others in the past.

Most of the belief stems from a few extra-canonical instances of Rowling elaborating on the Wizarding World and connecting aspects of what we see in canon. Most prominently:

- Animagi generally have the same form as their patronus, and a patronus can be a magical creature (Dumbledore, Tonks).
- Animagi are much more common elsewhere in the world (see Uagadou and African transfiguration specialty). It may be possible with other methods/schools of magical application.
- Animagi are not necessarily size-limited - both insect and elephant animagi are stated to exist, so this creates a minimum size constraint.

*** The process for becoming an animagus was described on Pottermore, and in typical JK fashion it's kind of off-the-wall.

1. Hold a Mandrake leaf in your mouth for an entire month, never taking it out for any reason.
2. Use the leaf as an ingredient in a potion, which is then set aside for later.
3. Every day at sunup and sundown, recite an incantation while pointing your wand at your heart, until...
4. A lightning storm occurs, at which point you must drink the potion and proceed to not lose yourself to the animal.

Obviously YMMV regarding the canonicity of Pottermore material, but it's what we have on the subject.

******* Exactly! Sure, it's time intensive, and really boring, but it's not /hard/. I've read the official method, and I see no reason that Harry couldn't have dedicated a month to the leaf, have someone who's good with potions do that bit, and then book a portkey to some stormy place and wait.

Might have come in handy during the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Or against Voldemort. Or... any number of other things really.

It's boring, it's time intensive, it functionally makes you mute for a month. But it's not /hard/.

And if nothing else, just from the stance of a fanfiction writer, the official method is /boring/.

And, to continue on a bit. Imagine a fic where, after the chaos of the first Trial in the Tournament, Harry just came back to the common room, turned into a dog, and curled up by the fireplace.

That simple moment, if done correctly, could lend so much interest to the Animagus transformation. Why doesn't he go back upstairs? Why not a chair? Etc, etc.

Just, using it like it's just a /part/ of the character: sometimes they just turn into a dog and curl up by the fireplace to rest. Maybe they got a little dog bed by the fire for him, because he does it so often. Idk.

** I don't recall any discussion etc that stated that an animagus could or could not be a magical beast.

With that said it seems that for an animagus that their Patronus reflects their animal form. Almost all the Patronus' revealed are non-magical beasts except for Dumbledore's Phoenix but I don't recall anything about Dumbledore being an animagus.

Now Sirius's form is talked about looking like a grimm but since we don't know what powers a grimm has (and we don't see Sirius using any special powers in his form) we truly don't know if his form is a magical grimm or just a black dog.

Basically, canon leaves enough wiggle room to allow fic writers to use any animagus form for their characters.

** Canon doesn't imply it one way or the other - though it says being an animagus is very hard/rare (and none of the ones we know of in canon are magical creatures). I think there's some implication of the patronus form and animagus form being originally correlated. That'd open a possibility up for Dumbledore (Phoenix) or dragons/thestrals (mentioned as a possibility).

We just don't know enough about them - though, personally, I would stay away from an animagus form that'd be too powerful or intelligent.

** Canon doesnt say but if you are open to head canon then here's my interpretation.

Your Patronus reflects what makes you happy, often through direct relationship with the memories you use to power it. This is a mix of heavy symbolism and powerful memories. For Sirius, his time in Hogwarts with his best friends as Padfoot is his happy memory, so his patronus takes the form of padfoot. For Harry, his patronus relies on feelings of love for family, both the parents that died for him and the family he has found, his patronus takes the form of Prongs, both a herd (family) animal, and a tie to his father.

An animagus form however is based on who a person is deep inside, their innate animalistic nature. Entirely symbolic, this is only to do with these fundamental basic traits of a person. Their spirit animal for comparisons sake. Now this does not, in my headcanon, discount the possibility of a magical creature animagus, but makes it incredibly rare. Only in cases where mundane creatures fail to describe the innate nature of the wizard does the more complex nature of a magical creature need to be represented.

This does lead to power wank writing though, "MC so cool they are the only dragon animagus" etc. So I usually stick to mundane animals, after all there are so many of them and with their innate traits as well as human symbolism anyone should be able to be described with a mundane animal
