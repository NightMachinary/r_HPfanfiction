I see it like this. Lily was already pregnant with her second child (it is slightly over a year between Harry and Ginny so it is biologically possible), when they found out about the Prophecy and need to hide. They've agreed to hide Ginny with Weasleys' (no, sorry, their anti-girl-curse, if there was a one, has not been broken then, and yes it helped Ginny was a natural redhead after her mother), which they did slightly after her postpartum period (that is after September 22nd). All Weasley boys were memory charmed to have included their Mum being pregnant again (which, frankly, was not that difficult charm to make, because everybody remembers her being pregnant all the time ;)). Then Potters started to work on preparing place for Harry with Dursleys, but they have never managed to finish it and they never told Vernon & Petunia, before they were killed on October 31st. Which was the reason why Dumbledore put Harry with Dursleys (he actually never really understood the mechanics of those blood wards, because they were Lilly's unfinished invention, or something).

These two will find out only when told in Harry's fifth or sixth year by Dumbledore, who sees a danger of upcoming incest.

Now, it gives us a nice setup for non-Hinny ship which doesn't need anybody's bashing. Or even Ron/Ginny ship, if anybody cares about that (but that's not probable, due to the Westermarck effect).

What do you think? Is there such a fic based on something similar?


** I read something absolutely years ago which had nearly that exact storyline, it exists, it's on ffnet and would either be rated T or M, not that it narrows down your search all that much, but it does exist!

** I vaguely recall reading something years and years ago that had Ginny secretly being Harry's sister. I can't help but think it was still a Harry/Ginny story in spite of (or perhaps because of) that particular plot twist.

*** OK, I went through (or at least gave a look) at the recommended stories there, and the result is rather unpersuasive.

- linkffn(12032761) --- yes, it is terrible. Lord and Lady Potter (that's Harry and Ginny) marrying multiple (and I mean multiple, five or more) girls, I haven't survived enough who will be the husband for the Lady Guinevere Potter (yes, they call her that). Grrr.
- linkffn(9355381) --- horribly tortured almost dying five year old Harry found by random tramps in London, who call him Sky (without much reason). Whatever.
- linkffn(5012016) --- The very first sentence “My name is Countess Daphne Potter.” Tortured and maimed body of Harry is found on the lawn of the Greengrass manor, where also horribly abused Daphne founds and transfers him to the neighbouring Potter Manor (which Harry never heard about, but otherwise everybody else can see it clearly). Enough.
- linkffn(6101434) --- short, sweet, and fluffy. Pairing here is Hinny, and thanks for that, because it turns out Hermione is not only like Harry's big sister, it turns out after the Battle that she is exactly that. No more plot than that. At least, not horribly stupid, which is better than the rest of the lot.

  6th year AU. Dumbledore messed with Harry's family even more than anyone suspected. Ginny discovers that she was born Guinevere Potter. Harry discovers that, in a twisted system, the power of having multiple houses to his name is undeniable. He sets out to turn this twisted system against itself; and maybe restore the nobility of the former kings. Harry/Luna/harem, dark

  AU. Harry Potter was abandoned by the Dursleys to the streets and later found by an Unspeakable, who tells him of his identity, inheritance and destiny. Under a new name Harry sets out to right the wrongs that has been done to him. Wolfstar slash later in the story.

** It's in our nature to avoid incestuous relationships. Ginny and Ron, having been brought up together as toddlers, are going to see each other as siblings and be repulsed by the thought of being in a romantic relationship with each other, even if, from a purely genetic standpoint, nothing is wrong with it.
