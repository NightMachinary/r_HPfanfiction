In a lot of fics and even to a certain degree in canon, Remus keeping Sirius's animagus abilities a secret is often depicted as Remus being ashamed or scared of how Dumbledore will see him or even out of some remnant piece of loyalty to Sirius.

However, considering Remus's reaction to Peter being the traitor, I'm pretty sure the reason Remus kept it a secret and joined the staff was so that he could get the opportunity to murder Sirius himself. Remus tries so hard to be someone nonthreatening that its easy to forget that he was very much thirsting for revenge. I think Remus is often times made out to be a softer person than he actually is. If Remus had not found out about Wormtail and had managed to find Sirius, I very much feel that he would have brutally murdered Sirius Black himself, or at least .

Anyway, I think it would be interesting if more fics explored these kind of darker selfish motivations. Part of what I find so lovable about Lupin is that he's a more gray character at times. When he thought Sirius was the traitor, I think he knowingly put others in danger by keeping secrets in order to get revenge by his own hands and I like the complexity of that kind of character.


** After reading this, I still think that shame played a very big role in why Lupin never told Voldemort about "Padfoot". I also think that he only accepted the post because Sirius had escaped and Dumbledore asked him personally to protect the school against him (without these 2 events, he would have "happily" stayed in whatever hole he was surviving).

But I think you have a point about Remus "darker" side. If he had met Sirius without learning about Peter survival, he would probably have attacked to kill, not contain.

** I figured he probably assumed Dumbledore knew.

After all, there's no way (in his mind) that the three other Marauders all snuck outside of the grounds all night one night a month for several years without the all-seeing Dumbledore noticing.

Dumbledore's own cultivated reputation for omniscience bites him in the ass again.

** That would work if not for the bit where Lupin guilt trip's Harry about sneaking around with his parents' sacrifice. Because if Lupin was so tunnel-visioned on revenge, that bit of dialogue does not feel right.

Also, if Sirius was really the traitor (and therefore capable of blowing up a whole street with one spell), I am somewhat dubious of Lupin's ability to actually defeat Sirius. Because let's face it, we never see Lupin perform impressive magic and he doesn't even have a successful animagus transformation to his name.

I think people often underestimate Lupin´s magical skills.

He survived the First war while fighting on front lines, then in Second war he got through all the battles we know about without any scrapes (in the Ministry fight he was basicaly the last one standing, whereas Aurors like Mad-Eye or Tonks were down, Sirius was even killed). The only time he was defeated was in the Battle of Hogwarts and that was after months of him practising only defensive spells.

While I don´t think he was the best duelist of the bunch I´d say he was pretty skilled

**** Surviving a war is not necessarily an indicator of skill, especially if your side is losing badly. Best example here would be the many German aces who scored 100, 200 or even more air victories, many of whom perished. If you scroll through the Wikipedia list, you have to go past 50 Germans, two Finns, a Romanian and a Japanese before you reach the first allied pilot (a Soviet). The first American entry is around position 80, the British even further below, and they won the war.

Likewise, I bet that Moody was a better fighter than many who survived the Battle of Hogwarts. And we saw Bellatrix win a 1v3 fight only to end up dead.

All 3 battled Bellatrix, who is in league with Snape. Kingsley took on the Lestrange bros then Bella I believe. Lupin took on Crabbe *or* Goyle then Lucius. Not really the best argument for Lupin's skills.
