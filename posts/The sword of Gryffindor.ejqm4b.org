A complete story where the sword plays a heavy part in the plot. (Important enough that Harry always keeps it with him.) Something more than just killing snakes big and small.


** I mean the fic Harry Potter and The Sowrd of Gryffindor has this.

I ploughed through it (hehe) and it was fun!

*** I know that everyone had their own tastes and opinions and I acknowledge Harry Crow deserves a spot somewhere for it being such a popular fic early in days of HP fanfiction...

You /really/ think Harry Crow is a great fic?

***** My personal issue is that 1) it's a feel good fic where the good guys never truly suffer and everything goes their way so there's a lack of conflict 2) it has goblins being so superior to wizards in every way magically and physically 3) all they want is apparently to be equal to wizards

****** IMHO, Harry Crow /was/ a good fic... *when* it was written. Since then, many, many more fics have been written and so the goalposts have moved. Harry Crow is now close to the "it's good for a bad fic/bad for a good fic" border, although the exact side of the line it is on varies according to the reader.

Although Harry Crow does have some eye-rolling moments, it is technically well written, the idiot ball is not randomly passed between characters, status quo is not god and the characters don't undergo random, unexplained personality shifts.

I'm not saying it's a brilliant story, but it could so easily have been worse.
