I've read so many fanfiction where Lucius is the true believer and Narcissa being this benevolent force like a Dark Molly Weasley. I want some where the roles are reversed; I don't care about whose POV it is or any pairings or if it's even a side facet of a larger fic. Give me the woman whose "true" sister is Bellatrix!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** There's a lot of benevolent sexism in HP fanfiction. It's not just Narcissa and Bellatrix, but also Petunia. Those women are often portrayed as innocent little flowers and/or battered wives, who just can't do anything against the oppressive power of the evil men who control them.

*** Those writers often forgot that Witches were relatively far more powerful than Muggle women. Advantages in physical strength didn't mean much there.

The most laughable trope is however abuser Ron, when canon Hermione was the physically violent one, and she beat him 7 out of 10 times in duels.

*** Narcissa is kinda easily redeemable compared to the others though. I mean, she lied into the Dark Lord's face about Harry being dead, and the only time she directly antagonised Harry, he was practically baiting her. (Lucius, on the other hand, was genuinely evil.)

Petunia is kinda ironic, since Vernon seems genuinely scared of her at times - remember the very first chapter?

Bellatrix. I suppose you could say that her madness was some sort of botched bewitchment or something, but in reality it mostly due to Helena Bonham Carter's rather sexy portrayal of her.
