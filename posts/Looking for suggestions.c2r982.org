I'm looking for good, long stories that have Harry shaking Draco's hand to make friends and joining Slytherin instead of Gryffindor.

The story doesn't need to be done and I would prefer it to be at least teen rating or more. I find that general audiences or e for everyone doesn't nearly pique my interest as the more gory or risqu√© ones do.

I generally read on Ao3 though I am open to FanFiction.Net stories as well. I honestly don't know of any other good places for fanfiction so if anyone has any suggestions there I will take those as well.

Thank you in advance!


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) has Harry shaking hands with Draco, although he ends up in Ravenclaw. It's pretty controversial here, some people hate it, some love it, you got to try it your to see which group you are in.

*** I will add that this story has its own site, hpmor.com if I remember correctly, where you can download it as a pdf, epub, mobi, ect. I'm sure it's also on AO3 and other sites.

I personally have read this story and love it, but sometimes it's too technical or science-y for others, or too out of character. It varies person to person.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
