Throughout many stories I've noticed various bits of common trivia.

- Sewage and other waste is magically vanished by common enchantments and runes.

- The killing and imperio curse is used on farm animals (or a similar magic by house elves)

- Couples use lust potions in the bedroom

- Inmates at askaban are fed nourishment potions by the dementors

- There's a gringotts branch in every major wizarding country.

- Asia and eastern europe are much more accepting of dark magic and therefore dont have problems with "dark lords".

- Snakes are magically bound to obey parseltongues unless specifically enchanted like the basilisk.

- Wands are custom crafted for customers in knocturn alley / Ollivander does custom crafts for a high price.

- The ministry doesn't shut down knocturn alley because theres a huge % of wizards who secretly use dark magic.

- There are Veela covens in the world and sometimes a lucky guy gets to visit.

- Mastering and tapping into the power of accidental magic is the key to wandless magic.

** Sewage and other waste is magically vanished by common enchantments and runes. -This was true according to Pottermore. Before plumbing, wizards would poop wherever they wanted and then vanish it

The killing and imperio curse is used on farm animals (or a similar magic by house elves) -Definitely not true. The killing curse requires hatred and there's a reason for that.

Couples use lust potions in the bedroom -Not canon but it is plausible. You can use it in your fics.

Inmates at askaban are fed nourishment potions by the dementors -No idea. We're never told how inmates are fed.

There's a gringotts branch in every major wizarding country. -Never mentioned in canon, you can say it's true if you want to.

Asia and eastern europe are much more accepting of dark magic and therefore dont have problems with "dark lords". -Definitely not true. The Japanese school wears school robes that turn white if you use Dark Magic. This is mentioned to be a terrible disgrace, which results in expulsion and a trial at their Ministry

Snakes are magically bound to obey parseltongues unless specifically enchanted like the basilisk. -No evidence towards it in canon.

Wands are custom crafted for customers in knocturn alley / Ollivander does custom crafts for a high price. -No evidence in canon.

The ministry doesn't shut down knocturn alley because theres a huge % of wizards who secretly use dark magic. -They don't shut it down because it isn't what fanon says it is. It's a regular alley, it just has a few shady people in it.

There are Veela covens in the world and sometimes a lucky guy gets to visit. -No idea.

Mastering and tapping into the power of accidental magic is the key to wandless magic. -No evidence towards it but it makes sense. Magic is guided by willpower.

Vanishing isn't really an enchantment or rune (and for that matter, there's little evidence that runes themselves have magical power). It's a spell you cast on the spot. I'm pretty sure he was referring to the idea that the toilets are enchanted with a "vanishing flush".

#+begin_quote
  -Definitely not true. The killing curse requires hatred and there's a reason for that.

Common fanon misconception. It's never stated that you need hate to cast the killing curse. It is only stated that you need power - by fake Moody in GoF.

1. What she says is that he needs to "mean it". So with the Cruciatus to be able to cast it, he has to genuinely want the person in pain (as opposed to merely wanting them disabled). With the Killing Curse, he would need to genuinely want the person dead. That doesn't require hate, merely the desire for the curse to do its job.

2. In any case, it's not clear if what she says applies to all the Unforgiveables or just the Cruciatus. She introduces it as about the Unforgiveables, but goes on to say more that clearly only applies to the Cruciatus. So the text is ambiguous.

3. It's unclear if Bellatrix is reliable on this matter, because in DH Harry casts the Cruciatus successfully with righteous anger, exactly the thing Bellatrix says is not possible in OotP.

**** u/RedKorss:
#+begin_quote
  This ancient Japanese school has the smallest student body of the eleven great wizarding schools and takes students from the age of seven (although they do not board until they are eleven). While day students, wizarding children are flown back and forth to their homes every day on the backs of a flock of giant storm petrels. The ornate and exquisite palace of Mahoutokoro is made of mutton-fat jade, and stands on the topmost point of the 'uninhabited' (or so Muggles think) Volcanic island of Minami Iwo Jima.

  Students are presented with enchanted robes when they arrive, which grow in size as they do, and which gradually change colour as the learning of their wearer increases, beginning a faint pink colour and becoming (if top grades are achieved in every magical subject) gold. If the robes turn white, this is an indication that the student has betrayed the Japanese wizard's code and adopted illegal practices (which in Europe we call 'Dark' magic) or broken the International Statute of Secrecy. To 'turn white' is a terrible disgrace, which results in instant expulsion from the school and trial at the Japanese Ministry for Magic. Mahoutokoro's reputation rests not only on its impressive academic prowess, but also on its outstanding reputation for Quidditch, which, legend has it, was introduced to Japan centuries ago by a band of foolhardy Hogwarts students who were blown off course during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe on wholly inadequate broomsticks. Rescued by a party of wizarding staff from Mahoutokoro, who had been observing the movements of the planets, they remained as guests long enough to teach their Japanese counterparts the rudiments of the game, a move they lived to regret. Every member of the Japanese Quidditch team and the current Champion's League winners (the Toyohashi Tengu) attributes their prowess to the gruelling training they were given at Mahoutokoro, where they practise over a sometimes turbulent sea in stormy conditions, forced to keep an eye out not only for the Bludgers but also for planes from the Muggle airbase on a neighbouring island.

** First off as far as canon goes- whether you like it or not- it is anything written by the author for the universe she created. The same goes for any book series. So the books (yes, even the play,) Fantastic Beasts, Pottermore, etc, anything she wrote or helped write is canon. This doesn't mean it's perfect or doesn't contradict itself sometimes. She's human after all.

Anything outside of the canon established by the author is fanon. This reddit page deals specifically in fanon.

Now, on the topic of Ollivander making customs wands, that would be false. His father did work that way, and in earlier times that was how it worked. I suppose that there may be possible with non-Ollivander wandmakers, but so far as the man himself, it's the wand chooses the wizard.

  I actually don't have problems with some tropes as long as they don't contradict canon. But Ron the Death Eater (where the hell did that come from?) and Hadrian Potter lord of Black-Gamp-Malfoy-Gryffindor-Merlin-Newton-Picasso-Every single person's family (what the hell?) where did these come from?

From people Trying to fix canon Harry. They think if they make him into Super!Harry, Indy!Harry, Lord!Harry that would make him better. It often does not. Ron the Death Eater comes from movies shitty portrayal of Ron.

Thank god! I always found it a bit odd that Sirius and James were portrayed as stupid when they were the youngest animagi ever as far as we know. They created the Marauders' Map and nothing like that exists in canon until now. They were abducted into the Order /right after graduation/. Seriously. I also never understood the concept that Remus was cleverer than them because he was studious and bookish. I'm glad that McGonagall describing them as too bright for their own good is canon.

I think that they are overshadowed by Snape. Snape had fifteen years to practice while Sirius was on the run and James was dead. I'm sure that had they lived out their lives properly then they would have become prodigies like Snape.

Besides, we know that Bellatrix had already graduated when Sirius was just starting his first year at Hogwarts. While they both admittedly served a lot of time in Azkaban, Bellatrix already had had /much more practice/ than Sirius when he joined the Order. When they duelled, they seemed equal. If it weren't for Sirius getting too cocky then the fight would've lasted much longer I'd expect. Sirius lasted better than Kingsley, actually. Thats not bad for a man thats been out of practice for /15 years/.

I'm really glad that isn't actually canon. I think because that they were troublemakers people interpret that as fools. Troublemaker does not equal stupid. Look at Fred and George. Also, Sirius wasn't exactly the smartest man in OotP but that wasn't the point of his character. It's understandable - Sirius spent 16 years of his life living with his parents, 12 years of his life being mentally and emotionally tortured while being starved. 3 on the run and 'free'. He only ever truly spent time with James for around 10 years? Maybe 11? He sent more time in Azkaban than with his best friend. *Ouch*. He returned into his childhood house where he was 99.9% most likely abused. Of course he was going to crack!

  That's fanon trying to make Lily into a Hermione
#+end_quote

Thank you! I will close a fan fiction when Lily is Hermione. Lily was her own person - not Hermione. Lily was charming, cheeky, very funny and vivacious. She also seemed extroverted. I don't get how she's suddenly introverted, a bookworm, a know-it-all and all panicky about exams. Lily seemed relaxed in canon. If I had to choose a character who Lily is the most like in personality, that'd be Ginny (not that she /is/ Ginny). Just because she and Hermione were both smart mugglebron witches doesn't mean that they both had the same personality. I kinda get where they are coming from - I really do but Lily was her own person, get over it.

Honestly, to me, Lily is overrated in brains. I don't get why they are now applying a quote about Hermione onto Lily but whatever. Lily was only ever described as clever at potions. Nothing else. She had a wand good for charms but that doesn't automatically mean that she was the Princess of Enchanters.

When they bring up being Head Girl, I always say that that doesn't necessarily mean that she was the smartest of her year. A girl in her year might've been a child prodigy but maybe she didn't have good leadership abilities. Head Girl isn't just given out to good grades. It's also for someone who has good leadership abilities, decent grades and a personality people would aspire to have.

Thrice defied. When this comes up I sorta roll my eyes. It seems farfetched that two teenagers barely out of school would duel the greatest dark wizard that ever surfaced on the planet and /thwart/ him. Three freakin' times. Worse yet, coming away unscathed. I take thrice defied as this, personally: Joining the Order, refusing his offer to join the Death Eaters and getting married.

I hate the fact that Voldemort wanted to recruit a muggleborn witch but that means that Lily must've been exceptional if Voldemort wasn't more interested in James than Lily that is. Honestly, if he wants to recruit a pureblood wizard from a filthy rich, extremely powerful family then he'd have a look at his wife before even knowing her blood status and her capabilities. Remember, Voldemort didn't only seek powerful duelists but he also sought well-connected and respected families - we can tell that from Lucius Malfoy.

Marlene McKinnon and her whole newly given personality always irked me. I'm glad for an answer. Thanks! Did you mean /The Life and Times/, though?

I was always disappointed by Ron's portray in the films. When he stands on his broken foot to tell a mass murderer that he needs to kill him first instead of his best friend that was truly wonderful. But they gave that moment to Hermione. /Of course/, while Ron whined in the background.

Thanks for answering my questions though! =)

***** Here are some quote about the two marauders :

/"Black and Potter. Ringleaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course--exceptionally bright, in fact--but I don't think we've ever had such a pair of troublemakers --"/

Minerva Mcgonagall PoA

/It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong--one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it./

Remus Lupin PoA

/"Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool"/

Remus Lupin OoTP

I often use them to counter those claiming they are dumb for some reasons probably due to Jo's fail to depict that cleverness into act or simply due to a personnal dislike for the characters. The two marauders are usually opposed to Snape and his cleverness being his main -if not the best of his- traits I imagine that it is painful to have his nemesis rivalling or even surpassing him on that matter.

****** But you don't know, do you? Lily is not only a goddes of charms. Lily defies all of Gamp's Laws of Transfiguration because she is secretly the descant of Merlin and the four founders! Lily Evans could cast the patronus charm at the age of 11 both wandlessly and non verbally! She gets straight 'O's in every single subject without studying and she was offered to be moved into Seventh Year when she was just 11. How very dare you say such things about Lily Evans! The mother of Harry Potter!

In all seriousness though, Lily is criminally overrated and underrated. I can't comprehend why Lily can't be her won person - I just can't. When she /is/ her own person then she defies most of her characteristics of canon - like extroversion and sociability. Oh yes, she also suddenly makes a veela look like a troll.

She is underrated by *some* and only some Snape fans. 'Why did she end the friendship! OMG! She's just as bad as James!'

It's because she knows her selfworth - get over yourself.

  Wands are custom crafted for customers in knocturn alley / Ollivander does custom crafts for a high price. Ollivander made custom wands for Pettigrew and Luna, the former under coercion, the latter because she had lost her wand when she was abducted.

** Little of this is canon (I'm thinking especially of the 'sewage' thing, as runes aren't magic in canon, of snakes being bound to Parselmouths, and of custom-crafted wands), though some of it isn't /contradicted/ by canon (Gringotts branches in other countries, the Ministry not shutting down Knockturn because the relevant officials are corrupt themselves).

I'm not sure about wandless magic. /Some/ of it presumably works as you describe, judging from Tom's pre-Hogwarts mastery of wandless magic. However, it seems that in other cases advanced wizards perform simple spells by waving around their hand mimicking the wand movement, which is something else entirely.
