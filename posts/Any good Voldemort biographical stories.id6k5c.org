I was wondering whether you knew any stories about Tom Riddle's rise to power when he is still discovering the dark arts and still has to rely on his charisma and charm to gain followers. I would prefer no time travel or significant deviation from his canonical personality (i.e. him falling in love) but, otherwise, everything is welcome.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

*** Can you put a link to it?

I am more curious about what people came up with either his time prior to opening the Chamber of Secrets (like how he discovered his origins or how he gained his gang) or his time between Hogwarts and the First War (such as his time as an employee at Borgin and Burkes or the ten missing years mentioned in HBP).
