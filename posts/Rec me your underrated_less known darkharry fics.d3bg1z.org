**** Just read it and it's definitely underrated. Harry's characterisation and magical development feels a bit forced but it has some great ideas. A jewel in the rough.

** Cleo Theo does some cool Dark Harry stories. And she's a really good writer. She's on FF

*** Counter-recommendation (? Is that a thing?): I used to like cleotheo's fics a lot, but I found that their fics quickly grew stale. If I recall, they often featured a lot of Dark-side worship, as well as overpowering Hermione, Draco and (occasionally) Harry into perfect Mary/Gary Sue versions of themselves. Action was also relatively sparse, especially given the length and nature of some of her fics. Her Dark Lady Rises series, for example, outlines how Hermione becomes the new Dark Lady, yet much of the series revolves around her romance with Draco, and how beautiful and powerful she is. I could count on one hand the number of action scenes in the series, which is impressive considering that the word count totals up to nearly 300k.

Writing style-wise, cleotheo also does this thing I absolutely loathe, which is blowing through important details and events in recap-style, and not really taking the time or effort to flesh them out into actual scenes.

  The world is a complex place, one of many subtle things that separate us Wizards though, many of them view the world as black and white, light and dark, good and evil. Albus Dumbledore is one of those people. So when Lord Voldemort fell the world rejoiced, and Dumbledore thought Harry Potter, the Saviors of the light to be just that his saviour. He is in for one hell of a surprise.
