*** Harry's hair is very messy. Scraggly. Disheveled. Shaggy.

The reason they always believe the person in a suit is actually a monster is because they're in hiding and can't use magic to defend themselves without drawing attention.

Hell, Harry has a history of apparating while being chased. The chase sequences are completely canon.

  Blowing up his Aunt Marge had been very satisfying at the time and when he left the Dursleys, Harry had no intention of ever returning. A meeting with a dog escalates into a lot of trouble for a lot of people. Not everyone can overcome their fear to act with courage.
