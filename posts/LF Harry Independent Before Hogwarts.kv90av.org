So yeah, basically i want something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7931017/1/Harry-Daniels-and-the-Order-of-Shadows]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5178251/1/30-Minutes-That-Changed-Everything]] Where Harry already learned a lot about magic... before going to hogwarts

idc the circumstances potters aiive, he has a twin, or he got a teacher or whatever

idc about pairings as long as it isnt slash he could be having a harem or sharing his life forever with only one person in a soulbond

idc if hes f'ckin the Black sisters with age potions since he was 5

Idc if hes OP, Dark, Grey or Light

Idc if hes heir to Black,Griffindor,Slytherin,Ravenclaw,Huffpuff, Lord Hogwarts or Heir to Merlin and Morgna Ke fay and discovered Arcane Magics

Idc if he joins and Order, a secret society or is part in the reptilian conspirasy with the Parseltongue

Idc about Weasley and/or Dumbledore bashing

Like i said i only care that hes independent and Went to study magic before Hogwarts (Preferently if he realises Hogwats is a bad school)
