Hey Folks!

I've read more Harry Potter FanFiction than I'd ever admit and I've accrued quite the collection of story ideas. However, I just can't seem to get ink to paper. I've got two stories in particular (one I've started and another I've only outlined) that I'd really like to get fleshed out - if for no other reason than to not forget about them. Would anyone be interested in writing a couple of scenes based on some of my ideas? I'd be particularly interested in a longer-term back-and-forth deal.

Thanks for your time and consideration - hopefully it's alright to post this here! :)


** Hey! I'm in almost the exact same situation!! PM your ideas and let's see if we have some plot-chemistry

** I'd love to help too. I tend to write a scene for a story I want to write and then not know where to take it from there. I would be interested to see if helping you could instigate my own writing. Feel free to PM if interested.
