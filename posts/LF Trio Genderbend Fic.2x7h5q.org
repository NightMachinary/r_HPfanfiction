I recently stumbled upon this [[http://www.deviantart.com/art/Quick-Kip-381824112][picture]] and it has made me interested in reading a fic that has a genderbend trio?

are there any decent ones?

Summary: Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

Harry Potter - Rated: M - English - Drama/Romance - Chapters: 16 - Words: 70,404 - Reviews: 1375 - Favs: 2,185 - Follows: 2,539 - Updated: Sep 18, 2014 - Published: Nov 16, 2007 - Harry P., Luna L.

Harry is shunted into a universe where /everyone/ is the opposite gender, including a female version of himself. The only exception: Luna Lovegood. Got to a point and then fizzled, but the author updated it out of the blue back in September. I'm fond of the writing and many of the contrasted character names, but in the execution there are more than a few pronoun errors that disrupt immersion. Also the whole world is value-inverted, where women are the dominant and aggressive sex, which adds to the feeling of misalignment.

*** The author's conception of how society perceives women and men is strange. Apparently our society see's all women as lacking sufficient "aggression" to have a major effect, because in the AU world fem!Voldemort thinks this of all men? Even though there are men like dude!McGonagle who are proven, powerful, and authority holding people. And what about the dude!Bellatrix, fem!Voldie's most devout servant, who surely had a MASSIVE impact in the first war?

** I would be interested in this as well. I've seen loads of stories with girl Harry, only one with boy Hermione, and none with girl Ron. Obviously none with all three.

**** Weasley Girl was very entertaining and reasonably well done. The fact that it's unfinished was a downer, but it seems to be updated recently. Thanks for the rec!
