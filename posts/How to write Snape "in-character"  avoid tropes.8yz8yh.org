Wanting to try my hand at some a angst/romance/slow burn fanfic starring everyone's favorite potions master, but since I haven't read the books in so long I'm worried I'll make him into this lame flat character that just sneers a lot while crossing his arms. So I come to you gentle readers & writers for some advice:

*Snape & Fanfiction*

- Any character traits he had that many seem to overlook when writing fanfic?

- Unique patterns of speech? Expressions?

- Any Snape tropes that I need to make sure I avoid? (Like Dumbledore with lemon drops)

- What would YOU like to see as readers?

- Any advice in general for approaching the writing of a Snape fic?

Thank you!


** Just remember, despite wanting to protect Harry because, ya know, he's an absolute asshole to everyone, but especially towards Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville.

While it's tempting to just write him as a stern teacher - partially because that's how he's portrayed more as in the movies - Snape is actually a bully and a garbage person. He's very brave - close to fearless really - and extremely smart, but he's garbage.

*** I don't know, I think there's some room for interpretation here. I mean, we know he's extra shitty to Harry and his friends, ergo he has to be /less/ shitty to everybody else.

I feel like sometimes people overcompensate, especially when it comes to Snape's teaching. He may be a huge asshole, but there's not a lot to suggest he's not generally an effective teacher.

**** Generally he's an alright teacher, but we saw marked improvement with Slughorn's style. Notably, we never see anyone improve at potions - those that are good are good and those that are bad remain bad.

The way he erased Harry's potions in the fifth book but left Crabbe and Goyle's also speaks of poor teaching as a teacher. It has been my opinion for years that Snape would have been better as, say, Madame Pomfrey's personal potioneer and someone else teaches the class because Snape's good at his subject but a poor teacher.

Sort of like Hagrid (except Hagrid's problem comes down to people being too soft to critique him and those that do act like asses so no one listens).

***** After several years of college, Snape strikes me as a fantasy version of the tenured PhD professor who's an absolute /genius/ in his field and is basically impossible to oust from his position for what he brings to the institution (research money in the real world, spy in HP) but /awful/ at actually teaching his subject to others because he understands everything so intuitively and thoroughly that he can't really comprehend someone needing more than what he provides in lecture and homework.

With an extra dash of asshole because this is still a fantasy story and he's still an antagonist until basically the very end.

****** That's like a lot of professors at my university. They are all very smart and clearly know what they are doing in their field but many of them are not good teachers. I'm fairly sure they are only at the university to do research and teach because its required in their contract. They put a premade slideshow on the board and read it to us word for word and are horrible at answering questions. They often seem incapable of understanding why we don't just "get it". Not all my processors are like that, some are very good teachers and clearly enjoy teaching but the rest are just bad.

** Well, in the fanfictions I have read so far, I see a lot of the time Snape is always using big words and talking without using contractions, BUT I am reading through the books again and Snape is like always using contractions and also not too many big words. So yes please don't make Snape not use contractions and do not try to make him use lots of big words. He does prefer snappy simple words when he is being mean to people.

** Please no Snape in velvet robes playing piano by the fireplace, or MotherGoose!Snape. Don't overdo it in the other direction and have Snape publicly whipping students and copulating with corpses either. And remember that he's pretty young in all of this. Still in high school when he joins the Death Eaters, in his early 20's by the time the main events have happened, and only 31 when the books start. Dead before 40. McGonagall has a good 30 years on him and they're not going to sit there like two old crones, she would look at him and see a little boy probably. Pretty much most of the staff are older than him, too.

Positives: Remember that he is bright and inventive. Probably constantly inventing new spells or working on weird dark magic in his spare time, not just hunching over cauldrons. He is very intelligent, knowledgeable, perceptive and eloquent. There is very likely an entire academic/creative side to him that we don't see, and a frustrating career that's punching below his weight, kind of like Walter White stuck teaching Chemistry to teenage morons when he could have been a billionaire. He is unflinching under tremendous pressure and even spilling his sarcastic personality in the presence of Voldemort. He's not afraid to stand up to both of his bosses. He also has a quick wit and a sense of humour, so he'd constantly have biting remarks and witty comebacks in every conversation, but they'd be very dark, rude and morbid. He also somehow manages to do lesson prep, teach, do homework and administrative duties, sort out teenage drama, and at the same time attend Death Eater meetings, possibly endure torture, possibly socialise with Death Eaters, report with the Order, and spare some time for banter. And it looks like it's all on a couple hours of sleep each day because he's stalking the halls all night too. So, very busy.

Negatives: He is a horrible teacher. Mr. Garrison from South Park-level horrible. He plays favourites and doesn't hide it. He's not physically sadistic to the students, but he does enjoy bullying them and having them do disgusting detentions. Less Filch and Umbridge and more guts and pus. He will probably have every bad habit from every poor people of reddit thread ever, and his hygiene and sense of style are lacking. He would not have silk ribbons for his luscious hair or silver cuff links with emeralds on them. He is very immature, almost like an overgrown teenager, takes everything very personally and would bully a teenage girl over her teeth. I also think that because of his rough background and this being the 90's, he'd not be reporting and coddling abused students and having the entire body of staff baby them. I think there is nothing parental in him, he is very closed off, almost too traumatised to function like a normal person. He treats teenagers like his peers instead of being a mature adult. If there's any situation like that he would likely be very private, discreet, very direct and pretty distant. He also has a fascination with the morbid, that is not necessarily sadistic in nature, but he's probably reading about deathy creepy things in his spare time. I also think he's bordering on incel/forever alone, but perhaps only in his head and not outwardly. He seems very polite to Narcissa. If you include relationships they would have to be even more dysfunctional than his professional life, maybe with occasional emotional outbursts just like his dad.

Speech: Snape has a pretty broad vocabulary, but he comes from a very rough, lower-class background. I imagine, growing up in Slytherin, he would have tried to emulate his wealthier classmates, but he still constantly makes slips in his accent, word choice and manners, especially when he's angry. He calls people "smelly" all the time. Look at snippets from the documentary "7 up" to see the very distinct difference in how children speak when they're the same age, but of different backgrounds. The wealthiest children talk like ponces even when they're seven. Well, Gordon Ramsay is also a northern Englishman and extremely aggressive. Imagine if he was also clinically depressed and somehow even more dickish and you get Snape.

** What a great question! Kudos for attempting to write Snape as IC as possible. He's not difficult to write, but very difficult to write /well./ If you write a snarky, vindictive character, he will quickly feel like Snape, but all his nuances are a lot harder to get right. It's easy to make him either too good or too evil, depending on how much of a fan you are of him.

I think an important thing to keep in mind when writing Snape is that he comes from a working class background. I often see him written like Lucius, using long words and impeccable manners, but in reality he's more like Filch. Depending on the story you have in mind, you probably could write him as someone who wants to break free of his past by adopting higher class behaviour, but even then he would make mistakes and revert to his working class ways when he's emotional, for example.

A second thing is that he's socially awkward, and very much so. Fandom seems to have made him into someone with a keen insight into other people's motivations and a great understanding of emotions, but that's not really who he is. I've never seen anyone else mention this before, but I personally think of Snape as autistic and would love to see him written like that more often. I think he's not only mean and paranoid because of his past, but also because he genuinely doesn't understand other people's behaviour and has become suspicious of everyone as a result. A Snape like that is not very attractive, but then again, he never was.

Last, Snape in the book has a sense of mystery, because we're never quite sure what side he's on and what his motivations are until the end. I love it when fics retain that mystery and a lot of my favourite ones do, though it's not at all easy.

I've personally made all these mistakes when I was writing Snape, so I'm happy to share what I've learned. Hope it helps!

** I haven't written a lot of Snape (he doesn't exist in the AU fanfic I'm writing... his female counterpart does, but she supposedly died before the story started) but one thing I think might be a good thing to keep in mind with Snape is that his biggest emotion, the one that controls or at least influences all his actions, is BITTERNESS.

While Alan Rickman's Snape isn't exactly the same character as the Snape in the books... too calm and collected... there is one scene in the last movie that REALLY sums up Snape as a character for me: The scene where he finds Lily's dead body and grieves over her. If you look at that scene, you might notice how he's cradling Lily while Baby Harry is crying in the background... and Snape completely ignores the crying baby, because he can only focus on Lily.

And THAT'S Snape. He doesn't see what's THERE, he just sees what ISN'T there. He can't let go of the past, and he can't ever truly appreciate what he has because he's too focused on what he DOESN'T have... what he lost, what he never had in the first place. And so he's a man consumed by his bitterness, a man who finds it easier to just loathe the world in general than to give it a chance. He's immature and petty, and probably takes some twisted joy in spreading his own misery to a world that in his eyes doesn't deserve any better -- a world that in his eyes took everything away from him.

Except of course the world DIDN'T take away everything. He still had quite a bit, except once again he never could appreciate what he had because he was too focused on what he DIDN'T have. In my eyes, Snape's the most tragic and pitiful character in the franchise. He had an awful life, and he let it destroy him.

** Snape is not a silky smooth mystery man like the movies portray him, unless you're going for movie version but let's assume you mean books. Many seem to ignore the fact that he has sallow skin and greasy hair. He also has a large hooked nose and resembles an overgrown bat. Severus Snape is stubborn, aggressive, and very sarcastic. Avoid describing his voice as silky or smooth or whatever. His voice is oily if anything. Like he really is depicted in the books as a horrible character only redeemed by DH. TBH if you're going to write him into any romance that doesn't involve some seriously problematic things, it's best to go for movie Snape who is a much more sympathetic character.

*** Also a few other tips.

- He hates everyone but his own house

- He despises Sirius Black with a burning passion and was barely willing to let him live, even if he was innocent

- He holds on to the past much too tightly

- He yells. A lot. Especially at Harry and the Gryffindors (Usually when Hermione asks too many questions and when Harry and Neville exist in close proximity to him for any amount of time)

- He is biased for his own house like nothing else. He will cheat, lie and bully to try to ensure his own house ends up ahead, including letting Slytherins attack Gryffindor quidditch players in the halls.
