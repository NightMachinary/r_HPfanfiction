An Invisibility Cloak, rare as they are, could be used to break into a bank. Newt Scamander easily broke into a vault without even planning it. Or a Disillusionment Charm.

If you had access to a Time Turner, you could easily win the lottery.

As you can trade muggle money for galleons, what's to stop wizards from doing this? Maybe Gringotts has a strict limit to how much you can trade during a week or something. Maybe the ICW put together a special team to look for wizards trying to manipulate the muggle world?


** No reason at all.

Accio. Confundus. Reparo. Alohamora. Apparation.

There is very little to stop a wizard from taking whatever he wishes from muggles, without leaving a trace of evidence, assuming they're careful enough.

If it comes down to value then nothing is duplicatable because everything has some value, but that's clearly not the case, so it would have to be some intrinsic property of the material. Also, gemino duplicated tons of gold in the Lestrange vault, so even that isn't off limits. In fact the only limit it has in canon is that the duplicate eventually degrades.

***** Problem: Value is a rather subjective, hell gold is rather... worthless on it's own. Some uses in electronics but other then that... Diamonds are literally worthless except for the perceived value (and some utility in industry)... And anything can have value even if made from rather mundane non-valuable materials. An elaborate copper necklace with some common rocks could fetch a rather nice price, especially if you acquired it for free.

If ANYTHING that can have ANY kind of value can't be duplicated/conjured/transfigured... well then those branches of magic can't even exist.

** There must be either strict currency controls as a matter of policy or law; or (more likely) some enchantment whereby galleons are gold are not actually fungible. Goblin/Ministry probably share in the seniorage. In a world where the Philosopher's Stone exists, I'm not sure real gold can actually have value.

I'm pretty sure I saw a fic where they make decent money simply with repairing furniture and other broken mundane objects. Given the apparent power of mass repair and reconstruction shown at the end of Fantastic Beasts, it seems like easy work.

Also: kudos to Starfox for the fencing stolen old pureblood bric-a-brac at antique shops. People do love their old secretary desks and rolling cabinets.

And hey, let's brainstorm some other fun hacks that could earn money and yet not immediately get the Ministry coming down for criminal activity or violating the Statute of Secrecy: * bespoke courier package delivery (apparation, portkeys, vanishing cabinets, etc) * repairing stuff * locating service (point me, etc) * "snake oil" medicine that really works. * safety office (cushioning charms, muggle repelling on dangerous objects, etc) * storage (via expansion charms, etc) * food/cooking - just have an exemplar of yummy dish and multiply it (that's okay re: Gamp, right?)

multiple ways.

if they aren't smart about it then someone is going to notice that they have a lot of money that is difficult to account for having.

another idea is an auror with xray glasses might see the amount of muggle cash this guy exchanges periodically and it's like showing up at a bank with trash bags of bills. suspicious.

**** The muggle police will eventually notice if a bunch of duplicates of priceless antiques start turning up. Aurors would eventually notice too.

Having said that, I feel like this sort of thing could work for a muggleborn wizard post-ebay who kept it small. People would notice priceless antiques but what about just nice average ones? A few hundred pounds at a time? A person could make a modest and very easy living this way. Don't keep a lot of money in the bank at once. You could just claim to muggle and wizard alike you went to muggle yard and estate sales all the time.

The problem though is that most people would get greedy and draw attention to themselves.

****** oh honestly, it's even easier than that. Muggles outnumber wizards several times over. Just find a wealthy muggle, put him under imperious, have him get you a few millions and live a confortable life. No wizard autority is ever going to find out if you're even remotely careful. The muggle won't realize anything is amiss once you've memory charmed him.

Honestly, all this talk of antiquities and stuff is silly. Of course getting and selling unique/rare items will attract attention. But even if you think my idea were a bit risky, wizards have notice me not charms and invisibility. Simply walk into a store, grab a 10-20 bill or so, and move to the next. The storekeeper will probably just think he made a mistake with the change if relatively small amounts of money is missing while the wizard got a nice little sum in very little time. After all, with magic there is actually little one needs to actually pay for.

** I would presume there are strict laws against such things, because otherwise the Statute of Secrecy is toast. Wizards using magic to cheat and exploit Muggles financially is a pretty short-sighted tactic... it'd probably work great for a little while, and then someone would slip up and the existence of magic would be exposed in ways that couldn't easily be Memory Charmed away.

*** Laws existing doesn't mean that it's easy to catch lawbreakers (what's a minor compulsion spell here and using an invisibility cloak there? Hell, even using the IMPERIUS on muggles should be hard to detect, unless you see it being cast or the muggle comes into contact with a wizard or witch testing for the curse (if that even works, I mean Malfoy etc. pleaded Imperius after the first war, so the tests must be quite bad because they didn't catch that there was never an imperius cast on Malfoy in the first place!))

** You guys crack me up.

What would wizards need muggle money for? They're allowed to do whatever they want to muggles, so long as they don't reveal the existence of magic. Want a car? Go to the dealership, have the owner hand over the keys and then forget the whole thing, aside from a compulsion not to consider the 'loan' of the car as a big deal.

There are so many ways to simply take what they want without bothering with monetary transactions that the notion of creating/sustaining a record of ownership of such resources is just a bad idea.

*** Hm...would they then have a department that actually removes curses etc. from "muggle artifacts"?

I mean the prosecution is probably lazy (most wizards - rightly so because a wizard basically is an enhanced human being (they life longer, can take more trauma etc.) - consider muggles lesser beings!), but it does exist IMHO!

** I assume than when you convert a lot of cash you draw an attention of both Gringotts (because you screw with their money) and Ministry (because they suspect that you might've messed with the muggle world, thus endangering ISOS). And you really don't want that. Especially the first one.
