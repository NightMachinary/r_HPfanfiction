:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Well, like the title suggests, I am trying to find a fic that allows Harry to manipulate and control emotions. It was a crack fic, that was kinda cringe, but still a funny read.

I think the pairing was Harry/Harem.

I can't exactly remember what site it was on, however, I do remember that Harry could see different colors/emotions and he could manipulate their levels to what he likes.

For example, in one part, he manipulated Neville's anger so much in Potions, that he actually attacked Snape.

However, in another part, he manipulated other's emotions so badly that Malfoy was terribly injured amongst other things in the boys bathroom.

He was also subtly manipulating the emotions of Narcissa Malfoy.

For the life of me, I cannot remember the name, nor can I find it, and it has been bugging me for a few days now. So, I was hoping that you can help me find it.
