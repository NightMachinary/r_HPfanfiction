Okay, this was my 2nd attempt at writing a fic, the first was a Harry Osborn Self Insert Marvel fic. I started with good intentions, but I kinda messed up the writing. There's way too less dialogue in the fic.

The next chapter I'm writing, is supposed to be during Captain America:The first avenger.

I'm really bad at history, I don't know what Britain and USA did during WW2. I'm looking on wiki and other such websites for information, but the writing will not be good.

If anyone here can help me write the chapter, I'll be really thankful.

*** It's not that I'm not happy with it. I either make it too long with dialogues, or too short without dialogues. Most of my first 3 chapters are just big summaries.

Thank God I changed the fic. I wanted to send Harry 5000 years ago, during the first Convergence. That would have been super long.

*** Sure.. I'd like that. One question? What is a beta? I've seen that term mentioned a few times, but I don't know what it means.

**** No worries, it's basically an editor, you send your finished but unedited work to your Beta and they help organize it, correct grammar and streamline the plot so the quality of the fic stays consistent
