I know this is pretty old, but if anyone has a copy, I'd love to read it again.


** I've got a .txt copy, but if anyone has a better copy, let me know. PM me your email and the title of this fic for copies.

*Title*: Forgotten Past

*Author*: Jamesite

*Chapters*: 36

*Summary*: HP/LOTR Crossover. When a new D.A.D.A. teacher arrives at Hogwarts, word reaches the Dark Lord, and an evil older even that the Wizarding World is awakened. And this time, not even the Boy-Who-Lived will be able to save the world. Post OotP and RotK (obviously). Hermione-centric.
