Requesting fic with time travel where their younger counterpart still exist? so no replacement of their younger counterpart as the two have their own body.

Also, any fic with time turner going back in less than 24 hours doesn't count.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

** linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): The best example, Harry speed ran the Horcruxes like you wouldn't imagine, then took the fight to Voldemort in a whirlwind of violence and bubblehead charms. I know what I wrote.

linkffn(On a Pale Horse): this is actually technically an inter-dimensional story, though in theory aren't all time travel stories? Anyway, Harry is basically nutso MoD!Harrry, and he only really cares about helping out his 'shell' (his words, not mine). It can get pretty funny.

linkao3(C'est la vie by cwycross): incomplete, but Harry travels to an alternate 4th year as Hadrian (his choice of name) where Neville is the boy who lived and his counterpart is an utter prick. The author somehow makes this all enjoyable when it should just be trite and cliche.

linkffn(We are the Golden Trio!): Harry, Ron, and Hermione (plus a five day old Rose Weasley) get sent back to the beginning of 1st year. Now, they are sent into their younger bodies, but two things are here. First: the younger versions are actually still there, and scared shitless, and the three of them want to take out Voldemort as quick as possible so they can return. Two (spoiler, be warned): at the end, they split from their younger forms to deal the finishing blow to Voldemort while their younger selves watch along with half the population of the Magical Britain. Worth the read for the dynamic between the the trio, even if its a bit clunky at times.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
