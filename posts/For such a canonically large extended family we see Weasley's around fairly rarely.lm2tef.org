I want fics with Weasley's by the hundreds, lets take this to its logical endpoint, Harry goes to the ministry for his trial and ends up accidentally losing Arthur and following /four/ different redheads before finally catching back up, in his 3rd year it took an extra hour to get through the W's in the Sorting as several sets of Ron's cousins arrive at Hogwarts. Its not just the Malfoy's with a blood feud, after all if you're a wizard in Britain its a statistical impossibility for you /not/ to meet and piss one of them off. Give me a fanfic where the stereotype of the British isnt that they eat roast beef, its that they all fucking have /red hair/


** Well, there was a blood war and the Weasleys are known for being blood traitors. Maybe only one branch of the family managed to survive. But I like your idea much better.

Also, Lily spent her entire time at Hogwarts trying to convince people that she wasn't another Weasley.

"Oh, hello Mr. Weasley."

"G'day Mr. Weasley."

"Where's Mr. Weasley?"

"He's not here, Mr. Weasley."

"Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce our new collegue from the States who is joining us this year at the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Mr. Baldwin, this is Mr. Weasley. Mr. Baldwin, this is Mr. Weasley. Mr. Baldwin, this is Mr. Weasley."

"Is your name not Weasley then?"

"No, it's Baldwin."

"That's going to cause a little confusion. Mind if we call you 'Weasley' to keep it clear?"

** Harry and Hermione weaved through the mob of redheads to reach Ron on the other side of the wedding tent.

"Blimey Ron, never knew you had this many cousins, how do you keep track of 'em all ?"

"'It's easy, really we're all in groups." Ron said with a shrug

"The Original Classics." Ron gestured to himself and his own siblings and then began pointing out the other cousins, all of whom in groups of seven comprised of six boys and a girl.

** My headcanon is that same as Arthur and Molly had many boys and one girl in previous generations they used to have many girls and one boy. So genetically there are plenty of weasleys around but in surname they arent that many.

That or Arthurs cousins and siblings were all killed jn the two wars. I mean in Billy and Fleurs wedding you never met a single young weasley. So maybe most of them died.

** I have actually wondered about this before. There are allegedly so many Weasley cousins that Harry pretends to be one of them at Bill's wedding and nobody even questions it. Yet we see none of them, ever.
