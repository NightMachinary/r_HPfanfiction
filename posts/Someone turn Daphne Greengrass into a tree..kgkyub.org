I honestly hate her fanon 'ice queen of Slytherin' characterization.


** "lignum hominum", said Harry as he flished his wand in a downward spiral towards Dapne. Tears in his eyes because he couldn't hand the rejection.

The dark green spell hit her square in the chest. Everyone in the great hall watched on in silence... As nothing happened.

Until Daphne tried to move, but she felt sluggish. Unable to move her legs from the floor. Suddenly her shoes burst open as her feet started to turn into wood and extend out wards into roots that dug in into the stone floor.

Her legs started to fuse together into a large single log as she watched in horror as her beautifully manicured hands started to turn into twigs with leaves. She started to scream and flail her arm around as the wood that has been crawling up reached her neck.

Then a heavy silence hung across the great hall. Everyone looked in wonder at the small tree standing there were once Daphne stood.

** What characterization do you prefer? Because she doesn't have one in canon.

** Like an actual tree? Cause these guys did that. It's a bit scary. I hate it too, but I think it's the basis, at least, of an interesting concept. You know, when Hogwarts is a school, not a placid set piece and pureblood proving ground populated by puny politicking and pawky pre and post pubescent people.
