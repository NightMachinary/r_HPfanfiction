[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdnRUNygO0c][This video]] explains the differences between movie and book Snape. And... it's astonishing. The differences in people's perception on Snape are almost completely linked with the differences between his movie and book self.

Just watch it. It's just so obvious in hindsight.


** I always knew there was a lot left out of the movies, but as someone who primarily read the books... yea, removing all of Snape's interactions with the secondary characters and non-plot essential bullying does really change the character.

Makes me wonder if my opinion of 'Draco is an unredeamable character" who really has no business being heroic or paired with anyone has the same thing, and if you watch him just as a movie character he comes out in a better light.

*** On Draco, not really. If your primary experience is the movies, he is still and asshole with no business being heroic or paired with such. It's part of why Harry/Draco and Hermione/Draco is so stupid. It relies entirely on one or both of the characters being entirely OOC to work. They cannot function together as anything resembling their canon personality

**** I know that I am probably the last person you'd expect to argue a counterpoint here, but IMO it is possible to write a somewhat believable good Draco fic if you diverge during the summer before CoS. Namely , he is shocked by a Mudblood beating him in every test (other than maybe potions, which is rigged by Snape) and decides to investigate how Hermione is cheating, which makes him eventually realise that she isn't, which leads to him questioning pureblood supremacy after he had just disproven it by example. Works better for Hermione than for a Harry ship.

It would leave him unrecognisable compared to his late canon self, but that's the whole point of the divergence, him growing up to be a different person. Which would not make him OOC since you'd see the journey and the change.

***** I think you have a skewed idea of what OOC is.

Anything that results in a draco that is fundamentally different than the draco we see at the end of the 7th book is OOC. It's just a matter of how much he is OOC. Now, if your story takes place AFTER book 7, you can do whatever you want and just call it character growth.

****** OOC is more used to say 'unbelievably out of character'.

Taking a character at a point in canon and having them go through a different arc/evolution does not have to be unbelievably done - in which case it can still be 'in character' while resulting in a very different outlook/personality later on.

Given that fanfiction is mostly about making such changes to canon, calling any character that diverges in any way from their one canon interpretation as 'OOC' is not particularly useful IMO - it's much more so to look at how believable/'in-character' it would have been for them to react as they do in the fic.

******** Yes, but I still think you have an excessively narrow definition of it.

For instance, let's take a very simple change - Dumbledore sends Snape to deliver Harry's letter instead of Hagrid. Would you say that there is no way to have Snape react to it while being in character for that point in the story? Should seeing Harry be neglected/abused change his view of Harry - and thus affect their interactions?

I would say that Snape changing from that would be in character, not out of it - even if it ends up in a different interpretation of his character than the canon progression.

********* Would it fundamentally change Snape's personality as we see it in book 7?

Because if it wouldn't (not doesn't, wouldnt, - two very different things) then it doesn't make him ooc.

As far as I see it OOC'ness should be measured based on the final picture of a characters personality at the END of the story we know. What happens before that matters little if the end result is the same. The literary difficulty comes in making that journey make sense.

If you make Draco a heroic good guy early on and dont have something happen that forces him to resemble canon Draco, its OOC. I've read and enjoyed a few good!Draco's, doesn't make it not OOC.

Keeping a character from being OOC is about subtlety. Making changes that, from a big picture view, changes pretty much nothing about a given event/plot point, but when you zoom in or look from a different POV, changes the meaning of an action.

My opinion on OOC might seem narrow but it really isn't. It's all about perspective. For a character to remain in-character they MUST from SOMEONE'S POV appear to act as they do in canon (this is different if you are writing an AU, I will touch on that last). They could be acting wildly different, or for completely different reasons, so long as someone can legitimately see their actions and conclude the same ideas as shown in canon ( to be extremely crude, brief, and not entirely accurate in Draco's case, that he is a total dick who cant do shit without whining to his daddy)

Now for an AU, as alot of fanfics are, the important element is internal consistency. If you choose to have him mirror canon draco's personality, stick to that. If you dont, then stick to what you decide. You cannot have both your own wildly different take AND canon's if you want a good fic. Unless you are doing the whole subtle POV thing anyway

********** I certainly think it would, yes. For instance, a lot of Snape's character (and relationship with Harry) early on appears to me to be based on Harry being so similar to his father. But a Snape that views Harry differently - and seeing that terrible living condition would /have/ to jolt Snape out of seeing Harry as a spoiled little celebrity - would force changes upon Snape's character over the course of the series. But those changes would be gradual, and 'in-character'.

I agree that suddenly making Draco a heroic good guy early on would make him OOC. However, having him grow into it would not be OOC to me, it'd just be exploring how the same character could have ended up differently. Eg, a more diplomatic Harry managing to keep Draco friendly, and forcing him to interact with Hermione on less adversarial tones, leading to a reevaluation of his prejudices, etc. Having that happen in the blink of an eye is too much - but stretching out over the first few years of canon would have profound differences on the character without ever having him evolve in an OOC way.

After all, characters in canon evolved and changed just like this, based on different situations.

The way I'm reading it, your view is appropriate when looking at stories that slot within canon - eg, if someone were to write a Neville focused story that is meant to just fill the gap of coverage we have of him, characters do have to act the same way they do (and evolve) in canon for that to work. But most fics aren't like that - they want to explore something changing, even without needing to be a seemingly drastic change. Again that's a bit of a definition on at what point something transitions into being an AU or not, but most fics that I've seen/read fall into the category of having changes to canon - and thus characters reacting ICly - but changing - is reasonable.

****** To me, out of character is a negative label and refers to actions where a character acts in an unbelievable fashion based on what was previously established. For example, Harry randomly slaughtering everyone. However, if you make changes which lead to a character acting in a way which is different than canon, that's not OOC as long as you can trace the behaviour change back to your divergence.

#+begin_quote
  Now, if your story takes place AFTER book 7, you can do whatever you want and just call it character growth.
#+end_quote

If anything, the firmer you established a character, the more OOC a sudden change of heart would seem. Malfoy after book one is a mean child with bigoted parents. After book 6, he is a hardened war criminal who has no qualms as long as he does not have to look his victim in the eyes while he murders them. He could have given up at any moment in HBP, yet he chose to continue on his mission again and again. Which establishes him in a certain way book 1 does not.

****** No, that is not what OOC means.

​

If you write a story where Harry is raised differently, and when you see him later he acts different, it does not necessarily mean he is OOC.

Its basically if you see the character change as expected for the change in circumstance. If you have a character say, have a near death experience, the fact they act differently after does not make them OOC. The question is "would it be in character for the canon character to act this way /If they had such an experience/".

The same goes with background changes. You saw character A act in a certain way when they grew up in an unloving household. Fic portrays character A acting differently after growing up in a loving household. Is it believable that they are the same person with just different backgrounds?

​

At lot of it is, of course, nature vs nurture arguments, but you better be making the argument that this particular behavior is because of nurture, not just changing it because.

** Interesting, I've never watched the movies past the second one and this explains quite a bit. I can see why movie!Snape is easier to forgive. It looks more like a man trying to be better, but still having lapses.

However, there is no reason for Harry to ever forgive book!Snape other than for giving Harry himself closure. Snape vaguely helped (though I know of no scene in the book where someone else couldn't have done the same), but ultimately he was petty and cruel to the end. Negating any redemption in my mind, especially towards Harry, one of the people his actions at the end of the first war wronged the most and that he continued to wrong after his second chance.

** I've always felt the films did create a new Snape. That being said I've always felt Snape was always going to get sympathy from the fanfiction community. We are /told/ Snape was friends with awful people, according to Sirius he also gave as good as he got towards James, SIrius, Remus and Peter and we know that Snape was a Death Eater, but we never /see/ what any of that means.

My assumption is that there are a lot of fanfiction authors who were bullied and because we see Snape's worst memory but not the things he did, there is a lot of sympathy towards him. If you look on the main Harry Potter Subreddit, you'll see there are a good number of people who genuinely seem to think James was a worse person. I think there are also a lot of people who believe being clever is a free pass to be a cunt, Snape and Hermione are their idols. They want Snape to be a good person because they see that aspect of themselves in him.

**** No, it isn't. It just reflects the difference between books as a medium of text and films as a medium of vision. That's the similar to what I call [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/the-problem-of-peter-pevensie-and-the-problem-of-wands.html][The Problem of Peter Pevensie]]: there are things which we are willing to accept in the written medium and suspend our disbelief, but when put to the film, they are just bizarre and grotesque. Both Snape and Dursleys are such caricatures of human beings in the books, that it is impossible to make them into film characters. They tried with Dursleys and because their presence in the films is very limited they got away with it. However, Snape is much more central character to the plot of the films, and it was not possible to let him be such caricature as in the books, so they had to make him more real.

By making him more real, I don't mean, they would have to make him better, they could make him more Death Eater. For example, I was always thinking (and I have a draft of the story) where Petunia Dursley is so screwed up as a human, because she was raped (using magic, none the less) by the young Snape, who didn't think about a silly Muggle as anything else than his plaything (for example, obsessive compulsive need to clean is one of the known possible coping mechanisms of rape victims). To be made a Mafioso you have to commit a crime, and I don't think why it would be any different for getting the Death Eaters' mark. What crimes did Snape commit before becoming a Death Eater? We have never learnt.

However, the film makers (probably because the films were PG-13) decided to go in the other direction and make him more realistic by making him better. Suddenly we have Snape of all fanfiction stories, where he is mostly Death Eater almost by mistake (e.g., linkffn(Trading My Sorrows by ShadowBallad;Digging for the Bones by paganaidd) or linkao3(Hatching Robin by Teao)).

**** Yeah, she is I guess. She really didn't know how to convey it properly though.

For 6 books Snape is an utter asshat. Harry never sees him show any redeeming qualities. Even "protecting" him in first year is explained as trying to repay a debt he owes/feels he owes his worst enemy(even if the guys been dead 10 years he still gets this title)... While he could be a saint behind the scenes(which i don't see being the case), he has spent ten years "protecting" his Slytherins by letting them run roughshod over the school(as seen in Draco), if his actions towards Hermione and Neville are taken as average, he has tormented many students for the "crime" of being Gryffindors, and while i don't THINK its mentioned in canon, it's pretty clear his O requirment for Newts has cut down on the number of people available for jobs that require Newt-Level potions(like Aurors?)...

These are not the actions of a "good" man, or a "hero"... Then Harry is given memories that show Snape had a hard childhood(I'd argue Harry's was worse), realized he set his "love" up for death so switched sides to protect HER, and worked with Dumbles to see Voldemort's death at the expense of Harry's life.... and this apparently makes him a hero....
