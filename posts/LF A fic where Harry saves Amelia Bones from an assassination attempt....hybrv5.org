:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm just gonna write what I remember from this fic, so that maybe you guys can narrow it down better... It's post-GoT . I think Harry is staying with the Bones... Susan doesn't like him initially... Blames him for Cedric... He foresees/anticipates/dreams(a bit murky at this point) but he comes to know that Amelia is gonna be attacked and prevents it.... This fic has been annoying me a lot. I have searched everywhere but I can't find it. I'm sure I read it bcoz if I had that much creativity, I'd probably just write for shits and giggles...


** I've read some with similar themes. Linkffn(the forgotten contract) for instance has harry staying with the Bones and saving them from an attack but susan doesnt dislike him in that one.

*** No.... Susan hates Harry in the one I was looking for... And Harry saves Amelia while she is enroute to her workplace... Susan isn't involved.

***** Do you mean linkffn(to fight the coming darkness) ... It's a good one too... One of my favourite Harry's. And if this is not the one you mentioned, please recommend it. I like any ship that isn't popular...

****** It might be. I never finished it but lily was coming across as not the purely light witch I was used to when I read it. Forcing petunia to let her cast a spell to protect harry possibly using James for protection from pureblood stupidity. I need to reread it.
