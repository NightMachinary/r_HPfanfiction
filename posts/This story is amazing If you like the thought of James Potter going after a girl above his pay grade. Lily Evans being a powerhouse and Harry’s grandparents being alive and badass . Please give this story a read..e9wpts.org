** What am I missing here? Its the length of a very short one shot after 2 years. I can't even imagine how all the stuff you mention in the title can even fit in the 2k words it has.

At this rate it will have 12k words (or 10% of the 120k that I assume will be needed to finish the story) in 2030.

** Thrilling tale of geriatric granny summoning demons and batling aurors. It could even get another thousand word chapter in this year.

  In which Voldemort in all his arrogance forgets why the eldest Potters are feared by all of the old blood, and in doing so, unleashes the full force of their family against him sending Wizarding Britain aflame. Now enjoy watching Lord Charlus and Lady Dorea Potter lead Harry, Sirius, and company into one hell of a ride complemented with Marauder level hijinks.
