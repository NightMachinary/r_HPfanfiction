** "...The first thing he thought when he saw it was, "Surely this architect was part spider." On closer inspection, he realised that it had only six "legs", but the illusion persisted nonetheless. From the main body of the castle extended a spire, but it was dwarfed by the towers that surrounded it. Six pathways connected the building to the towers, which went on seemingly for ever. But pulling his attention back to the main building, he noticed the giant purple...something, on the opposite end of the keep. Despite his initial reaction, he could not deny that the castle was pleasing to the eye; even though the towers seemed to reach the sky, they were themselves dwarfed by the mountains behind the castle, not to mention the effect created by the massive castle in what appeared to be a frozen wasteland otherwise. The more tactical part of his brain considered the difficulty- or perhaps the sheer impossibility - of taking the castle by storm; surrounded by mountains, a moat, six massive towers for archers to have field days, and then you would have to scale the main castle itself. The architect may or may not have been part spider, he thought to himself, but he certainly knew how to design castles."

** It's a busy picture. Not sure what about it is specifically important to your story (like the type trees or that purple orb), but i wrote up something quick that you're free to use if you want. Also, I'm typing this out on my phone, so please excuse any errors or weird formatting.

  Twin moats surrounded the palatial, eclaire-shaped complex, separated only by a thin buffer of emerald forest. Six bronze-tipped towers stood along the cobblestone rim of the outer moat, three on one side of the building and three on the other, each seemingly taller than the peaks of the mountain range behind -- tall enough to kiss the sun, maybe, but not so wide as to block its rays from washing the complex in a bright glow, or from nourishing the terraces that rested on its roof.
