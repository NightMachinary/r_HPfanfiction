So I've been looking for a particular fanfiction for a while now. It revolved around Harry and Ginny and a few other character. From what I could remember, Harry and Ginny had some sort of link, and some form of phoenix powers? It was a fairly long one, and in one of the chapters I'm pretty sure they healed Neville's parents from the Cruciatus curse? This might be a bit vague, as it has been a while, but I would really appreciate if anyone could help me find it!

** Is this one where Ginny is hooked up with some woman in New York to learn some sort of healing thing, and when she comes back she uses what she learns to heal the Longbottoms? In the story I'm remembering one Longbottom was in a clearing in an overgrown jugnle (in his/her head) and the other was in a desert. And Ginny had a tattoo on her inner thing of a dragon I think.

Despite all that, I don't think it was as bad as it sounds.
