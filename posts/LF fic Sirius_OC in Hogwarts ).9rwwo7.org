I wanted something new, I always read about Hermione or Harry but I need a break from them.. :) I search for something but this was with OC who was brave, she argue with Sirius, tell him off. You know, she was popular etc. I want OC who is shy and she prefer be in the shadow. And she doesn't want to be on the spotlight or be friends with Marauders because she is afraid that they do prank on her. I don't know if something like this even exist...
