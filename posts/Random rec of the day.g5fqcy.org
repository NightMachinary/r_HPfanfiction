I was just browsing through my favourites and found this forgotten little beauty at the bottom. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2217444/1/A-Mary-Sue-Alphabet]]

It's not very long at all, so don't be worried about a long time commitment. But it made me smile on this otherwise dreary day, so just wanted to share.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
