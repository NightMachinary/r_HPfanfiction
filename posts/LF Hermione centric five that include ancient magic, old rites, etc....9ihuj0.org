I'm looking for Hermione centric fics that include magical theory. Old rites, solstice festivals, earth magic, etc. No slash. A pairing would be great, I'm a sucker for Snape or Draco, but open to others. I've read "whom the goddess chooses" and "witchhikers guide to Beltane"

Thank you

** Bits of the linkffn(the chessmaster: black pawn by flye autumne) series involve Hermione and some kind of old magic. I stopped reading somewhere at the beginning of second year (not for any reason, just got busy) so I can't say for certain that that part of the story has gone anywhere yet but it did seem to be a plot hook that would be important. The author is active on this site so you could try asking her for more information!
