I find myself in the mood for some hp/sw fics, preferably set in the sw-universe.

Give me your favorites along with why you recommend it.

I'm looking forward to reading your recommendations!

** The only one I would truly recommend is this one, the humour is a little silly and Harry is fairly OOC and the plot is a little fluctuating in quality but it is absolutely readable and almost certainly the best SW/HP crossover there is. There is a side story by the same author as well that shows reactions to the story from some side characters that is worth a read as well if you enjoy it.

**** To be honest the author has fluctuated wildly in his update schedule, I think the longest was about 3 years between them, sometimes he updates in a few months. Still the story I get most excited about updates for though.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For]])

It's one of my favorite stories in hp/sw. the only problem is it's still being written and has slow updates. Most of the reasons I'd recommend it have to do with the plot so I won't give those but, I do recommend giving it a shot.

Someone else mentioned revenge of the wizard which is also pretty good.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  Crossover and OoTP AU. It's Harry's fifth year, and a desperate Dumbledore hires a new Dark Arts teacher who might prove to wreak more havoc than Umbridge ever could... Darth Vader.
