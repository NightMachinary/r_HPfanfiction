** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305538][Amaranthine]] - (7000 words) James/Lily, very down-to-earth take on their relationship during the war.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=295307][Friendship for Dummies]] - bit of cracky fun with Terry Boot and co.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=315682][Serenity Hill]] - switches between adult Charlie Weasley dragon keeping and childhood Charlie listening to a bedtime story; really charming.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317236][Unmasked]] - (500 words) a moment with Harry after the war, which I thought made great use of limited words.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=289998][It's Only Love]] - Cormac/Lavender, Post-War. I love minor characters, and I think this does a great job of exploring two characters that weren't the most beloved in a way that doesn't compromise their canon characterization.

  JKR portrays Harry as completely unaffected by the Avada Kedavra cast at him. But how would things have gone if it had been different?

/It's actually 7,000 words, which is a touch longer than you mentioned, but it's such an incredible fic that I had to include it and hopefully a couple of extra thousand words won't put you off reading./

*** I am currently in a ldr, at the moment I am reading harry potter series to her . I tend to record them and send the chapter to her . But I had the idea to have a short story and wrock song at the end .

For example I am planning to read the evil over lord list at the end of graveyard chapters in gof.

So thank you for sharing good short works :) .
