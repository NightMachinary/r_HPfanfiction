I know someone else has made a similar request, but I'm talking about /actual/ bashing, not just Albus finding out he's an entitled brat.

Edit: I'm not sure why this post descended into a discussion, but all I'm asking for are fics containing bashing, not whether Albus is worth it in your mind.


** He is a brat in fanfiction “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child”.

** I don't like Albus either, because he is a self-entitled "I'm the son of Harry fucking Potter, woe-is-me" arrogant prickish brat. but he doesn't deserve being actually bashed.

*** This is according to Cursed Child?

My mind seems to have deleted it, so I can't remember anything after Epilogue.

**** I actually ended up really liking Albus in CC.

I mean, yeah, he's a whiny, self-entitled jerk and a drama queen of massive proportions, but considering that before that play came out the Albus had zero personality, and in the fandom he was shaping up to be an even blander and less interesting version of Harry, I thought the CC characterisation of him was a massive improvement. Yeah, he's horrible, but he's being so entertaining about it that I don't really care...

Plus, big bonus here, when he acts like a whiny brat people around him actually treat him like a whiny brat. Nice to see that instead of the mollycoddling that fanfiction is so fond of.

***** I'm gonna piggyback on this.

I agree. Albus quickly became one of my favourite characters in a quick span of time, even if we include Cursed Child. If you get beyond it all, he is an average teenager, isn't he? He's a massive ball of conflicted emotions that turns into a drama queen. Some of us may have been different, in some sense, but I can assure you most of us were like that in our teenage years. Maybe not as bad, but still pretty dramatic.

As for the last remark, I also agree. In ones tory I'm working on, I had Harry be an utter jerk to everyone and people got angry and hated him, but when I had people in the story reprimand him, and treat him badly like he treats them, people got pitchforks and torches, screaming bloody murder. Lmao.

*** Well, obviously I disagree with that. I've hated him since his introduction in the Epilogue... although then, it wasn't /entirely/ his own fault. Having been the child neglected in favor another, I could understand James' plight in trying to gain his parents' attention and smiling despite the crushing weight of expectation.

**** I can't see any evidence that James is being neglected in the Epilogue. Albus might be getting more attention in this instance, but it IS his first time going to Hogwarts, and he's nervous about it... and James isn't helping with his teasing, even if he tries to look innocent and insists "I was just saying!"

In the scene, James is mainly just excited about seeing his friends again. He wanders off twice or his own accord, probably so that the narrative can focus on Albus, but when he's there, Harry and Ginny don't ignore him in favour of Albus or anything.

According to Ginny, they wrote to James three times a week during his first year at Hogwarts. When he's present, he gets quite a bit of attention; and like most twelve-year-old boys he think his mother is SUPER EMBARRASSING when she hugs and kisses him and tells him to give Neville her love.

***** The favoritism toward Albus is obvious, which is probably what resulted in his sense of entitlement and the sibling rivalry as is often the case. Harry and Ginny aren't concerned about James arriving on the platform safely, and most of their interaction with him is just to scold him. As for the letters, when a parent sees the favoritism, they often try to over-compensate for the neglected child - Ginny probably did this because of Harry obviously preferring Albus and, as seen in the Epilogue, he barely paid attention to James.

But I know from past experience that you don't agree with me on anything, which is fine. Although I don't see how this provides me with any bashing stories.

****** I would agree with you that ROWLING'S favouritism towards Albus is obvious, though I don't see any evidence that Albus is being favoured by his parents.

James, as I can see, looks to be more the independent type -- he seems to have a tendency to go off on his own. I think you're sort of reaching with the "evidence" that Harry is neglecting James... yeah, they scold him, but he IS being a jerk to his younger brother. Albus is getting more attention from Harry at this moment, but that's because he needs it at this moment. James is just happy and excited and overall boisterous; Albus is insecure and nervous and needs reassurance.

And no, this isn't providing you with any bashing stories, but it doesn't seem like anyone else has any either.

******* "He had never told his other children that" is pretty obvious favoritism.

And the last part was directed toward the comments in general, not just you.

******** James obviously didn't need to be told that. From what we see of him, he was never in any doubt as to where he belonged. I just think it's a stretch to take one sentence and from that infer that James is being neglected.

I mean, he's very clearly neglected by the NARRATIVE, especially in CC, where Albus sort of takes over the entire thing. But from what we do see of James, he has an overall good relationship with both his parents.

********* It's not a stretch. It's applying real-life experiences, and though I've heard many that are similar to my own, here's mine for an example: I was told, "Oh, you'll be just like your dad!" my entire life, so I followed his career path, and even though I hated it, I smiled and pretended I enjoyed it. Meanwhile, my brother, who's always been favored, was given a choice. He's also the one who had a bad relationship with our father. Sound familiar? Methinks it does.

Also don't bother replying. I know we won't ever agree, and contrary to what people are doing, this /isn't/ a discussion. It's a request.

******** Not really. There are things my dad has told me as the oldest that he hasnt told my brother and vice versa. Harry didn't tell James whatever it is (i have never read CC) because it wasn't relevant to James' issues compared to Albus. Common sense would say that James knows things as the oldest that Albus does not also. Harry keeps things close to the chest when it comes to himself, so if he is telling one of his children anything about himself it is probably relevant to something the kid is going through and he thinks it will help
