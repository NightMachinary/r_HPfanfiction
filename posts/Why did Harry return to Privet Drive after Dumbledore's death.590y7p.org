I read the 7th book long ago. Please pardon my foggy memory.

I was thinking about Moody's death. This raises a question if Harry wasn't in privet drive, Moody's death probably came later. But why Harry returned to there after 6th year?

Dumbledore was already dead. He was only weeks away from 17th birthday. Wouldn't it make more sense, Harry not returning there as he had to leave in two weeks eventually?

Harry, Ron & Hermione lived at grimmauld place during Horcrux hunting. He could stay there instead of returning to Dursley's. It was under fidelius charm, the death eaters couldn't find him. Would ministry could detect if someone underage using magic under fidelius charm? As far as I know, the ministry wouldn't.

Perhaps Snape had access to there but Moody already managed it before his death. So if Harry were to stay there, he could ensure precautionary safeties. Also Mundusgas Fletcher's thievery would be known earlier.

There wasn't any rules like that underaged wizards must live with guardians as we know Sirius left his family while he was 16.

Other than blood safety issue, was there any other reason why Harry went to Dursley's after Dumbledore's death?


** Because JKR wanted an aerial shootout and kill off more good guys, so nobody questioned whether the original Dumbledore plan might have been compromised by Snape.

The thing with latter Books is, whenever simple solutions exist (for both good and bad guys) but would interfere with her plot, she tends to disregard them.

*** Yup. I've also often wondered...

...why not portkey Harry away to an unexpected location? Hell, why not portkey him away to an unexpected location that is under fidelius? Why not have Harry walk a mile away under his cloak before having him get into a muggle cab? Why not have someone sidelong apparate him after he walks away under cloak? Why not sidelong apparate away from privet drive itself? If the cloak isn't good enough to conceal him (after all, Dumbledore apparently could see under it), why not use magic to build a tunnel out from under the house over to Mrs. Figg's and have him secretly get in a van over there? Why not have Harry take polyjuice so he looks like a visiting adult wizard, and have him walk away, while the wizard who walked in apparates out? You can come up with these all day long.

And the answer is, because JKR wanted a big aerial fight where Moody and Hedwig both buy it.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again, what makes the canon is that JKR is a fantastic writer and you don't stop to think about this stuff until afterwards, but damn, she leaves plot holes the size of the Atlantic.

**** The really obvious portkey or apparition options are ruled out because the ministry of magic can apparently control or track them. But yes, there are tons of other plans that would have been safer than the big aerial fight. Gotta drive the plot somehow.

***** It would be inconsistent to claim here that the ministry could track all portkeys and apparition. If they could, why couldn't they track Harry and Hermione apparating around while they're on the run? Why couldn't they track what happened to the cup portkey in the last task? But again, none of it really makes sense, and the real motivation was that JKR wanted that scene.

And I've come up with a dozen more ideas since. For example, it is canon that humans can survive inside an undetectable extension charm, as Moody was kept in such a space by Crouch, so smuggle him out using one. Vanishing cabinets are canon, and should be on everyone's mind after what happened only weeks before, so smuggle him out using a pair. Polyjuice Harry to look like Vernon and take him out a whole week earlier. You can apparently transfigure people into animals and objects (there are examples in the series), so transfigure Harry into a coin or other small object and take him out in someone's pockets. One could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on.

But again, I'm not going to claim JKR is a bad writer. The fact that she gets you to go along with her hole-filled over-complicated plots is a tribute to the fact that she's really a brilliant writer. And again, without the holes and inconsistencies, fanfic would be so much harder to write. If a plot is really airtight, it's nearly impossible to change it around without ruining things. The ideal canon for fanfic is a work that people love but where the plot is a mess and you can play with it endlessly without altering the essential components that make people love it. Harry Potter is perfect for that.

** Harry says Dumbledore wanted him to at the end of Book 6. I don't quite remember, but I think it had to do with Harry still being underage and having the Trace on him, or something like that.

** It's been a while since I read it but yes Dumbledore made Harry promise he'd go back there one last time. So he'd have the protection of living under the roof of his mother's family for one last year. As to the port key and the other methods, they said there were spy's in the department of magic. That had made all those magical means of getting Harry out of the house illegal or just impossible. All done under the guise of Harri's protection.

** presumably they wanted to recharge the protection one last time, even if the house isn't safe he'd still carry it with him. it's the reason he survives the second killing curse, and probably contributes to his ability to keep voldimort out of his head that whole year. surely feelings alone aren't enough or voldemort would never be able to survive in any ones mind.

*** No, the reason he survives the killing curse is because of the horcrux in his scar combined with Voldemort having his blood. And Voldemort stayed out of his mind because of the pain he incurred when he possessed Harry at the ministry battle.

**** presumably all these convenient circumstances happen because of the magic of the connection, voldemort has the protection in his blood and harry has the horcrux. i'm not sure the blood cells are as important as the magic involved.

***** Voldemort does not have the protection of Lily's sacrifice because he has Harry's blood. Having Harry's blood negates the protection allowing him to directly harm Harry.

As far as the protections around Privet Drive, we don't know wether Voldemort could have breached them or not.

****** there's nothing in the story to indicate that blood in general and on it's own has these magical properties. when they talk about Harry's blood, they are talking about the magical protections in it from the sacrifice. this is pretty much the whole point of nearly everything in the whole story.

********* I never said "Blood Magic" was a thing. That being said, we know that Voldemort using Harry's blood is what allows him to touch Harry without being hurt like Quirrell was so obviously blood is critical on some level. Dumbledore also said the protection around Privet Drive worked "as long as Harry lived with his Mother's Blood" (paraphrase), so again we know that blood is important. Then there is the "look of triumph" in Dumbledore's eye when he finds out that Voldemort used Harry's blood. So while blood magic might not be spelled out in the books, blood is obviously significant in some manner.

********** yes, which is the point. harry went back to privet drive so the protections could be restored for a while longer. the question is did staying there for a short while contribute to harry surviving the ak when the horcrux in his scar didn't; or not?
