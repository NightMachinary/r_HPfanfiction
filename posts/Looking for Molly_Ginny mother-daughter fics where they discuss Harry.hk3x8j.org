We never really see any real sense of what Molly thinks about Harry and Ginny in HBP/DH and how she her ideas about her daughters relationship with her adopted son has evolved over the years.

Not looking for any real Molly bashing, beyond maybe being a bit of a prude though I don't particularly buy that.
