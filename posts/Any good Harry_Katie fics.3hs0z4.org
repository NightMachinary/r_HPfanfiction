*** Wow, there's only one complete Harry/Katie fic with > 40K words in all of fanfiction.net, same as Harry/Millicent and Harry/Lisa Turpin.

For some reason I have seen Katie characterized as a lesbian in more than a couple of fics, I wonder who was the first to do it.

**** Eh. Canon shows us that houses are more or less irrelevant when it comes to choosing personalities. Hermione was studious despite not being a Ravenclaw. The Puffs were all affected by rumors of Harry being a Dark Wizard, and when they hear him speaking in Parseltongue, they make him out to be the villain immediately. Pettigrew was a coward, but when push came to shove, he showed more cunning than any Slytherin ever did. The two prodigies, Voldemort and Dumbledore, weren't from Ravenclaw. Slytherin accepted Half bloods into his house, despite 'Purity' being its motto.

TL;DR Houses matter very little, and anyone can have any personality regardless of House. I suppose in Daphne's case you can include some token, overdone conflict of being in enemy houses if the story takes place during Hogwarts years, but that's pretty much it.

(And what's the matter with being foreign anyway?)

EDIT: I suppose that's where perceptions come in. I find OCs (or quasi-OCs) in main roles to be generally annoying. If a canon character can do a similar job, use the canon character. I'm reading fanfiction after all, I want to see Harry Potter characters in them.

  (5/7) It is a dark time for Harry Potter. Voldemort is secretly amassing power, and only Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix opposes him. Abandoned, libeled, loathed and reviled, Harry has few allies and fewer options. Harry must learn to control his powerful and mysterious emerald trance; if he cannot, Harry will be consumed by darkness. (AU Slytherin!Harry)

****** Ginny's had proper build up so I'm not complaining, I liked what the author's done with her as it's significantly better than the real books an comes across natural. In comparison the girls he dates are almost like distractions, Katie in particular. He basically just makes out with them in his free time to relieve stress and Katie ended up being almost an after thought because that's basically all she was. He's getting pushed down, but really the Katie thing was going to happen regardless. I honestly don't like that the author labels the latter installments with who Harry is paired with because in Pansy's case for instance she only gets with him towards the end, but she's there like she's the main character, same with Katie.

******* I suppose.

I will agree that he has a much better Ginny than canon, and the relationship is built up semi-well.

I still wouldn't think it natural if this Harry got with Ginny though, and I'd also find it disappointing storytelling - for a Slytherin!AU, he's managed to divert canon somewhat well, but it still falls very close to canon.

If he get's with Ginny as well, and it /lasts/, I'd be sorely disappointed. I don't think she and what she represents fits very well with this Harry - the author is already skirting close to a very canon Harry, although he redeemed himself somewhat with Pettigrew - this Harry settling peacefully with Ginny would be the final death knell for him as an original canon independent protagonist.

******** That's possible as well. I don't think she quite matches this particular Harry perfectly either, but the build up would make it better than any other pairing at this point. Of course they've held off on getting together all of this time, it could just happen towards the end.

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
