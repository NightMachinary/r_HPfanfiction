I'm looking for a Harry that travels around for whatever reason and goes on either a willing or unwilling adventure.

I've read 'Make a wish' and 'Lone traveller' and their respective spin offs so I've been in mood of Harry going off to different places. I've also read 'against my nature' not that fond of BL but I wont say no to it.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2651376]]). After Halloween in 1981 little Harry is sent to the past many-many-many years ago (like really many, the whole humanity is still living in tribes), he's immortal (and doesn't know why) and he just lives with it. The whole fic is him travelling. It's very interesting.

linkffn(Basilisk-born). Before his 5th year, Harry is sent to the past many years ago (not so many like the first rec though, his first acquaintance is Merlin) and has no way back aside from living the whole time. Again, it's *very* interesting and it's *huge*.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8337871]]). The same premise, lol. He's sent to 3050 B.C.E. but, unlike the first two recs, not so much managed to happen/not so much time has passed but it's still very interesting.

^{okay, and now I want to re-read Basilisk-born so I can pick-up where I left off} +^{and where was it?}+ ^{and read all the new chapters. Oh, it's gonna be delicious.}

  Voldemort intended to kill the whole Potter family, but something unexpected happened. Now, the Dark Lord must face the result of a severely twisted Prophecy as well as a very old... thing. What history can Harry have after this? What history can he make?

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
