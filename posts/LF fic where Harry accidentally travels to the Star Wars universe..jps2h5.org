:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
He has a bout of accidental magic, which unlocks his ability to control time and space. He vanishes from Privet Drive and reappears on Coruscant a few years before the Mandalorian War breaks out. He learns how to use his magic, including Apparition, and uses it to break up bar fights and rescue captives (and breaking up the occasional slave ring). Later, he learns how to control time, and finds his way back to Earth in his adulthood.


** Huh, sounds interesting.

Not the fic you want but have you read linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25133773]]) ? It's the best Star Wars xover I've read

*** A few. Harry finds his way back to Earth when Dumbledore does a ritual that pulls on Harry just enough to let him find his way. He either owns or acquires a house on Earth and uses magic to expand the garage, with the goal of building a spaceport. He captures several ships from pirates and slavers, including a Corellian Corvette and a small-ish Mandolorian cruiser.

** This sounds like a nice concept. How do you expect Harry to interact with Jedi and Sith and should he play a part in the main plot or is it more of 'he learns to live in the world before going back to earth' kind of thing? I feel like I've read a few fics with similar concepts but can't remember if I did.
