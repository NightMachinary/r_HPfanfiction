There are a few scenes from fics that I have in my head but just can't remember the story they came from!

1. Harry is living in a cottage I think near Hogsmead post Voldemort and has this urging to make a wand. He goes to Ollivander's and Ollivander tells him he is becoming a mage. I think he also made a staff from a branch of one of the trees in his yard but thought he was making a walking stick instead.

2. This is a bashing story I'm pretty sure. Sirius and Hermione are running for Minister of Magic. Sirius promises to destroy the anti-werewolf laws, while Hermione is going on about how Harry is her friend and him and Dumbledore are her great influences, but it was proven before that that Dumbledore was a manipulative jerk and wasn't around anymore (or was in hiding or something like that). Harry was interviewed after the speeches and said that Hermione wasn't his friend and he was supporting Sirius.

That's all I remember about them. Thanks in advance for any help!


** I don't know about the first one, but the second one is Pretty Boy by DepsTheSlytherinSnapeFan.

*** Yep, this is it! Thanks for the help! Though I could have sworn that it was a one-shot ¯_(ツ)_/¯
