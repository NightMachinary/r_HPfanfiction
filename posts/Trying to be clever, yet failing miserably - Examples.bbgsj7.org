Lupinus, commonly known as lupin or lupine, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. The genus includes over 200 species, with centers of diversity in North and South America. Smaller centers occur in North Africa and the Mediterranean. They are widely cultivated, both as a food source and as ornamental plants.

**** While su3su2su1's review does bring up some valid points, I get the feeling that part of the reason that the review was so damning was that su3su2su1 was reviewing HPMOR as a stand alone work rather than it being a HP fanfiction. The only reason why I'm saying this is because the reviewer admits that they did, in their words, a "(rather loose reading of the) books," which to me implies that they also haven't read a bunch of HP fanfiction nor would be able to pick up on some of the references or in-jokes that HPMOR makes due to that. What stands out to me immediately is the Useless!Ron trope that su3su2su1 appears to be extremely uncomfortable with, but I feel that the average fanfic reader would be unperturbed by.

While I admit I haven't read all of the review, I wonder if su3su2su1 would have been as harsh if they had the full context of HPMOR since HPMOR pokes fun at a lot of the minutia of the HP world as well as HP fanfiction tropes in general.

I was more under the impression that it was "Here's some interesting concepts! Understanding them isn't plot-critical, but if you'd like to learn more, look it up!" Especially since I remember reading the author's notes where it said something like all of Harry's statements on scientific or philisophical concepts was from the author's understanding of said concept after reading up on it.

**** Yudkowsky was the founder of an online rationalist community by the name of Less Wrong, whose detractors like to call it a cult, due to the way some of its members tend to take whatever Yudkowsky says as gospel (and, of course, due to the people who call it a cult's belief that key elements of Less Wrong's creed are pseudoscientific nonsense).

It's not /really/ a cult, of course, let alone a sex cult, though your mileage may vary on how cult/ish/ some of its members can get (I invite you to read [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yEjaj7PWacno5EvWa/every-cause-wants-to-be-a-cult][this defence]] by Yudkowsky himself, and [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/25/is-everything-a-religion/][this non-LessWrong-essay about the dangers of comparing everything to religions and cults]], to get a fairer idea about this).

It's related to it, in the sense that Scott Alexander has read a certain number of LessWrong writings; but it's certainly not part of it; certainly it very neatly avoids all the elements that make people think of LessWrong as a cult. Alexander is a fiercely independent fellow who respects Yudkowsky as a fellow thinker but has never considered him the be-all end-all of anything, he's not a preference utilitarian, and while he does think super-AI is possible and dangerous, he's not always yammering about it the way LWers tend to be. Nor, for that matter, is he a proponent of cryonics.

#+end_quote

A good start to what? And I know what analytic philosophy is, thank you very much.

What we were arguing about it is whether LessWrong can fairly be called a cult. I hold that it cannot. There is an argument to made that it can be /compared/ to a cult in some aspects, but at the end of the day falls squarely into the "exclusive club of clever people with a tendency to overestimate /how/ clever they are" category and no more than that.

Yudkowsky, yes, point taken. I think he's a fun thinker, and I agree with his morals on a lot of points (big into anti-deathism, me), but he doesn't strike me as the scientific genius he thinks he is.

Alexander, though, I'm unconvinced. Alexander /doesn't/ claim to know more about scientific topics than he does; when he does write about science it is with prefaces of "I'm not an expert, I could be misunderstanding some key element, these are just my two cents", more often and more emphatically than Yudkowsky does.

And unlike Yudkowsky, who makes it a little easy to forget he's not actually a scientist, Alexander /is/ a professional psychiatrist. (But we're not discussing Alexander, anyway. As I said, it is absolutely unfair to treat him as a LessWronger, besides which Alexander has /not/ written any supposedly-instructive /HP/ fanfiction.)

#+begin_quote
  why does it have to be mentioned that they're also really clever and exclusive?
#+end_quote

That wasn't entirely a compliment. To devolve into Internet-jargon, my point was that LessWrongers tend to be "nerdy" types --- people who were top of their class or the like in middle-school and are used to being smarter than everybody else.

**** LessWrong is Eliezer Yudkowsky's "rationalist" movement. I'm exaggerating a little bit when I call it a sex cult. After all, while many IRL members of the community participate in polyamory (that's really many women for few men), there are definitely no unjustified allegations floating around online that Mr. Less Wrong himself has fed LSD to his sexual partners, told them they were worthless without him, and forced them to take IQ tests before having sex with them. No allegations at all.

Moral beliefs can't be objectively right or wrong. You have every right to disagree with Yudkowsky's brand of preference-utilitarianism, but it is as valid as any other moral theory, so long as it is self-consistent.

Whether or not you believe Kant's moral theory, a philosophy teacher who successfully helps you understand the basic tenets of Kantian moral theory has still successfully taught you something.

No. Moral theories are systems based on moral intuitions that just kind of exist unbidden in the human soul, and no matter what certain religions maintain, those moral intuitions can and do differ from person to person. The only way a moral system could be objectively mad would be if it didn't reflect anyone's moral intuitions, but that's clearly not the case with preference-utilitarianism.

** Considering how Rowling herself named her character, I'm not really bothered by "Adonis" for an attractive character (not than much different than Narcissa for a beautifull but arrogant woman).\\
The overly long and creepy description is a problem though ,but would be without the name, we don't need to know that the shirt of a guy is in Acromantula Silk and that it puts in evidence his "Quidditch chiseled body". Same for the girls and the "dress showed she had forms right in the right place". Just say attractive, a little more details like his height or his hair color and be done with it.

Diable is also a little simple to my tastes (I mean what next, Mr Baddy Evil?) but still passable, more bothered by the A/N explaining the reference. Not only the reader are not complete moron, but I think that finding the reference that named a character is part of the fun, especially if you understand years later (like Bellatrix which mean "The warrior", found this at least 5 years after finishing HP). So explaining the meaning in the first chapter the character is introduced is a bit boring yeah
