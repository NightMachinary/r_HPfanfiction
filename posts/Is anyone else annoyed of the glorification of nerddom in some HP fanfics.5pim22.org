And i dont mean the good nerddom of "i play video games and like fantasy and sci-fi" but the obnoxious "i must be first in class and good grades are all that matters" kind!

I have read so many fanfics where the first step for an independent/powerfull harry is to start becoming a major nerd, classes suddenly become super important and everything else takes a backseat. I mean, sure, in a world where you can learn new spells from books, reading a lot and learning from them is very usefull, but that has nothing to do with class work as such. You arent going to be able to fight a dark lord if you just revise notes of what you learned in the first few years a lot. Yet in so many fics the answer to becoming powerfull is becoming hermione 2.0 or worse.

I have read (and abandoned them short after usually) fics where the superiority of muggle homework planners (do these things actually exist?) and muggle pens and calender management were major plotlines - and all i could do was thing to myself was "seriously?".

Now, i have nothing against a geek!harry or just him being a good student or learning a lot, as long as its built into his character and not a device for powering him up. But as something to suddenly make harry op its just aweful, i hate the plotline of "harry gets shaken up and realizes he has to do something, mails hermione for more homework and starts to try to be the best he can in class".


** It's a little weird, I agree. But a huge section of fanfiction is noticing something about the source, and then exploring that aspect.

Like you said, a huge portion of magical power in HP comes from, simply, study and practice. Hermione may have dismissed herself as simply having "Books! And cleverness!" But it's pretty indisputable that she was the top witch of her class. Studying = spells = power (up to a point).

Agreed, though, that simply rereading your fifth-year textbook isn't enough to have a slugfest with Voldemort.

After a year of running the DA, Harry would probably be moderately confident in the results of his training. It makes sense for him to shore up a weakness by studying more spells.

This is assuming that study has no impact on the power of your spells.

As for the parent comment, I'm pretty sure the OP was being specific when they said "battle" (which is /not/ just running around and casting Stupefy if DADA is a subject of its own).

I'm not sure who would win in a duel between Ron and Hermione, but Harry would best either of them post-GoF. And that, I think, is where potential magical prowess beyond what one gains from study comes into play, if at all.

*** Also, it kind of makes sense. Not completely, as experience also matters, but it does make some sense in the HP universe. This is a world where knowledge is /literally/ power. It's not even indirect. If you study more, you learn to use more advanced magic that can directly affect the world around you.

Learning in some form (doesn't have to be a traditional classroom environment) is integral to magical power in the HP world. A bad student is a weak wizard by default in any well written HP story.

**** Well, you can argue either way here. But in any case 99% of actual school work probably wouldnt help in battle, divination, potions, runes, muggle studies and so on and forth. Charms, tranfiguration and dada seem to be the only school subjects that would actually help, and for those only a very minor part of what is taught. Knowledge in other subjects isnt really power, its just knowedge. And knowledge that you cant actually use is just worthless while fighting.

***** You are thinking incredibly narrowly. I said /power/, which doesn't necessarily translate to battle prowess. That said, many of the subjects you listed could certainly be helpful in battle. Lets go over them before real quick:

- Divination: Being unexpected is very often much stronger in the real world than all the practice you can put in. In the real world it often comes down to luck, but it doesn't need to in the HP verse. Do you seriously believe that being able to see portions of the future would not be helpful? You could see signs of attacks coming before they actually do. You could see where someone was going to be on a date/time, and ambush them. A killing curse from the back kills just as well as the most impressive magic cast by Merlin himself from the front.

- Potions: With the proper potions ability, you could bend someone to your will in a variety of ways. Make them fall in love with you, poison them directly, have them spill their most valuable secrets. Likewise, with the proper knowledge you could protect yourself from all of that.

- Runes: Runes aren't very well explained in the HP verse, but it's safe to say that they are probably used in some fashion for creating things or ritual work. At least, that's the logical line in which you would use them. Creating things is rather obvious, you could create spell resistant clothing or a permanent defensive structure. Rituals could be used to increase your personal power directly (which is directly stated in the books).

- Muggle Studies: If a wizard doesn't know what a gun is, he is a sitting fucking duck for every single person who does. Extrapolate this to literally every other muggle war technology.

We're not talking about just fighting. Like I said, that's the narrow view. You might as well be wearing horse blinders. Think about what you could do with /just/ potions in the real world. Oh, you want to start a war on muggles? contaminate muggle water supply systems with any number of hard to notice potions that kick in slowly, but result in either a passive or dead population. Better yet, aerolize those potions and distribute them via brooms across entire cities, at all once.

Ron was constantly around the most knowledgeable witch in the entire school, having her pound information into his head with a figurative hammer. He also took part in DA lessons, and was in life or death situations literally every year of his schooling life. He learned. He may not have studied in the traditional sense, but he learned none the less. Neville took part in the DA and also the reformed DA in his seventh year. He took his studying seriously, even if he was bad (at first) at the original application of that knowledge.

I mentioned that learning need not happen in a traditional school environment in my original post for a reason. /Knowledge is power/, not /Sitting in class for 8 hours a day and learning the teacher approved curriculum is power/.

****** And you are approaching this way to broadly, by your line of argument the most important skill Harry (or any leader) could actually learn would be to delegate properly (which actually is true irl, but its boring). None of the above is actually crucial for Harry to know himself, as long as he has someone with him who knows all about it he can do all of the things you mentioned but without having to spend any time learning them himself.

******* Until the person/people you delegate to decides to turn on you, as is very likely to happen in pretty much any broad conflict between two sides. That's part of the pattern in most armed conflicts in human history.

Also, none of what you just said actually detracts from my main point. Even if I were to accept your premise that the only skills that truly matter in a personal power sense are the ability to do direct battle (I don't, because it's incredibly simplistic thinking.), that doesn't change the fact that those with more knowledge are more likely to come out on top. Because once again, knowledge is /literally/ power in the HP world. If two people are battling it out and one knows a half dozen spells and curses that the other doesn't, he will win much more often.

It's the same reason "cheese" strategies work in literally every confrontation in the real world. From video games to actual fist fights. Only in the HP world, instead of a cheesy chess move or a sucker punch to the face, it's a spell that you don't understand or know how to counter that kills you before you can figure out what to do.

Magic can /literally/ shape space and time in the HP verse. A flick of you wand changes the world as you and I know it. That. Is. Power. And you can only do it with /knowledge/.

So Knowledge is literally power in the HP world. There's seriously no debating this.

Yes, because of plot convenience. There's plenty of stupid shit in the books, because it was telling a story to children/young adults. We're not talking about the story, we're talking about the world. Rowling handwaved or ignored plenty of possible uses of magic, because either it wasn't appropriate for a series aimed at kids, or it would ruin her plot.

In a story where a magical terrorist that brought an entire country to its knees, /twice/, can be foiled by a couple 11-17 year olds over and over again, we need to accept that plot convenience takes precedence over logic.

The vast, vast majority of wizards we see in the HP world are mediocre at best. They were focused on living their lives, just like ordinary people. In fact, much of the HP characters /we actually see/ could be very easily described as "ordinary stereotypical middle to lower class British families, but with magic".

Also, Rowling had already created fairly large repertoire of either explicit or implied spells throughout the series. Plenty to keep track of for children/teens. She wasn't looking to write a spell book, she was telling a story. That story would not have been aided by an entire heap of new spells that those young people would need to remember and understand.

#+begin_quote

Off the top of my head, Voldemort does the following:

- Creates multiple Horcruxes, dark magic so unknown that 99.99% of the characters we meet in the HP world wouldn't even recognize the word

- Engages in multiple dark rituals to increase his own personal ability

- Learns the apparently singular ability to /fly/ without any magical aid but his wand

- Uses a ritual to create a brand new body for himself

- Conjures a magical silver shield in the fifth book which is never seen again

- A whole host of spells in the fifth book dual between him and Dumbledore that we basically never see again

- Engages in intricate mind magic that most people never even scratch the surface of

We see plenty of unique and powerful magic from the two strongest wizards in the series between Dumbledore and Voldemort. It's just that little of it was explained to or understood by Harry, because he was a middle-high school student learning the basics of magic. Also of course because Rowling didn't want to have to spend hundreds of pages every book explaining the actual mechanics of magic that Harry wouldn't even understand anyway.

In both cases you can probably cast them about same number of times with different levels of Stamina but it wouldn't matter if you don't have any dueling/battle prowess which is different from learning by books or by just casting spells.

** I don't think Harry Potter is the series for you. In PS we're told that magic involves a lot more than incantations and wand movements. As the books progress, it becomes clear that it's a magical system where your proficiency with magic in practice is a function of how well you understand it.

We have a clear and repeatedly emphasised example throughout the books: Hermione studies magical theory in greater depth and as a result is able to cast more advanced (i.e. powerful) spells than those who have not. She is also able to pick up new spells much faster because of said study.

On top of Hermione, there are plenty of other indications that understanding of magic is the key to casting it well.

- The fact that Hogwarts exists in the first place and has so many classes which focus on theory. Recall how they had to have 2 months of theory classes in PS before they even tried to cast their first Charm.

- The fact that Hogwarts has a huge library and that within that library a single spell can have multiple books written about it. At one point Harry has three different books all about the stunning charm.

- The fact that Dumbledore and Voldemort are talked about as being particularly great students in a manner that indicates this is relevant to their current power.

- The way that classes teach general principles which are expected to apply across the discipline. So in transfiguration they teach certain example transfigurations but it's anticipated that once you can do that example transfiguration you can also do other transfigurations of the same type (e.g. invertebrate animate transfiguration). The fact that skill is expected to be transferable between different spells of similar effect indicates that different spells can have elements in common i.e. a shared theoretical framework which once learnt allows you to cast spells of that type.

Of course there is much more to magic than study alone (see my full works for greater detail) but study does seem to be the most important single factor.

Of course, the "Harry realises he needs to be good at magic so goes back to his first year work" is nonsense, but it's nonsense for a different reason: Harry already knows that stuff. He's been at Hogwarts for 5 years by the time he has that thought in the common trope, and he's been getting pretty good grades at that. He doesn't need to go back to basics, he already knows the basics.

Making Harry completely ignorant of the basics of magic is just a bad way for the author to shoehorn in their shitty ideas for how HP magic works, usually completely contradictory to the canonical system.

*** But in canon in any actual fights hermione performs just as well/bad as people that have done almost no studying at all (or are very bad at it), neville or ron for example. And its pretty fair to say that Ron didnt understand any of the stuff behind it, yet he cast spells in battle just as well as her. It seems pretty clear that studying has very little impact in battle prowess.

Most people would agree that Harry is a lot better then Hermione in dueling, yet he also doesnt really care about how the magic actually works either, not did he study it a lot.

And i think its fair to assume both Voldemort and Dumbledore having been great students was due to them being prodigies, and not that they became prodigies due to studying a lot.

**** 1. Hermione's main weakness in duelling is non-magical in nature: she does not perform as well in dangerous situations as Harry and Ron.

2. We have very little information about how Hermione stacks up to Ron in a duel, and Neville even less. I'm not sure what you're basing your conclusion on.

3. As I said above, there is more to magic than just study. Harry has certain qualities that make him particularly good at combative magic. I can go into the theory behind this if you like, but it takes [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit?usp=sharing][several thousand words]] to explain.

4. Harry does indeed care about magic works and he did study it a lot. We know this because he got an O in DADA and an E in Charms, Transfiguration and Potions in his OWLs. That would be impossible without knowing the material examined.

5. You seem to be unfamiliar with the nature of prodigy. The reality of prodigy is that it only ever amounts to anything impressive if you study a lot and work hard to realise your potential. Without that work, potential is all a prodigy will ever have. Prodigy doesn't give a person the ability to shortcut the acquisition of knowledge, it merely accelerates and smooths that process and allows a person to take it further.

2. The way her/his performance in any of the battles is described in the books.

3. None of that is actually proof, its all an unproven theory so vOv. Its not an argument.

4. He studied for school, as much as everyone does. Yet with his level of study he was perfectly able to cast spells, meaning that if he suddently focused a lot on studiyng for school he really wouldnt change much.

5. Nah, thats flat out wrong. At least in regards to school, take any math genius in RL history, they all got straight As in math without having to study one minute. In fact, you dont even need to be a genius for that (i know a few people who have a talent for maths, and they all made it through school with almost pefect maths grades without doing a thing bar paying attention in class). Someone who is a prodigy doesnt need to do any work at all to do well in school. A real genius would get perfect scores with almost no studying at all. Only when they are done with university and start with reasearch and similar do they actually need hard work.

It might astound you to learn this, but you can study material beyond what is covered in class. Specifically for Defence, had he stuck to what was covered in class, he'd have no better spells or techniques available to him than are available to all fourth year students. Possibly worse than Hagrid, for instance, since Hagrid took Defence before the curse on the Defence Professor position.

Those who want to truly master a subject won't just absorb what they're taught in school; they will seek out more knowledge on the topic elsewhere. While the rest of the class is re-reviewing basic calculus, they'll be reading about Riemannian manifolds.

Had Voldemort and Dumbledore merely been the sort of prodigy you are talking about, they would have graduated early and foundered. They would have reached the same height as everyone else faster. They might have done a little better out of sheer boredom, a little better still from grasping what they were taught in more depth, but that's it. No magical inventions, no new discoveries, very few spells that the average Hogwarts grad couldn't recognize or replicate.

Instead they do things with magic that awe everyone else.

****** You're just making bad arguments now, and wasting my time in making me reply. Please think your arguments through properly in future.

1

It makes no such implication. Of course in any high pressure situation if someone loses their head they will be at a severe disadvantage but that does not amount to the conclusion that ability with magic is an incredibly minor factor compared to non-magical factors in duelling. It's a single, specific scenario and one that lacks general applicability.

Hermione's superior ability with magic does not translate to battle prowess in the books because she is generally fighting against magically superior foes. She is a partially trained witch fighting against adults, some of them equally or more talented than she is.

In all of Harry, Ron and Hermione's duels, they were fighting to survive and escape, not to win, and they were relying largely on non-magical ways to do that.

In every proper duel between competent adults we have seen, ability with magic has been the deciding factor. E.g. Dumbledore rounded up the Death Eaters in OotP in record time because of his magical superiority, and Voldemort and Dumbledore's duel was decided entirely by magical factors.

The only time we have seen non-magical factors be relevant is where a magically inferior combatant is desperately trying to keep up with their superior, using evasive tactics and trickery i.e. thinking on their feet, performing well under pressure.

2

Please identify a specific passage, because my exact point was that there is nowhere near enough combat description in the books to make any decision at all as to Ron and Hermione's relative duelling competence (or even Harry's).

Saying "the stuff in the books" is not a specific enough citation to counter a demand for evidence.

3

It is precisely an argument: large amounts of canon evidence linked together with inductive reasoning. You don't get to dismiss it simply because it's inconvenient to you.

4

He was perfectly able to cast spells, but he was not able to cast perfect spells. Notice that when Harry cast the shield charm for the first time in GoF it could barely hold off weak jinxes. By the time we got to HBP it was bouncing powerful curses back at their casters. In both situations he's "able to cast the spell" but the result is massively different. What has changed? Harry is not fundamentally different in any way. What's changed is that he's completed two more years of magical schooling and his magic is better as a result.

5

Incorrect. No genius builds the entirety of human knowledge from the ground up. They learn the body of current knowledge from the same stores of knowledge as everyone else: books, classes, knowledgeable individuals. Their genius doesn't mean they get to skip the learning process, it just means that the learning process is easier and quicker.

And then when they have mastered the pre-existing knowledge in their field, they can seek to apply their intelligence to expand it.

If you think about it for a moment, you don't even need to ask geniuses about how they learn to know that this must be true (though if you ask them, they will confirm it). If every genius built their knowledge from the ground up, deriving it themselves in its entirety, then a single genius would be all it took to replicate the entire body of human knowledge. Yet this is patently false. Even history's greatest minds have solved just one or two big problems.

Although it must be said that term of combat even reading a lot and doing research is (in canon) totally worthless power wise. Being good at spells is what matters, and the ones that are used a lot are fairly well known and wouldnt require much, if any, research or reading.

***** Genius(dom(?)) doesnt come from hard work, its something you are born with.

Because none of the schoolwork that is shown in the harry potter universe actually teaches any of the spells/techniques that are used in combat bar some stuff in DADA, charms and transfiguration. And even there the skills are practical ones, not theoretical ones that could be gained by actually studying (in the book sense).

If Harry were to train a lot and would practice to get better at spells and transfiguration that would make sense and would help his skill grow. Him reading a lot about them wouldnt, or at least wouldnt very much. And even if they would, only the stuff that actually is about them would help - and its pretty fair to assume that 99% of hogwarts schoolwork has absolutely nothing to do with any combat related spells.

Harry trying to better himself by practicing spells a lot and practice dueling and trying new spells - good and believable. Harry just focusing on getting an O in every class he is in and as a byproduct somehow becoming powerfull - not really believable.

****** You can't really master skills without studying, though. Sure, training a lot to become powerful is believable, but without studying the spells at all isn't. I reckon it's canon for a large number of the tests to be based on the ability to perform the spells in a class---turning something into a snuffbox, for example, in Transfiguration.

In that case, if Harry focuses on getting an O in said class, he would need to practice said spell repeatedly. If he knew the theory that enabled said spell to work instead of just brutishly using it, then he would probably be able to do it better and apply it to more fields. Studying would help him go above and beyond simple wand-waving, and into application---and if you say that that won't help at all, then take a look at Dumbledore & Voldemort's battle in the ministry. If they didn't comprehend the magic they were using in the first place and could simply use it by invoking a spell or training it through sheer brute force, then there should be more wizards capable of what they are (even if you bring the concept of magical reserves into this, surely one transfiguration of the type would be possible?).

And what does that genius apply to? If they're geniuses at comprehending magical theory and exploring beyond what's already there...that doesn't involve repeatedly casting a spell. If repeatedly casting a spell and training it to get the muscle memory down is all that's needed for magical supremacy, then I think that Hufflepuffs would've been the upper caste. Sure, genius might be a factor, but it doesn't take a genius to find an empty classroom and repeatedly cast spells at the wall.

And let's throw talent into there for good measure, because why not? If you're very talented, like Dumbledore or Voldemort, okay, you've got to train to be good in combat, maybe. I can accept that. But are you going to create /every single spell/ you use? No---for example, Voldemort uses Crucio and Avada Kedavra. Where do you get the spells you use from, then? Books and studying.

And are you going to train excessively for battle? Honestly, probably not. We see Harry dodging and rolling a lot, which is very stereotypical of combat, but compared to powers like Dumbledore and Voldemort, we also know that Harry is quite the novice. When Dumbledore and Voldemort duel in the atrium, they barely move around---they use the knowledge that they have gained from their studies to try to best one another.

You mentioned doing this through training, and training /alone, without any studying,/ which means, as I said before, that someone throwing spells at empty walls for a month should be the most powerful wizard, and Hufflepuffs would be the best at magic.

Then you said that, of course, talent factors in. Sure, talent might factor in for the overly powerful wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort, so I mentioned them, and the spells they used during their battle almost certainly aren't very well known. For your average wizard, though, innate talent isn't that big of a factor, and throwing spells against a wall for hours might improve your mastery of one spell. Beside which, how are you defining talent? An increased skill to comprehend things that others wouldn't? That talent is only useful in studying, not through dueling training---you're hardly going to have some breakthrough in application while you're practicing dodging of all things, are you? Learning new spells in the heat of battle isn't exactly practical. If you want talent in training, then the only talent available is, really, physical prowess that allows for an increased ability to dodge. Hell, that means that if Crabbe and Goyle decided to ask someone for powerful spell incantations, then found some hole to practice in, they'd emerge the most powerful wizards ever known even if they hadn't the slightest inkling of understanding towards the spells they use. After all, Crabbe and Goyle are essentially lumbering lackeys---they ought to be somewhat physically fit.

But their classes are already mostly centered around learning spells. You can't do one without the other. Studying for those classes means learning spells and theory, which makes you a better wizard. And if you're a better wizard as a whole, you'll be better in battle. You can learn spells without the intent of using them in a duel, but if you're good at casting a stunner in DADA then you can probably shift your wand and cast it at someone else if you eventually end up in a duel.

A bit of an objection there. What was Harry's strength and ultimately Tom's downfall was Harry's almost instinctive understanding of obscure magical concepts, such as the Priori Incantatem effect (everyone else was stunned by the weird stuff that was happening, even Tom, but Harry somehow knew that he has to do this-or-that) or his---and Lily's too, by extension---sacrifice (which was Tom's final undoing). You don't have to be good or quick, you just need to have the abilities that help you in the situation you find yourself in.

That said, I think the whole thing about studying being oh-so-great comes from the facts that one, the Dursleys did make Harry stop caring about getting good grades, two, Harry did show that in the moments he actually cares about studying he can get a lot of stuff---difficult stuff even---done fairly quickly (the Patronus Charm, for example), and three, some of the really good wizards and witches we know seemed to be fairly studious (and even if we do know it's because Tom and Albus were prodigies and in Hermione's case it is because she'd had 11 months to read her books before she actually went to Hogwarts).

****** Unless I'm mistaken Madame Rowling did state that the kids /have/ to get the letter on their 11th birthday at the latest, though, which means that the latest she could have gotten her letter was September of the previous year. It might not be the whole reason why she performs well, but it would explain why she was above people in the early years but not really later.

That said, I think most pureblood kids, kids who grew up with magic all around them and thus mundane and normal, are interested in /studying/ magic just because it's magic. If there is no other reason then most of them wouldn't really care one way or another even if it is magic, and Harry doesn't interact with people who are neither Ron nor Hermione enough to say for sure that nobody else read the books before. Also, Malfoy clearly had flying practice on what wasn't a toy broom before coming to Hogwarts; interpret that however you want but Quidditch is what he cares about and an advantage he has ... or would have had had Harry not been just that good at flying.

Edit:

Yeah, so Madame Rowling said two conflicting things in two interviews, one being what I wrote and the other that the letter comes during the summer before a prospective student's first year. The latter has been said first, making the former more recent and the entirety of it into a mess. It still changes nothing about purebloods possibly having years of advantage but seemingly not using for the most part, though it's less than 11 years unless the parents want to chance it without knowing if their kids actually are magical.

Supposedly---that is, if we take this interpretation rather than the other one, since heck if we know which one it is really, and there's even the chance that both were valid, just not at the same time in history---the birthday is the deadline which means that the letters would be sent a few days before that and that Hagrid visited Harry was precisely because it was the last day and they couldn't chance it. The reply date set in the letter might be the accepted kid's birthday or it might be 31st of July for everyone but the August-born kids, or it might be (again, if we choose the other possible option) 31st of July for everyone.

A lot of the surrounding stuff makes it no less confusing either. For example, you have Ollivander, who you'd think would have it better if he sold wands all year round rather than mostly just in the summer, but on the other hand wandcraft is on some level art and it wouldn't be out of place for Ollivander to spend the winter replenishing his crafting materials, but on the other other hand considering that he needs wood and what is basically animal parts winter might not be the optimal time for that and all the people who broke or lost their wands at various times never have a problem with getting a replacement regardless of the time so he is always available too; add to it the fact that the Death Eaters captured him in his shop when it would have likely been much more convenient for them to capture him outside of it if he ever left it ^{(the possibility of them just being stupid still exists, though)} , mix it with the lore bit about wandlore making it fairly likely that Ollivander gets a fairly large percentage of his materials himself, and it's easy to look at it in search of some answer and see the abyss instead.

One thing that is certain is that, with no strong evidence for either of the two options and with two seemingly contradictory statements about it from Madame Rowling, it's a bit of a mess that we have to either untangle ourselves or not touch at all.

#+end_quote

Except that is fanon. Hogwarts letters don't come on students birthdays, they always come around the end of July. Book 1 confirms this by the fact that Harry was getting Hogwarts letters for about a week prior to his birthday. The fact that Harry's birthday just so happened to be close to the time that Hogwarts sends out letters is just a coincidence. Meaning that Hermione never had 11 months to read before Hogwarts. She would have had just as little time as everyone else.

Though in relation to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5pim22/is_anyone_else_annoyed_of_the_glorification_of/dcrux9h/][thebondoftrust's post]], I feel a massive plot hole that JKR overlooked is regarding magical families. Logically, purebloods and halfbloods should have had an advantage since they would have been exposed to magic for 11 years. Legally speaking, the Ministry lets the parents control the children's magic, meaning that Ron and Draco SHOULD have been at an advantage, especially Draco given how his family would be less likely to actually follow the rules when it comes to not using underage magic at home.

Even without a wand, there is all sorts of things that could be taught: History of Magic, Herbology, Ancient Runes, Astronomy, Care of Magical Creatures, and Divination. While the latter four are electives, the former two are compulsory subjects and are highly important. You'd think that purebloods and halfbloods would be taught prior to going to Hogwarts in things such as history and herbology.

Even when it comes to using a wand, its not likely the magical parents wouldn't be able to supervise their children. If Ron tried magic at home with his wand during the summer holidays and something went wrong, then Molly or Arthur would have fixed it, especially since Molly is always at home. If Draco tried doing magic at home with a wand and something went wrong then Lucius or Narcissa could have undone his mistake since its implied Narcissa stays at home, and Lucius probably spends more time at home than Arthur even if Lucius still has a job.

I could understand the Weasleys not taking advantage of such a thing since they try to follow the rules, but the idea that neither Draco nor any other pureblood (nor any half-blood who wasn't raised by muggles, for that matter) wouldn't take advantage of being able to be practise magic at home sounds absurd.

Even if a magical child doesn't go to Ollivanders until late July, that would still mean that there would be around a month for purebloods/halfbloods practise magic at home while supervised. That's just assuming they waited until Ollivander's. We know Ron and Neville both had hand-me-down wands from other people (Charlie and Frank respectively), so in their case, they would have had even more time to practise magic. While Ron's wand wasn't right for him for reasons related to that specific wand (Ash/Unicorn hair according to Pottermore shouldn't be passed down, so Ron was screwed in that regard), its heavily implied in Deathly Hallows that wands used by family members would work well for others. Narcissa gave Draco her wand in DH which suggests that her wand would work for him, presumably because they are family. If Charlie's wand had been made of something different and not so damaged, or if Ron had got a hand-me-down wand from someone else (e.g. Bill, Molly, Arthur), Ron would have been able to use it just as well as the wand he later got from Ollivander. So logically, it makes no sense why not a single pureblood or halfblood took advantage of such opportunities, especially those from pure-blood supremacist families like Draco's or the rest of his Slytherin housemates since it would make sense for them to take advantage of the "loophole" which is common knowledge.

*TL;DR: Hermione getting her Hogwarts letter on her birthday is fanon, and the same goes for every other student. All students get their Hogwarts letter near the end of July. I find it unrealistic/absurd that not a single pureblood or halfblood ever practised magic at home even though Dumbledore basically spelled out the loophole in HBP which would let children in magical homes do underage magic at home with a wand.*

Except not really. It's more of a mess with canon rather than anything fanon, because Madame Rowling did say that in an interview, even if she'd already said something else that conflicted with it in an another interview before it.

However, I do note that retcons are a thing and as such can happen (and a few times Madame Rowling did retcon things), and Ginny did get her letter around her birthday which was 11 days into August; this isn't strong evidence but it is enough to say that no, I didn't pull this out of my ass. And Pottermore also has, or at least had, a bit about the letters being sent around one's 11th birthday; not in an article and in the help section instead, but Pottermore was supposed to be for writing about things that are canon, so it being wholly wrong and yet being on Pottermore seems like some kind of a bad joke.

If he had studied as hard as Hermione, he would have been a hell lot more powerful by the end of the Series.

That being said, my problem with many fics is that his power progression was done too easy and too fast. Those plots generally work like that: after a summer of intensive training, Indy!Harry was now capable of whomping Death Eaters' asses, and after an year or two, outduel Voldemort.

**** If you don't study how do you know what you're training? Take weightlifting as a real life example. You can sling around all the weights you want and technically I guess it makes you "strong", but without learning technique not only will you never reach your full potential, you can actually hurt yourself or hinder progress.

** I've never actually read a story like that. A story where Harry is smart? Yes. A Story where Harry uses pens and notebooks and such as opposed to quills and parchment? Yes. But never that, that's kind of silly.

But Planners and stuff, like homework planners do exist, we had them in Elementary School (Primary School, whatever you wanna call it). They look like [[https://www.pinterest.com/explore/homework-planner/][this]], but the ones I had had a spot for parents to sign it.

You mentioning this cliche though, now has me wanting to write a story where the "power he knows not" is proper prioritizing of schoolwork.

** I have to wonder if it comes from the type of people fanfiction will attract? Not to broadly paint every fanfic writer with the same brush but I have to imagine alot of the people who decide to write fanfics are maybe a geeky and studious lot (trying real hard not to generalise here) and the whole power from studying is a sort of power fantasy for these types of people?

****** True. I do feel that Divination is a unique example, however, as much of the fandom's dismissal of it stems from in-universe stigma.

The centaurs have their methods which appear to work, and Trelawney clearly teaches more than spontaneous prophecy and how it's impossible to teach, yet even Dumbledore questions its place on the curriculum. It's a shame, really, and something I feel quite strongly about.

******* It's really all the tantalizing hints we get. I mean, Trelawney is right pretty often, just not in the way we think. One of the big things is how it can tell you not about the future but the present (that tarot reading in HBP which says Harry is present).

** I think this is a key point of what bugs me in the Hermione worship; there's a difference between learning and application, between theory and practice, between astronomers and astronauts. This doesn't discount the importance of learning, but a hero like Harry is the sort who leverages every instinct and insight when it fits. Hermione would be the sort to freeze up, either from actual fear or from a form of analysis paralysis; she might be so stuck trying to think of the best solution that she doesn't act in time to be effective.

The movies were terrible in this: they made Hermione the thinker-actor-hero and put Harry into the role of happens-to-be-the-weapon; just point him towards the trouble and he'll be fine.

**** Actually, we do. Hermione does well part of the time, at others she's in a dead panic asking Harry what to do; trying to keep them from hurting a baby-headed Death Eater... because it's a baby; and treating a Silenced death eater as if no threat, instead pausing to praise someone. End result- she's the closest to death of all the combatants due to spell fire (Sirius was defeated by not understanding the danger of his location in the room).

She's afraid and asking Harry for orders. You're reading panic into the scene.

Because it appears to be an infant mentally and that's a line she's not willing to cross. Meanwhile, Harry is using nuisance spells, essentially -- disarming, stunning, paralysis, nothing that would keep someone down who has a friend nearby.

** Yeah, I find this trope really exhausting---not because there's something inherently bad about being smart, but because it often comes across as someone wedging their own identity, and their belief in its obvious superiority, into a narrative that is somewhat more complex than that. (If you are So Smart, try not to grossly over-simplify the worldview of a YA novel.)

It just closes so many doors---once you see Harry Buckle Down and Start Studying, you know exactly how the story is going to end and exactly what is going to be glorified/vilified. Suddenly the universe itself is subordinated to the axe the author wants to grind about it, sure as if they'd written "Manipulative Dumbledore" or "Weasley Bashing" in their summary.

The worst example of this for me: About 5000 words into /Harry Potter and the Fifth Element/, which is I think a million words long, the author puts Hermione into a "Talk Nerdy To Me" shirt (and suggests in an AN that future hilarious t-shirts about how cool being a nerd is are forthcoming). I'm glad I was warned in advance.

Okay, that is stupid, but I completely disagree with your point. Knowledge is power, especially for wizards who can literally alter reality with their will and a wand. Learning how to do that better isn't the be all end all of becoming powerful, but it's more than likely the first step.
