Hello! I've started making audiobooks of the Alexandra Quick series of all-OC Magical America fanfictions by Inverarity. I've finished the first book of four (fifth ongoing), and am posting chapters three times a week on [[http://samgabrielvo.com/alexandraquick][this podcast.]] [[http://www.samgabrielvo.com/alexandraquick/feed/podcast/][(RSS link here)]]

As the fics aren't mine, I don't feel uncomfortable wholeheartedly reccomending it for those who haven't heard of them, whether you listen to my audio or just read them. They really are just about the most professional-quality fanfics I've ever encountered, and I'm thrilled that the author gave me permission to record them this way.

I'm doing this as career practice, so any feedback, even--especially--negative feedback, is encouraged and appreciated.

Oh, and if this kind of post is frowned upon, that's my bad. I'm new to reddit.

But yeah, thank you for listening!

** Will you do compilation files of each book together (or in parts if it's too big for that) to easily download once it's finished? I'd rather not save a ton of individual chapter files.

This is one of those series I've meant to get into but never got around to yet, so I'm looking forward to it being completed. I do a lot more audiobook listening than reading these days.

*** Thanks for this, I hadn't thought about it and I'm glad you brought it up. I certainly can and will do that once books are finished. You'll be able to find this in whatever form I do it in on the podcast wordpress blog I linked to above.

Are you asking for a .rar file or whatever of the chapter files, or a massive gigafile of an entire book? I don't see why I couldn't do either or both, but I'm curious as to which you mean.

**** I was specifically thinking of the whole book in one audio file, if it's small enough, or divided into 10-20 hour pieces if it's too long to fit all in one. ;)

***** Sure thing! The first book is 15 hours long, so I can definitely make that into a single file once all the podcast episodes become available. If the file turns out to be huge I can just ramp up the mp3 compression. Spoken word doesn't need a huge amount of fidelity.

****** Sounds perfect, thank you! Please do post again once the first book is finished so those of us who prefer to listen to a thing all at once can do so. ;)

** Alexandra Quick is definitely a series worth making audiobooks of, and all honour to you for doing it! :) I love audiobooks and listen to a lot of them.

I didn't have time to listen to it all, but from what I heard, I think I can say this: Your reading of the dialogue is GREAT. The characters sound distinct and the way you read their lines is engaging and emotional. I have no complaints about this, you totally nail it.

When it comes to the NARRATION, though... that's where I have a problem. The narration isn't very engaging to listen to because you don't really insert any emotion or variation in it. No matter what the tone of the scene is supposed to be, you tend to read it in the same "trailer voiceover" style, with very little variation in tone and inflection between sentences.

The way the narration is read is really important in an audiobook; it can give new life to the text, or it can just make the story fall flat. I don't know if you've heard the Harry Potter audiobooks, but they are a very good example:

Personally I find the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone REALLY boring. When I read it in the book, or when I listened to Jim Dale's reading of it, it was just a really dull chapter and I wanted the story to GET A MOVE ON already.

However, last year I listened to Stephen Fry's version of the audiobook, and something interesting happened: When Stephen Fry read that first chapter, he managed only through tone of voice to make it interesting and engaging. He narrated the events and descriptions in such a confidential, almost gleeful tone... and instead of just reading about boring events I had more the feeling that Stephen Fry was coming up to me and saying conspiratorically: "Listen, I just have to tell you about these AWFUL people! You won't BELIEVE how awful they are!" He sounded like he had so much fun telling me the story, that I ended up having fun listening to it.

That alone taught me something about audiobook narration. The narrator has to insert as much emotion into the narration, as into the dialogue.

*** This is phenomenal feedback, thank you very much! Having listened to the Jim Dale books several times through, I've actually just recently started listening to the Stephen Fry ones for the first time, and I know just what you mean. What you speak of here is something I've been trying to work on throughout Thorn Circle, and I'm hoping to improve on as I begin Lands Below. I'm also a part-time radio DJ, and shaking my on-air delivery style isn't easy to do. Honestly, that's one of the reasons I started this project. Thank you so much for taking the time, I'll redouble my efforts with this going forward!

**** It's interesting, actually, because while so far I think I prefer Dale's myriad character voices to Fry's approximations, Fry's narrator is the best character in his reads, and he certainly outstrips Dale in that regard. In truth, the main challenge I focused on while reading Thorn Circle was to make sure every character sounded distinct. I've done two major audio projects before. The first, a video game where I did every voice, had 20 characters in it. The second, another young adult fantasy audiobook, had 10. Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle has around 45. So I threw myself into that, made lists and workshopped important characters, blew up Inverarity's inbox with questions (which he was a great sport about), even re-recorded some characters entirely during the edit when I worked out new voices for them. And for all that, while I was honing the narrator voice, I did, to an extent, forget that the narrator is a character.

Definitely a lot to work on for Lands Below.

***** Definitely agree that Jim Dale, on the whole, does better character voices... and it's not like his narration is BAD. It's just that narration-wise, Stephen Fry does a so much better job, and a book usually has more narration than dialogue.

Another Stephen who does a great job with audiobook narration is Stephen Briggs, who reads a great number of the Discworld books. Not only does he have an impressive array of character voices, but his narration is also really good... it really brings out the wry humour, as well as the occasional dark tragedy, of the writing. Before Stephen Briggs took over the audiobooks, they were mainly narrated by Nigel Plainer, who isn't bad either... and two of them were narrated by Celia Imrie, who was a very interesting choice.

See, Celia Imrie narrates the audiobooks in a very sweet "read to children" kind of way... and this REALLY worked for the book Equal Rites, because the main protagonist, Eskarina, is an eight year old girl, and she thinks and acts like an eight year old girl. In fact, she's so realistic as an eight year old girl that she's not always that likeable; she's not EVIL but like a child she's often thoughtless, petty, self-centered and unthinkingly cruel... but in the audiobook, she became adorable because Celia's reading and voice for her was so endearingly innocent.

The other book Celia Imrie narrated was Wyrd Sisters, where the protagonists are notably older, and the perspective and writing more worldly and sophisticated. It is a better book than Equal Rites overall, but as an audiobook it's much worse... because all of a sudden, Celia's sweet-natured reading just RUINED the book; what had worked so well for the previous book now suddenly just seemed syrupy and vaguely patronizing.

So you're right; the narrator also has to be a character. And pretty much more than any other character in a story, the character of the narrator can make or break the whole thing.
