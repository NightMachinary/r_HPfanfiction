What are your headcanons of the Professors of Hogwarts? What do they do in their spare time? Who do they hang out with?

We never focused on any of them having a family, so does anyone have a family? I like to think that Madam Pomfrey has a husband who works busy hours at the Ministry.

Even before Pottermore, I liked to think that Minerva had brothers. I like to think one brother is married, they can't have kids but they adopt. The other brother travels and is single.

Charity Burbage has a Muggle husband.

Severus, Minerva, and Filius banter with each other. Severus and Minerva do it more often. It helps relieves the stress of watching over so many students.

What are your headcanons for the Professors?


** Hooch is unusual in that she only works part time and doesn't live at Hogwarts, she just teaches flying lessons for first years in the first term and comes in to referee Quidditch matches. She used to fly professionally and has enough saved up from her successful career that she doesn't actually need a year round job.

The staff routinely bet on the outcome of the Quidditch cup, which McGonagall takes very seriously.

Trelawney is so rarely seen the house elves sometimes don't even set out enough plates for her to eat at the staff table.

** - Filius still runs in underground duelling circles. He's mostly retired now and judges the matches, but if you get him drunk enough he'll take part in one.

- Snape smokes

- Sprout is willing to give her students funding to start any club they want, or to fund educational programs or therapy for a student because she's determined to make the playing field as equal as possible for her Puffs. Where does she get the money? No-one asks, but she does cultivate quite a few expensive plants in her greenhouses, and they don't actually need that many for class...

** Minerva and Hagrid were in the same year. 3 years below Tom Riddle.

No one is entirely sure how old Flitwick is. Must be the goblin in him. Obviously he's At Least 15 years older than Snape but could be ages with Minerva for all we know....

Burbage is now the youngest member of staff. She was only supposed to be temporary while Quirrel was on sabbatical but agreed to a second year when he applied for the dark arts position. Was offered a permanent contract in 1992.

Out of all the teachers Flich hates Sprout the most. She's always tracking dirt into the castle. He thinks it's a pity she's not a student he can put in detention. Mrs Norris is no help against her. She seems to actually like the woman for some reason. He doesn't know that Sprout grows catnip for her especially.

** McGonagall and Snape are best friends and only communicate in sarcastic quips and snarky insults.

Sinistra hates Trewlaney.

Flitwick is a dote and good friends with Minerva and Snape, but not on the same banter level. He is the amiable glue that keeps the staffroom together, able to liaise between different cliques.

Sprout is exactly as the films, badass weird and goes drinking with Hagrid. (Remus stuck with these two when he was at Hogwarts)

No one likes Dumbledore.

Sinistra and Vector are very good friends but the kind of polite, business friends who just talk about work. (Firenze stuck with these two)

Burbage always feels a bit left out (in my head she's very muggle so doesn't fit into the wizarding world as much). Generally stands at the edge and makes polite conversation with who'sever beside her.

Pomfrey is a stubborn fireball who sticks with Snape and Minerva whenever she has time to go to a meeting. Promfrey hated Gilderoy with a passion and Minerva more than once had to physically stop the woman from murdering him.

Sinistra is a lightweight. Flitwick is not.

Trelawney never shows up to anything. When she does she sticks with Burbage.

Hooch has little to no interest in any staff thing and makes excuses to miss them. She is a fierce, ruthless woman who takes absolutely no bullshit from anyone. Very frank and to the point. It's my own personal headcanon that her and McGonagall are married and spend their evenings drinking sherry and making very nuanced sporting puns. I don't care if it's not canon, I like it.

** Snape and McGonagall have tea every Friday evening. It started off with Minerva physically dragging Snape to her office but eventually he made it on his own.

Snape and Minerva are lowkey best friends but you won't hear them ever say a nice thing about each other, though they bond over their students and quidditch

Trelawney has some sort of thing for Snape and makes passes at him when she gets drunk

Pomfrey and McGonagall make sure Snape takes care of himself.

Snape isn't afraid of Voldemort or Dumbledore, but he is bloody TERRIFIED of an angry Minerva

The Heads of Houses do bet on which Quidditch team is going to win...sometimes they even bet on other houses, but all behind Dumbledore's back

Filius gets along with everyone, he's the glue of the staff

Hooch really doesn't give a SHIT about anything

Every once in a while, when the students are really awful, the staff (minus Dumbledore and Trelawney) will spend the night getting drunk and playing games (chess, cards, etc.)

Everyone lowkey dislikes Dumbledore and talks shit behind his back occasionally

Everyone stays away from Pince

Snape is the baby of the staff even after he'd been teaching there for over a decade, and he goes to Dumbledore to complain, who only twinkles and offers him a lemon drop

Dumbledore's lemon drops have calming draught and just a little versitaserum

The staff has an ongoing bet each year of how each DADA teacher's term will end

Everyone knows of Sinistra's and Snape's on-and-off affairs which is just sex but no one dares acknowledge it...outright

** All of these are fantastic and I'm keeping them for references in later writing.
