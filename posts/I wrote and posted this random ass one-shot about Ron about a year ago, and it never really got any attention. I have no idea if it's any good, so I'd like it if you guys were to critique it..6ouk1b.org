#+TITLE: I wrote and posted this random ass one-shot about Ron about a year ago, and it never really got any attention. I have no idea if it's any good, so I'd like it if you guys were to critique it.

** The non aging curse device has a lot of holes in it and makes for a weaker story.

My first reaction was to question why someone would use this curse in a battle. A battle has an immediate need to take down an opponent and casting time isnt going to be wasted on a curse that won't come to fruition for a 100 years.

Second, why isn't Voldemort using this on himself if it prevents aging since he has a fear of death? Why aren't more wizards using it? If Ron was able to diagnose the curse then others must know about it and therefore used it and Ron would not be alone. Why didn't his friends use it?

I realize the curse isn't the point of the fic but it is hinge on which everything hangs. IMO you need to find a different device to explore this type of grief.

*** +1000 upvotes there. Every time that a dark wizard/witch hits a character of a story with some spell that either sends them back in time or other time giving stuff I feel like going on a cat murder spree..

Seriously, a bad reaction to a badly made potion mixed with some randomly throw ingredient or spells or enchanted item is much more believable.

** Generally it's an interesting premise, but the concept has been already examined a lot.

Some examples are the movie "Man from Earth" and - in this fandom - linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh).

Quite honestly, while your fic is well-written (no obvious clumsy language, no bad grammar and a good use of language in general) the only purpose of this shot seems to be examine the concept of not agining while everyone around does, how eternal living is a curse. Your story did nothing to add to my understanding of that. Both examples I linked allready examine it in detail, and - imo - in a better, clearer, way. Partially because they are longer and thus have time to make us care about the characters, and partially because they set up the concept and conflicts better.

--------------

I'm going to be more nitpicky than usual, because with such short fics the use of language is more important than for longer texts imo.

Take these lines:

#+begin_quote
  For the life of him, he couldn't. Why? He couldn't answer if he tried, and he didn't.

  'It's been a good life,' he thought. A good life, but oh so many regrets.
#+end_quote

The 2nd line is a semi-answer to the first line, but it's never explored anymore. You set up a conflict here (Good Live vs. Losing Everyone) but then never elaborate on it.

You actually do this a second time with the exact same conflict:

#+begin_quote
  No one to love, no one to be loved by. Still, it was a good life. He had stopped being afraid of death for a while now, or so he thought. Why did his feet seem to be frozen, unmoving in front of the veil?
#+end_quote

You set up the exact same conflict again, and again without resolution or additional exploration. What's worse, you don't even give the reader enough (or just more) material because we don't know /anything/ about Ron's life beside the loved ones he has lost.

We don't get to see the good side, so the non-resolved conflict annoys even more, because now it is non-resolvable. Why was his life good? You make us care about the conflict by stating it twice - but also drop it at the same time.

So overall it kinda had the feeling that you were not sure where you wanted to go with this.

I wanna quote from A long Journey Home here:

#+begin_quote
  "Do you think you're the only person to bury family and friends?" he growled. There were a grand total of four people in the world who could speak to her the way he was; his wife was at home, and the other two were children who hadn't even learned of her identity yet, much less their privilege. "I may be a tenth your age, but that's still more than enough time to grasp loss. And unlike you, I had a tool at hand to prevent it... a gift of the Elixir, and I'd never have to lose a friend to time again! But like you, I've let what has to be done override what I want to do, and I've had to say goodbye to friend after friend because of it."

  "Do you really want to compare numbers?" she asked angrily. "Because-"

  "This isn't a game of who has suffered the worst!" he snapped. "Death may skip us, but he comes for everyone around us! And it gets so... tiring!"

  "So what? Life goes on!" The ancient woman's voice was shaking, and it hurt him to hear. "Children everywhere will bury their parents, lovers depart from beloved, accidents happen! We don't just stop because-" She skidded to a stop, eyes wide. Finally hearing her own words, just as Nicolas had been voicing her own thoughts. He smiled at her sadly, his own anger gone as quickly as it had appeared. She drew a shaky breath. "Clever boy," she whispered.

  "You don't have a monopoly on the 'wise old goat' role, you know," he remarked. He stood and walked over to her, squeezing her shoulders gently. "I understand what you're going through, Morgan. And Peri will listen when you need to talk, too. We won't very well abandon you."
#+end_quote

I feel like this part does better job of examining the relationship of an immortal person with death.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I'm gonna cover something that hasn't been mentioned yet, especially because you say you want more readers / attention.

You need a better summary. I'm honestly never going to click on a fic with no summary, and I'm even less likely to click on one with a summary that's basically "its short just read it". My immediate reaction there is "fuck you don't tell me how to spend my time!"

Your readers time is valuable and there are hundreds of thousands of fics for them to read. Why would they ever open one with a generic name and nothing to pull them in? Would you see a movie you knew nothing about? Pick up a book? Nope. So why expect your readers to do the same?

If you're too lazy to write even a three sentence summary (?) then pick a line from the fic that you like. Something interesting that makes people wonder how and why we got there.

Do better for your potential audience and help convince them to open the fic. Otherwise no critique is worth it, because you won't have any readers anyways. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
