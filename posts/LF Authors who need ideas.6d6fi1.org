I have tried to write about 4 different stories but the truth is I just don't have the skill or patience to write what I have thought out.

So I am wondering if there are Authors out there willing to listen to ideas and make them a reality? If this is an out of context request then certainly delete this post, I'm just curious is all.


** It is probably easy to find writers to do ideas, especially as challenges, but odds are, you won't get many good writers, and you will feel cheated when some amateur comes along and ruins your idea.

*** That was/is my fear of course since I am already doing a good enough job ruining it myself ;)

**** Who knows, you might get lucky. A while back I wrote the most hideous, shittiest fic ever, up to 50k, and gave up and stopped. Several years later, I am looking around for new stories on this subreddit, and I find a story that has an eerie amount of similarities, and I see that the author was following that shitty fic. He had taken everything I was trying to do, and made it everything I wanted out of it.

** Authors generally tend to have far more story ideas than time to write them. The hard part is in going from concept to proper story, which requires a whole lot more work than just ginning up the concept in the first place.

** I suffer the same issue in that I have a great many ideas but no skill to create a story worth telling without ruining the image.

My best advice is to try writing them as a drabble, not only will this provide a greater base for an author to go from but might suffice for building a short story from many small chapters.
