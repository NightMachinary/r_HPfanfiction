Hi, I have a request for you. I am looking for stories that show Morgana le Fay in any way. It could be that she is a mentor for Harry as a portrait or book or still alive and adopting him or she is portrayed in some way. Because I personally find Morgana very interesting. Maybe there will be stories.

** Jasmine Potter becomes Muirgen (among other historical figures) when taking linkffn(A Long Journey Home). Although it's technically unfinished, you can still read the story as if it was complete, because it starts by giving you the beginning and the ending of the story, and then the rest is just telling some of the stories from the middle. So even though it stops partway through one of the tales, it's not really left hanging.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
