Considering they are a canon pairing (in the extended universe anyway), I haven't read any fics featuring them. So send me your best ones! Fics that are book canon-compliant which feature the development of their relationship preferred, but if it's an otherwise good story with them in it, I'll take non-canon compliant stories too. The ship doesn't need to be a focus, but should still show their developing relationship.

Thanks in advance!


** Lady of the Lake by Colubrina has an amazing sideplot with them adopting a son and dealing with trauma, but it doesn't start until like 15 chapters in

**** So does it have to end Neville/Hannah?

Mind, I have nothing against the characters, but I know a couple of fics with it where they both end up breaking up.

There's another one which has a more tragic breakup, but I can't remember it for the life of me.
