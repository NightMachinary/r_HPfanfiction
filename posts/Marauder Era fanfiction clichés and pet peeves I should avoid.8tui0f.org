So I'm planning on writing a fanfiction but I don't know what to avoid and what not to. I want to try and break away from the stereotypes while adhering to canon as much as possible but what are some of the most annoying and most inaccurate clichés from fanfiction so I could avoid that. And what are some facts that are often forgotton, misremembered or ignored so I can avoid those as well.

Thanks! :)


** My biggest pet peeve I would say is how Sirius is portrayed. I see so many stories where he is some hyperactive spazmoid and it drives me bonkers. He was an abused rich kid who probably had really good manners.

** For all that is good in the universe, do not keep hinting at Peter being cunning or conniving or what have you. Nobody else seems to have seen it coming in canon, and it would be strange for him to act really evil that would definitely be noticed over the 1970s by his friends. He didn't turn because he was "evil" or a master manipulator, he was desperate and afraid.

James was a chaser, not a seeker. Forget about why he had a snitch in Snape's memory (I know its dumb that Rowling did that, but it is what it is).

Don't try to make Lily or Snape or even Remus into these incredible magical savants in school (assuming they are depicted here). They were reasonably talented students, but just students. Show that Lily is good at Charms and Potions, while Snape is good at Potions and DADA (and maybe other subjects), but don't overpower them.

They learn about Remus in 3rd year, and became animagi in their 5th.

Don't make James come on too strong, or be so in to Lily even when he is 11. Same thing for Snape, though that could vary depending on your personal interpretation.

I don't remember when the Marauder's Map was created (or if its even mentioned), but it probably was not until they were old enough to have explored the castle.

James had the Invisibility Cloak, but we don't know when he received it. Who knows, he could have had it before he got on the Hogwarts Express.

I wasn't planning to. If anything, Sirius and James would be closer to 'magical savants' because they were the top of their year but they obviously weren't at only eighteen, least of all these three. I was planning on making Lily the tenth of her class, Remus ninth and Snape right behind James and Sirius. Thoughts?

Doesn't matter too much. I am actually not sure if their really is any "ranking" so much as Harry says Hermione was top in the class (since he probably knows her grades), so don't focus too much on who is better than who overall.

As for the map, odds are it had to happen after they became animagi. They wrote their pseudonyms into the document, so it probably wasn't at least until they were 5th years. The plot can sort of revolve around becoming animagi for 4th-5th year, and now they need a new project during 6th year, so they decide to record their discoveries in the map.

Lily should be closer to Snape than Remus (who I don't think is never said to be near the top, even if that's reasonable). That she got the Head position, which appears to go to those at or near the top, suggests that anyway. It's really hard for me to think Snape was behind them. Potions and DADA he was pretty much a shoo-in to win (Sirius pretty much says this). I could see them besting him in Transfiguration and maybe Charms.

Pottermore says it was mapped over time using the Invisibility Cloak, so it could be anytime really. But since it wasn't taken by Filch until their seventh year, I'd like to think they had it usable by their fifth year.

***** To be honest, we don't know about Lily all that much so OP isn't particularly wrong or inaccurate when he puts her closer to Lupin than Snape. We know Lily was reasonably talented and Lupin constantly proved himself as that throughout the series so placing her around him is plausible enough. But no one can deny Lupin is extremely talented and way above the average wizard so there's no fallacy in placing Lily close to him since he constantly proved himself a formidable opponent. Getting the Head position doesn't rely on academic achievement only, remember that and making it just so isn't accurate. There are perfectly lovely reasons in popular fanfictions (Commentarius and TLAT) where Lily is Head Girl and are all very plausible and add depth to her character so OP could toy with that as well and get creative with it.

Anything in the top ten behind Sirius and James is plausible, to be honest because we just don't know enough about her to make assumptions that are very wrong around the levels between Lupin and Snape. Snape was, after all, an extremely talented wizard so thirty-seven year old Snape = eighteen year old Lily isn't logical at all, since he spent around two decades building up on his skills while Lily was sadly dead so we don't know what she could've been, but she would have been very talented (around Emmeline Vance and Lupin). But she wouldn't be behind Lupin in talent, so anything below that is implausible. But anything near Dumbledore and Voldemort or Morgan Le Fay for that matter is also ridiculously improbable.

But to be honest though, OP shouldn't concentrate on rankings all that much and try to concentrate more on character development rather than how 'wow' they are at magic and just how much of geniuses they are. For example, Lily from Every Other Midnight isn't plausible because she's better than most top aurors at only eighteen, Lily from the Long Game is also implausible because she's basically a goddess but Lily from Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, The Life and Times, or Promises Unbroken is perfectly fine and very probable. It depends on balancing things out (Lily is good at potions and charms, she should struggle a bit with another subject, maybe non-practical ones or Transfiguration).

****** As I said, it's reasonable to put Lupin high, but we know the head position does have a lot to do with outstanding academic achievement. Just look at those who had it: Dumbledore, Percy, James, McGonagall, etc. All top of their class. Now Lupin is exceptional, but I find it unlikely the top girl in their class was behind so many people, just really unlikely.

I definitely didn't say Lily was equal to an adult Snape, I was talking about schooling. Unless we're just going to say Slughorn and Lupin are completely unreliable, Lily's Potions ability was more or less indistinguishable from Snape's. Likely very good at Charms as well, given the wand she had (notice James's skill in Transfiguration is matched by his wand's aptitude).

Anyway, I agree about the ranking not being super important. It just sticks in my craw, I suppose.

******* Firstly, yes, you should be one of the best but not necessarily the best. And there's no evidence she was the top girl of her year unless I'm missing out on something. Ron was a prefect. I'm not saying Lily was like Ron but you get by point. She was way better, obviously but as far as we know, not the top girl of her year. Remember, there are people we don't know of and it's perfectly reasonable that some might have been brilliant as well. Especially with the likes of the Bones, Prewetts and McKinnons still floating around at that time.

It is unknown thus far whether she was the top girl or another girl was better so it's just something akin to a 'headcanon', because it's an interpretation that isn't contradicted by canon but other interpretations like The Life and Times that has Donna Shacklebolt the top girl is also valid because, again, nothing contradicts it. So it's unknown unless Rowling confirms it and all headcanons are perfectly acceptable if nothing contradicts them. So it's not canon, just unknown to us. So TLAT is a headcanon and her being as smart as Hermione is also a headcanon. But who knows what Rowling thinks anyway?

Eh but Prefect is stated to not be about having the top grades; neither Ron nor Harry had even close to the best scores. Lupin got Prefect over James and Sirius, even though they had higher grades. But the Head position has no known exceptions to going to those with the top scores (Dumbledore, James, Percy and so on).

********* I don't see why Prefect and the Head Position shouldn't have the same requirements. Lupin was exceptional as well, although not as much as both Sirius and James and we actually get a reason why he was made a prefect. Ron, however, was most likely made a prefect because of self-esteem issues. Because, looking at the other prefects, we see that they are among the top, but not the top: Ernie Macmillan, Padma Patil, Draco but we have unexplained ones like Pansy. So, it's not necessarily about grades for both positions. I'm also unwilling to believe that Percy was the best at practical magic in his year.

I think it's also worth noting, about the head positions that we only get four years out of over a thousand so there must be some exceptions. We know they're heads, but we don't know /why/. For example, Draco was supposedly better at magic than Ron. However, had the seventh year been normal and Dumbledore was alive, would he have gotten the head position over him? Unlikely

My point is they were heads and all positions weren't achieved based solely on academic achievement, but for reasons unknown they were, so unless Rowling decides to tell us, I guess well just have to rely on our interpretations. I personally like to believe that Dumbledore saw that James had matured and wanted to set an example to Sirius and the student body of how someone like James (a bully) evolved into a responsible adult in hopes of making them learn. As for Lily, there are a lot of possibilities and I personally believe she and James were good but she was picked from among the best as a muggleborn so Dumbledore could also set an example to the student body as well. I also like to believe she joined a lot of extracurricular activities and was generally well-liked, outgoing and very responsible and charismatic. But my friend thinks they were prodigies so extraordinary that Dumbledore set them up there. Anothr friend of mine thinks that they weren't actually heads and Hagrid was misinformed or misremembering (lol).

Notice the pattern? We don't know the reasons entirely and what goes on in Dumbledore's mind so it's our interpretations at the end of the day

Anyway this is too long and pointless, sorry for wasting your time

*** I always wondered why specifically Lily and Snape are made into magical savants and portrayed as the 'ideal' witch or wizard. It really irks me when we do know the top two of their year: Sirius and James. That is completely ignored in favor of those two. Especially Lily, which can sometimes get sickening because of just how overpowered she is. Snape is an entire different story as well. But I see no reason why it's so reinforced in the fandom that they were /incredible geniuses the likes of Merlin and Dumbledore/.

** - Remus wasn't particularly fond of chocolate, that we know of. He just offered Harry a bar that one time. And before anyone goes "but he had one /on/ him", he knew there were Dementors around. /That's/ why.

- Peter Pettigrew was not a bumbling moron, nor the other three's chewtoy, nor an obviously-evil, sycophantic traitor-in-training. He was a rather good student, albeit a notch beneath the other three, and a genuinely good and loyal friend, which is why his betrayal was so terrible. (He was also not particularly ugly as a kid; just plain. The movies make him look vaguely repulsive, but that's /after/ he spent 10 years as a rat who didn't wash very often.)

- Not everyone in the past is someone we know. I guess it's fine to say Lily was friends with Alice not-yet-Longbottom, but not everyone was in the same generation. Frank might have been one or several years above the Potters, Lucius would have been in his seventh year or something when James started, etc.

- Concerning Remus specifically, there is little canon evidence that he has /any/ benefits from being a werewolf (goodbye super-smell, and good riddance), and it's nearly certain that he /doesn't/ have obvious scars on his face as canon keeps claiming.

- James was a /Chaser/ in Quidditch. I think this one's mostly cleaned up by now, but it never hurts to put up a reminder.

- Not that canon points against it, but unless you have something /really/ clever to do with it, /please/ avoid the "I'm not Sirius, you're Sirius" puns. /PWEASE./

- In the early years Snape was neither an "evil" kid, nor a harmless victim of bullying. He gave as good as he got to the Marauders, who do you think he invented all these hexes in the Potions textbook /for/? Their conflict should be an ever-escalating war where every time /they/ prank /him/, /he/ pranks them /back/.

- The Divination Professor is not yet Sybill Trelawney (who is hardly older than the Marauders at all). Corollary, /that is not an excuse to make them competent/; Dumbledore mentions he considered cancelling the class altogether shortly before he had ot hire Trelawney to get her safe and protected at Hogwarts, which implies her predecessor was just as shabby.

- Small but grating: Lily did not call James "an arrogant toerag" every other sentence. She used that insult /twice/ in canon. It wasn't her go-to monike. The oddity of the insult, however, suggests that she was wont to making up colorful ones on the fly; so be creative!

- "Padfoot", "Prongs", etc. don't refer to the Animagus forms as separate entities, because the Animagus forms /aren't/ separate entities. Those are all just nicknames which the Marauders referred to each other by. "Sirius turned into Padfoot" means nothing. (Consider that the Marauder's Map says "Msr Prongs, Padfoot, Moony & Wormtail present..."; specifically, would Remus really give credit to his /hated werewolf form/ for the creation of the Map?)

- Snape wasn't /bullied/ into joining the Death Eaters. Peer-pressured, yes, but the other Slytherins didn't take a wand to his neck; he was genuinely /friends/ with Mulciber. (Not Harry-Ron-and-Hermione friends, but, you know, pals. They talked about /other/ things than Death-Eatering.)

- Few Marauder fics involve Dumbledore very much, which is weird, because James and Dumbledore went on to become close friends, and thus I find it highly likely they were already on very good terms when he was a student. He /did/ arrange the whole Whomping Willow set-up with them, too. So featuring him as more than a cameo would be nice. Maybe he's supportive of the Marauders' pranks at first because he finds them funny and thinks the other Professors are too stuffy, but then progressively grows more distant and stern when things escalate and what they and Snape do to each other starts straying more in the "goddamn illegal" direction than "oh Merlin that's hilarious"?

- As I understand it, Regulus was a terrible person. He's the perfect example of “Even Evil has Standards”: he was /absolutely/ into blood-purity and Muggle-born-torturing, he just thought Voldemort was an insane maniac even by Black family standards and anyone who split their souls would be a guaranteed trainwreck in the end. Perhaps there was a bit of nagging conscience buried underneath besides, though that's not even certain; but the point is, Regulus is not Snape. Regulus should not have a "slow descent into darkness" that Sirius tries to pull him away from. Regulus should fit right in with Mulciber and Avery and Rosier.

Whether it was for James or for Remus or for all four of them is irrelevant.

Well that's kind of what I'm referring to: he's like Draco. Draco did /not/ have a "descent into darkness". If anything it was the reverse. My point is that Regulus isn't "seduced" to the Death Eaters like Snape is --- and yet is often depicted that way --- but rather had always supported them, even if he couldn't go through with the actual violence.

Sure. I'm not making a /moral/ argument here; the Marauders may well more to blame, that's not what I'm /talking/ about. What I'm saying is that whether or not it's very effective, the story should /show/ us Snape fighting back, and nastily, rather than just being a passive victim to the Marauders' pranks (which is what usually happens).

  For the first quote, McGonagall says "quite in their league". Since James and Sirius were top of their class, "not quite in their league" still means pretty damn good.

you're being obtuse. he was described as 'slow'. and she wouldn't have to be 'rather sharp' to someone who was pretty damn good. you're also not making any sense. 'not being in their league' includes everywhere from 2nd place to last place. the character was, very obviously, designed to be a pathetic sycophant who surprised everyone by being a cunning sycophant. /every/ single discussion about him emphasizes how pathetic he was. every achievement is with a caveat that he needed help, or was slow, etc.

As to her being "sharp", that seems natural when he was constantly putting himself next to the other three Marauders who /were/ better than him, such that he always looked worse in comparison. Somewhat like how Ron is, in the end, a pretty competent wizard, but fanon perceives him as very dumb because he's constantly next to Hermione.

** Snape was /very/ prejudiced against Muggles. The only reason he was friends with Lily is because she was the only other witch in the area and he was lonely. Recall that he even attempted to kill Petunia once. He showed Death-Eater leanings before they even went to Hogwarts.

Snape was also the ultimate destruction of Lily and Petunia's relationship. The sisters might not have been close, but they cared about each other before then. Petunia even warned Lily away from Snape because she thought he would be a bad influence.

Lily had several friends other than Snape. Possible friends for Lily include Marlene McKinnon, Mary McDonald, Dorcas Meadows, Emmeline Vance, etc. Do /not/ make them into the female version of the Marauders. Lily is more like Hermione than she is Ginny.

- I can't remember if Hestia was part of the first Order, but if she /was/, then she could be related to Megan Jones and possibly a Hufflepuff.

Frank and Alice were known as good Aurors, so they are at least one year, probably more, older than Lily and the Marauders.

There is only one known case where James hexed people for fun (Bertram Aubrey, I believe was the name). It probably happened in fifth-year and that, combined with Snape, is the reason Lily said it. Seeing as people justify Ginny hexing Zacharias Smith and others, well, make of it what you will.

Not canon, but for the Prank, the timeline is /likely/ this:

- Sirius turns sixteen in November, runs away in December.

- For whatever reason, Sirius tells Snape how to get past the Whomping Willow. /Likely/, Snape antagonized him and Sirius reacted badly.

- Snape tries to reveal Remus as a werewolf but James saves him instead. Snape shows no gratitude.

- James, hearing what actually happened, forgives Sirius' accidental attempt at murder and wants revenge on Snape. Thus the scene after O.W.L.s occurs, but he can't justify it to Lily seeing as no one is supposed to know about Remus.

The Marauders used cruel but harmless pranks. Snape actually attacked them. (Based on the O.W.L.s scene). Also recall that until recently, pantsing someone wasn't considered sexual assault/harassment, and anyway, Snape's attempt at murder was far worse.

Peter might have been a sycophant, but he was also a good friend and reasonably smart.

A good way to explain James having the Snitch is that he played Seeker before, but the team needed another Chaser so he changed positions. Maybe he switched in his sixth year. (Like how Ginny switched positions.)

By fifth year, Lily started realizing that Snape was a lost cause. The O.W.L.s scene was just the last straw.

There is no evidence for Wolfstar. Possibly Remus had feelings for Sirius, but Sirius was firmly straight. (Having Remus secretly pining for Sirius but knowing it will never happen is an interesting twist. It could also be the reason for the line, “Your mother was there for me when no one else was,” as Lily helped him get through it.)

James was probably good or even the best at Potions, seeing as his father was a Master. Slughorn also probably offered him to be part of the Slug Club, but James rejected it. (And thus Slughorn only mentioned Lily, because he was offended that James rejected him.)

Snape had been obsessed with Lily since he was about nine years old. Very few people would appreciate those types of feelings and frankly, I find them creepy, not romantic. When Snape stares intensely at Lily and she blushes, it's likely because she's /uncomfortable/, not flattered.

Being good at Dark Spells does /not/ mean that Snape was the best at Defense Against the Dark Arts.

If they had class rankings, it'd probably be:

- James/Sirius

- Snape

- Lily

Snape had a choice in joining the Death Eaters. All Regulus ever knew was the Dark Side. Do with that what you will.

The first war started in 1970, thus James was opposed to Slytherin. It is /not/ the same as Draco mocking Hufflepuff. Also the class sizes were probably bigger than in Harry's time. In fact, it would be the tail-end of the baby-boomers (the war with Grindelwald occurred at the same time as the Muggle one). This means there were probably more Muggleborns, too.

**** - Snape's attack on Petunia might have been accidental, but it happened because he seriously wanted to hurt her and she might have been killed had it worked. The attack on James was a slash to the cheek; had Sirius not shouted, it might've cut James' jugular. Both attacks were certainly done with the intention of harm.

- Would they have been playing Quidditch recently if it was O.W.L.s? I can't recall if they did in OotP for Harry. Anyway, he specifically said he nicked it.

- I base Lily's feelings on my own experience. Trust me, when you're the recipient, it gets /really/ uncomfortable.

- JKR has implied multiple times over that Sirius is straight. She has not done the same for Remus, so he could still be bisexual. My own interpretation for the reason she hasn't outright said it is because Wolfstar is a popular ship, and she wants to seem open to LGBTQ. Let's face it, she does stuff like that a lot.

- I was simply stating that it doesn't directly correlate. Also the same argument could be made for Remus, who taught DADA. Or for all we know, Peter was the best at DADA. Or your new OC character, Maleficent Dracula.

- Britain might not have been directly part of the war, but we /do/ know it was heavily influenced by it. Often in those situations, people have less kids for fear the war will reach their own country. Perhaps it wasn't a baby /boom/, but more kids would have been born overall.
