I just posted chapter 8 of Prisoner, a tale of Remus, Lily, Sirius, James,, and a muggle OC named Sarah. This chapter is pretty fluffy, although the story overall is tragic, because war is hell. Here's a little excerpt:

Sarah laughed. “I feel so silly. I've somehow been thinking that Sirius is a man who sometimes pretends to be a dog, but now I realize he's actually a dog who sometimes pretends to be a man.”

Lily laughed too. “I thought that was obvious. James, I told you this cur would be nothing but trouble if we took him in. These high-maintenance purebreds are completely impractical.”

“Come on Lily, he's been a Potter family pet for years, ever since his old family dumped him. He has nowhere else to go.”

“Yes he does. Sirius, why are you always here? Don't you have your own flat?”

“Well, I do, but...” his voice faltered. “I don't like being there since Remus left.”

“It seems lonely without him?” sympathized James.

“No, it's just really messy now that he's not cleaning it.”

Lily turned to her husband. “Anyway James, it's bad enough you allow your pet indoors. I won't let him eat at the table. We ought to put his dish on the floor.”

“Good view from down here,” Sirius said cheerfully from the floor under the table, where he'd taken his plate. “If you're a leg man. Muggle clothes show everything. Look at a witch in robes, you can't even tell if she's got legs or tentacles or what. Muggles flaunt their bipedal locomotion. That's so hot. What? Don't laugh. It's true. I can't help that I'm into bipeds. Here I thought you'd be accepting of my weird fetish for two-legged beings, but now I see that you're prudes.”

“I'll have to cancel that blind date I set up between you and Auror Moody,” said Lily as she hauled Sirius up and shoved him back into his chair.

#+begin_quote
  When a human is captured by werewolves, escape is impossible, but she might be able to accomplish one thing: kill Remus Lupin. He's the most evil werewolf in the pack because he's the best at pretending to be human.
