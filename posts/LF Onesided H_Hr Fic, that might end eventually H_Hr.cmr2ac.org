I would like to know Fics that have Harry being Single (Post-war). It could be that he and Ginny never become a Couple again or atleast not like they imagined to be. Either they try it for a certain, but not much time or their feelings are gone, when the War is over. Ron and Hermione however more or less develop like in the Canon (epilogue-compliant). However at some Point Harry begins to be attracted to Hermione and have feelings for her.

And at some point he might confess to her that he feels more for her than just Friendship. I would like if she is still (happy) with Ron and apologizes for not reciprocrating these feelings, or something like that.

Whether she stays with Ron or they separate (because their Relationship dont work anymore, the reasons for this can vary) doesnt matter. I would also like a Single Hermione who dont reciprocrate his Feelings.

It can still happen that in the end, she also develops feelings for him. Whether or not, i accept both.

** This isn't quite what your asking for, as it's Hermione who has feelings for Harry, but it is an epilogue compliant one-sided H/Hr.
