I want a long -- and I mean /long --/ fanfiction (completed/on-going series), where the MC is self-reflective via actions and thoughts, on what it means to be a good person. I want someone who frequently doubts themselves, especially if they are in atonement for past actions. Someone who stumbles and falls along the way, yet never losing sight of who they were and hope to be.

Bonus: they have friends who act as 'morality pets' for them, and if anything were to happen to them, then may whatever deities exist have pity upon those foolish enough to inflict harm.


** The protagonist of this fic will be an adult. Seriously, this type of self-reflection and emotional work is rare in teenagers, and that's not even touching the whole war aspect. I hope you find a fic that fits this as well, but for it to be somewhat bearable this needs to be focused on adult characters.

*** I think this kind of thing is possible for maybe a Harry that sees more shit than in canon, but also is forced to do things himself. That kind of internal thought process would not come up until late though.

It has inklings in canon in Order of the Phoenix when Harry is concerned about being a bad person.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** I want to rec mine because this is basically the theme of the entire story. ^_^ I feel like it's pretty rare to see this theme in YA fiction, and I'd love to find more stories like it.

Harry Potter wants to explore the stars and conquer death using the powers of magic and science, but struggles with self-doubt over whether he'll ever achieve anything. He's socially awkward and has some anger issues, which he tries to overcome for the sake of the people he cares for. Eventually he has to decide whether to follow his head or his heart, and what that means for his path in life.

Harry meets a D&D style Paladin and is impressed by the poise and certainty about what is right. This Paladin becomes Harry's mentor and Harry sorta struggles wether he should follow this calling for the rest of his life or not. Whether he wants to sacrifice a normal life...etc.

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.

** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2470334/1/]])

I think this story does exactly what you are asking for, especially for the main character (Severus Snape). It was started before HBP came out, so of course there are changes to canon. Snape starts out in character, but changes massively. It is very believeable since the protagonist is an adult. There is one aspect of this story which I highly dislike, but I still think it is very much worth the read.

  COMPLETE. AU to HBP and DH. Snape and his apprentices form a bond which may never be broken, not even in death. And at the end of it, Severus Snape is able to perform a spell that he has never been able to do before. Ok, it's not a million words. I tried.
