:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I read the first few chapters of this fic a while back and now can't seem to find it.

Here is what I remember:

- Harry was living on his own in a dreary flat in a poor neighborhood of Muggle London. I think they were mentions of him being pretty dissatisfied with his (boring) life.
- He was around 18 years old, and somehow didn't know he was a wizard. I don't remember if it's because he had never been told or if he had some kind of amnesia.
- A group of wizards his age, who were on the run and active in the resistance against Voldemort, came to look for him. Hermione, Draco, and I think Ron, were in this group. He had to leave his flat (which probably had become dangerous once the location was known to wizards) to go with them.

Does anybody know that fic or fics with a similar premise?

-- also, this is my very first post on Reddit, so I hope I'm not posting in the wrong place or anything!!

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
