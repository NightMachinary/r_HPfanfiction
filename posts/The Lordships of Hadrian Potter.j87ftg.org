What is the biggest stupidest inheritance list you've ever seen? Seriously, give me the best Harry-power-wanks goblin inheritance stuff just so I can laugh.


** I always wanted to see one of those scenes where they play the inheritance list scene like a Monty Python sketch.

"...Mr Potter-"

"That's Lord Potter! But you can skip the rest, I like you Goblins, after all."

"Very well. This is StabbySpork, Senior Account Manager, beginning Lord Harry Potter's Rite of Delayed Corpse Looting. Apologies, I slipped into Gobbledegook there, I mean the Rite of Inheritance. You get..." The Goblin pauses. Unrolls the scroll further. "Ugh. Do I really have to read all of this? We'll be here all day!"

/twelve Goblins latèr/

"-And he shall also be bequeathed the Small Estate just outside of Little Whompwillow-upon-sable, assuming he dances the ritual dance of the Morris tribe my grandfather once saved from an attack of Amorous Elk-"

/Takes long drink of water/

"-that were desecrating the ancient temple of the Mac Guffin clan, which you as Honorary Shaman of the Morris Tribe of Pixie-Scousers living on the Estate also inherit, and also he shall inherit-"

/Passes out/

Harry leans over the desk. "Is he... alright?"

"Yes, yes, he's fine. Just... pining for the Fjords! Bring in the next Goblin!"

** The inheritance ones sometimes make sense (although I'll never get why he's always the lord of ravenclaw and hufflepuff.. like where's the relevance to those houses) but it's the compulsion potions/blocks that make me laugh like

Hatred to all slytherins Loyalty to albus Dumbledore, Weasley family Mistrust potion to anyone not a gryffindor

And then sometimes I've seen personality altering potions

Low self esteem, self sacrificing etc

All made by Dumbledore of course

** linkffn( *A battle of subtlety and manipulation* ), it's an Harry/ Narcissa fic (and a pretty bad one in my opinion). Here's a quote of the 1st chapter

#+begin_quote
  /Name: Harry James Potter/

  /Heir to: Potter family (blood), Peverell family (blood), Emrys family (blood), Gryffindor family (magic), and Slytherin family (conquest)./

  /Magical core rating: Average 14 year old: 78. Average Adult: 93. Merlin Emrys: 777. Yours: naturally 250, enhanced from basilisk venom and phoenix tears to 500, blocked to 95./

  /Animagus form: Black Panther./

  /Magical abilities: Parsletongue/

  /"What does this mean for me exactly?" he asked the still somewhat shell-shocked goblins./

  /Shaking himself Ragnok said "Well Lord Potter it is different for each of the families. The Potter family Lordship provides some property and access to your family vault but not much else. The Gryffindor and Slytherin families give you two of the now three votes for the Hogwarts School board and any artifacts belonging to the two founders but nothing else beside their vaults. The Peverell and Emrys families are two of the three most powerful families in our nation's history and those three families in fact set up our government. Along with their vaults and properties you will gain their seats on the Wizenagamot, they are two of the three great council seats that, if there is a majority vote, can veto any motion that the Wizenagamot puts forth along with their normal vote but they, along with the third family of Le Fay, haven't been seen for the past eight hundred years."./
#+end_quote

I don't know if this is the "worst" inheritance list I have ever read, but the fact that is happen at the start of the 1st chapter made me remember it even years after reading the fic.

**** I honestly can't remember the fic outside of that inheritance scene, but since the first chapter gives us :

- Lord Harry
- Heir of several Houses including the Founders and Merlin
- Magical Cores
- *Sealed* Magical Core (probably by a Manipulative "For the Greater Good" Dumbledore")
- A political system where a child can basically control the country because he has the power to veto absolutely any law (and the same power over Hogwarts)
- A marriage contract

I think you are probably right.

  Also known as ‘What Happens When You See How Many Tropes You Can Stuff In A Story'Harry Potter, after meeting Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, bows back to the goblins outside of Gringotts Bank when going to Diagon Alley. Many, many tropes (and possibly shenanigans) ensue.Expect then they didn't, because the author couldn't find it in themselves to continue it. Except you lovely folks can. This is abandoned/up for adoption.

** linkffn(Basilisk-born) by Ebenbild something like that. Can´t tell the list because it is never truly listed, just implied. But don´t worry, it gets stupidly long, spread out and still stays 100% in story logical. (By that i mean there is a more or less valid reason for all of them, not just a "Hey, some of you Great-great-great-great-great-Grandma got nailed by Godric Griffindor, so you own Hogwarts")
