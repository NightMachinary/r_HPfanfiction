Uh, hi, it's me again. I submitted the post a few days earlier about Harry/Gabrielle, which was largely due to the fic A Fine Spot of Trouble. Anyways, I just finished that, loved it, especially the interplay between Harry and Draco, etc. Just poking my head back in to see if you guys have any really good "Harry and Draco become friends" stuff. It doesn't have to be post-Hogwarts like AFSOT, but no slash pls.

  Why did Harry Potter nod in greeting to Draco Malfoy when he saw the man on the platform 19 years later? Ron and Hermione were clearly not on such terms with the man. What secret did the two men share from even their own families?

  Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire but no one could have foreseen that written on that same slip of paper was Draco Malfoy. Resented by their houses and forced to participate in the Triwizard Tournament together, the two once rivals form a grudging alliance in their struggle to survive the trials ahead. Rated MA.

  They say there's no such thing as a magical Animagus. They're wrong. Harry Potter, Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy join together in an alliance no one, especially Voldemort, is expecting. Severus/Harry mentor, Harry/Draco friends. No slash.

  AU after CS17. Harry pulls a very different sword out of the Sorting Hat, and that changes everything. The Sword of Slytherin has powers that go far beyond just killing legendary monsters, and soon Harry finds himself caught up in an improbable adventure and a bizarre case of mistaken identity. It just goes to show that strange things can happen when time meddles with wizards...

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

  6/7th year fic. Harry decides he wants to do things his way, because Dumbledore's method of defeating Voldemort just doesn't appeal. He finds friends in unexpected places and embarks on a method of defeat in which he sometimes holds little hope. H/OFC.
