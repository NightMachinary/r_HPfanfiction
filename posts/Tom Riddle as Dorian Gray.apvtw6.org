Any fics where Tom Riddle gets a portrait (as in Dorian Gray) that stops his aging, he does want immortality after all. I just think that whole portrait thing would make a lot of sense in a wizarding world. Preferably begins in Tom Riddles school era while he is in Slytherin, but really any setting is fine so long as it has Tom Riddle using a Dorian Gray style portrait


** If there's not already a fic that follows this idea, I'm tempted to write one myself... what a great concept!

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/637673]]

It's a series but from memory the particular type of painting magic is not brought up until part two.

Setting is 90s Harry at Hogwarts and au canon-divergence from after tmr graduated

**** I believe Laocoon's Children touches on it(albeit it's abandoned and I'm sort of glad it is,there's a lot I didn't like from the notes)
