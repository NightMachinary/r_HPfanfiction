So the latest chapter of my fic went up last night and I've left it on sort of a cliffhanger. It's not completely a hanger as we know that all of the main characters die at a later date (Marauders), but it's still ending on an explosion. So far I've had two reviews saying "Oh come on!!" And one of them said they shouldnt be surprised, knowing my writing style.

It is true that I have used cliffhangers quite often in the past. For Aurors in particular, several chapters towards the end finished at a moment of great peril or suspense.

I do this for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I enjoy the reactions from people - I sound like a sociopath but it's so satisfying to know your writing has emotionally affected someone. Secondly, they're more likely to come back. What can I say? I work in marketing. Thirdly and finally, it often feels more natural to me to end there than anywhere else, perhaps after a lifetime of watching dramas on TV. The format of fanfic lends itself to episodic formulas like this. The last chapter of my fics are usually slow paced, slice of life, wrapping up the loose ends in a peaceful sort of way. But until then I'd rather keep things going.

I've never thought this was a problem as I tend to update pretty quickly and I always try my best to live up to the cliffhanger - I hate cliffhangers that don't lead to anywhere or are a punchline to something mundane.

But I'm starting to wonder if it just pisses people off and I should stop. Perhaps I'm enjoying people's "omg more!" reactions but I might be misreading them - the frustration might not be worth it for them.

What do you all think?

*** I know you're talking about the audience, not the characters, but I call that the Vonnegut school of writing ("Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them---in order that the reader may see what they are made of.")

** Without going through your corpus of work:

1) Make sure you do post the follow-up. Fanfiction that stops abruptly is pretty dang common, to the point where starting a story that isn't already finished is a bigger leap of faith than many are willing to make.

2) Don't overdo it. If you end every chapter on a cliffhanger it can get tedious rather than exciting - especially if the cliffhangers are all similar types of danger. You should (almost) always end a chapter right before something interesting happens, but if it's always 'will s/he die?' it'll become cliche.

*** Oh yeah I always finish my stories. There's one I removed because I wasn't going to finish it but hardly anyone had read it and that was last year. I agree that having a cliffhanger and not updating, or waiting a long time to update, is shitty.

** Cliffhangers are a good plot device if used properly. By properly, I mean, used sporadically to enhance anticipation in the next chapter, or phase of the story. If used too often, people will either get so used to them, that it loses its effect, or they will lose interest in the story, as I have done. People do not like to be kept on edge all the time. The overall writing of the chapter itself should be what excites people to be looking forward to the next chapter, not a cheap cliffhanger. Think of a TV show, they don't end every episode on a cliff hanger, yet the last episode of the season may end on a cliff hanger, which then enhances the excitement for the new season to start. So I would say, pace the cliffhangers out to like every 10 - 20 chapters or so, depending on the length of your story.

*** I may have been over using them then. This is the first of this story, but it's on chapter 3. In my previous fic I didn't have any for most of the story but used several in a row during the climax.

**** To be fair, it worked very good with The Aurors. You had me on edge the entire time. While it's too early to say you're overusing it with your new story, I do think it's good to be wary of it.

Personally I thought it was adequate: the first two chapters were pretty slow and just setting the mood which had to be shaken up a little. A way to keep it down a little might be to move the scene which is cliffhung (is that even a word? It should be) to the next chapter. You start that part with "It was just a few weeks later..." so it's a good point to cut it off anyway.

***** I think I was worried that if I didn't introduce some action it would be yet another chapter with just a lot of talking and I might start to lose readers. As it happens, it's not a popular fic at the moment anyway!

****** Well in that case, maybe it would've been a good idea to wait a bit with posting and to include the thing you have now moved to the next chapter, to this one.

I think there's two kind of cliffhangers anyway: here something dramatic happens and we have no idea whatsoever what's going to happen. The other is where the action goes on a bit longer so the reader knows who is attacking who and what's up in general. Then, after showing some death eater action or whatever you can cut the story off just before or after someone yells a curse.

A good example in the books: the forest scene in DH: there's a cliffhanger after voldy screams avada kedavra. You don't know if Harry's alive or not. If the chapter would've ended however the moment Harry walked into the clearing and you'd have to wait for how the story goes on you would've cared less. Maybe the scene coming after would turn out to be boring or not what you imagined.

Cliffhangers play with the knowledge the reader has. In your story I had very little. There weren't really blanks to fill in as, well everything was blank.

I hope you won't force yourself to write your story a certain way because it isn't (yet!) popular because that's just not what you, as a writer, should do. I think you have proven that you know how to write and structure a story and that you should stick with it.

** Honestly, this is one of the reasons I usually limit myself to completed fics. Too many cliffhangers that were abandoned. It leads to a massive distrust of writers as a whole.

I grew up reading books, where cliffhangers are resolved immediately, and not serialized fiction. And I always hated them on TV - and honestly, usually couldn't remember what had happened by September, so the intended effect was pretty wasted on me. It did not whet my appetite.

So, basically, one vote against clffhangers.

** You run the risk of writing a fanfic that reads like a telenovela if you end too many chapters this way. I personally don't care for them unless it's a /big/ plot point and the story is moving onto its climax.

A good example of a properly (in my opinion, at least) used cliffhanger would be something like Harry has been held captive by /insert random bad guy group/ He's made several smaller attempts to escape but was found out fairly early on. So he decides to play the long game and gives the impression of being compliant for several chapters of the story. Then he is sure that his captors' guards are down, and he starts planning his escape in earnest. A chapter or two of him building up to the escape and then one chapter of the actual escape attempt. His captors were not as ignorant of his plans as he thought, and are in hot pursuit. He grapples with them a bit, but then breaks free just long enough to apparate away and--CLIFFHANGER. Did he get away? Where did he go? Will they chase after him and bring him back? /That/ is a good use of a cliffhanger.

It's really annoying when cliffhangers are used every other chapter just to elicit a response from readers and for mundane things like "Who just stepped into the room? CLIFFHANGER! Oh, it's just Ron, and he's only looking for his lost shoe."

*** I guess that is what I'm risking with this fic as it's canon compliant so there won't be any shocking twists, unlike Aurors which could get away with it more. I'll have to make sure that going forward I resist it. I think I'm finding the transition from a suspense thriller fic to a character study hard.

Completely agree with you about shit cliffhangers where theres nothing shocking or exciting. It's just sticking two fingers up at the reader and isn't really fair. I like to make sure that if a chapter ends with a bang the next one should open with a bang too.

** I've read many a story that stopped on a cliffhanger and was abandoned, then for weeks I'll only read stories that I know were completed so I never get played like that again. It's fine to write cliffhangers as long as you don't keep your readers waiting too long. You say you use cliffhangers quite often, and while that can get annoying if you're a mediocore author, it's fine if you can make the cliffhanger fit in the story. Again, just don't wait too long to update your story afterwards.

** As long as you update frequently and regularly (effectively writing serial fiction), cliffhangers are fine. And in a completed story, they're no trouble either.

** Personally I hate reading a cliffhanger that ends in 'who will die?' because it just irritates me to try and guess who it is for weeks. I prefer 'this character just died!' cliffhangers because then I can start imagining what happens afterwards and I look forward to seeing what plot threads the author chooses to move forward with. Of course, I don't like trying to solve mysteries much, I'm just in it for the plot, so my perspective may be different from other folks'.
