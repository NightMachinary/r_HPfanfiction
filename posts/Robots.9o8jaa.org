Wild request and/or prompt/concept. In the muggle world robots rise up and take over the muggles, and it's left to the wizarding world to save them. Preferably with familiar faces.


** This is a very cool idea Kergio! :) Yes I love ROBOTS and it would be so cool to read about Harry Potter world but when they start to make robots and then it would be magic vs robots or maybe it could be super friendly and peaceful and then it could have a sentient robot person who can use magic and has a soul like spoilers PENNY FROM RWBY she is so cute and my favorite character and so interesting magic and technology yes together. :) Yes it is also one of my favorite concepts from kingdom hearts too about how anything alive and thinking can grow a soul, even a puppet or an object or a tree. :)

In Harry Potter world, if I was to write a story in the future of it, I would make this a similar thing! Where anything alive and thinking can grow a soul, and also where anything alive and thinking can have the chance to be born able to use magic or not - mages and muggles and squibs - just like biological creatures. :)
