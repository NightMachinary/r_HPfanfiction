Lost track of a great fic I once read. It's all about Harry becoming !super! and taking over the world and herding all the muggles into North America, where Hermione also escapes. Just remember the ending.

Hermione sends her son to infiltrate Harry's empire in Europe and then joins him in order to kill Harry. They accidentally kill Harry's son or son-in-law and this pissed Harry off, who launches robot invasion of US.

Also there might be a kidnapping of Harry's twin sons by Hermione and Ron in there somewhere (or maybe another fic)

*** One of my all-time favorite fics, the tactics the Wizards use to cripple the Muggles is extremely interesting and gave me chills, that our economy would become so crippled from the sudden loss of one resource that arguably isn't necessary for survival. Read the fic to find out what I'm talking about! :D

*** It really was very entertaining and kept me interested till the end. I think it was Harry/Daphne, had Harry fighting a nundu and making a magical utopia after taking over the world. Hope you get a chance to read it cause it was one of my all time favs
