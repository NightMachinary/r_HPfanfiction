“Harry Potter is dead!” Those were the four words to define the Wizardry World in May 2nd, 1998 at the Battle of Hogwarts. Contrary to the usual belief, Harry James Potter did not rose from the dead to “save” the world. Tom Marvolo Riddle, better known as Lord Voldemort, was declared the Man Who Conquered among his followers and those who decided to submit to his ruling.
