Fanfiction has been life for a long time. Far too long but I started in the HP Fandom and progressed into others.

Recently found my old laptop and browsed it.

Found my old files of fanfiction and saved fanfiction from other authors that I'm sure more than half are no longer found online lol.

I've spent the day rereading my old WIP and Completed fics that are half edited and half littered with html brackets because back in the day that's what we had to do. *bold* - /italics/ - paragraphs - and I'm grateful that I no longer have to do this lmao.

Like... has anyone found their old works? Has anyone just sit and reread and cringe or fall back into the story just to swear because you've never finished?

I have 50+ stories that have never been posted. I wasted so much time writing and I never posted ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Why didn't I find this during quarantine, it could have filled the listless days.

Ugh.

Anyone remember the yahoo groups? I had one. I forgot i had one back in 2010... I'm scared to see if they're still around lol.

I feel like a HP fiction veteran slushing through broken links, deleted LiveJournals, old YouTube fan made videos of Drarry and Edward/Harry crossover madness, and old fanfiction faves that feel like new stories.

10+ years. Sheesh.

Please tell me I'm not alone in these thoughts/feeling?


** Lockdown dragged me back fanfic.net. It was wild, I hadn't looked at my account since I was about 14/15 or something? I'm 25 now so, a while!

Id completely forgotten I had a bucket list as my profile? Something I wrote when I was a kid. It was really sweet actually, to go back and write in all the stuff I'd completed and forgotten about. Thing like, travel to 5 countries, drive a car, watch a play on Broadway. Little things that must have seemed like big dreams back then. I've added to it.

I didn't have a lot of stories posted but reading back, I'm bloody chuffed at them! They're not good but they're not bad either. And I remember how much fanfic helped me through my exams, helped me develop my writing skills and essay qualities so I'm quite nostalgic for them.

I don't have any of my drafts.... They were probably aved on the old desktop computer which is long deceased at this point!

Ooh, and not group chats but I did have a lot of PMs from old online friends I used to beta for and vice versa. They were cringey to read, I hope they're doing ok... Rehabilitated Sith if you're out there... Hope you're well üòä

It feels nice to get back into writing now. It's fun, I forgot how much I loved doing it.

** I recently cleaned out an old laptop and brought all my fic files over to my new one and sorted them out. I had a bunch of Harry Potter stuff in there, but a lot of it was old Stargate stuff saved off of Live Journal.

I still have some of the earliest fic I wrote as a teenager and it's pretty bad. Full of drama and non-stop angst.

** I found an old USB flashdrive, and on it was an old HP story I'd written, about 15-16 years ago. It was horrible, and I deleted it from any and all sites I remembered.

Still, finding the story prompted me to revise and remake it into what I'm writing now, and I'm having a blast.

** I wrote my fanfics on paper back in the early 2000 when I didn't know what fanfic was and didn't have internet in the small village I grew up.

Found some of the storybooks last year during quarantine when I cleared out the cellar. I was pretty happy that I didn't had internet at that time. My stories were full of mary sue self inserts - I was 10-14 when I wrote them. But there were some pretty unique story Ideas that I haven't seen often in the fandom yet. And all of them were written pre HBP so there wasn't anything about Horkruxes in them, Blaise Zabini was a girl (because of an translation mistake in the earlier books) and I had some funny ideas what the prophecy meant.

** I lost the email address tied to my FFN account years back when my laptop was stolen, and a lot of my WIPs were tied to that address, so I can't go back and reread them, but if the quality of the stuff I /did/ post back then is anything to go by, then I'm /very/ glad that they'll never see the light of day.

Oh you think it's bad now? Wait until there's something new that disregards your headcanon and ruins your story

*** Anything beyond Half blood prince doesn't count. The epilogue doesn't count. As a anti-Ginny/Harry and denial of Fred dieing .... the series is complete, altered, and the MoD concept blew apart mountains of fanfiction in terms of the 'prophecy'.

After Sirius died shit hit the fan lol

**** Without a doubt. Be happy /that's/ the only thing you really had to worry about for so long. If any future Harry Potter stuff gets made, it could easily interfere with your stories and all that

***** Nah. I refuse to acknowledge the crazy after Fred died. I'm ignoring the kids and the wtf names, ignoring that Harry went on to live a 9-5 job... üò§

I've dealt with quite enough HP purists it don't bother me.

To be fair, I'm feeling this in my other Fandoms, I'm just like whyyyyyy....

****** You misunderstand. I'm not a HP Purist. I despise Romione, despise the world building after book 3, despise Rowling's refusal to accurately show any aftereffects of a battle, as well as how she portrayed Ron in books 3, 4, and 6

******* By purists i didn't mean you. I meant the ones I've been trolled with over the years. Sorry it read like that. I tend to write m/m fiction which didn't get hate but let's not point out the crazy over mary-sues.

By the end of the series I just think she wanted a clean ending with magical kids. Adult us know that fighting a war and past child abuse would lead into ptsd but that would be a messy chapter and probably have more controversy than Hermione settling for Ron.

Ron is complicated. He wasn't a good friend, he's a little shit that Harry forgave and eventually Ron did grow up. Ron's pass is being Harry's first friend that *stuck*.

I have angst with Dumbledore. Greater good bullshit - but he's like many adults who ignore obvious signs and the adults in general when Umbridge was around. A child had to try and fix an adult issue üôÑ.

** I love going through my old work even though a lot of it is cringe. I found this 2 chapter fic I wrote that luckily included a summary about Voldemort being the vampire king and I guess a lot of the characters were gonna be vampires/vampire hunters (I really liked the Van Helsing movie as a kid lol). there's one fic for Naruto that I have incredibly vivid memories of writing and having a friend read in class but it's been lost to time unfortunately :/ it's the only one I can't find and I wish I could because I'm very curious what that was

** Yahoo groups and everything in them are gone. Poof!

I found an old fic that was half posted maybe six months ago - didn't realize I had started that, let alone /finished/ it, and had to do a lookup to get the login information. It was pretty awful, but it was finished so I posted it anyway <.<
