Does anyone else feel like they should be reading novels/literature by established authors instead of (drivel) Harry Potter fanfiction?

Just wondering if I'm alone in these thoughts because I read like ~1-2hrs of fanfiction a day. With a few exceptions, fanfiction really is not the most thought provoking content. I just can't seem to make the transition to reading novels that I actually want to, or should, read. A notable example is that I got halfway through LOTR in the holidays (no internet) and on return to internet, did not touch it. Does anyone else struggle similarly? HPFF has almost become an addiction that diverts me from better/different reading pursuits.

I don't mean to hate on HPFF at all, I've been an avid reader/fan for many years. I just feel like I should be pursuing different novels and was wondering if anyone's in a similar boat.


** I get where you're coming from.

I read HPFF because it's /familiar/. I know the characters, I know the world. When I read fanfiction it's all for the love of the game, the game being the characters.

It's not that I wouldn't enjoy reading other original novels, I just would much prefer to read more adventures about a set of characters that I grew up with and love.

It's no different than wanting a sequel to your favourite book or movie, not really. You just love the franchise so much you just can't imagine a world without more of it. I read fanfiction because it gives me more of what I love so much.

So maybe some stories aren't amazingly written, or have been done before. It doesn't much at all to me, because I'm in it for the characters.

Life is so short, just do what makes you happy man.

** "Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted." - John Lennon

But on the other hand, I see where you're coming from. It's nice for personal growth to expand outside of your comfort zone. Personally, I read fanfiction to relax. I'm a grad student, and I read things that make me think way too hard every day. But, like you, I branch out to reading published novels and etc. on the holidays.

Overall, I think you shouldn't put too much pressure on yourself to read things that are "better". Reading is a hobby, why stress yourself out about it? Just enjoy. :)

*** Thanks. Not exactly stressing out, I just do inane things like binge watching TV, reading HPFF, mindless internet browsing. Yeah it's basically just procrastination... But procrastinating everything including the personal goals I've set myself! Like finishing goddamn LOTR. Which I really really want to do, because it's so good. But HPFF is so much easier so I never bother. I just need to do it.

**** Throw some headphones on and listen to LOTR audio book while doing housework, maybe it will give you that "gotta finish it" feeling. I'm terrible about not reading "real" books anymore too, I thought getting a tablet would help the situation, but it made it so much worse.

** Once, perhaps. Then I realized that at the end of the day, when you find the 1% that's worth reading, it doesn't feel like a waste at all. Sometimes you even learn a little about writing though it--what makes a good story/plot/narrative, and what makes compelling characters. You even learn a little about trends in online fiction.

I do read other novels as well, but they're all in the same boat, to me. I used to feel a lot of pressure to get into literary fiction, but never acquired the taste. I mostly read fantasy novels, essays that analyze popular media/books, and poetry.

At the end of the day, you're the one that determines what you get out of it. Is it purely for hobby and enjoyment? There's no shame in that. If you still feel the stigma of it being a waste of time, try to figure out a method of deriving something else from it too. Does it help you develop as a writer? How has it aided you as a reader? Perspective, perspective.

** Sometimes. I have a copy of Les Miserables on my shelf that's been on my to-read list for a while now. My goodreads to-read list just keeps growing. +Unfortunately, my salary does not+

With regards to reading for leisure, I feel that as long as I enjoyed it, it doesn't really matter what I'm reading. For example, I also like reading historical articles on wikipedia for fun.

But I do feel guilty about choosing to read fiction over the career-improving stuff I /should/ be doing in my free time, haha. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

** I've spent most of my life reading "real" literature. I only started reading Harry Potter fan fiction a year ago (I'm 30 years old) and I have torn through it. Reading will always been an addiction for some of us no matter what the content. There is /no reason/ that reading fanfiction should be considered a better or worse addiction than reading literature, because most people do not read at all. Even if you compulsively read classic novels, you're probably still doing it to escape reality. It's just slightly more socially acceptable. But it's also just as likely that people will be unable to relate to you if you talk about it. I've read War and Peace 3 times and enjoyed it, but I have met more people who want to talk about Harry Potter than Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky.

** HELL NO! It's never a waste of time to do something you love as long as you aren't letting your responsibilities fall by the wayside. People need to have hobbies to deal with the stress of the real world.

I used to be really secretive about fanfiction because I thought it was super nerdy and people would make fun of me for reading it, but since then, I decided it's not a big deal, and it isn't. There is a bit of a misconception that fanfiction is about sex/porn, but that is easily remedied with a 30 second explanation.

Spending a couple hours a day reading fanfiction isn't a bad thing. Reading is a common hobby, and fanfiction is a subset of literature. Sure you might get more, intellectually, out of other types of literature, but if those don't interest you, then there's no harm in sticking to fanfiction.

Reading of any form stimulates the mind and keeps your creativity sharp. Don't ever feel like that's a negative thing.

*** Haha yeah I totally know where you're coming from with the secretive reading. I used to be pretty embarrassed about it but now I'll happily tell all my friends about fanfiction.

A major problem I see with fanfiction is that it's quite a limited conversation piece. Mainly because everyday people aren't that interested in Harry Potter and everything I read is based off one universe. If I read literature that's more varied, then each novel is a potential conversation topic. This is a pretty big factor for me since I struggle a lot with finding things to talk about.

Thanks for your reply. Makes me feel a bit better about reading fanfiction. But I really think I need to find the motivation to start reading proper novels. Fanfiction has become pretty stagnant for me.

**** I've found that if you are excited and passionate about a topic and you explain it with equal fervor to somebody they'll feed off of that enthusiasm and feel where you're coming from. You just have to explain it in terms they'd understand. Related it to other fandoms or series, discuss crossovers etc.

** I don't know why (I probably do know why - it's probably because I wonder about this a little), but I think I expected this to be from a writer's perspective. I.E: Do you ever feel like you're wasting your time writing fanfiction that obviously has no chance ever of getting published because it's... fanfiction? (I'm in a writing rut, do not judge me!)

Eh but no. In reply to your question in of itself: I think a lot of people summed it up better than I ever could - do what makes you happy! I have had somewhat the same thoughts as you - I have so many novels on my to-read list, but I just don't get around to reading them because... fanfiction. It sometimes bothers me that this is the case, but ff is normally a phase for me anyway, so I'm sure I'll calm down from the utter binge reading that I've been doing as of late. I hope so, anyway.

As for Lotr in particular, I can completely sympathize! I have been meaning to read that for literal ages. We should create a support group! Or, you could use [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0][this]] to motivate you!\\
Warning: loud.

Anyway, I hope my nonsensical ramblings helped in some sort of degree!

*** I think writing fanfiction can be good because writers get a varied range of direct feedback through reviews. It is also good practice. So for the serious writer I think it can be a good starting point. However I imagine that one wouldn't want to write too much, or only, fanfiction.

**** I wholeheartedly agree with you! I'm very shy about actually getting my fanfics out there, but aside from having the innate want to piddle around with characters that I adore, it's a very easy way for people to connect to your writing and thereby easily provide constructive crit. As I said: I do have moments where I just question everything when it comes to my artistic pursuits, but that's more just me having a crisis as opposed to actually hating dabbling in any sort of fandom.

** I know totally what you mean. It makes me feel absolutely awful sometimes that I could read other things.

But I've concluded that maybe I don't love reading so much that I love how therapeutic reading HP fanfiction is. Fanfiction gives us a semblance of control. Reading fiction from others... It's hard to choose your outcome.

I think it's why super!fics, independent!fics, time travel/doovers, and ships do so well.

** I think we keep returning to fanfiction because we know the characters and love the world. We are willing to put up with some crappy writing because we are invested in Hogwarts.

Moving to 'real' stories would require us to find a story we could get invested in just as much, but it requires wading through loads of different worlds and writing styles to find that one book we like.

We stick to fanfiction because it is safe and familiar. Putting in the effort to find a new world just isn't that appealing.

** I completely feel you. I only got a way from it naturally, to be honest. When I was literally in places where I couldn't access it. Then I'd come home and want to read it again, though...it was only after I went through a long time of being unable to find good, new fics that I was able to stop reading it. Everyone here is saying enjoy the things you enjoy, but I also kind of see (for me) fanfiction as an addiction. I can't stop when I want to stop, I feel this need to keep reading. It interrupts my sleep cycle at times, and I feel like I'm putting off my life. Not to say everyone who enjoys fanfiction is like this, but I find this phenomenon occurring for me.

What helped getting back into regular novels was picking up books I already knew I enjoyed and rereading them. From there, I could read other titles by that author, explore similar literature from authors, and so forth. That really helped. Now, I only read fanfiction when I'm seeking comfort. If I feel myself going back down the rabbit hole, I force myself to get out of my house and do other things I enjoy.

So to answer: yes, I feel my addiction to fanfiction prevents me from pursuing other literature, and keeps me from living my life to the fullest.

** I'm late to this thread, but I had to comment because this is so very relevant to me. I'd been feeling guilty about that for a long time, and at the start of the year I resolved to begin reading real books again. Since then, I've read 26 novels while only reading updates from Favorited fics. To be honest, it's been rather refreshing to have a break from continuously slogging through heaps of horrible fics in order to find something worthwhile to read, or just rereading my favorites over and over. I did just indulge in a reread of Applied Cultural Anthropology and The Long Journey Home, but I also have a mountain of books that I'm looking forward to reading.

** Lol @ the idea that novels are any more thought provoking than fanfiction. I mean, sure, if we're comparing the top tier 0.01% best of the best stuff, novels beat fanfiction. But the 99.99% that's left are probably similar in quality.

The only difference might be that with novels, there's greater quality control so we hear about the shitty stuff less often. But make no mistake, they are out there and in great numbers.

*** On the one hand, I sort of agree with you, but on the other you're just completely and utterly wrong. The truer thing to say is that 99.9% of fanfiction is complete and utter shit. The remaining .1% ranges in quality between lower professionally published novels and the very occasional middle. It's nice to make ourselves feel better by saying that we're not really sacrificing any quality by reading fanfiction over professionally published work, but that's just delusional if you really believe it. If you picked up a book and it was equally as good as most fanfiction you read, you'd put it back down immediately and scoff at anyone that liked it.
