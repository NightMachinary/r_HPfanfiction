:END:
I'm looking for a specific Fem Harry story. She was adopted by Sirius who magic accepted as her father. Lily and James were still alive but gave her up for reasons I can't remember. The only specific scene I remember is that Lily and James attempted to get her back into the Potter family but when Fem Harry refused Lily magically disowned her in the Great Hall. It was posted on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] I believe.


** Try linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches)

It has a femHarry who was eventually adopted by Sirius after he breaks free from Azkaban and it has an antagonistic relationship with James and Lily

It's quite dark though, so if you're not into dark stuff, then don't read it. I don't know how to hide spoiler text so I won't add it here but it does get really dark

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry
