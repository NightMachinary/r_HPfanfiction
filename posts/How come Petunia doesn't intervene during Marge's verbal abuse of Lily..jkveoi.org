Fine... she didn't like Harry for whatever reasons but based on information provided by JK, it seems that she was still somewhat close to Lily. They were really close as children but even later on seems that they are on speaking terms as the Dursleys and the Potters go on a double date and they invite each other to their weddings (although the Dursleys don't honor the Potters' invitation, in their defense maybe a magical wedding was too much for them). We also find out that Petunia and Lily exchange gifts (also the fact that Lily insults the vase from Petunia might also indicate that Lily had become quite snobby with regards to her abilities and was constantly flaunting them in front of a jealous Petunia). Finally it's stated by JK that the moment of hesitation in DH represents Petunia taking a final look at Lily's eyes.

To me it seems that, despite their animosity, the sisters cared for each other. Therefore I find it difficult to understand Petunia's thought process when she just stands there quietly while Marge compares her late sister to a bitch. I am thinking that no matter how angry I am at a family member, I still won't tolerate someone else insulting them, especially if they are mocking someone who passed away. So what are your thoughts on how Petunia was justifying that passivity in her mind?


** I expect that Petunia considered pleasing Vernon to be her number one duty in life, and keeping the peace with his sister was more important than anything else. It seems she didn't like Marge to begin with, not least for bringing dogs into the house, so biting her tongue where Marge was concerned in honor of marital peace may have been ingrained long before that incident.

Add onto that that her feelings about Lily were a tangled mess. She loved Lily, but thought her parents preferred Lily to her. She loved Lily, but she was deeply jealous of the doors that were open to Lily but not Petunia. She loved Lily, but she had the magic from Lily's world turned on her in a painful way from time to time, whether it was little Sev from the neighborhood dropping a branch on her or a giant giving her son a pig's tail that needed surgical removal. She loved Lily, but she was given no real choice in raising Lily's child, regardless of what sort of family she and Vernon might have planned for themselves. Her mind was too full of too much unresolved pain to confront anyone over Lily-- least of all Vernon's sister. Vernon got to keep his sometimes-awful sister, and Petunia lost her sometimes-awful sister.

The decision not to defend Lily might look simple to Harry, but I doubt it was simple to Petunia.

** honestly Marge is terrifying, and it looks like when he's with his sister, Vernon and her get quite sloshed and enter a very belligerent feedback loop that would be incredibly uncomfortable and possibly dangerous to get between.

No matter how bad a person Petunia is, I can understand if she didn't have it in her to speak up. she has so much shame attached to any and all memories of Lily, and she had to have at least some guilt with how she treated Harry, and so I feel like she'd stall out just gulp her white wine or whatever and stay out of it.

Family and in laws are fucking hard and complicated at the best of times, and I honestly cannot see Marge not being one of those sisters that gives their brother's wife criticisms at every opportunity while not distracted by terrorising said sister in law's orphaned nephew

** If you reread the very first chapter of the books. The very first chapter from Vernon's perspective very strongly suggests that all the dislike towards magic and the Potters was from Petunia. Vernon might well be an unreliable narrator but he states that bringing up the Potters is a sure way to annoy Petunia.

*** You may have things you don't want to talk about yet still think they are important. For example the amount of work that you have been procrastinating on but still know it needs to be done. Just because I don't feel like talking about it with anyone doesn't necessarily mean I don't care about it.

** As far as anyone in the muggle world knows, Lily and James were drunks that got into a car crash with their one year old, died, and left him with a scar. Even if the actual Lily is someone she still loved, I imagine the character Lily she created in her hate for Harry is not someone she wanted to defend, which is what it would appear to Marge or any other muggle.

** Just for my own satisfaction, let me mention here story “Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee“ linkffn(12551744), where this scene is taken from the Petunia's point of view (and the result is rather different).

** Well, Marge's glass shattered when she called Lily a bitch. Harry assumes he's the one who made it shatter, but no one complained about underage magic...
