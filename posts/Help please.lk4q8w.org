:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi guys, Can anyone help me find a particular fanfic? I can't remember what's it's about etc

Basically, it's where Harry is raised by elite death eaters, who wear red robes. And if Harry wants them, he pulls a rope and a gong sound was made. And I think the chief elite was Lucius Malfoys brother

Any help please! Really appreciate it. TIA


** Not sure if it's the same fic, but I recall a series and it was a bellatrix/Voldemort pairing?
