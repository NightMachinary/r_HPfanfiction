** And once again I am glad that I started compiling local copies of my favourite stories when I got my kindle. Since this is the public part of my dropbox I can't guarantee how long it will be up, but my copy of VINCET and the sequel VULTUS SERPENTIS may be found here:

[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/93394/VINCET%20%28788%29.zip][Vincet - Vultus Serpentis]]

#+begin_quote
  VINCET 1: Some people, when crushed underfoot, simply buckle and lie dead still. Some find inner strength and fight back. Yet some others pawn their Aunt's wedding ring and hex their relatives. Shades of grey, argues Harry. No Slash VINCET 2: Every so often, a momentous individual makes their way through the world, making ripples in their path. Dumbledore and Voldemort were two such men, sending waves crashing, obliterating all else, and Harry grows sick of wearing a life preserver.
#+end_quote

I put both epub and mobi/kf8 (azw3 container, for kindle) in there, but you can easily convert the epub file to any other format (including plaintext) using some software like [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] or its commad-line toolset.

** Pity. That was a very good story.

FYI - Nos tres reges were three authors in a collaborative effort. Dunno why they would take down their work.

You might try Darklordpotter, who archive many fanfiction stories.

*** Book 1 covered year 1; book 2 covered year 2. The story is told from Harry's POV. It's been years since I read it, but here's a quick rundown of what I recall: [[/s][Spoiler]]

The story was rather non-angsty given its setup and told in a wry, Jack Vance-esque style.

***** Indeed, they had a few other good stories in addition to /VINCET/, all with a level of polish that's rare for fanfiction. /The General/ was very solid writing. They also had a psychological, serial-killer-Harry story (I forget the name) that was quite competently done.

** It appears that Nos Tres Reges has chosen to erase themselves from the world of fanfiction. Their account has been renamed Deleted00000001 and the related Twitter page is no longer extant.

I'm not sure how I feel about that- on one hand, a person should have the right to a clean slate and control of their intellectual property, in as much as they can claim any ownership for a derivative work. On the other, the stories, having been shared, are now a part of the life and experiences of many others along with the author(s), so removing them seems selfish, especially since it costs them nothing for the stories to continue existing.

*** Making things even more complicated are sites like AO3, which suggest that people who are not the original authors post properly cited stories that have disappeared from other locations on the internet. Also not sure how I feel about that.

In my experience, big, popular stories often disappear when the people behind them get publishing deals for other, original fiction pieces, and then start trying to "sanitize" their writing history. Might not be what happened here, but I've seen it before.

**** Yup, Fettucini/Oblong for example took down everything because they got a publishing deal and it was several months before some badly mangled snippets of stories from all over were pieced together to enable people to read them once more.

***** That's not true in the case of Fettucini/Oblong/MrJoe/SerpentSannin. Supposedly, if one is to believe the comments he made on DLP at the time, he was accepted into a university writing program and decided to rid himself of "childish distractions" like writing fanfiction. Granted, he was a narcissist who changed his stories about as often as he did his monikers, but these comments were made concomitant with his leaving fanfiction and removing his last story.

Several fanfiction writers out there have published professionally or semi-professionally (joe6991, jbern, Perspicacity, hgfan1111, Cassandra Claire, to name a few). Only a couple of them have bothered removing their fanfiction from the interwebs. Publishers appear a lot less anal about it nowadays and many like how popular fanfiction authors come with their own fanbase numbering in the several thousands, with a ready means of marketing.

****** Cassandra Claire removed her works because:

A. Some of them are NC.17. Authors don't usually want that on their track record. Slightly ironic because her RonxGinny fic title ended up being used for her Draco Trilogy !realfic adaption (like Master of the Universe to 50 shades of grey).

B. The Draco Trilogy is a mass of plagiarism

C. TDT is reused heavily for TMI (first 3 books) and TID. Characters, general gist, important plot points, the entire falcon scene in City of Glass. The later 2 started developing its own plot though.

****** That's interesting, I didn't know any if that. I only ever found his fics via a repost by someone else (which I think was where my idea that he got published came from) after he had already removed everything, so I guess I was lucky as anything of his I read was completely fixed :D
