I need some all-time classics to read as I'm constantly wanting to read something but then the daunting task of actually finding something kills my mood. M/M preferable and please god no omegaverse.


** I'd highly recommend taking a look at [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]], which is a dedicated slash sub. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/mqy4ok/what_are_your_favorite_god_tier_fics/][This thread]] from last week asking for everyone's "god-tier" fics would be a good place to start.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2137872][Pandemic]] is honestly the best thing in fandom I read in years. Mature characterizations, brilliant series end to end. If you want to go back to stuff before 2010, [[http://www.archiveofourown.org/works/67766][Snape: the Home Fries Nazi]] is pretty awesome and rightfully considered a classic.

What ships and tropes do you like? There's a ton of new Wolfstar fics going around.

**** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987973][73 Aberdeen]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5252627][Break]] are great for Wolfstar. Lesser known but definitely on the angsty side!

For Snape/Lupin have you tried busaikko's fics? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/63556][Ten Aprils]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/305284][Apocryphal tales of romance and wonder]].

***** 73 Aberdeen is amazing! I still need to read Break.

[[/u/Yunwha][u/Yunwha]], I checked my Wolfstar bookmarks on AO3 - here are two really good ones with under 600 kudos, since you said you'd read most of the well-known fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27679754][*Rourke*]] *by sreka:* When wildlife filmmaker Sirius Black arrives on a remote Antarctic island for a year-long assignment, he isn't phased by the freezing wind, the perpetual darkness, or the hostility he meets from some of the biologists at the research base. He is used to living an itinerant existence. He is comfortable with unforgiving conditions. He expects the world to treat him harshly. But he does not expect to fall in love. (complete)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20059978/chapters/47507422][*chase the stars*]] *by Duskglass:* It's probably the most foolish, reckless, dangerous thing Sirius Black has ever done in a lifetime of foolish and reckless and dangerous things... but he takes one look at Harry and knows it's the only choice he can make. (or: 'sirius escapes azkaban early & accidentally kidnaps harry' au) (WIP)

** I second the rec to visit [[/r/HPSlashFics][r/HPSlashFics]]

Here are some - perhaps not all time classics - but personal favs

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334][chalk this one up as a win]] is a Flintwood soulmate fic. Overall, you might want to check out the whole series as it features two other Soulmate fics in the same AU universe. One is a Drarry the other is Dean Thomas/Seamus Finnigan fic *Summary:* Oliver Wood wakes up in the Hospital Wing a week after his first Quidditch game ever with a head injury and his soulmate's thoughts wound around his left wrist. Frankly, he's more concerned about missing the Quidditch game.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/705045][Bound]] is a great Wolfstar series. An AU in which Sirius emerges from the veil, when Remus is already married to Tonks. Brilliant characterizations, a lot of hurt and raw emotions with a hopeful ending. *Summary of the first work:* “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120][Time Turned Back by TaraSoleil]] Probably my favorite Harry in the Marauders Era fic. Harry and Hermione both end up in the past. Harry/Sirius Hermione/Remus

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15930521][Step back in Time]] This one is very good, in which an older battle-worn Harry doesn't quite end up in the marauders era, but around the time his younger self was left on the Durleys doorstep. He basically adopts himself all the while navigating magical Britain, the people who want to meddle with Harry's life and the upcoming rise of the dark Lord. He doesn't take shit from Dumbledore either, young Harry is a sweet kid. Highly recommend. Endgame is Snape/Harry. There are multiple works to this series.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966][The Second String]] Don't know if you know this fic, it's called "The Second String" Harry ends up in the past. He pretends to be a Squib and ends up working in the Hog's Head. Pairing is Gideon Prewett/Harry Potter. It's a brilliant fic! Great plot and characterizations. Canon and OC characters alike Highly rec

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/68/][Death of Today]] My favorite Death Eater!Harry fic (eventual Harrymort). In this one, Harry is the product of an affair between Lily and Regulus, Lily having seduced him to get intel on Death Eaters Harry grows up in an orphanage. His name in this fic is Izar, which takes a bit to get used to but don't let that stop you. Features cool world-building, especially in terms of spell creation, Death Eater raids and clashes with Aurors, manipulative and intelligent Voldemort, intelligent Harry --> good character arch/developement, Unspeakable!Harry, alive!Lily and James Potter, interesting plot and plot-twists. An edited version is currently being posted (chapter by chapter) on ao3, above I linked the complete fic from ffn

******* Not really, it uses very few of the traditional tropes. Compared to the kind of fics you're talking about the characterization and writing are actually pretty well done. It's just obnoxious in a [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]] way, what with the author using Harry as a mouthpiece for his pseudo-scientific opinions, complaining that the canon magic system isn't logical enough, munchkin to the max, etc. among other things. So it isn't bad like the Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin fics, but it is pretty off-putting in the "genius 11-year old who's smarter than most adults" department. Like, not a fan myself, but I can see why some people would like it.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
