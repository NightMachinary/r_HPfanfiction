Does anyone have any recs for queer (any gender, any pairing) fics where there is either 1. no over worship of wizard cops or celebration of policing or 2. a thoughtful anti-cop/carceral exploration (that doesn't also degenerate into a relativist acceptance of death eaters?)

â€‹

I just read an otherwise good fic where a subplot was the fight to keep high numbers of aurors on the street post-war and figured there must be some great stuff out there that doesn't glorify police!

(And remember rule 9! I don't wanna fight about cops.)


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) and its sequel, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis) have at least four queer main characters. Aurors exist as part of a wider, very clearly flawed system that's better than nothing, but not particularly good.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that even an unbroken soul is not immutable, and that everything has a price. The price of love is loss; the price of knowledge is understanding; the price of life is death; and the price of mastering Death...is far more than he ever wanted to pay. A continuation of Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux.
