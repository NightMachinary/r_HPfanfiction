So, I've finally finished reading Core Threads by theaceoffire, and I decided about half-way through it to write something about it. I've been trying to think more critically about what I read in the last year, so this is mostly an exercise for myself. That said, I haven't studied literary theory or similar subjects other than in passing, so if you are looking for some kind of nuanced, insightful commentary I cannot guarantee it. These are my thoughts and feelings only, written down as they come to mind. Most of it is pretty rambling and doesn't follow any particular order, I just need to get this off my chest.

As for my personal history with it, I had read the first few chapters years ago, probably around 2015 when I was first getting into fanfiction, and dropped it for reasons I can't remember. The conceit of magic as threads and the mindscape that are central to the story are literally the only things of note I remembered of it, and even then I hadn't read further than chapter 10 at most. I started reading it again at the start of October, and just finished at the start if December. I sketched out part of this review as soon as I finished it, then let myself cool down a couple of weeks. Most inconsistencies in tone are probably due to that.

A few general thoughts before delving in the particulars. First of all, I did not like this story. There are portions that are okay, some parts are interesting, but in general I found this fic to be boring and mediocre. The writing is nothing to write home about, but it's decent enough that it doesn't pain me to read it. Typos and spelling mistakes are few, though one really annoying one in the last few chapters bears mention - it's 'vampiric', not 'Vamperic', and there is no need for capitalization. And speaking of caps, the most annoying thing in this whole fic is probably how the author uses all-caps for emphasis. It's a constant thing, it happens at least once every few paragraphs, and it fucking drives me insane. It completely ruined any kind of immersion I could have built while reading, though that really doesn't mean much, and it definitely helped in souring the experience along the other myriad problems I have with this story.

Right then, let's start with the premise. The premise of the story is that Harry, after having had his arm broken by Vernon and been thrown under the stairs, gets in touch with his magic, which he visualizes in the form of threads, and starts messing with it. He heals himself, steals food, makes his room better, and then he creates a mindscape, starts sorting his memories, destroys and absorb Voldemort's soul fragment and so on. The story covers Harry's years at the Dursleys (who didn't actually want to abuse him, but were manipulated by the horcrux), his first year at Hogwarts and the summer after that. It ends a bit after the start of his second year, the author presumably having abandoned it (last update was more than 2 years ago).

* From this point on, I guess, spoilers for literally everything in this fic.

  :END:
Now, to go back to how I found this boring again, I have more or less completely forgotten most of what happens between Harry first arriving at Hogwarts and the parts where he starts dealing with the goblins for the potions/rune/island thing. The reason for this, in my opinion, was the last few chapters. They were, in simple words, dreadfully boring. I'm talking about the 3-4 chapters (considerably longer than the norm, too) Harry spent remaking Drake Island, of which he is king by the way, into some kind of sci-fi techno-magical utopia. This includes, by the way, building lodgings for his subjects, libraries, restaurants, farms for both plants and animals that use time acceleration, forests, canals and other waterways so that merfolk can interact with the city, then doing the same with the vampires, and it just never fucking ends. The author fixates on the most pointless of details, even describing things like railings at some points, and all I wanted was to skip ahead and see if it went anywhere at all. The whole island arc was, in my opinion, complete and utter shit, easily the worst part of the whole fic.

So yeah, I forgot like half of the story. I honestly can't remember what happened to Quirrel, or the circumstances of Goran's attack (and oh my fucking god Goran, I'll say more about him later), or just most of it because it's so pointless. There doesn't seem to be much point at all in this story, except for heaping more and more power on Harry and probably indulging the author's fetishes of creating magitech-based societies, amateur economics and OP!God!MoD!SuperAwesomeInEveryWay!Harry. And family, can't forget the family fetish.

As an aside for that second-to-last one, since I've just remembered I have to talk about this, let's talk about Hunk!Harry. In the last few chapters, Harry has another magical accident (more on these later on) and has to make himself a body. Do keep in mind that Harry is 11-12 at this point, but the author has a few convenient excuses that make him Harry-in-name-only (bleed-through from Voldemort in his early years, mindscape running vastly faster than the outside world, eating libraries and a few people's memories and probably something more that I've forgotten). So he makes himself a body, and things get hilarious. For me anyway, I'm only half sure the author expects readers to take this seriously. His body is built like a brick, described in multiple occasions as 'bodybuilder' and 'adonis', and I just can't help but picture swole 11 yo Daniel Radcliffe, but with handsome Squidward's face on top. Also, he's like twice as tall as the other students his age, just to add to that image.

This fun generally only lasts until the authors reminds us again of the gaggle of preteen girls literally drooling after him. The harem aspect of this story is also one of the worst ones. First of all, it's written like shit. I literally can't remember who all is in his harem, because all the characters except Harry are cardboard cutouts that only come out of storage every now and then. Each of the members of his group (it had a name, but I couldn't bother remembering it) can be summed up in a sentence or two, and that's literally it. Like, what's the point of Terry? He likes Quidditch, and that's it. Same for Neville, though he at least had the potential to be more what with the fic ending right on his mother's curing. Probably not though, if I had to bet he would just have gradually faded out of sight in favor of the harem members.

And since we're talking about the harem, on the flipside I just find it weird how the author insists on involving some characters with stuff even when they shouldn't really matter. Daphne is worst example of this, followed closely by Luna. When Harry is building his civilization on the island, Daphne helps with writing the fucking laws, and Luna is literally the head of the newspapers and directs people in writing them. Hermione too to a lower extent, as she helps with research in the runic language (created by Harry, of course). Just, what the fuck? Why is the author so fixated on making 10 year olds useful to society, I literally don't get it.

Actually, can we talk more about how Harry got Xenophilius sent to a mental hospital and adopted a ten years old? That is, in fact, a thing that happened. This whole family thing in Core Threads is something I find creepy as fuck. Luna, Goran, even that completely irrelevant family that became Harry's vassals, I just don't see the appeal in it. I can see why it would make sense for abused 11 yo Harry to want a loving family, but in this fic Harry has one. He's not on the best of terms with Vernon, but he treats Dudley like a brother and Petunia is fine as well. And it has been that way for years, so where does this thirst for familial love come from?

Especially in the case of the vassal family (I can't remember their names, again), what's the point of them except to make Harry look better? He saves them from financial ruin by throwing money at the problem, inserts himself in their family dynamic and... Well nothing. They get invited when everyone gets together as another set of reaction pieces for whatever Harry pulls out of his ass at any time.

And speaking of reactions, it seems to me as if everyone reacts the same. There is a set of reactions to anything Harry does, and practically nobody strays from it. Harry displays any kind of skill - the narration reminds us yet again of what a great 'catch' he is, every female person of suitable age (meaning anyone who isn't old or has kids) blushes/averts their eyes/mouth hangs open while they think of how hunky he is. Harry pulls off an impossible feat of magic - everyone has their mouth hanging open while thinking of how hunky/profitable he is. And on and on.

Changing the subject, let's talk about magical accidents. Harry 'suffers' from a number of them - from towards the start, when he had to fight off Voldemort's fragment, to basically the very end, when his massive throbbing magical cores were becoming too much for his body to handle, so he built himself a new one. Now, the problem I have with how the author uses them is pretty simple - they come pretty out of nowhere, and they always result in Harry becoming better. The first part is pretty straightforward, the only accidents you could see coming are the scar one (because you already know it's a problem) and maybe the new body one (because there is a modicum of foreshadowing in his magic starting to do things based on his subconscious). All the rest of them? Completely unpredictable, just came out of left field.

Accidents making him better is the worse of the two. Every single time Harry has one he will explain that the way he did things before was 'wrong' but now he knows the right way. Using threads instead of a core was wrong, so now he makes himself a core. Substituting magic for mass in healing and similar left his body in a wand-like state, so he makes himself a new body. Having millions of cores in his body is burning him inside out, so he moves them to the island. And every single one of his accidents has him tell us how beforehand something was wrong and he just didn't know it yet. Like him not having a normal sense of taste before making his new body, because he was half made of magic or something.

Bashing is a problem for this fic, but not a very extreme one. Easily the most victimized by the author is, quite obviously, Snape. He abuses Legilimency the first time they see each other and then more times beside that, is portrayed as a bumbling idiot with a vendetta, and most egregiously, he is literally murderous. As in, he straight up fires an Avada Kedavra at Goran, Harry's adopted troll son, because he wouldn't face repercussion from a legal standpoint. And Harry isn't blameless in this bashing, as what he does is the kind of shit you would see in a Perfect Lionhart fic. After fortifying his mind against intrusion, he sends a commando duck squad into Snape's mind that give him debilitating migraines every time he even thinks of hurting anyone, along with stealing all his knowledge for himself. Also I remember Snape getting paralyzed from a broken spine, but I can't remember how that ended up.

Another character that, in my opinion, has been given a pretty shitty hand, is Dumbledore. While not the evil manipulating mastermind he's too often portrayed as in fanfiction, I don't know if this version is worse. He's, quite frankly, insane. Take the Dumbledore that says random words at the opening feast, turn that to eleven, and he's like that all the time. He has basically no conception of where he is or what people around him are doing, he just goes around saying random things. One time he was kind of serious, and he almost killed Harry 'by accident' (this fic kind of accident, that only result in Harry getting stronger). And the excuse for this is... Magic makes you go insane. The more powerful your magical core, the more likely you are to have some kind of 'quirk'. This is one of the AU elements of this world.

(Honorable mention goes to Fudge, who holds an idiot ball so massive it would collapse in itself and become a black hole. He basically signs off an island to Harry, gives him sovereignty, any and all permits he needs and more for trading and such, because he thinks he's doing a favor to Malfoy. The whole thing is contrived and one of the most stupid things I've read in a fic in years.)

And speaking of AU (such segue, very nice) there is also dimensional travel. By becoming MoD Harry now has the eventual job of... replacing death? Managing the universe? Fuck if I know. The point being, by gathering the Hallows now Harry can go to other dimensions! Hurray, exciting.

Now to be fair, I thought some of the parts in Rose Potter's world were interesting. My imagination went some really good places with the concept, with interesting themes and characters that behave like human beings. Too bad the actual thing is pretty shit. The concept is interesting, a Harry going to other dimensions to help various AU Harry's with their problems. The execution, well, no. It starts with Rose at the end of year one against Quirrelmort, who starts torturing her in front of the mirror. He brutalizes her until Harry possesses her body and scares him off, then rebuilds her body and leaves for like a month. As for the AU elements, Dumbledore is the typical Evil!Manipulative! one, big surprise there, Hermione has the hots for Rose and proposes a threesome (still 12 btw), and magic is weaker there. I'm kind of torn on that last one, because it kind of immediately destroys any kind of tension from the whole thing when Harry can literally reshape reality as he wishes. Even more than usual.

Still, going on. Harry comes back and finds Rose on what is basically house arrest, with some kind of magic binding thing on her courtesy of Dumbledore. They escape, go to Gringotts, Harry demonstrates his magical prowess to the Goblins, who are even more impressed than usual, Rose is adopted by the King of the Goblins, Harry makes a ward daughter that can basically control the entire world's wards. The end. This happens more or less 2/3rds of the way into the fic, and dimensional travel is over and done with. Instead we get island building, and I already said much about that. One last thing about Rose is, well. Why the fuck is she also part of Harry's blushing maidens group? Why does it read like she wants to jump his bones, for fuck's sake? The only way to make 11 year olds lusting after your totally-not-SI protagonist worse was to make one of them a female version of yourself. Like, goddamnit.

I haven't even talked about Gringotts, and this is getting pretty long. It's a pretty central part of the story, with them basically being the backbone of Harry's financial wealth. He uses his magic-seeing ability to make super wardstones and potions, the goblins fall over themselves to help him out. Not much to say there honestly, it's just kind of there.

I guess the last thing to mention is Harry being a soul mage. The details are kind of blah and not important, but one thing I wanted you to know is that he can insert his girthy, throbbing (did I already use that?) magical cables into people's soul, which feels downright orgasmic btw, to mess with their magic. Naturally, he has only done this to a select few, all girls around his age who gravitate around him. But noo, this isn't skeevy as fuck, I don't know what you're talking about.

There are more things I haven't even started on, like the aspects thing, the veela secretary, the clan of vampires he +subjugated+ +remade in his image+ converted, the whole muggle mafia arc. I'm exhausted, I don't feel like it, I'm going to go read something decent to try and purge this fic from my mind.


** Wow, I'd repressed that story ages ago, and now I half remember it again. I'm not sure how I feel about that.

Personally, I got to sometime around after Harry came back from the alternate universe, and got bored. I started reading something else, and eventually decided to fully close box, and I haven't regretted it.

** Aight, now I never have to read this story. Thanks!

As for the people in the comments saying you missed the point of the fic, I pulled open the fic and it does not say anywhere that its a crack fic, and the only thing that could indicate that its intended as crack would be the humor tag.

Its my belief that if something doesnt explicetly say its crack (and even sometimes if it does) it shouldnt be excused from the problems of the fic.

That said, this is a great well written review and this line really stood out to me.

Due to this early investment, it took a while for me to realize it was crap and drop it.

*** It does. Like, yeah, I agree with [[/u/Misdreamer][u/Misdreamer]] on a lot of his points, but I also wasn't reading /Core Threads/ seriously (as one might read something with action/thrills/drama), so a lot of those issues aren't nearly that bad in that context. And, maybe this is fallacious of me to say, but this story is /fanfiction/, not a published work. If it was something published, I'd want my money back for the quality of it, but since it's not - and since I know it's an amateur's attempt at a "what-if" based on the canon story and common fandom tropes - I can get invested in the story more easily.

Yeah, Core Threads isn't the best, but I've never understood people raging about works of fiction, especially when it's not the sort of fiction that appeals to them.

*** Others have pointed it out, but no, Core Threads is not crack. A crack fic kind of requires a certain awareness of itself - it's a parody of established tropes and themes. Intent on the part of the author is important, otherwise it's just a badly written fic.

There is a crack tag on FF, the author didn't use it. He used the Adventure and Humor tags. Also of note is this part of his bio

#+begin_quote
  However, every once in a while I feel a gap appears where a story is needed, and I decided to put down in type the concepts of "Core Threads". If I feel that the character stands up through the entire story, I am planning on sending him through other universes as well, as I feel the cross-over stories list is overly full with uncompleted stories and abandoned scripts.

  Hopefully I can stay on topic with my story, but it relies heavily on the characters. I tend to allow the beliefs and ideals of the characters to dictate how scenarios occur, and how people interact. As a result, I tend to be just as interested as the reader about where the heck all this story is leading too. I have a general idea and the framework for some cool powers and story plot points, but how these get introduced and when they get used? No idea yet.
#+end_quote

I took Core Threads as seriously as the author probably intended. The humor wasn't funny to me, too formulaic and even, at the cost of sounding pretentious, juvenile, but it's recognizable. There are times when you can clearly see that the author understands the tropes of HP and is trying something with them, but that's not used for humor, mostly as a wink to the readers that we're supposed to recognize. Like commenting on the difference on the goblins between Harry and Rose's worlds, what difference does it really make that one is a monarchy and the other a loose confederation? Who cares? Most are like that.

So yeah, not crack.

*** The hallmark of a crack fic is thinking the author was on crack when strange and irrational things happen at random, and then at least some part of the world reacts to that insanity. It's almost always done for comedy.

Core Threads is powerwank, and it's not even good powerwank.

For Core Threads to be a crack fic, Harry would have to discover his magic threads, then use them to weave himself an ugly christmas sweater that makes anyone who sees him fall in love with him while also believing he is a 90 ton herbivorous dinosaur.

He then struggles with how the Dursleys have completely filled the cupboard under the stairs with ferns, trying to feed him and how Dudley keeps trying to hop on his back and "ride his awesome dinosaur" to school. In his frustration, Harry unravels core thread-sweater, only to discover that the Santa Claus knitted onto the chest has imbedded itself in his chest as a permanent tattoo.

He then falls into a mindscape in which Lord Voldemort's Horcrux and Santa Claus decide to have a gay wedding, and Q from Star Trek pops in, bringing Elton John with him to officiate the event. Guests include Abraham Lincoln, King Henry V, the entirety of the Harlem Globetrotters, and Julius Caesar riding a Tijuana donkey painted to look like a zebra.

When Sir Elton John asks if anyone objects to the wedding, Mrs. Claus shows up and screams bloody murder, not because Santa is about to make himself a bigamist, but because she reveals that Santa Claus is actually just six house elves standing on each other's shoulders in a santa suit. All hell breaks loose when it's revealed that all six of the house elves are just Dobby using a clever array of time turners. In the resulting chaos, Voldemort's Horcrux and the Dobby brigade fuck off, violently expelling Harry from his mindscape.

When he comes to, he realizes that he's somehow blacked out for the entire Hogwart's train ride and first month of schooling. In his mental absence, the sorting hat sorted him into Waffle House, and now Harry has to walk around with maple-syrup-colored accents on his Hogwarts robes and he's always followed by the scent of greasy butter and lonely midwestern trucker BO.

The good news is that as the only member of Waffle House, Harry gets to play every position on his House Quidditch team, which does by using the self-multiplying tricks he learned from Santa Dobby. His perfect coordination catches the eye of one Ludo Bagman, who offers to recruit Harry directly onto his new pro Quidditch team, the Accidental Horcruxes. When asked pointed questions about the team name, Ludo gets all shifty-eyed, drops a smoke bomb, and Batmans the fuck outta there.

The rest of the year passes relatively uneventfully, although Harry does have to contend with the fact that this giant smelly troll won't stop following him around, snuffling at his school robes trying to find the source of the delicious trucker BO-and-greasy-butter smell. The staff allow it, however, since the troll is remarkably well behaved and has very little tolerance for bad language.

With the troll's help, he earns perfect O's on all potions assignments.

At the end of the year, Harry fears that Snape is aiming to steal a precious treasure hidden behind a cerberus on the third floor, and when Dumbledore rushes off to the Ministry - not, mind you, via apparition or floo, but by riding his Jazzy Mobility Scooter at a whopping 6 kph - and Harry's response to his concern is to mobilize his crack team of Snape-stopping friends: the troll, himself, Moaning Myrtle, and SHIELD super-spy Black Widow in her disguise as Sally-Anne Perks.

They make pretty short work of all the traps, and Harry feels a little silly about bothering Black Widow with the whole thing, since the troll just smashes through everything. Even the fire trap at the end is inconsequential, as the wall next to the fire is not, itself, on fire and the troll simply smashes through the wall.

Imagine their surprise when they discover the final room contains nothing but a mirror. And who should be standing in front of the mirror? That's right, motherfuckers: the *real* Santa Claus. And he is not happy. Not one fucking bit. He will tolerate no pretenders to his title, and Harry's mindscape has transgressed against him. As such, he seeks the Philospher's Stone so he can craft a special Christmas cookie that, when force-fed to Harry in conjunction with a number of other ingredients, will cause his mindscape to shatter, leaving Harry bereft of his magic-thread power.

Or at least, Harry assumes that was his plan. He never really finds out, since as soon as Santa drops the first f-bomb, the troll roars out "language!" and smashes a fist down on his head, splattering Santa bits all over the final room.

That is crack.
