What if Wizardry never came to be? What if instead of being able to do simple charms with a wand, a witch or wizard needed to call upon Magic in high ritual? Wizards wouldn't be lazy since Magic would be used for less trivial things. Is this an interesting idea, or would it make it more boring?

*** I'm guessing common household charms? Don't think that's lazy though.

** It would certainly make things quite different, the whole dynamic of fighting for one would be quite different if someone needs to stay still doing a ritual to cast anything, for one I see physical combat (maybe improved through potions or rituals that permanently makes someone stronger) becoming much more important, as well as enchanted weapons, Voldemort for one would really have to change his approach.

On a more world building look the fact that magic can only be called through a ritual would make accidental magic non-existent, which could potentially mean that no one ever finds out about muggleborns or they are found later.
