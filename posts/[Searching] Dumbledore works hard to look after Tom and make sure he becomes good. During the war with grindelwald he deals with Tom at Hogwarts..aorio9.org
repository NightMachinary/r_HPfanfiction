Tom may eventually get adopted or become a professor and may travel to the normal dimension?

I also think Slughorn may help dumbledore as well?

This is when dumbledore is a teacher at hogwarts

*** While Realignment is great, I'm not sure it's what OP is looking for. The opening of the story makes it clear that Tom and Dumbledore have an antagonistic relationship (at least from Tom's point of view) and it's only the arrival of the stranger that makes Dumbledore take Tom on as an apprentice

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
