I'm trying to remember a fic from Ashwinder's archives that has Hermione helping win the final battle via a control room at the center of hogwarts. The room features doors to every other room in the castle, and she obviously uses it for liaisons.

The plot of the story eludes me, but the control room is all that has stuck.

Thanks!


** It doesn't sound too similar other than the connected room with doors to every other place and that it's sshg, but could be this one in which Unspeakable Hermione finds secret places with her magispectrometer:

*** Thank you! I'll go look. I can't remember anything but the magic room, of course. But I do love a good molly bashing fic.
