I can get into a good super!Harry fic, but, does anyone have any fics where Harry is still Harry but happens to be a metamorphmagus?

(some changes are givens, but fics where Harry is a genius who marries fleur and hates Ron and is smarter than Hermione and could kill Voldy without a wand with his eyes closed are getting old


** I just read this fic linkffn(Mentordora Tonks). It may be a bit cliched and far fetched at places, but I liked it nonetheless.

It's by the author of linkffn(Harry Potter, Geek of Magic) so if you liked that, maybe check it out.

  Seeing as he's her closest living relative who isn't her mother, a Malfoy, or a prisoner of Azkaban, seventh-year student Nymphadora Tonks takes first-year student Harry Potter under her wing. Possible Harry/Tonks when Harry's older?

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

** linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky) though he only finds out about it about 750k words in. He's def not super nor OP. Above average, somewhat crazy and tenacious and smarter than canon, impressive and impossibly lucky at times, but nowhere near the level of Dumbledore and Voldemort in raw skill and power.

Just a quick tip, Fic Search tag is for when you're searching for a specific fic. You should use Request for general search about a topic.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

** linkffn(10449375) Stargon's Cupboard series is VERY tropey and includes a smart Harry that's much stronger than in canon, but he's by no means all powerful and fails plenty of times throughout the story. He realizes he's an animal is about halfway through the series. Again very trophy but well written, plenty of nice changes from canon too.

*** I was going to rec this too. Yes, trope-y and smarter/stronger than canon but I think it's set up well with the character changes that were built in (being besties with Hermione).

I just finished this series and REALLY enjoyed it.
