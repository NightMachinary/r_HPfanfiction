Like, he insults people sarcastically/ironically/to keep cover but Harry just kind of ignores it, accepts it as part of snape's personality, or actually appreciates the sheer wit and snark.

If you look at some of snape's lines with the mindset of taking everything as a joke, you do get some comic gold.

Like, Snape and Harry have the potential to be possibly the greatest comic duo in Hogwarts, A History.

that's right, Gred and Forge, make way for Snap and Herry

** Not /exactly/ what you're looking for, but Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions has a Harry who greatly looks up to Snape and mostly ignores his meanness to learn potions from him. This is mostly because Harry is a kicked puppy who is dying for validation from an adult he admires, but also because Snape is not a terrible person in this fic. It's the perfect balance of plot, fluff, humor, and angst, in my humble opinion!

Edit: It also has a pretty good sequel in the works!

**** There's a Snape/Hermione fic that has a somewhat similar Snape, but I don't know if that's your cup of tea. It's called Pet Project. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2290003/1/Pet-Project]]

As for similar genre, if witty/adorable Harry thought process is a genre, there's also The Seventh Horcrux. I just like to recommend this to people because it's silly and fun, though. It also has a funny Snape in it, but Snape is not a huge part of the story. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux]]

Not really what you're asking for, but this is what I have ¯_(ツ)_/¯

**** Not OP but I've been reading this fic and enjoying Snape as well! I think he's similar in linkffn(magical relations by evansentranced) which, though slowwwwwly updating (I refuse to believe it is abandoned) has some really great Harry/Snape interactions, including Harry teaching Snape Parseltongue with hilarious results.

** Yes, I also feel that way about his dialogue! I know a lot of people here consider most of his lines to be an example of what a horrible person he is (which to be fair is true), but I just can't help but find all his sarcasm and the phrasing of his insults to be completely hilarious.

linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) My favorite Snape-Harry banter is in this AU. He is a death eater in this Voldemort won AU and still canon in personality so not very nice, but he isn't a bad person either and looks out for Harry. They have some amazing conversations that are based on entirely on sarcasm and snark that are just perfect coming from both of them.

linkffn(The Never-ending Road) This fem!Harry fic captures the comedic side of his character fairly well without making him out of character (Note that this fic is gen despite the note in the summary for future pairing) .

linkffn(In Blood Only) Snape is Harry's father, an older fic so somewhat AU in regards to Snapes background. He and Harry do not really get along with one another really well, but his dialogue and internal thoughts are really well written and really funny despite him not being a morally good person.

One example of some great conversations from the two of them from this fic:

#+begin_quote
  "So this one, single room is warded against Death Eaters, and the rest of the house is warded against me," Potter said slowly. "And how is this not a prison?"

  "The lack of Dementors might be an indicator," Snape said dryly.

  "You're as good as one," Potter snarled. "You certainly suck the joy out of my existence."

  "You flatter me too much," Snape said with a cold smile, inwardly pleased with the boy's words.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
