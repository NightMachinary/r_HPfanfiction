So I always love those fics where one thing is changed, and then the whole story gets impacted (examples-Ginny Weasley is a Slytherin, Harry has a twin, Sirius breaks out of Azkaban early, Remus finds out how horrendously the Dursley's treat Harry and steals him, etc.) If anybody has fic recommendations like that, please share! I go for pretty much any ship, as long as there's no incest or huge age difference (except Remus and Tonks, ofc) and any era is fine too, as long as it's well written. Have a wonderful day, all :)


** For Lack of a Bezoar fits the bill. It's an alternate 6th/7th year where Harry isn't able to get the bezoar to Ron in time during HBP.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** It's probably worth mentioning which ones you already know. I'm guessing you've come across Innocent? It's my top recommendation for that kind of divergence.

The Accidental Animagus is pretty decent, too. It seems at first like a fix-fic, making everything better, but once Voldemort properly hits his stride, it turns out he's been level-grinding too.

** I believe it's in the many deaths of Harry Potter but when certain things happen (clues in the title) Harry has to juggle the differences in his sense of events with everyone else....this was vague cause I wasn't sure if it counts a spoilers, anyway it's a really good fic.

** I think the trope you're looking for is called "For want of a nail". Anyway, here's one where everyone freaks out when Harry says the B-word at the end of second year.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** I really enjoyed survival is a talent by ShanaStoryteller on ao3. It's a Draco/Harry soulmate au, but the focus is really not on the soulmate stuff at all. It's more of an excuse to explore the idea of what would happen if Draco and Harry had a reason to try to put aside their enmity starting in second year, and how the story would change as a result. The characters are amazing and the writing is really good. It's currently unfinished but still updating fairly regularly.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
