Yes here it is I am so excited!!!


** Dumbledore teaching DADA for some reason = handwave excuse to show an extra creature (Boggart)

Lion thing in trailer that Newt confronts is possibly a manticore.

Grindelwald has the Elder Wand, wonder how they're going to square the issue. Possibly Grindelwald goes after Tina, Newt has to try and help her/save her.

Flamel is there. Wonder if he's like Kowalski's ancestor or something. I could see it.

Wouldn't it be hilarious if the blue-fire creature was actually a Heliopath? Lovegoods ftw!

Seriously, is there even a Statute of Secrecy for some of this stuff?

I'm sort of waiting for Newt to find a Basilisk in the street of Athens at some point. Gotta catch 'em all right?

***** Honestly? Its probably /easier/ to say Dumbledore is the one who inspired Newt's love of magical creatures.

That goes well with the idea that Newt is gonna give Fawkes to Dumbledore later on.

Edit: Also, it may just be that its a lot more expensive to show transfiguration than it is DADA.

******* /Possibly/, but thats not really how businesses, which the studios are, think.

If you can come up with an easy out to not show Dumbledore teaching people how to turn a parakeet into a chinchilla, you are going to be pressured to do that.

Why do you think they're making five of these things? Why hire Depp to play a blond-haired eugenicist revolutionary?

Grindelwald by contrast is only ever really shown in magical exclusive settings or alone.

Great idea actually. Newt decides he believes they should end the SoS for his creatures to be free, joins up with Grindelwald.

No, see, having a new creature piss on everyone at the end of the film means you can do whatever the hell you want to with no regards for the rules of the universe.

** Assorted thoughts:

- Coming around to Depp as Grindelwald. The look is better (silly mustache gone and he's lost weight) but it's still a bit too clown-like. Nonetheless, his voice is great and it looks like he's carrying himself with charisma and gravitas. Cautiously optimistic.

- Flamel as eccentric and frail works. There's always needed to be a reason why Flamel does not play a greater role in events. It's not my favourite route, but using him as comic relief is novel.

- I really want to know who the woman with the three vicious-looking cat-things is. The ominous music as she's introduced suggests a bad guy - maybe a lieutenant for Grindelwald? He needs some, because the enemy can't just be him. But the woman does also have that same look as Flamel, so it could alternatively be Perenelle.

- It looks like the movie is going to open with an epic action sequence of Grindelwald not just escaping but also fighting a large number of Aurors in the sky. That's going to be amazing and get the movie off to such a strong start.

- Such great music.

- Leta Lestrange's "you've never met a monster you couldn't love" line was great, but I worry about how the whole Newt-Tina-Leta love triangle will fit in with the rest of the movie, which is about much more serious matters than relationship drama.

- Also I thought Newt's fear was going to be homework, which I think would have been a snappier line. Oh well.

- Dumbledore as DADA teacher... not a fan but it's not a a big enough deal for me to care all that much. Transfiguration works so well with Dumbledore because it's widely considered the hardest subject, and heavily academic. It goes well with Dumbledore as an expert on the arcane. But I get why they would streamline it for the movies.

- So glad they're not going the "Grindelwald and Hitler were buddies" route that fanon has assumed since forever, even though JKR was saying as early as 2005 that there was no causal link between Grindelwald and Hitler/the Nazis, it's just that wizarding and Muggle worlds mirror each other.

- Who is the person saying "You underestimate your talents, Mr Scamander"? Accent sounds Germanic, but not Depp's voice.

- Love the enchanted glove pointing Newt to Dumbledore and then apparating him there. Nice link to Dumbledore's magic pointing Ron to Harry and Hermione in DH and apparating him to them.

- Grindelwald's line "magic blooms only in rare souls" makes me wonder if JKR is backtracking on magic being genetic - having it being inherited mystically, rather than through a literal gene. If so, good. The gene idea never worked very well.

IIRC, Grindelwald didn't care much for blood status but rather magical strength in witches/wizards and tearing down the SoS. Given that I'm more of the opinion that he's using "bloom" to mean /greatness/ rather than /birth/. IE: Magic /is great/ only in rare souls.

*** Magic is genetic really did lead to some unfortunate eugenics apologists. I guess that's kind of the point of the Death Eaters, but it also takes away from the main message of the series that it's not about blood status, but ability. Having muggleborns pop up without being great grandchildren of Marius Black or whatever makes it more special and makes the message less confusing

Like a fanfic where there no overreaching plot until the author gets bored and needs to end it, but also wrote a sequel with their fave characters. So little of it has to do with anything else going on and a lot of it just gets dropped.
