Was looking for a Harry Potter that takes charge of his life.

I've enjoyed reading dat93's version of Harry in -

Cloak And Dagger - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7095868/1/Cloak-and-Dagger]]

Resident Evil: Potter Style - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7344753/1/Resident-Evil-Potter-Style]]

The Rise of Darkness - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6192731/1/The-Rise-of-Darkness]]

I enjoyed him being confident in himself and a bonus with him having some type of subordinates / followers.
