After stories where Sirius has a much younger sister that he doesn't know about, eg hidden from him or born after he moved in with the Potters.

She could be around Tonks' age or friends with a older Weasley, or even friends with younger Death Eaters (but not one herself). Bonus if she blurs the line between light & dark but not strictly dark.

Thanks in advance.


** This is an oddly specific request. Is this a thing or something you are hoping is a thing?

*** Not a thing just something that came across my mind randomly. Possibly inspired by the unknown daughter stories I have read.
