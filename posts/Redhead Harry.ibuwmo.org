So saw this post on pinterest about Harry being the opposite in the way he looks (Looking like his mum with his dad's eyes). And I haven't seen any fics like that before, so I was wondering if anyone else has? No requirements really, just wanna see our boy with red hair lol Here's the og post I saw it on [[https://pin.it/1J0JbBl][Redhead Harry]]

**** It is in:

- a bit crackish linkffn(Pranking The Tournament by Gardevoir687)
- linkffn(Looking Beyond by shini-amaryllis) ... unfortunately, unbelievably too long (among those stories, which could be cut to one fifth without loosing any content)

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!

  The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight
