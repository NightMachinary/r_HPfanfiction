Any well written fanfics where Harry is kinda punk or becomes punk in say... Third year. Something where he is NOT very good friends with Ron and Hermione. Thanka guys


** Well I've been reading Chaos by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2603123/tangledribbons][tangledribbons]] on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], it has 51 chapters and it complete, but it has the main pairing as Drarry if you mind that or not, and its kinda fast paste but so far its the only punk Harry fics i found that haven't been abandoned after 1 chapter :^/ I would like to know if theres anymore fics with Punk/rebellious Harry aswell becuase its intresting to read
