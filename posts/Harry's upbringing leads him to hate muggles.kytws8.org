Think about it, even if you strictly stick to canon until the fic starts 11 year old Harry has spent most of his life being abused (some fanfics overdo the abuse but even if you just look at canon it is abuse) by the Dursleys, he's been locked away, the calling him "freak" every 5 minutes is fanon but he is definitely treated like a leper, and like a house elf.

So when he is 11 he is taken away from this abusive environment and put with his own kind, he hasn't experienced betrayal at the hands of wizards yet and certain wizards hold beliefs muggles are inferior, even the Wealsey's believe muggles are inferior, they may think they need protection and killing and hurting them is wrong but look at Ron's comic books "the adventurs of Martin Miggs the mad muggle" and they ignore a muggle (or Squib it isn't clear) second cousin. Arthur who is supposed to be the muggle expert is also incredibly ignorant as evidenced by the questions he asks Harry and his inability to navigate muggle london in book 5 without Harry's help. And the Weasley's are well meaning kind people. Yet they still discriminate even though they probably don't intend to.

So the most enlightened wizards treat muggles in a patronizing way informed by ignorance even the "muggle lover" Arthur Weasley.

Given his own treatment at the hands of his muggle family plus the natural discrimination against muggles in the wizarding world (we have just examined why the best case scenario, the Weasleys are less than ideal) Harry would grow to hate muggles. Harry feels Hogwarts is his home and hates returning the Dursleys were summer, this could grow into real resentment towards his muggle family and the muggle world as a whole.

After all both Tom Riddle and Severus Snape grew up in abusive muggle households and grew to hate them (I don't believe Snape would have betrayed Voldemort if not for Lily's death, he was quite happy to kill muggles until that point). It isn't a stretch Harry could feel the same.

And that is before you even bring in any out of canon fiction like altering the scenarios slightly.

So I'm looking for fics where Harry really hates muggles due to his upbrining.

This lends itself to a dark Slytherin Harry fic but that isn't a requirement. I'll also take a Harry that is Gryffindor and against Voldemort but still hates muggles.

Maybe he hates them enough he sides with Voldemort, maybe he is still against Voldemort (after all he killed his parents) but agrees with his ideals think of a Magneto type scenario " I'd like you to know that I agree with every word you said. We are the future. But unfortunately, you killed my mother."

Maybe he is still the same as canon apart from this fact and Hermione is horrified and tries to change his mind (this might actually be more interesting than the usual dark Slytherin Harry route).

Ideally without too much unrealistic bashing. Lets not have Ginny trying to slip Harry love potions ir secretly evil Dumbledore (he can be criticized and flawed but hes not stealing from Harry or trying to manipulate his friendships).

He doesn't have to want to committ genocide or anything (though he could), he could just want the wizarding world completely seperate (like Rappaport's law) or be really dismissive and cold about them (maybe this is what Hermione notices because he is really nice to the Weasleys but cold to her parents).


** Funny enough, I posted a prompt myself that kind of poked at the other direction: Harry hating wizards (and also the Dursleys). Link [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dfugth/prompt_harry_decides_that_wizards_are_to_blame/][here]], if you're interested.

Basically, logic was that he's only in a situation that /allows/ him to be abused because of wizards. A wizard killed his parents. A wizard placed him with his abusive family. A wizard keeps sending him /back/ to the Dursleys. Etc, etc.

It was a fun idea, to me at least.

Anyway, about your idea: If I wrote this myself, I'd probably go more "I want them to leave me alone", and not "dark, murderous, revenge". Maybe Harry just conspires to leave the Dursleys, and the muggle world as a whole, behind. More "quest for freedom", less "Next Tom Riddle".

**** Your idea is really interesting. Like I said: I'd not go "dark" with it, because that's just me. If you wanted the Hermione angle, you could even have Harry be like "Your parents are the exception" after meeting them.

Harry dislikes muggles, but Emma and Dan are alright. They're muggles, but they're not like most others.

So... Harry is kind of casually racist? "You're a credit to your race" kind of thing with the Grangers?

***** I think Harry would more have a childish black and white view of the world. He doesn't really meet Hermionie's parents in canon except in passing in book three, I don't even think they are introduced. Which makes them a blank canvas for fic. I always imagined Hermione had loving parents who completely supported her even if they didn't always understand. So maybe Harry hates muggles and Hermione takes him home with her to show him not all muggles are like he thinks (also Harry need therapy which doesnt seem to be a thing in the wizarding world) ajd by helping him process the abuse he suffered he starts to realize not all muggles are like that. So he's less hostile/wary/suspicious of Hermione's parents.

Equally maybe it doesn't work at all and he has decided because of muggles not understanding magic they should just keep away from them.

His arguments dont have to be flawless he's a damaged child/teenager depending on his age during the fic.

****** I think it comes down to the kind of story you want to write.

A story where Harry is wrong in his "all muggles are bad" stance and learns that its just that he had a shitty life? A story where he decides that the Grangers are the exception? A story where he figures that they're nicer than most, but they're still /muggles?/

There's a lot of angles, and a lot depends on which one you want to go for.

I'd be interested to see a Harry who dislikes muggles on principle meeting a nice, supportive, loving version of the Grangers. I think it'd be interesting.

And yeah, his arguments don't have to be perfect, its nearly more interesting if he's flawed actually. That gives room for others to argue against him, which could lead to some fun character moments.

** On the subject of his abuse

I've seen about five types of legally classified abuse

A. Mental and or Emotional abuse

B. Verbal abuse

C. Physical abuse(however minor) (remember fifth year?)

D. Modern Child Slavery(I don't remember what it's actually called, unless I did get the name right...)

E. Criminal Neglect

Fuck the Dursleys. This is enough to give someone PTSD.

** I remember Harry feeling this way in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness]]). It's a very popular Slytherin Harry story, so you may have already read it. He doesn't want to kill muggles or anything like that here, but he isn't very fond of the muggle world. He even faces a bit of an identity crisis because he kinda agrees with Voldemort about muggles, but Voldemort is also trying to kill him.

** Did Snape kill Muggles? I got the impression that he doesn't actually give two shits about the blood status thing, just pretends to.

Canon Harry gets weepy over owls and house-elves (and I like house elves, don't come for me!) so I don't see him hating or being actively prejudiced against Muggles. I think he is smart enough to know that not all Muggles are bad, he just got dealt a bad hand with his aunt's family. But of course in fanfics anything goes.

*** Canon Harry is so loving he basically forgives everyone who screws him over (including the Dursley's and Dumbledore) the whole point of canon Harry is he knows how to love and Voldemort doesn't. He forgives basically everyone and even has some sympathy for Tom Riddle.

But I think this is more realistic, Harry upbringing both pre and during Hogwarts is not the sort of upbringing that in reality would lead to a stable person.

As for Snape it is never explicitly stated Snape personally killed muggles, death eaters did in the first war though and he was one. I think what Snape wanted was acceptance, he lost Lily as a friend by this point and his childhood was rubbish too, so he sought it in people who recognized his skills. He was quite happy to tell Voldemort about a prophecy that would lead to a child getting killed though (he must have known Voldemort would react to a prophecy about a baby about to be born that could vanquish him with murder he didn't care until Lily was involved). He could easily have said nothing but he told Voldemort and probably expected rewards, which indicates he was after the status and power Voldemort could potentially offer if he won, even if he didn't truly believe in his ideals he didn't care it was wrong if it benefitted him.

In all the fics I've read that pull off a Muggle-hating Harry, they note that even though Petunia and co were the only actual abusive Muggles Harry met, no others Muggles intervene to stop them. Primary school teachers are trained to recognise abuse and yet they miss his second hand clothing, thinness, and bruises from Harry hunting, which should be especially obvious in comparison to how Dudley gets treated. Teachers also don't stop Dudley and his gang bullying him. And the neighbours all think he's insanely criminal and his classmates don't talk to him for fear of Dudley. So far Harry hasn't met any Muggles that have been actively nice to him. Miss Figg doesn't really count because she is also an authority figure who was in a position to recognise and stop the abuse and yet she didn't.

**** Regarding Mrs Figg I read one fic (wish I could remember I think it was a parental Snape! fic). Where Dumbledore set Mrs Figg up to keep an eye on Harry as in canon, but she wasn't reporting the Dursley's abuse (Dumbledore expected her to report any problems and assumed Harry suffered no abuse as she said nothing), because she was worried if Dumbledore removed Harry she wouldn't keep getting paid and might have to leave her house. It sort of gave Dumbledore an out of the usual bashing in such fics, and he genuinely felt really guilty for what happened to Harry and not noticing.

** I would think that Harry would mostly be apathetic to muggles rather than hate them .. I don't even think Riddle or Snape(may be his father? is that cannon?) hate muggles but they see them as powerless and less than magicals rather than hate them .. so Harry in that scenario just ignores all the acts of muggle baiting wizards do except when it doesn't fit with his goal of Riddle's defeat .. so he would probably not ignore insults to Hermione who is clearly his friend & ally and help defend her parents if they are at risk but wouldn't lift a finger when he knows some wizards are torturing muggle strangers unless they are DEs and going against them reduces Tom's power & influence.

** Harry was able to early on not generalize Dursleys behavior, and was able to tell that not all muggles behaved the same. He speaks of the kind muggles he meets in grocery stores and the streets who wish him and shake his hand. He also speaks kindly of Miss Figg (at this time she does not know she is a squib). Even though he disliked the Dursleys for their behavior we never see Harry having a generalized negative view of muggles.

Regarding Arthur and the Weasleys, they can not be faulted because they never spent time with muggles. We never see them think muggles are inferior. They just think muggles are weaker, and are amazed how muggles have invented so much without magic. All their oddities is because of their lack of contact with muggles. Arthur is very kind to the Dursleys, and Mr and Mrs Granger.

We have no incident of Snape harming muggles (not sure where this killing muggles is coming from.) Yes, he was a death eater, and death eaters generally wanted to subjugate muggles. But we can see that even Tom Riddle did not care about muggles subjugation. Snape can have many other reasons other than ideological to join the death eaters. Maybe he wanted to learn dark magic and invent new spells, and the death eaters funded his research. We don't know so much about Snape. Snape is such a complex and contrary character.

*** The kind muggles he meets in grocery stores and streets who want to shake his hand, are witches and wizards, he doesn't know this at the time but it becomes fairly obvious once he hears he is famous in the wizarding world. Of course Harry in canon knows the difference, but this is HPfanfiction not HPcanon.

As for the Weasley's Arthur Weasley sets him self up as some kind of muggle expert. Yet he doesn't know anything. He wants to learn and is willing to learn to give him credit, but he is also pretty patronizing. If I set myself up as an expert on say Nigerian culture, despite the fact I had never been to Nigeria and know virtually nothing about Nigerian culture would it matter if I was kind to Nigerian people I met? I think it would still be seen as me being ignorant.

In Goblet of fire, they mention death eaters hurt muggles for fun, it doesn't seem to have been Voldemort's main goal, but if he had subjugated the wizarding world I think he would have moved onto muggles. He wanted power and there are so many more muggles than magicals. Whether Snape /liked/ it or not it is safe to say he probably took part in such raids. If he had other motivations for joining e.g learning dark magic, funded research, he still made the decision he was OK with torture and murder in exchange for that.

**** Basically Harry was sensible enough to not assume every muggle is like his uncle and aunt. Unlike Tom Riddle. Snape is so contrary about his feelings towards muggles.

The fact that Arthur is the expert on Muggles in the ministry, and knows so little about them shows how ridiculously separated the magical and muggle words are (despite a lot of marriages with muggles). Possibly people like Dumbledore and Hermione can see that the statute of secrecy is a wall which will eventually cause problems, as the gap between both these worlds keeps getting wider.

I am not saying Snape is a saint. But, his character is so contrary that we can never truly know where his deeper motivations lie.
