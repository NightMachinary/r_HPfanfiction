So, title says it all I guess. I'm searching for fics where Hermione gets sucked into the abyss that are the dark arts. Don't care about pairings.

Thanks in advance


** Another classic is Applied Cultural Anthropology. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or]]

**** Thanks for fixing it. I was on my phone when I posted the link last night and forgot to go back and change it to the non-mobile link when I got to a computer.

**** I liked it, but it hasn't been updated since late December. I hope it's not abandoned because Hermione was just starting to show her dark side.

***** IIRC, there was a quite a long gap between the penultimate chapter and the most recent one, so hopefully he's just a slow updater.

****** From his forum postings, he is trying to alternate chapters with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9221236/1/Appeal-of-Authority][Appeal of Authority]] (sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8235774/1/Trial-by-Ninja][Trial by Ninja]]), a /Naruto/ fic that essentially does with Sakura what ACA does with Hermione.

***** Its so often that fics get abandoned at exactly the moment when the real twist happens. I suspect its because the authors all write straight-forward and then realize that they have no plot, just an idea for character development.

** In addition to those posted so far, here are some that I consider good, if with some reservations:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/][Reign of the Serpent]] looks like it might end up there. Excellent fic either way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/][Harry Potter without Harry Potter]] has her end up deceiving her way into Durmstrang, where she finds herself having to learn All the Dark Arts or else she might be murdered after graduation.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/][Labyrinth]]: A Riddle-like Hermione arrives at Hogwarts, with Harry tagging along. Updates slowly.

These have the elements, but are less recommended:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8791538/1/][Abyss]] (literally): Troll Incident doesn't go very well for Hermione, and she starts planning revenge on the wizarding world. Probably abandoned, and not very good in the first place.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614738/1/][Darkest Witch of her Age]]: Diverges in GoF when Hermione begins resenting her parents; well written, but a little bit emo, and hasn't updated in a long time.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8113248/1/][The Dark Duo]]: Locked the bathroom with the Troll, Hermione's accidental magic "deals with the problem", and more. Not updated in a long time.

** Can't believe I forgot [[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=1819][Dangerous]] (registration required). A decade after the end of Book 7 (sans Epilogue), Harry returns to England to find that Hermione is leading an insurgency to overthrow the Ministry, things having gone back to Business as Usual after Harry left.

Unfortunately, while a lot has been written, and a lot of it is good, it hasn't been updated in years.
