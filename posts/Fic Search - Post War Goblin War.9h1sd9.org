Hey everyone. I've been trying to find a fic that deals with a Goblin War, sparked by Harry's actions in Gringotts. I remember that his kids played a major part in it, and the starting chapters had Dudley's kid I think. The Sword of Gryffindor was also a plot device, and there was a shade of Voldemort residing in the Chamber of Secrets. It also had some minor politics, as Harry was being pressured to engage Aurors in the war by the public, and he was stubborn with his refusal. If anyone knows of what I'm looking for, I'd appreciate a link.


** I'm almost certain the fic you're looking for is linkao3(369727).
