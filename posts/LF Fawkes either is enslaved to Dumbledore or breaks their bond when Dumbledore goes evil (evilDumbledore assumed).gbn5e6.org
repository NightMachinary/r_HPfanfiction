:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a cliche'd trope, but I don't see many previous posts that specifically list fics with this. Some examples of the former would be Remus recognizing a dark binding and breaking it, or Harry performing diagnostic spells on Fawkes and finding it, and Fawkes either bonds with him or disappears into Phoenix Country forever. The latter would be things like if Fawkes saw Dumbledore almost fall to the dark side and breaks the bond to stop him or warn him.


** Alternate thought:

Dumbledore is being manipulated by Fawkes.

Immortal firebirds have their */needs/*, you know? Back in the 1940s, Fawkes was feeling that

'50 year itch' and started scouting out that tasty new kid, Tom Riddle (yum, yum, get him some). Tom, recognizing Fawkes to be the unfaithful slut he is, rejected him.

Infuriated, Fawkes starts using their familiar bond to push Albus into conflict with Tom, driving him to the Dark Side (TM), leaving Tom with no other choice but to start killing people when the only job he could get once he was done with the school was working for the magical pawnshop (whatever its name was)

Once Harry is born, Fawkes senses this kid could be Albus' replacement, so why not use him to deal with that uppity bitch Tom. (Fawkes holds grudges)

And boom, you've got canon.
