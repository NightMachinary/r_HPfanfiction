/Does anyone have a list of works that don't break canon or are about custom characters that don't change/effect the canon plot? Perhaps there is a term for this that I am unaware of and could just search said term on ff.net?/

I want to read some separate stories to experience more of the wizarding world without it breaking the main books or go against what an established character is/does. My main concern with reading fanfiction is if the story breaks the main books or deviates from canon (like Harry teams up with Voldemort or dies in the Chamber) which would later lead me to become confused about what is canon and what is not.

Maybe a story about a Slytherin student (established or fan made) during the same time period of the JKR books and shows a different side to the story like not accepting everything presented to him at face value like Harry does.


** The term you're looking for is canon compliant and there are lots of us who exclusively write this way. You might enjoy linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) for a slytherin perspective. I also write canon compliant stuff but I don't have anything in Slytherin. I do have DH from Ginny's point of view though. linkffn(Not From Others)

You may also want to look up Northumbrian's works.

*** Wow thank you so much for all those tasty recommendations! So many stories by Northumbrian I probably will have enough material to read for years, considering how pathetically slow I read lol.

**** Be warned that not all of Northumbrian stories are completed but are in the same universe, so to speak. I've only read a few but I've heard that sometimes his stories spoil uncompleted ones. What I have read has generally been very good though, and like you said there is just so much there that you'll be set for a long time :)

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** linkffn(7937889) is canon compliant, in the perspective of Snape. The writing is fantastic at the beginning, but quality fluctuates in the other time periods of Snape's life.

This fic offers a different point of view when it comes to Snape's actions in the seven books. While I don't necessarily agree with some of the characterization, I think it's an interesting read.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/56ah93/fanfiction_friday/d8hx6ql/][Err. Yeah. Well. I do!]] Still being occasionally updated as well!

The Snape Chronicles and Northumbrian's stories are actually included in my list as well, just like Floreatcastellum's work. This should keep you busy for the coming days/weeks/months/years, depending on how often and fast you read ;)

** On this sub you could be forgiven for thinking most fanfiction is AU because there seems to be a general preference for that on here.

My own stories are canon compliant, or at least don't contradict it, and I think a high proportion of fics are, though I wouldn't like to guess at the proportion. It does seem that AU is growing in popularity as the original canon (and its readers) get older. But still I don't think this sub is really representative.

*** Not just a general preference here. There is a vocal section of the HP fanficdom that refuses to accept canon compliant fanfiction and claims all fanfiction has to be AU to be valid. They can be found across various sites.

**** I have always found the joy and challenge of HP fanfiction in exploring the gaps in canon -- of which there are so many! The things and characters Harry doesn't see; the things that are only hinted at in the books. There is so much potential there I never felt the need to look elsewhere. The original canon is what I liked in the first place, so why change it?

It was a bit of a culture shock for me when I first discovered that wasn't a universal view.
