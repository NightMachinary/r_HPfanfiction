A fic where Harry is exceptional in both politics and magical ability. Well written, strong character development, and if not completed, at least written to a sufficient degree that it's not frustrating when you reach the end.


** A Marauder's Plan, where Sirius doesn't run after PoA, and becomes Lord Black, setting in motion a chain of events that turn Harry into both a Political Powerhouse, and the destined Master of Death. 87 Chapters, Complete.

** Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense; The Serpentine Subterfuge; The Ambiguous Artifice; The Futile Facade) series with a politically powerful and magically gifted Fem!Harry disguised as a guy. I don't read Fem!Harry normally but this series sort of skirts round the issue and is very readable. 4th year may be abandonned, first 3 are complete.

Also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; 12384509; Honour Thy Blood) might also all qualify. First on is long and 2 years complete, second is pretty long, and third is complete.

  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream.

  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
