It may be an odd or unusual request, but I am looking for quality fanfics where Harry vanishes at some point either prior to going to Hogwarts or in the early years of Hogwarts (like prior to 5th year). He might vanish because he is kidnapped, jailed, lost in time, runs away, escapes, is hidden away to be trained, or any other such style.

He then returns years later (Like.. maybe 5-10 years after he would have graduated Hogwarts or something). Wizarding Britain may have been overrun by the dark (Voldemort/death eaters) or saved by the light. Maybe very little has changed other than the people themselves. The main point is it should be post-Hogwarts and the world should have moved forward in some fashion with Harry missing and his whereabouts unknown (perhaps he's presumed dead).

As for Harry himself, his return could be in a variety of ways, and who he is, is open-ended. Maybe he comes back incognito, pretending to be someone he is not, or hiding in plain sight. Maybe he fights injustice from behind the scenes, or funds projects from the shadows. Maybe he is good, or maybe he is bad. Perhaps he is a new dark lord or comes back to take up a Wizamgamot seat or his inheritance, or simply to find someone to fall in love with. Again its open-ended.

The main point is I am looking for stories where Harry is placed into a world that has evolved WITHOUT him in whatever form, and with whatever excuse is made for his absence (provided no one knows what happened to him). And a world that is a POST-HOGWARTS world.

Any rating is fine but I do prefer more mature fics. I am not offended by much so darker stories are perfectly fine. Smut is fine as long as the plot is first. I prefer stories that have relationships but would prefer no main character slash. Side character slash is fine. Harry should be the main character but stories told from different character perspectives are fine.

This request was inspired by a few stories I have read in the past, the most recent one being Escape to Darkness: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4815342/1/]]

So hoping there are more out there than I realize. Thanks ahead of time!


** linkao3(7331278) *Hermione Granger's Hogwart's Crammer for Delinquents on the Run*- This might be a bit more light hearted than what you're looking for, it's not a crackfic, but it's not super dark and depressing either. It's also Harry/Draco, but if I remember correctly it's slow burn and the fic is rated T, so they're not jumping into bed with each other right away or anything like that. Other than that, it's exactly what you're looking for, Harry doesn't find out he's a wizard until he's 17 and Voldemort has taken over the Ministry.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
