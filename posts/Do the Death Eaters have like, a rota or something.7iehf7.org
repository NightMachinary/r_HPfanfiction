I appreciate that SOME of the Death Eaters are too important to have jobs, or are escaped convicts, but what about someone like Walden MacNair? He is a hardworking man with a full-time job - he can only be a part-time murderous blood supremacist.

How do you see the Death Eaters working out their schedules and the actual spread of labour? Do you see them as having strict ranks, or is it looser? Basically, how do you think the structure of the Death Eaters, as an organised group, pans out?


** I imagine them having a loose organisation where you spend your free time murdering unless you have specific instructions from Voldemort. So a few "gentlemen" meet up, have a few drinks and go out for a night of murderous fun. Voldemort strikes me as the type who despises micromanagement unless it involves his obscure plans. He is content with his followers doing their own thing as long as it serves his cause.

Of course there are coordinated actions as well as Voldemort's master plan but for the most part, direct supervision of rape, murder, torture and arson is not required. One of the inner circle as oversight should be enough.

** I imagine it's pieced together much like how most terrorist networks are. There's the supreme head/center of propaganda, but then everything from there is heavily decentralized. That way there's a common goal/thing they're working towards, but the actual hands on day-to-day is very much left up to individual 'cells' if you would. Even at that level, there's always a disconnect between those who are the true believers to the cause, and those who are associates, or useful idiots.

This is why I believe it was such a big deal in the books to be a /marked/ Death Eater and not merely someone that was assisting them (either willingly or unwillingly). A Death Eater was someone that was fully committed to the cause, a "made man" if you will. They're /part/ of the organization, the ones who actively work to bring about their cause. As opposed to those who were merely recruited to assist. They weren't loyal to the Death Eaters, but they were willing to help.

To give an example, not everyone that works for ISIL actually is a card carrying member of them. Some just work with them because their ideals line up. This is similar to how Umbridge wasn't a Death Eater, but she certainly had zero qualms in assisting with their campaigns.

  who get tasked with stuff like torturing the Longbottoms
#+end_quote

Might just be fanon, but I was under the impression that the torture of the Longbottoms was not done on any sort of orders from Voldemort, since he had already been defeated by the time the torture occurred. Instead it was a group of his followers torturing members of the Order for information as to their lord's status/location.

** I got the impression that Voldemort planned most things for the evening, so any employed Death Eaters would have been off work at that point. Most official meetings or attacks are probably scheduled well beforehand, so everyone has time to make their excuses.

For unplanned summonings, we see during Voldemort's initial return that Snape doesn't show up in the graveyard and is later forgiven for this. It never comes up again or hangs suspiciously over his head.

Presumably, this is because he was publicly being a professor at Hogwarts at the time, which seems to have been taken as a perfectly valid excuse. He couldn't very well disappear from the stands at the Triwizard Tournament without looking suspicious af.

Voldemort is aware of which of his followers have day jobs, especially ones where they can't necessarily just skip out suddenly, like Snape or McNair. So they probably get a good amount of slack if they can't always make it on short notice, whereas outlaws like Bellatrix are likely expected to be available 24/7. People like Malfoy, who may or may not be in the middle of a political meeting at the time of an unexpected summons, might be given some slack on a more case-by-case basis.

** Voldemort liked to sleep in. So in general holding a job was not all that difficult. In the other hand, the evenings were a bit more of a problem. There you were, giving the missus a good seeing to and bang! Suddenly your Dark Mark goes off. That is one big mood killer, I tell your.

Well, except for Bellatrix I'd guess.

** I've always viewed the group to be composed of lots of competing individuals and factions, all trying to accumulate the favour of Voldermort, plus personal power and influence. If anyone is familiar with the current historiographical orthodoxy that the Nazi government (and state institutions) was comprised of officials and departments constantly competing against each other and not actually working very effectively together, then that's probably the best way I can describe my conceptualisation of how the Death Eater structure operated.
