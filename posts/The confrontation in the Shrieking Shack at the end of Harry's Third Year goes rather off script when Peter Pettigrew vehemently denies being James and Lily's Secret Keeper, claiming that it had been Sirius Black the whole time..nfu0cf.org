#+TITLE: The confrontation in the Shrieking Shack at the end of Harry's Third Year goes rather off script when Peter Pettigrew vehemently denies being James and Lily's Secret Keeper, claiming that it had been Sirius Black the whole time.

Whether this is because of some variant of the Rashomon effect, Sirius had been turned into a Manchurian candidate by his own family, or some other massive twist I leave open for others to fill in.


** You have to ask why though. Why'd he live years as a rat, why'd he cut off his... finger, etc.

*** Well it depends on how wild you want to take things. Maybe the finger was cut off during a brief exchange of spells between Sirius and Peter. Maybe there was a third party involved during the confrontation that locked Peter in his animagus form. Maybe Sirius shouldn't have had that fifth helping of baked beans for dinner, and it was that combined with a nearby muggle smoking a cigarette that caused the alleyway to blow up.

** It would be a very compelling argument, if he didn't fake his death. There's many things you need to gloss over to enjoy Harry Potter, but why Pettigrew spent 12 years as a rat instead of coming out of hiding the second Black was thrown in Azkaban is the most egregious.

** Wormtail: "Why would I be a secret keeper? I wasn't even friends with your parents."

Remus: "Come now Peter... you always hung out with us."

Harry: "I heard McGonagall say that too."

Wormtail: "Hung out with you? You always thought you were too good for me. Did I have an admiration for you? Yes. Was I ever allowed into your clique? Absolutely no."

Sirius: "The fuck? We taught you how to turn into a rat?"

Wormtail: "That's not true. I learned to be an Animagus to impress you and James and you just laughed at me when I turned into a rat. Tell them how it was Remus!"

Remus: "I don't remember that."

Sirius: "It doesn't matter. The point is I asked James to make you the secret keeper."

Wormtail: "You did? Well he never asked me. For all we know the house was never under the Fidelius Charm."

Sirius: "Wtf? Dude I was a witness to that."

Wormtai: "Maybe you might have made a death eater impersonating me a secret keeper. I think I would know if I was made a secret keeper."

Sirius/Remus: "Peter you're being ridiculous now."

Wormtail: "That's what you said when you made me set my pants on fire in third year."

Sirius: "It was a game of truth or dare."

Wormtail: "Yeah... dare to enter the common room with your pants not on fire and you'll see what happens."

Harry: "Don't mind me but it seems like you were quite a bully to Peter in school, Black."

Sirius: "Come on Harry you don't actually believe this traitorous shit!"

Peter: "But you'd believe the guy who killed twelve Muggles and supposedly me and then spent twelve years in Azkaban and is considered You-Know-Who's right hand man?"

Harry: "You do have a point."

Sirius: "Oh for fuck sake. Remus, help me out here!"

Remus: "I mean the version of the story I knew was that you were the secret keeper. Peter here denies your version so I'm not sure what to believe..."

Sirius: "I was James's best friend. Do you really think I'd betray him?"

Remus: "I wouldn't know. After all your family kind of supported Voldemort's views when he first came around."

Sirius: "Remus, you wouldn't actually believe that, would you?"

Remus: "I don't know what to believe anymore."

Sirius: "I can't believe this shit is happening. Fine. Then why would you spend twelve years as a rat?"

Wormtail: "Then why would you spend twelve years in Azkaban?"

Sirius: "..."

Harry: "Hold on! He has a point. Why did you actually spend twelve years as a rat?"

Wormtail: "Well Sirius came to me spewing some nonsense and then tried to kill me. I was scared."

Sirius: "And you decided to cut off your finger because...?"

Wormtail: "Cut my finger off? You blew it, you asshole."

Ron: "Good but once Sirius was in prison why did you continue to pretend you were a rat?"

Wormtail: "At first I didn't know the threat was gone so spent a few days as a rat then got found by a certain Molly Weasley. I instantly fell in love with her corned beef sandwiches and decided 'fuck it, my life as a rat is better than my life as a human'"

Ron: "You know that my mom would have gladly fed you corned beef sandwiches if you asked for them as a human."

Wormtail: "So what should have I done? Just show up at your door and ask for corned beef sandwiches?"

Sirius: "Fuck corned beef sandwiches. The point is that this little shit here sold your parents to Voldemort, Harry!"

Wormtail: "Remind me how? I never even met You-Know-Who."

Sirius: "Because you were the secret keeper."

Wormtail: "The secret keeper of what? Why would you entrust me with any secrets if I was never your friend?"

Remus: "I think you might be lying, Peter. We were all your friends."

Wormtail: "Yeah, if you call the guy who has to do embarrassing shit for your amusement, has to write your homework assignments, has to deliver love letters to your crushes friend."

Remus: "Peter, this is not about a petty school grudge, is it?"

Wormtail: "Even if it were... don't pretend like James ever considered me enough of a friend to entrust me with the safety of his family."

Sirius: "You little shit... how dare you..."

Harry: "Now we should all calm down. So Peter, you say they weren't your friends but then explain how comes your nickname is included on the Marauders' Map."

Wormtail: "Is it? Well at least I got that much credit for drawing it..."

Remus: "Come on Peter, we all drew it."

Wormtail: "Yeah, you drew the girls' bathrooms while hiding under James's cloak."

Remus: "Well..."

Wormtail: "Come on, Remus. You're the reasonable one. You knew what we were like. Don't tell me that if Sirius would have suggested to James to make me a secret keeper he wouldn't have just laughed in his face."

Remus: "You have a point. I'm sorry Sirius. Stupefy!"
