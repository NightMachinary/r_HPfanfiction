linkffn(628937) I just read this story and I can't stop the tears. What I will say is not exactly a spoiler but be warned anyway. This story talks about character's reaction to Harry's suicide. Remus and Sirius' broke me. Ron too. It was a little bit disappointing not reading Hermione's POW but still an awesome story. Like I said, read if you want to ugly cry.

** linkffn(1399984) is an emotional story. Everyones reactions to Harry's actions and Harry's own realization of what he has done is heartbreaking. Not to mention it deals with some extremely heavy topics.
