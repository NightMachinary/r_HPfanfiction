In the books, Death Eaters are often mentioned, yet I have some problems to see who was a member and who was not.

For example, in HBP, Dumbledore mention several names who were waiting for Dumbledore in a bar during his interview, all these names, like Lestrange or Malfoy were later name of Deather Eater, but most of these people seem parents of the Death Eater (since Lucius or Rodolphus would be too young to be present in this scene). What happened to this old generation? Draco Malfoy speak of his Grandfather death as something pretty recent in HBP, but he never appeared at Voldemort summon and doesn't seem to have been troubled by any accusations, did he just leave his son be marqued or did he have another position (he also didn't have a place in the "circle" of Voldemort).\\
Another thing is Narcissa Malfoy. She is a Blood Purist, but is she a Death Eater? She doesn't seem to be here in the graveyard, but is present during both the Death Eater meeting in DH and the battle of Hogwarts. Is it because the HQ was in her home and Voldemort took every availiable wand for the Battle or is she marqued? And if she is not, can she still be a "Death Eater" (like does Voldemort mark everyone of is it an honor his servant have to earn?).

And what about the other Death Eater's wives? Are they Death Eater too. Except Bellatrix (crazy), Carrow (not married) and Narcissa (not sure she is), they never mention any other women, are they not member too?


** Malfoy's grandaddy (Abraxas) died of dragonpox I believe. I have a headcanon that he was assassinated on Voldemort's orders after getting skittish with the direction of his Master - he was rumored to be responsible for the resignation of the Muggle-born Minister of Magic Nobby Leach (see Pottermore or the HP wiki for more).

The other old-timers who made up Riddle's original organisation the "Knights of Walpurgis" are not confirmed to be dead or alive by the time of the second war. Personally I've cooked up many a head-canon on their whereabouts.

​

Narcissa is not a marked Death Eater. Her home was being used and her husband was, for a time, a high-profile Death Eater. I imagine she was believed to be trustworthy OR, more likely, Voldemort knew he had the life of her son hanging over her head in case of treachery. Any mention of other women is minimal. The movies show some in key Death Eater meetings, so make of that what you will.

​

The Harry Potter wikia has a fairly comprehensive list combining known Death Eaters from both wars. The main lot that I pulled together in my own research are as follows (apologies in advance for any first names that aren't canon that I may have forgotten to edit out!):

Alecto Carrow, Amycus Carrow, Crabbe Snr, Barty Crouch Jr, Antonin Dolohov, Gibbon, Goyle Snr, Jugson, Bellatrix Lestrange, Rabastan Lestrange, Rodolphus Lestrange, Walden Macnair, Lucius Malfoy, Mulciber Jnr, Nott Snr, Peter Pettigrew, Augustus Rookwood, Thorfinn Rowle, Selwyn, Severus Snape, Travers, Corban Yaxley

​

Then of course you have the few known initiates near the climax of the second war, them being Draco Malfoy, Crabbe n' Goyle.

** Well, reasoning by analogy with similar real-world movements, there'll be a few 'prominents' who - for reasons as individual as they are - are getting on board with the movement in the hope of fortune and glory. They're the funders, the recruiters, the speech-makers, the political influencers, the intellectual theorists.

The bulk of the members, though, will be your blackshirts, brownshirts, jihadis, etc. The profile is remarkably consistent across terrorist groups. Ideal recruiting age is 21-25, economic lower-middle, and not doing too well out of life, possibly due to bad luck but you're better looking for the ones doing poorly as a result of bad choices and laziness. You tell them that the reason for their woes is [insert target out-group here] and they'll absolutely /lap it up/. Give them a chance to "hit back" and the buggers practically indoctrinate themselves.

*** On this point, Harry Potter also has the advantage of the "Dark Art". Since the Dark Art seem to be more intention based than other spells, even a mediocre student can become dangerous.

The best exemple is Crabbe, described as so bad it's a miracle he passes his class (or at least in Harry's opinion, he is not the most neutral opinion in the book), yet become extremely dangerous in the end just because he can use at least 2 of the 3 Unforgivables (Cruciatus and Death Curse) and is able to summon Fiendfyre (but not to Unsummon it though.)

** One way to describe who/what the Death Eaters were/are is as Blood Purist Extremists. As for the oldest generation of them, ie: those that were in Riddle's gang while at Hogwarts, they were originally known as the Knights of Walpurgis (an obvious nod to Walpurgis' Night) and then at an as-yet unnamed point in time underwent a re-branding to their more well known identity (much like Riddle himself).

It's possible that Draco's grandfather was too sickly to attend the summons at the graveyard, presuming that said grandfather even had the Dark Mark to begin with, as there doesn't seem to be much that indicates who beyond those confirmed within the canon has them. That said, the general consensus is that the Dark Mark is given to those of Voldemort's Inner Circle, or those that have earned his favour.

Finally, there probably are more female Death Eaters than those mentioned in canon, in fact another one is mentioned in the Hogwarts Mystery game in the form of Merula Snyde's mother (along with her father). Before anyone says anything, Merula herself is proving to be a rather interesting character, where despite her holding Blood Purist views she seems to hate Voldemort, likely for him being the reason her parents are in Azkaban.

The latter. Voldemort has a lot of servants, but not all of them are Death Eaters or permitted to have the Dark Mark branded on them; One notable example is Fenrir Greyback; though he is permitted to wear Death Eater robes, and is basically a Death Eater in all the ways that matter, he does not himself have a Dark Mark.
