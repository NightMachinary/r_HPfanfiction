I'm thinking about writing a fic with a female Harry, but I don't want to name her Harriet or something similar. I was thinking of continuing the Evans' family "tradition" and naming her after a flower. Right now, my favorites are Marigold "Goldie" Lily Potter and Camellia "Lia" Lily Potter.

Opinions and/or suggestions?


** I like Camellia "Lia"! Out of flower/plant names, I find Rose and Daisy too cliche, Ivy and Iris are alright but my favourite is Holly - it sounds like Harry but is not awkward like Harriet, is a plant and is a nice name.

*** True. It also gives a name connection to the holly phoenix wand.

** I think Jasmine is one of the classics. Flower name that has James included.

** The one I'd use myself in a fem!Harry fic would be Rose (Lily) Potter. It's rather plain, just like Harry, and continues the flower tradition.

** Judging by the name Lily and James chose, they might prefer names that are classic, simple and traditionally British (correct me if I'm wrong, but it's a really popular name in the UK, isn't it?). So judging from that, names like Phoebe and Charlotte, Victoria or maybe even Claire and Gemma. I personally love Poppy because it balances a lot of the things that make Harry 'Harry' and it's also a flower name.

Petunia makes a direct comment on the name Harry: 'Nasty common name, if you ask me'. So, I like to pick a nasty common name circa 1980, and navigate from there. To me, Lily and James are also dreadfully common and boring names, they're not a Sirius or Remus or Severus. Also, Poppy Potter has an air of faint ridiculousness about it, which I love.

*** I like Poppy too, I was just thinking "will people think she's named after poppy pomfrey?" But I think its pretty. What do you think about Primrose, shortened to Rose or Rosie for a nickname?

** I'm partial to Iris myself, Holly being a close second.

Of your suggestions, I like Camellia, but "Lia" sounds like "Virgillia". Use "Cammy" if you must.

"Goldie" reminds me of a dog. Or Gilgamesh.
