Hear me out. We see Hermione successfully transfigure Ron's facial features in book 7 before they go to rob Gringotts. Iirc his transfigurations wear off when they go through the waterfall. We also have Madam Pomfrey do some kind of charm/transfiguration to make Hermione's teeth smaller. And apparently this was permanent because it never seems to have worn off. Surely someone could make some good money doing tranfigurations for people right?

There's a market for plastic surgery in the muggle world. And with magic, you gotta figure that the body modifications would be more natural looking. And probably less dangerous.

edit: can i just say this sub is really awesome for discussion. if i had posted this on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] it would have gotten like 2 downvotes and maybe 3 comments if i was lucky.


** Well, what makes you think they don't? Like with IRL plastic surgery, there's probably heavy regulation around minors doing it, so we don't hear about it at Hogwarts; and there's some social stigma around it so not everyone does it. But I'm /very willing to believe/ that, for example, Lockhart wasn't altogether born with the good looks we know.

*** i feel like there's only social stigma against it in real life is because that it usually doesn't look as natural or it doesn't come out well. ie for boobs it's sometimes easy to tell when they're fake or as people age their facelifts can look kinda bad. probably in the wizarding world it's much easier to reverse and apply as well as not being able to discern a difference if done by a competent person

I don't know about england, but it's very common in the US for parents to put their kids in braces purely for cosmetic reasons, though I'm sure there's some self-justifying that crooked teeth are more likely to cause problems in the future or something.

My dentist always tried to sell me that straighter teeth were easier to floss and clean and whatnot. Also if they're crooked they're probably only going to get more crooked as you age, which might lead to actual problems, so arguably it's better to head off the possibility.

** One interpretation is that it's just harder to do with magic than you think. i.e. /because/ we see that not all mages have maximum physical attractiveness, we know that it's either something they don't value in their society or something that isn't just snap-of-the-wrist easy to do.

Canonically. all transfigurations are permanent until untransfigured. Ron's in book 7 was only washed away because of the Thief's Downfall.

**** Because the Thief's Downfall is made to unravel those who would assume another form to steal, not to unravel every single cosmetic change a person has. HP magic is mostly conceptual and Of would assume the purpose of an enchanted object would be the use of it. As smaller teeth isn't a tool of thievery, it would survive the trip.

  "Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she *transformed* various aspects of Ron's appearance" (DH, ch 26).
#+end_quote

Word of God says transfiguration is permanent (though I wouldn't put it past her to have accidentally contradicted this somewhere, but that's besides the point) and the book never states that Hermione is using transfiguration in this particular instance. So I think it's safe to assume that she used charms (ie a hair thickening charm, color change charm, etc), which would be why Ron's disguise was washed away but her buck teeth didn't come back :^)

** I think they can and often do, but what wizards consider attractive isn't necessarily what we do. Look how often fashion changes in a century and from country to country and remember wizards have been living apart for ~400 years. Just having clear skin, all your teeth, and decent nutrition is plenty.

I think part of the reason wizards are so over the top is because aesthetic is of greater cultural value than mere sexiness. Especially when sexiness is devalued when anyone can look anyway they want.

** My take is that it's difficult to do, something that a wizard's passive magic ,to give it a name, would fight off against.

Hair an teeth changes seem like a exception since they're not technically alive. Maybe in Hermione's case the nurse just ''cut'' the teeth instead of just shrinking them and that's why they stayed that way.

The whole ''dark wizard with rotten teeth and whatever else'' makes it sound as if the more dark you go with magic the more your body/mind start to deteriorate, it may even be a status symbol between dark aligned wizards (lol)

** My headcanon, at least, is that human transfiguration is very hard, and human transfiguration meant to have enduring beneficial effects like better health or looks is Really Fucking Hard.

​

And the few people who even master transfiguration to such a high degree (such as Dumbledore, McGonagall, Pomfrey, Barty Crouch Jr, Voldemort presumably) will tend to be very studious people who don't care that much about looks (Hermione the daughter of dentists might've been able to pass her teeth as a more serious problem, truthfully or otherwise).
