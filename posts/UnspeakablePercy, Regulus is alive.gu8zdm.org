:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Spoilers ahead obviously. I think it's an unfinished fic on ao3, but I've read so much stuff over quarantine that I honestly do not trust my own memory. I can remember quite clearly that Percy becomes an Unspeakable after he graduates, and I'm pretty sure he was sorted into Ravenclaw too. Regulus is alive, and one of the last chapters i remember is him, Sirius, Remus, and maybe others trying to trap Voldie in the Department of Mysteries with some kind of runic set up, but it gets messed up last minute. Would appreciate any help!

*** Oh my god it is!! Thank you so much! I was going spare not being able to find this fic again, and of course I forgot the crucial plot of it being a time travel fic.

**** To be fair, there was a long part in the middle where I wondered if the author had forgotten it was supposed to be a time-travel fic... that plot seemed to fall off the edge for a good portion of the story, before being suddenly brought back towards the end.
