LF fics where I can find very-very sweet and warm relationships between them, where I can feel them being a real family.

I'd prefer some canon (i mean Sirius was in Azkaban for 12 or about that years, so Harry was with the Dursleys). Though if you know really good non-canon ones (where he adopts Harry after 81's Halloween)

I would really love to read where Sirius escapes from Azkaban, steals Harry and they hide to live together. Do you know any?

Boom. Sirius escapes Azkaban, takes Harry with him, begins to attempt to prove Sirius' innocence. There's 3 full books and a prequel book that ties in with it. Semi Regularly updated, follows similar major plot lines as the books, and honestly is as equally enjoyable as the actual books from JK. Can't recommend it enough!

**** Not sure, I've always found FF.net a less than user friendly site. I just like this one better, the search engine is cool and can be very specific.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** In linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming by FarenMaddox) (I linked the first part of a trilogy), Sirius escapes from Azkaban, steals Harry and they hide to live together. :) But he spends less time in Azbakan, he escapes when Harry is 8 years old.

It also has great world-building outside of the wizarding Britain, and a lot of well-developed OCs.

In my view, the first part and the (very-very-very long) epilogue to the third part are the best, with the second part being a little bit "meh".

  When Sirius Black escapes Azkaban and 8-year-old Harry Potter disappears, the world is thrown into upheaval. What will Britain and Harry be without each other, and who will face the Dark? You only THINK you've read this before. I guarantee you haven't.

** Linkffn(to reach without)

May not be your cup of tea if you aren't interested in reading about a Harry that becomes a girl after some accidental magic and how he deals with it. Also imo Harry's girl name is really stupid but if you can look past that it has a nice relationship between harry and Sirius. Girl Harry doesn't immediately come out to the world as being Harry Potter so she is adopted by Sirius under the guise of being a distant Black relative who's parents recently died. Gradually we learn about a relationship between Sirius and lily prior to lily and James so there's a nice surrogate dad/child bond thing. Also Harry doesn't all of a sudden start liking guys so we get a cute budding relationship between him/her and Susan.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
