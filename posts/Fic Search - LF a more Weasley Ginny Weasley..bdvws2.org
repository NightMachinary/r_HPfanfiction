To explain this, has anyone explored the idea of changing Ginny Weasley's appearance to be more like her father's instead of being a body clone of her mother ? With like Arthur, I mean tall, lanky, with large(relatively) hands and feet, and those Weasley blue eyes Bill, Charlie, Percy and Ron sport.

If so, please do link. Preferably with Harry/Ginny pairing.

Aside from this, I am myself experimenting with a changed Ginny name. Guinevere Cedrella Weasley, to be closer to the Arthurian theme of the other names of the Weasley clan, and to honour Arthur's grandmother.


** Ginevra is Guinevere.

*** Yeah, but why go for the Italian variation when you can just outright use Guinevere. It would not be an overly strange name for the wizarding world.

**** Dude you're asking for fics where Ginny has large hands. Let's not talk about what's strange.
