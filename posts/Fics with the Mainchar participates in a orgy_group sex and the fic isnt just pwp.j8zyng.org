  Dumbledore tells Harry everything after the third task and Hermione is determined to help Harry tackle it all. She finds a unique solution that will change their lives forever. She will awaken forbidden magic and great power that will shake the magical world and will definitely offer power that he knows not. The rating is for a reason.

** The Triplicity series from idleside on AO3 is really good. It's about a threesome relationship between Harry, Pansy, and Daphne and before you stop reading this post altogether, you should give it a shot. It's an AU post-Hogwarts but has an actual overarching plot going on. It's also not fluff and brings up some serious issues between a threesome relationship actually working out. It doesn't just become a perfect romance and all the characters are well-written with actual strength, fears, and development. So it's pretty engaging.
