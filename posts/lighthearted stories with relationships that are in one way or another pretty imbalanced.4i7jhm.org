In most fics with romances the relationships are well balanced, both partners have a similar level of attraction to each other.

But I want to read aomething different for a change.

Harry bullies the friendless Hermione into becoming his girlfriend. Hermione makes Harry take her to the yule ball because she hates everyone else. Luna goes full yandere on Neville and makes every girl who comes to close to him fall down the moveable stairs. Harry decides that overdosing yourself with an open ended love-potion is a perfectly gryffindor thing to do. Ginny physically travels back in time to fulfill her lifelong dream of becoming a professor at hogwarts and starting a romantic relationship with her student harry potter, etc. Etc.

I can already picture cougar Ginny seducing a stuttering, blushing, virgin Harry.

I'd read it.

** Only one that comes to mind is linkffn(8618289) since Tom bullies a lost in time and very confused Hermione into a relationship with him. Not quite lighthearted, but not super dark or anything.

Of course, Seventh Horcrux linkffn(10677106) actually works well for this as well. Lighthearted and Harry is mostly rude to Ginny for the entirety of the story.

  COMPLETE: A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it-smashing it-nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century. This should not have happened. HG/TR.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
