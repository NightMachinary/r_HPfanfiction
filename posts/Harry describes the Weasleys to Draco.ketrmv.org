I'm looking for a one-shot where Draco approaches the trio in the great hall and starts to insult Ron. Harry is baffled as to why he would provoke such a family and breaks down the Weasley skillset. It isn't overly long, I read it recently and can't seem to find it. Does it ring any bells for anyone? thanks!


** That sounds like a time-travel fic I read where Harry stands up to Malfoy for the Weasley family on the train like just right after meeting Ron, and Ron is very confused how Harry knows so much about his family. He goes on a rant about how great each member of the Weasley family is. I don't remember the title, though.
