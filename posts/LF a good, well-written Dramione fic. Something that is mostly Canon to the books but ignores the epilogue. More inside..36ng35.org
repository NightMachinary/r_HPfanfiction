#+TITLE: LF a good, well-written Dramione fic. Something that is mostly Canon to the books but ignores the epilogue. More inside.

I know I'll probably catch some flack for it, but I have always enjoyed Dramione but the fics I have seen of late or all cheesy, trite, and Mary Sue/Gary Stu-ish. I want a good story, good writing, and good Dramione.


** I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]]. It's a great read. I loved Silencio as well (the Bracelet, not so much. It was way too angsty for my tastes). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6725154/1/I-Spy][I Spy]] was good also.

*** EDIT: just kidding me. I found it! Thank you!

What site is it on? I looked it up on fanfiction.net but only found people referencing it. What's the best place to look?

** This is the only Dramione fic I've read, but I really liked it. It's an after the war fic where everything is cannon except the epilogue. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395687/1/It-s-All-Uncharted][It's All Uncharted]]
