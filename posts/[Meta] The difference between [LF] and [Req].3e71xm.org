[LF] = Looking for

This is for finding a specific fic that you know general details about but cannot find because the Fanfiction search system sucks. You are hoping that someone would recognize the *specific fanfic* you were trying to find and have a link.\\

--------------

[Req] = Request

This is for finding many fics of a specific type/genre/character/trope/pairing. You have heard of or just read a fanfic of this type and are looking for *recommendations* from the community. Your request should be very generalized.\\

^{Please correct me if I'm wrong, this is just what I always assumed.}


** I agree that this would be the preferred arrangement, but I also despise when an insular community makes rules too stringent for the average new visitor to abide by. In most cases the insular community would jump up and down on their heads about 'read the FAQ you fuq!' but the faux pas is usually a matter of legitimate English words taking on too specific a meaning amongst the gang members.

tl;dr- make this a suggestion, because people are people.

*** I agree. The distinction is also only useful if it's enforced and I'm not interested in doing that.

*** I agree. I just sometimes get [[http://mylolface.com/assets/faces/angry-y-u-no.jpg][annoyed]] when I click a request for something interesting, and it is completely /not/ what I wanted.

But again, such is reddit and such is life.

** As far as the sub-Reddit's tags are concerned, they're all requests.

** I know that's how people use it, but I would tend to understand it exactly the other way around. "Looking for Hermione/Harry with God-like Harry and fortuneteller Luna" sounds natural if you expand "LF" into the words "looking for". While "Requesting if anyone can find that one fic with the squid and the Greenday concert where Harry is a girl and Draco falls in love with a centaur that I read once" also sounds right, to me. But if you reverse them, they sound strange.

** Ever since I came here I've been seeing pretty much the opposite.
