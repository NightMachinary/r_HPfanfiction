It's a bit of a guilty pleasure, but I really enjoy stories where people are shocked/horrified when they discover the lengths Harry is willing to go to achieve his goal. I'd prefer it Harry isn't totally evil, but employs dark magic to achieve his goals. For example, I enjoyed the scenes in the Denarian series where Harry's ruthlessness is revealed.


** "Returning to the Start" might fit your bill.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

** linkffn(the Art of Self-Fashioning by Lomonaaeren) - one of my newest favorites, Harry isn't the BWL but his parents are tortured into insanity like the Longbottoms in canon. He's fairly close to sociopathic due to extreme Dursley upbringing when he discovers this, so he fanatically takes on the quest of restoring them using Transfiguration.

  When a man is pushed to the end of his tether, be prepared for violent retribution. The magical world had better prepare itself for the turning of the tide. If the magical government cannot be trusted to protect its people, then Harry Potter will just have to do it himself. Trigger Warning: Graphic depictions of violence.
