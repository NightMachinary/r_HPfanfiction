I know for certain that he had a /bad/ home life, but that doesn't automatically translates to /abuse/.

I know his dad wasn't the best of fathers. I know his parents marriage was strained to say the least, and that might have mostly to do with his mother being a witch.

But was there any indication that Snape's dad was abusive? I'm not really sure here.

I'm curious because so many fics uses this for Snape and Harry to bond over or to excuse Snape's crappy behaviour, when I'm not even fully certain if Snape getting abused by his father is even canon.


** Tbh we know so little about snape. It's on purpose, really, and in this regard the books are written like a mystery novel - who he was, and what motivated him had to be a secret revealed at the end in order to have the impact it did. JKR has spoken a few times in interviews on this.

So there's lots of gaps in Snapes character that fandom has filled.

We know for sure his mum got yelled at by his dad, that she cowered and snape cowered from it too. We know his summers were spent bored at home killing flies on the ceiling like Harry. We know that he wore his mums clothes, common at the time for families of poverty. And there are a few indicators of poverty in his family home, if you're aware of mill towns in that time era in the UK.

Pottermore also indicated that snape got the belt from his dad. Where or not you consider this a valid source is up to you.

Speaking frankly, the canon is so large in its gaps of snape that fandom has come up with things that are so commonly held it can be hard to track what is and isn't canon. But we know so little. We have no idea even about what his wand was, and he is one of the few characters that we don't know this basic fact. The fics you talk about are heavily anchored in fanon expansion of snape as a character. If you don't enjoy snape as a character, as a lot of people don't, they won't be your cup of tea.

**** Sorry! It's being whipped, not belted. Full quote from potter more, and I don't think it's up anymore:

His first name, Severus, has its roots in Latin, directly translating to mean ‘stern' or ‘harsh'. This was exactly the front that Snape put on as he swept down hallways like a bat and berated Harry for every wrong: a stern and harsh façade to hide what lay beneath. It was also an accurate description of the desperately lonely and unhappy childhood he had with a harsh father who didn't hold back when it came to the whip.”

***** Yeah I see what you mean - definitely down to interpretation. Given the era he grew up in, I think the vast majority of kids were beaten on occasion, it was completely normal, but similarly it could also just be read as his father being very stern.

I think he probably was, but it wouldn't have been regarded as abuse - he and Lily probably just thought of it as vaguely bad.

****** Yeah. I choose to interpret it in the social context at the time. Mill towns were pretty destitute when Snape would have been growing up in them, and I feel like the few scenes we get are heavily coded for domestic abuse, poverty and unfortunately family violence.

The problem I sometimes have with fan content is that people take this to an extreme like extreme physical abuse, sexual abuse, etc etc. To be honest, a verbally violent home in poverty with belting or whippings - while normalised in many households before domestic violence advocacy became more normal in the 80s and 90s in the UK - is already pretty extreme. People come away from households like that very bitter, emotionally damaged, and kind of like Snape. We remove children from those homes now. It's very bad, even without the gratuitous violence piled on by some Fanfics. JKR has her own experiences with domestic violence, and I felt that her coded depiction is convincing and nuanced. From our modern perspective we can kind of understand the implications of that environment.

We also have to bear in mind that domestic violence has meant different things over different times. Snapes household probably was just seen as distastefully bad, but not call the police bad for that era. Back then you had to really batter your wife around before the boys in blue got called.

******* Completely agree! I think we see similar nuance with Harry, who grew up in the era where there was increasing recognition of domestic abuse but still wasn't looked upon with the modern perspective we see so many writers view it through.

Still better than not knowing how Hermione's parents are named.

** I think so, though like with all abuse, fanon dials it up to 100. I think Rowling clearly enough insinuated his father was a wife beater, and also an abusive drunk father. This isn't particularly surprising as most of the father/husband figures in HP and all of J.K Rowling's books are awful abusive men. Given her own biography, father and first husband, this is understandable.

Was his dad the cartoonish figure of fanon?I highly doubt it, As someone with a drunk father who would terrorize me occasionally, but was overall nice and loving, I can only interject my own experience. I'm not even comfortable considering my experiences abuse even though logically I understand it fits the definition. Real life has layers of nuance that fiction, and more so fanfiction, often lack.
