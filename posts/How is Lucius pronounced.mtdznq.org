I have seen different pronouncations of it, and I was curious. I have always prouncounced it "Loo-see-us" and I think they pronounce it like that in the movies? (Idk i havn't watched to movies in a long time) but I have heard some people proununce it "Loo-shus" and it is mispelled as "luscious" alot in fics since it is prounced similar


** Baby name sites say it is pronounced Lou-see-us - think of Lucien and pronounce it the same - though I saw a site that said many Harry Potter fans incorrectly say “Loo-Shus”! Lol! I don't think the original Latin is relevant to today's pronunciation - we do have a soft c, and in most modern Romance languages, and in English, a “c” followed by an “i” or an “e” is soft.

*** Also, the rest of the faux-Latin in HP is so terrible that the pronunciation of that name is in the noise. :-D

**** I just thought it was pretty humorous that some random baby name site was referring to how Harry Potter fans pronounce it! And as an illustration of incorrect pronunciation! It is a little weird, since it was pronounced correctly in the movie. But yeah, given the word and name bastardization in canon, Luscious Lucius is a pretty minor point!

** In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius][original Latin]], it is pronounced "Lukius", as "C" is always pronounced as "K" in Latin.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla][Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] was a Roman dictator who had massacred many of his political enemies. JKR must hate this guy since she turned both Lucius and Cornelius into her villains.

"Lucas" and "Luke" are also derived from Lucius. So yes, you can actually call him Lucius Skywalker.

**** Sulla was a leader of the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates][Optimates]] in the Roman Senate, who were somewhat like the Purebloods in the Wizengamot.

***** And Gaius Marius was a power hungry and tyrannical politician/general, who worked under the guise of being progressive. Say what you will about Sulla and his executions, but he got the idea from Marius' slaughter of all his allies in Rome without a trial before that.

Both were great men. Not good men, but great men nonetheless.

** I feel so stupid that I can't even describe how I pronounce it xD. I mean, here I'm with czech language that pronounces letters as they are written... I'm not even kidding when I say that I don't know how to explain it even through I live with this language for almost 20 years now. But if you want to hear it then listen to it with google translator (it does a good job).

But if I should describe pronunciation of Lucian's name to the best of my abilities then it would be like this:

Lucius -> Lu-ci-us

Yeah.... Doesn't tell a shit about it.

*** I'm honestly not trying to be snide here, but does the Czech language really pronounce letters as they are written? So the word "Czech" is not pronounced "check" like I've always heard, but rather "K-Zech", rhyming with "fetch"?

**** No no no that's not it. What I meant only applies to its own words. Czech is normally pronounced “check” as you said. But like I said, I don't know how to explain it because I have never really cared, you know?

But for a explanation:

Czech language means Český jazyk. And now imagine a pronunciation of individual letters and that's how you read it - you just bump them all together into a word. But, of course, if you try to pronounce it with English pronunciation then it's not gonna do the job.

But the easiest explain would be a word is. Don't read it as you normally do but try to pronounce i and s individually. That's pretty much how it works.

** I prounounce it "loo-shus". Luscious I pronounce "lush-us". The sound "loo-see-us" I would probably spell "Lucyus"
