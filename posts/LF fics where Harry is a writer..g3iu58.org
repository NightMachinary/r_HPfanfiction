Whether for a newspaper (e.g. Poison Pen, my favorite fic ever. Damn, that one's good.) or novelist or maybe writes school books. I need some relatability in that facet.

Its a story where Harry got tired of being an auror and decided to become a writer. The story focuses on his and Hermione's family life. Later on Harry's daughter becomes a writer herself.

Not even the times I was called a honky or a fag-hag. No, I'm not from the city, and yes I'm friends with a few homosexual people, but I mostly pity the people who think those are bad things. Once I was trying to help a girl in ASD with her English homework and made a joke apologizing that I couldn't help her more, English is my second language, my primary is canine. Another student blurted out, "does that mean you're a bitch?" I tried not to laugh, I really did. His face was priceless when he realized who he was talking to. He obviously expected to get another detention for that.

*** Now that I have read it, I want to give my comments on The Archeologist.

While fem!Harry writes a book, more emphasis is put on the adventuring part (think Indiana Jones) - so you can probably guess by that Harry is a Curse Breaker (which needs more love in HP fandom, because - hello! - magic Indiana Jones!). The author tends to skip times a bit oddly and at least I never got used to it (a paragraph can be quite a time difference), and the moment there is more combat-action, the author usually justs skips to the conclusion.\\
While it was pretty nice, I found it frustrating that author at times used shortcuts instead of just describing everything. So - 7/10 for me. It was good, but won't be reading again anytime soon.
