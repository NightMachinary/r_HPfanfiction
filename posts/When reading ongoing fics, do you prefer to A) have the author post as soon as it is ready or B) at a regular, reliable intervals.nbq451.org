Option A means you get some chapters sooner but have longer waits until the next at times.

Option B means you always wait the same amount of time. For instance, new chapter every Friday.


** Neither. Whatever works best for the writer works for me. I can wait if need be, and I rarely remember update schedules...

** I prefer an update schedule. I'm not going to remember to go to my (non-work) email everyday, but if someone always posts on Saturday I'll remember that.

** It depends on the story in a lot of ways. For linkffn(New Blood) positing mini-chapters twice a week, I feel like I can actually keep up with it as it updates and I like the schedule. For linkffn(Grow young with me) which puts out far larger chapters less frequently, I'm happy to reread the entire fic every time it updates so I get the full effect

#+begin_quote
  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** This wouldn't be such a problem if Grow Young with Me was getting updated more than twice a year. I know the author writes other stuff, just wish she would focus on her main story instead.

** C ... write it first, rewrite it eight times (what Michael Crichton said), and only THEN publish however you want.

That Crichton's quotation in full:

#+begin_quote
  Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.

*** This is an understated truth. Most writers do not crank out flawless first drafts, or even first drafts that make sense. Writing is re-writing. And it gets better with each pass. Some writers only need one extra pass. Some need ten.

I post whenever it is ready, but ready tends to vary by chapter, so I am all for option A.
