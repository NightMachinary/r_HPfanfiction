Let me clarify one thing: I don't particularly like /Harry Potter and the Cursed Child/, though I certainly don't hate it as much as some people. I'm not asking you to like it, or even to consider it canon (whether it's canon is an entirely different matter). But every time /Cursed Child/ comes up around here or on [[/r/harrypotter]], there's always someone who comes and calls it a "cheap fanfic" or some variation thereof.

And it's... /not/ a fanfiction. Calling it fanfiction seems to be missing the point... and believe it or not, sullying /fanfiction/'s good name.

Let me explain.

"Fanfiction" has the word "fan" right there in it. It is defined, to me, as non-profit writing created by fans of an original work, just because they /want/ to see their idea of a story with those characters they love realized. /Cursed Child/ is nothing like that: it's clear that Rowling decided to do a play, wrote up a summary, and then she /hired/ Tiffany and Thorne to help her clean it up. They obviously don't hate it, but I'm not even sure either of those two are "fans" of HP to a meaningful degree, and I'd wager they did this more for the big money in it than out of a genuine desire to write that play.

/Cursed Child/ isn't any more fanfiction than you would call an /Expanded Star Wars Universe/ or /Expanted Whoverse/ novel a fanfiction. It was written at the original author's request by a writer who's likely doing it for the money more than anything else, and thus is simply not fanfiction.

Hate /Cursed Child/ all you want (although please keep it mind it's a personal opinion, not a fact everyone agrees with). Bash it, insult it, burn copies for all I care (for the purpose of this rant). But /don't/ call it a fanfiction.

Thank you.


** Wait, is this literally a rant about you not understanding the rhetoric device of hyperbole?

Wow.

To clarify: When someone says "This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard", there's a high likelihood that they actually heard a dumber thing before. They are using this sentence as a rhetoric device to explain how dumb this thing is they just heard.

I'm sure that 99.9% percent who say that Cursed Child is "bad fanfiction" are quite aware that it is not actually fanfiction.

Edit: I just thought of a better example. Have you ever heard the sentence: "I love The Matrix. Such a great movie. It's a shame that they never made any sequels." - What you are doing right now is like trying to explain to this person that there actually are sequels and that they are mistaken.

*** I quite understand what hyperbole is thank you very much, but I don't think everyone who says CC is "fanfiction" are actually using a hyperbole. A lot of people (more on [[/r/harrypotter]] than this sub, I'll admit) consider it fanfiction for not being by J.K. Rowling, and from arguing with them repeatedly I can tell you they did /not/ meant that as just a figure of speech, but were utterly convinced it had no more weight or officiality than fanfiction --- that it was just "endorsed fanfiction".

**** u/Deathcrow:
#+begin_quote
  [[/r/harrypotter]]
#+end_quote

Ahh there's your problem then. That sub is trash. I'm surprised that they reject CC since they seem to swallow everything else but okay.

#+begin_quote
  endorsed fanfiction
#+end_quote

Still sounds like more of an insult to me. It's just a way to attack it's legitimacy: "Not written by JKR" (and everyone knows fanfiction is *bad* therefore CC child is bad)

There's plenty of situations where people reject canon or extensions of canon and treat it as fanfiction in other fandoms too.

Btw: Large swaths of Pottermore are just bad fanfiction too. Maybe some day everyone will get to my level of grump.

***** Oh yes, there are a /lot/ of people on [[/r/harrypotter]] who are "book-purists", refusing to acknowledge anything else than the original seven novels (be it /Cursed Child/, /Pottermore/, interviews, film-based or game-based factoids, or in some cases even /Fantastic Beasts/).

****** That's me haha. I respect head canon on fan fics but JKR shouldn't get to fetch n her work without actually writing a book about them. You forget that the tales of beedle bard and Fant. Beasts. Are canon too.

**** Don't worry I'm sure he can take a bit of dry wit.

If he's upset I will of course offer to apologize, because I have no issues with him.

** No one thinks /Cursed Child/ is literally fanfiction. It's meant as an insult. So this plea isn't going to get anyone to stop.

** It's actually worse: it pretends to be a good product, but its quality is only that of a mediocre fanfiction, and it tries to cheat you of real money.

** I find 'Cursed Child is fanfiction' to be deeply insulting to fanfiction.

I get better quality product from people who care about the canon more (though their interpretations may vary) and I don't have to pay for it. Also, nobody is going to claim that I can't understand it unless I pay /more/ money to see it performed.

Thanks but if I'm going to pay extortionate prices to go see a theatre show, it's going to be Hamilton again. That at least lived up to hype.

** I agree with you quite a lot. I don't think CC is fanfiction. I think it's a mockery of fanfiction and of fanfiction readers and writers. I don't believe Tiffany and Thorne are fans in any meaningful sense and I think the utter disposable careless awfulness of it shows absolute contempt for HP fans. I understand it being called fanfiction as an insult by people who have no love for fanfiction, but by people on this sub? Yes, that disappoints me.

I didn't care for it myself.

*** Because most fanfiction is bad, poorly written and just not fun to read. FF alone has 700K+ HP fanfics, it's not an insult to fanfic writers suggest most of that 3/4 of a million uploads are not good.

** This just misses the point, seemingly intentionally so. No one says it's literally fanfiction, but that the quality (or lack thereof) validates it being called fanfiction of the poor sort.

** Achille yes I agree! I have not read Cursed Child yet but if JK Rowling did publish it then yes it is a real story! Just because people do not like it does not mean they can pretend it is not real. :( Because yes that is trying to argue against facts of reality. :(
