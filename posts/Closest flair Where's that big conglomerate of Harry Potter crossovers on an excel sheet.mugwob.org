Just as the title says, I remember someone posting an excel doc with a whole bunch of crossovers on it, and I can't find it.


** Closest I can find is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/iuxdcd/back_at_it_again_with_the_fanfiction_google_doc/][the doc (not sheet) linked here]] or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dmob0h/in_honor_of_this_subreddits_cakeday_i_give_you_my/][this spreadsheet]]. There's also [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vq3zpeZRbdY3pF-m8-bEbUBH_F8rN8mGSFKEXvGqftc/edit#gid=0][this one from the sub's wiki.]]
