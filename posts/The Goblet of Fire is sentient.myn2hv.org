The Goblet was made first by the magical Greeks to overview and handle the first ancient Olympics and has been used since then for every major magical tournament. Every time the goblet has been used it's soaked up more and more magic and has become powerful enough that it is now in a sense mildly sentient. It's only objective is to make whatever challenge it is presiding over entertaining, awe inspiring and fairly bloodsport like.

If no satisfactory champions enter themselves or are given for entry the Goblet will choose the best champions regardless of what the age of the champion is, no matter whether they are consenting or if they are even aware of the existence of whichever tournament the goblet is presiding over.

If the challenges which are made by the people handling the tournament aren't daring or dangerous enough by the Goblets standards, the Goblet will not allow any of the challenges to proceed until a suitably fatal and dangerous challenge has been made.

When the triwizard tournament happens at Hogwarts the Goblet chooses the three most magically powerful, skilled and cunning sorcerers that it can sense to compete because three school children who haven't finished their education yet isn't very entertaining according to the Goblet, considering it used to oversee magical gladiatorial matches in Ancient Rome it might have a point.


** And so out of the cup comes Albus Yadda Yadda Dumbledore, Filius Flitwick, and Minerva McGonagall.

**** ROFL. Drop Minerva then. She's badass, but Filius was a master duelist. (I looked it up to be sure as I wasn't sure if I was recalling fanon. :)
