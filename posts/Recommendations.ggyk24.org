Hi, can i get recommendations for HP fanfic where Harry's parents live?


** There's ‘Consuming Shadows' by Child_OTKW where Lily lives, and they move to France, where Harry goes to Beauxbatons. It's a Tomarry/Harrymort, and a really good read. Link: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12228520/1/Consuming-Shadows]]

There's also ‘Let's Try Again' by DayDreamer315 where Lily and James live, but James and Severus are Harry's parents. It's a James/Severus, Sirius/Remus, Fred/Harry/George and a time travel/fix it fanfic. Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14469255/chapters/33426591]]
