Just something I inexplicably find myself wondering; if Tom Riddle wanted to completely separate himself from his family and upbringing, why did he anagram his muggle name, as opposed to discarding it and creating a new name entirely?


** He was a histrionic little shit of a teenager with an innate personality disorder and a really, really bad case of magic-induced loss of common sense. Come later life, when he's stuck with it, he looks back on his juvenile anagramming and cringes, which is why he tries to get everyone too terrified to say it out loud.

** On a related note...When translated into languages other than English, the name Tom Marvolo Riddle often had to be changed, so that when the character said "I am Lord Voldemort" in their native tongue, the anagram still worked. [[https://www.google.com.au/amp/www.indy100.com/article/lord-voldemort-10-languages-harry-potter-warner-brothers-translations-7815376%3famp][Check it out]]

Edit: for those who can't be bothered with the link:

Turkish: Tom Marvoldo Riddle (‚ÄúAdƒ±m Lord Voldemort‚Äù)

German: Tom Vorlost Riddle (‚ÄúIst Lord Voldemort‚Äù)

Spanish: Tom Sorvolo Ryddle (‚ÄúSoy Lord Voldemort‚Äù)

Finnish: Tom Lomen Valedro (‚Äúma olen Voldemort‚Äù)

Greek: ŒÜŒΩœÑŒøŒΩ ŒúœåœÅŒ≤ŒøŒª ŒßŒµœÅœÑ (Anton Morvol Chert) becomes ŒÜœÅœáœâŒΩ ŒíœåŒªŒΩœÑŒµŒºŒøœÅœÑ (‚ÄúArchon Voldemort‚Äù)

The Greek translation is interesting in part because it's one of the few translations that tried to keep ‚ÄúMarvolo‚Äù while simultaneously not bothering to keep ‚ÄúTom‚Äù . . . or to make it a proper anagram, for that matter. (There's an extra omega that the translators hope you won't notice.)

Not to be outdone, the Slovenian version takes He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and renames him completely:

***** Idk if anyone actually needs this, but to explain the joke:

I think gigadweeb is referring to how "soy lord voldemort" sounds like he's the lord of soy boys.

Basically, soybeans have isoflavones, which are phytoestrogens that weakly mimic the effect of female hormones. Some people latched on to this idea, saying guys who consume a lot of soy have low testosterone and look/act more feminine. This turned into a meme, and the alt-right started using "soy boy" as an insult, like cuck, for men who are weak/girly/soft, especially feminists.

To an edgy right-wing teenager, the Dark Lord Voldemort being not just a soy boy, but the *Soy Lord* would be pretty amusing. Honestly, it made me laugh, even though I disagree with the insult on principle (not only does it go hand in hand with toxic masculinity and bullshit gender stereotypes, it's completely ignorant; soy doesn't actually lower testosterone levels or have any physically emasculating effects at all).

... but you gotta love the mental image of an effeminate, docile He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named standing in a Starbucks drinking some fancy soy latte. It's surreal. I also like the idea of sixteen-year-old Tom intentionally making "soy lord" part of the anagram, lol

** I like to think that he came up with it while bored at Hogwarts, and thought the meaning was super deep and cool. When he first started the Knights of Walpurgis, he insisted they all call him Voldemort, even though they all thought it was kinda dumb.

When he became more well known, he realised that he sounded like a huge dork, changed the name of his followers to Death Eaters, put a taboo on his name, and ordered his followers to refer to him as "My lord". But by that point, it was too late to change his name, as everyone already knew him as Voldemort.

To reject the name his mother gave him would reject her and therefore the legacy he inherited from her, which is something that makes him special. He can't do that, but he also can't bear to use his muggle father's name. So he charts a middle course and uses an anagram.

We may as well ask why he used the cave to hide a horcrux. There have to be other places more secret and secure in Britain (the Chamber of Secrets comes to mind), but he can't let go of his past, and he can't imagine that anyone else would be clever enough to connect his dots.

** Because Tom Riddle isn't capable (in a literary sense) of creating anything powerful on his own; he can only corrupt what already existed.

Snape invented spells. Dumbledore invented the pensieve and the deluminator. But we never hear about anything Voldemort created. He plunged the depths of Hogwarts for its secrets, but those secrets were already there. He took powerful/historical magical objects and turned them into horcruxes.

It's a fundamental part of his character. He believes that all history was simply a build-up to his own rise to power. If that's true, then all of the symbols of Voldemort's power have to tie back to the past, and that includes his common muggle name.

-To everyone their own priority. Most Dark lords want power and domination, I want knowledge and good study habits. It doesn't seem less respectable to me..."

Yeah ok, the idea is funny. Makes me wonder what a typical Hufflepuff Dark Lord would be like... "I'm going to kill you all until you learn to cooperate" or something along these lines, perhaps?

****** I've always thought the 'Hufflepuff gone horribly wrong' is totalitarian conformity or evil bureaucracy - think Soviet Russia or The Dark Pink Lady of Cats.

The funny version... I'm thinking of that episode of the Fairly Odd Parents, where Timmy's dad never got the trophy, and everyone is happy.. Or Else!

It makes sense. Hufflepuff has communist values in a way.

I don't know Fairly Odd Parents.

****** Well, I don't know about a dark /lord/ from Hufflepuff, but it would be something along the lines of a totalitarian regime where loyalty and being a good person gets you a good living and being a negative element gets you death in agony.

I mean, if they don't want to cooperate, fine, let them be, they'll be jealous of what the ones that do cooperate end up having. But try to make things worse for others, be malicious in your actions, and you'll be used as an example. For the good of the community.

****** Hey, AnIndividualist, just a quick heads-up:\\
*acheive* is actually spelled *achieve*. You can remember it by *i before e*.\\
Have a nice day!
