I've had an idea in this regard for a long while now that I can't put out of my head and just keeps scratching and scraping at me to write it down. It wouldn't be my first fic in general, just the first one for this fandom and I just don't know if I should bother because the fandom feels toxic as frak.

Some details of what direction I'm trying to go:

- Harry's name is not changed because it's a plot point that she's got a gender-mismatched first name. Until she shows up in Hogwarts, the magical world doesn't even know she's female, with the possible and probable exception of Dumbledore.
- The prophecy is unchanged and the fact that it refers to a *HE* as Voldemort's nemesis while Harry is a *SHE* is a major plot point: the Potters hid their child's gender to use themselves as bait for Voldemort in order to lure him away from the Longbottoms, which worked.
- Harry's incidents with accidental magic at young age ended up poisoning Vernon's and Petunia's marriage, ultimately resulting in a divorce over Petunia refusing to cut Harry loose out of fear of Dumbledore. Harry and Dudley still live with Petunia, but no longer in Little Whinging. Petunia isn't abusive of Harry (Dumbledore let Petunia know that doing so would be /very unwise/), just bitter and apathetic, and she also has a bit of an alcohol problem.
- As a consequence of her background, Harry is initially highly skeptical about the whole Hogwarts thing, suspecting it to be a big prank at her expense, until she manages to repeatedly cast magic outside supervision and realizes that 1) this is no prank and 2) magic is */awesome/*. She's got above average smarts, but not Hermione-level; if anything, her academic performance is held back primarily by the fact that she's unmotivated to perform beyond minimum requirements, reading and experimenting purely out of boredom (and this time around, she's actually good enough in Potions for Snape to bluntly declare her work "/acceptable/" and move on, rather than insulting her).
- And that is where her primary personality trait comes in. What she sees in the Mirror of Erised is just herself chilling out in peace, unbothered by anyone and free to do whatever she wants. She's one hell of a flier but /really/ doesn't want to play quidditch where others can see because she's got major performance anxiety. Her Sorting is difficult not because she can fit into multiple Houses, but because she's equally unsuited to all of them: she's borderline lazy, she's got zero ambition, she doesn't care about knowledge for knowledge's sake and her first reaction to bad stuff happening to someone else is "not my problem" (though she still comes running if the situation is /really bad/ and her conscience isn't letting her stay uninvolved; basically, her altruism is initially overpowered by her not wanting to be the center of attention for any reason).
- Harry is not gonna be OP. Nor is she going into politics; in fact, she avoids it like the plague and has no inherited obligations in that regard (the most she'd get is observer status without voting rights). As I said in the title, shipping is not the focus of the story and the primary pairing most likely won't be a factor until year 5 at the earliest.
- I'm also very explicitly not bashing /anyone/. Not Ron (he'll be mostly out of focus), not Dumbledore (he's very much a positive character, just tired and wanting to get the whole Voldemort business over with so that he can finally retire and spend his twilight years in peace), /no one/.

One major deviation that will definitely happen is that Harry declines to participate in the Triwizard Tournament (Dumbledore doesn't even say her name out loud in front of everyone, he just lets the feast proceed and privately summons her afterwards) and there are no consequences to her refusal. Other than the plot to get her into the cemetery requiring an alternative way, which drives things off the rails to the point where Voldemort is accidentally resurrected with Neville's blood instead of Harry's (unintentionally fulfilling the "mark him as equal" condition) and Harry fatally bashes Pettigrew's skull in with a rock, leaving Voldemort and Harry unable to directly hurt each other.

** I don't know about the fandom as a whole, but I'm personally quite receptive to the idea. I just made a request post about a week ago for fics with female leads that aren't romance-heavy, which is honestly a depressing rarity in fanfiction.

I will also add in the obligatory note to not worry so much about what the fandom wants and just write what you want to write. And an added note that even if the fandom is not receptive to the concept (though I don't think this would be the case), I think that female protagonist fics that aren't them being shipped with every other male character is sorely needed.

To sum it up, go for it, and if/when you post it, please let me know so I can read it!

** First, some advice: you should write fanfiction to have fun with it, not to have a good reception in the fandom. There will always be people who dislike what you do, but if /you/ like what you do, like-minded people will like it too! Now, AO3 is better at filtering out the haters (because there /are/ people who look at a summary written *FEM!HARRY* and still comment "Harry is a girl???? Why didn't you say so?? This sucks!!!"), if you want to moderate or not have comments, and it's easier for people to find your story by tags, BUT ff.net seems to have a bigger part of the fandom reading and writing gen (non-shipping) fics, and you should know that [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] is just a small part of the fandom, so the reception will be very different on different places.

That said, I love your idea and I would read the hell out of it! Just from this, I already identify with her so much lol. I, too, would look upon the mirror of Erised and find myself just chilling. And I need more Harry just-leave-me-the-fck-alone Potter in my life.

No bashing and no OP-genius-smarter-than-Hermione Harry? Are you an Angel??

Also I wanna know more about that prophecy..... /Is she the prophecy kid?? Are prophecies BS???? Did Voldemort pick the wrong baby??? Is she even the girl-who-lived??? How many people know about the prophecy, how many people know about the Potters being bait, and oh my god how does that affect each character's attitude towards Harry???? Snape??????/

Ahem. Anyway. If you write that story, please let me know so I can read it.

*** The thing with the prophecy is that it explicitly states that the one who will defeat Voldemort is a male. So when Lily had a muggle ultrasound while she was pregnant (the technology was around for nearly 20 years by that point, so she should have access to it) and found out she was pregnant with a girl, she and James knew that by process of elimination, Neville is the one the prophecy is about - but Voldemort didn't know that. So they hid Harry's gender in order to make it look like there are two candidates, resulting in a 50% chance of Voldemort picking the wrong one, which he did.

As far as the prophecy is concerned, Neville is Voldemort's true nemesis, he's just yet to be "marked as an equal" until he's 14 (and Voldemort unintentionally using Neville's blood for the resurrection ritual due to Wormtail accidentally nicking Neville's forearm with the knife while they're scuffling over the cauldron is what fulfills that part). Dumbledore initially believes that Harry is uninvolved and free to walk away but once it becomes clear that Voldemort sees killing her as a matter of pride despite now knowing full well that she's not his real target, Dumbledore begins to suspect that Harry might be the Power He Knows Not in the form of a wildcard whose actions are not bound by the wording of the prophecy but whose involvement via circumstances can indirectly affect the outcome. After all, the prophecy doesn't say Neville has to do it alone and a girl(friend) with a one-of-a-kind protection against his nemesis (due to Lily's protection, Voldemort cannot magically inflict harm on Harry directly, only indirectly via things like blowing up the ground next to her to bludgeon her with the flying debris) is the kind of ally Voldemort can never have.

** Very promising!

My three suggestions:

- No abusive Dursleys, they tried their best, but it's difficult to raise a magic child. Can you imagine tantrums mixed with accidental magic? They did lose their tempers a few times and order her into the cupboard to "chill out".
- Sort her into Hufflepuff, although she's lazy, she's loyal and greatly values friendship.
- Given such major personality change from canon Harry, please please do not rehash canon plot. Even if Dumbledore puts the PS at school, she's NOT going to stick her nose in, so you can either make Voldemort gaining his body earlier or getting neutralized by Dumbledore in front of the Mirror

*** No abuse happens. In fact, I recently thought of a scene where Dumbledore explicitly asks Harry if she was physically abused, only for her to be unable to name even one incident and wonder why didn't they when they hated her so much. To which Dumbledore would casually recount a tale where he was in the response team to a DE raid in muggle territory and caught a DE in the middle of having his way with a muggle teenage girl. Said DE promptly got launched out of the second-floor window and hit the ground beneath in pieces, while Dumbledore stunned the girl, healed her and applied a memory charm so that she won't remember the trauma and can move on with her life. Last time he checked back on her, she was happily married. Moral of the story: child abuse is where this Dumbledore draws the line at whether someone can still be redeemed in his eyes and as he near-smugly adds, he may have "accidentally" let that slip to Petunia.

There's a high likelihood that she won't get involved with the PS, yes. I'm not sure whether she would even get involved in the troll incident, as McGonagall casually solos the beast with the expected competence of Dumbledore's right-hand woman. Moral of the story: don't mess with the stern granny who teaches magic because she likely knows a hundred different ways to mess you up with it, even if she doesn't end up doing it in the end because she's a morally good person.

**** A potential plot line I always want to see happen is Harry having a relatively normal Hogwarts time and facing Voldemort as an adult, fully trained and avoiding these pesky issues:

- Teenagers beating Voldemort either through ridiculous power progression or Deus Ex Machina
- Child/Teen politicians
- Children/Teens forced to become soldiers and killers
- Incompetent adults trope in children's literature

No ridiculous power progression will happen. Harry's way of fighting is that of a guerrilla-style dirty fighter: she makes heavy use of the Invisibility Cloak for ambushes, flanking attacks, throwing potions with dangerous effects, fake retreats into traps prepared ahead of time, improvisation with her environment with things like blasting through walls, opening gas valves to set off an explosion after luring DEs into the house and herself getting out on the other side, and just generally being an annoyingly slippery combatant. She can't fight an experienced DE head-on, so she cheats like crazy because honor means nothing if you're dead.

******* Details still need to be worked out but the general idea is that Neville tags along for the ride and when Wormtail pulls a knife on Harry to take her blood, Neville attacks Wormtail, the two get into a scuffle over the cauldron and Wormtail accidentally injures Neville with the knife, causing Harry to flip out, tackle Wormtail to the ground and beat his face with a rock until he stops moving... at which point Harry gets flung off of him and pinned down by Voldemort, as Neville's blood fell into the cauldron and completed the ritual while Harry and Neville were distracted.

On the other hand, Neville's blood being used instead of Harry's means that Harry's protection via Lily is still very much intact, which is what allows the teens to escape due to Harry realizing that Voldemort cannot magically harm her directly and immediately putting herself between Voldemort and Neville as the latter's human shield.

There's no law or commandment saying that Voldemort must be resurrected in the graveyard or that he must return in Year 4. It's been done ad nauseam in fics already!

** I would love to read this! It seems like you're intentionally avoiding/subverting a lot of tropes (which aren't always bad, just used incredibly often), especially power fantasy, manipulative Dumbledore, etc. As long as the story doesn't just exist to subvert tropes but also stands on its own (and it sounds like it will), it's a great choice.

As for the fandom...well, you can never please everybody. People will argue about everything, including whether Harry is an acceptable name for a fem!Harry. But there is also an excited audience for everything as well.

This might be the only fic I've ever seen which really plays with the idea of prophecies being bs, and The Prophecy only being fulfilled because Voldemort is so dramatic. I'm really looking forward to reading it. Please let us know when you post it!

Not to mention that you'd have to sidestep all the information security issues of canon twice over, making the whole thing even more dubious.

*** It's not necessarily bashing. They didn't hung the baby out to dry, they were fully prepared to die for their child if Voldemort catches the bait and that's just what they did, albeit not necessarily in the same way: I have half an idea that Lily tried to ambush Voldemort with a sawn-off shotgun due to knowing that she can't hold him off in a magical duel and managed to actually hurt him with it, but not seriously because British gun control laws at the time meant that she had to obtain it illegally and without training. Even then, she successfully made Voldemort royally pissed to the point where he literally tore the cheeky little mudblood limb for limb for daring to use a muggle weapon against him, denying her the quick and painless death she got in canon.

And no, the Potters' ploy is not universally treated as heroic. I mean, yeah, Dumbledore thinks it is, but Harry is very ambivalent on the matter and even Snape is heavily torn because as much as he'd like to declare the whole thing to be James' idea he convinced Lily of, Snape knows Lily well enough for a part of him to be aware that Lily herself is fully capable of this kind of subterfuge on her own (especially since Harry is one hell of a dirty fighter herself and explicitly got it from Lily).

** Eh, I'm not really a fan of not changing the name or just calling her "Harriet", cause that just rings of laziness to me. It will never be not jarring and will destroy any suspension of disbelief you attempt to generate.

And tbh the plot point you've sketched out for why the name is the same just seems like a dumb and unnecessary cop-out to me. The rest is nice, but this plot will be tedious and jarring and I doubt I'd read the story if I'm ripped out of it every time I read the protagonist's name.

Just drop that one, give her a name that actually makes sense and this will be a great story.

This will require some shenanigans to explain the so-called "protections" being moved. Or a course for Dumbledore to be called out for not even noticing that they moved.

Also, Dumbledore will have to be swinging bats at people looking to get femHarry married into her family. Last Potter, all that money? And before people go "that's not a trust vault blah blah blah", Harry's Grandfather sold his very successful potions business. Harry's father was not irresponsible enough, or alive long enough to spend that much money to leave what was in Harry's vault.

ANYWHO~ That amount of money AND having the fame of "offing the Dark Lord" (or having her ready to hand over when/if the Dark Lord comes back) makes her perfect Trophy Wife material.

And for the name, Harry IS her legal name registered at the proper authorities after birth. The option of changing it later on via the proper legal channels is open, yes, but it nevertheless caused her a lot of headache as a child when other kids teased her over it, to the point where prior to knowing the true reason, she sometimes wonders if her name was a prank by James.
