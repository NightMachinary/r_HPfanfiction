I'm talking full on cursed monkey's paw, malicious djinn wish granting assholery that leaves Harry ultimately wanting to crawl back into the cupboard he grew up in, and wait for the end of the world.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

** I mean, in a way, isn't that series canon? At the start of Book 1 Harry wants to get away from the Dursleys. He is then taken away from the Dursleys in a wonderfully cathartic manner, told he has powers, fame and wealth, and gets to learn magic and make friends.

And that all stays true but his wealth causes his friend to be jealous, his fame causes massive problems, his powers mean he is fated to fight a Dark Lord and die.

I am pretty convinced that if Harry could have had a normal life as a Muggle he would have been happier.
