All I remember about this crackfic is that it's a satirical fic of some sort attacking the Manipulative!Dumbledore trend. The most prominent scene I can remember is where Dumbledore and the teachers storm into the Great Hall in a congo line chanting. I don't remember all of the chant but it ends with "EVERYBODY DO THE DUMBLEDORE!" or smth like that.


** Sorry i'm not familiar with that fic, but you may enjoy knowing [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYKupOsaJmk][what it was referencing]], at least.

** I usually don't like crack fics, but this was fun.

Oooh, and you might be interested to know that the the "Everybody walk the Dumbledore" song is actually a parody of the song "Everybody Walk the Dinosaur." :) You can see the music video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83nFiPoSuzU][here]].
