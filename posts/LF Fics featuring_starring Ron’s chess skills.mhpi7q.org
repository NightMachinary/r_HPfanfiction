Ron's chess is never really mentioned after PS.

I'm looking for anything about that aspect of him. I don't mind if it's slice of life, AU, gen, time travel, canon compliant, shippy, Dumbledore!Ron, Chosen One Ron.... whatever.

E.g. it could be a canon-compliant slice of life fic about how/why he became interested in chess. Or it could be... I dunno, Ron travelling back in time and meeting someone who loves chess, Ron using his chess skills in later books to plan out strategies against Voldemort. Whatever, really, as long as it's about Ron.

That said, I would /prefer/ no chess prodigy Always-A-Muggle!Ron AU.


** A slice of life fic showing Ron inadvertently teaching Harry Chess and how Harry accidently became really good at over the 7 years ðŸ˜Š

  Harry accidently gets good at chess after playing Ron for 6 years. Pity he doesn't even notice.All the chess matches are real and linked in the fic for you to follow along for context since, as it turns out, writing chess is bloody difficult!

** There was one that I've forgotten the name of where Ron was in Slytherin became an apprentice under Daphne Greengrasses father who was a competitive Chess master. It started out really well but I eventually had to give it up because it was just going in circles with no development in either the character or the plot. Ron would make a mistake, learn a lesson from it, and a few chapters later would repeat that very same mistake all over again.

There were some good parts to it, the Daphne/Ron romance it was teasing was interesting as I'd never seen that anywhere else. But like the rest of the story it was just going around in circles with no development actually happening.

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? [Trope stew: this fic began as an exercise, an attempt to use problematic or challenging tropes. A meta-discussion of each trope to follow each chapter.]
