I remember the author note saying basically he wanted to change the context for the train ride, by having Harry read a book, but why would Harry be reading a book... well if what Harry's Diagon Alley stay changed then the train ride would change.

If anyone has any fic recs other than the specific one I'm searching for, feel free to recommend... I do like 'For Want of a Nail' fics.

Here is the fic I was reading that reminded me of this fic if anyone is interested: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4036037/1/]] warning: cracky


** Basically every timetravel!independent!Harry. Those books,ustom wands, time turnes wouldn't purchase themselves.
