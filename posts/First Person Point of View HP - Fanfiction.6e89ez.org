Is there any good fanfictions from Harry's point of view? It has to be a first person story.


** Not canon but linkffn(4068153) is amazing and its sequel has been updated for the first time in ages.

** I was all set to recommend "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the jungle]]" by jbern, but when I checked, it's actually second person.

The curious part is that since it's spoken as if /to you/ you actually feel like it's /about you/ and therefor very personal. The exact kind of personal that you might expect first-person perspective writing to offer but actually doesn't quite.

I'll leave it out there. His story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The lie I've lived]] actually /is/ first person, come to think. It's also definitely in the category of "good" in my opinion. linkffn(3384712)

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
