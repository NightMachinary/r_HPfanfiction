This is killing me. I am 80% sure I read it on ao3 at some point but it was about a morally grey Harry that gets with Tom/voldemort, and there's this beautiful allegory about jellyfish (the author specifically goes into the word Meduza) and how it represents Harry and his motivations. I remember it not being crazy oocish and I think he was still friends with Hermione. That's all I have and it is KILLING me because I remember it being so damn good and on par with No Glory by Obsidianpen. If any jellyfish fics ring a bell please help a gal out!
