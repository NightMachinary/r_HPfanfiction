** Harry Potter and The Great Gatsby. During a timeturner mistake, Harry is jetted back to the 1920's where a depressed wizard uses his magic to throw grand parties and generate a great deal of income in order to woo the muggle love of his life, Daisy. Harry becomes Gatsby's only true friend when he begins living next door. Daisy is revealed to be a good friend of Lily's mother and Gatsby recognizes this with Harry's eyes.

Eventually Gatsby loses his connections within the Congress of Magic. The WIA (Wizarding Information Association) decides to stop his outlandish displays of magic around muggles and assassinates him. The memory of his death is implanted as a muggle-murder following an affair. Harry is then deported to Great Britain, where the Ministry sends him back to the present.

**** Why thank you.

Edit - Pure blood political bullshit in the first chapter in a story taking place AFTER the battle of Hogwarts....I get the need for dramatic tension, but how fucking cliche. "The people in charge are selfish assholes." And letting purebloods have any say after Lord Thingy? Stupid, stupid, stupid.

This is disappointing so far. I've seen this zombie movie before. I was hoping for something a bit more unique. Thanks again for the link though.

** Harry Potter and the History of Tom Jones, a Foundling. Harry encounters a biographical work about a young man who lived some hundreds of years earlier. He throws it away because reading for amusement is inconceivable. Hermione, incensed, retrieves it from the rubbish bin and reads it. It's okay.

Harry Potter and the Clan Corporate. A family of merchants from another world stumble upon Hogwarts. They begin exporting magical ingredients and potions en masse. Snape hires on as a consultant. A splinter faction of the merchant family ends up cooperating with Voldemort. Harry listens as important people talk about what's happening. He plays Quidditch. Voldemort invades Hogwarts. Harry flees, but he has to be told twice.

Harry Potter and the Clockwork Rocket. Yalda embarks on a plan to save the world, combating heavily entrenched sexism. Harry Potter feels unsettled that a female without a co would put herself in such a position and even more unsettled that anyone would use birth control. He exchanges harsh words with an unusually pale male of high birth. The rocket takes off. Harry gapes.

Harry Potter and the Jennifer Morgue. Eldritch magic pushes Harry into the role of a protagonist in a spy thriller. He muddles through, leaning mostly on the resulting plot armor to get him through. Foreign intelligence officer and not-exactly-human Fleur Delacour also helps keep him alive while doing most of the work, snatching victory at the last moment.

** Harry Potter and The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. Sadly, Harry's marriage with Ginny starts to fizzle as Harry enters his midlife crisis which consists of him heavily remembering his darker younger days. He meets a girl, a girl with a dragon tattoo. Shes pretty cool, because come on, she tattooed a dragon on her body (most likely a Norwegian Ridgeback). This girl brings the excitement of adventure back to Harry's life that he had been yearning for ever since he defeated Voldemort.

** Harry Potter and the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy:

Chapter 9 ...A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of millions of light-years from end to end.

As it closed up, lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the Universe. A team of seven three-foot-high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxiation, partly of surprise. Last of all a shortish man from what used to be Surrey, England. This unfortunate soul had been reaching into his fridge the world seemed to drop away around him. The sudden lack of oxygen, the planet below him, and the ship shaped like a rather fetching running shoe convinced him that he was no longer in his kitchen grabbing a drink, but rather in space.

One might think that space travel is a bad hobby for someone with only a little wooden stick, a towel wrapped around your waist and a bottle of firewhiskey in your hand, but you would be very wrong.

I like his worldbuilding a lot and also the underlining ideas , even if i'm not such an objectivist and actually disagree on some of his points (i despise libertarianism) , but i grew up with those bricks (books) so they influenced hugely how i think. I started reading them at 13 and finished them (then a pause untill the Omen machine) at 15-16 so yeah i'm still really attached to that world. I'm sad that i have read them in my language and not in actuall english but what's done is done.

Nowadays if I pick up the new series books, Richard just feels preachy and (especially) his sidekick feels like an angsty little ignorant girl (not Kahlan, I meant the village girl he picked up on his way to save her).
