I'm always looking for new, interesting stories, and think it would be great to share the best new stories of the last 6 months. (If it's nice and was published 7 months ago, it's okay too, just no "old" stories.)

I think this thread would be a good idea because new stories written by unknown authors are overlooked quite often. Or at least I have a hard time finding the good ones among the huge amount of fanfics published each week.

Requirements:

- author should have a good grasp of the English language

- still updating or complete

I'm not looking for stories of a particular "genre" (Slytherin!Harry, time travel...), chances are that even if I don't like it some other user will be glad it was mentioned.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10632814/1/Changed-Fate][Changed Fate]]

In 2008, after a decade long war against Tom Riddle and his armies of inferi, the dark lord is finally destroyed. A pair of veterans from a conflict the likes of which the world had not seen since the darkest days of WWII, receive a second chance. They find themselves in a world similar yet different, where Riddle is still seeking new body and a tournament begins in Hogwarts...

Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]]

People fear Voldemort for his power -- a striking combination of innate genius and surgical precision. People fear Grindelwald for the men he led and the system he created. Voldemort or Grindelwald, Mr. Potter, which one are you? HP/FD AU - Inspired by Santi's BWL and Fettucini's Knowledge is Power. Durmstrang!Harry with a focus on politics and economics later on.

The Magnate was published 6 months and 4 days ago, but I figure that's close enough.

*** I read The Magnate and Death Before Dishonour and liked both, I hope they get updated again.

** For me, it's the Blackman trilogy, hands-down. If you liked the style of humor in The Lie I've Lived, A Black Comedy, or What Would Slytherin Harry Do?, this one will treat you right. By "same style," I mean utterly sophomoric and completely brilliant.

Author is MattSilver, who also wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma]].

It was inspired by [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=787440&postcount=1230][this post]].

*** Thanks, I'll definitely give it a try. The Lie I'Ve Lived and What Would Slytherin Harry Do are great, A Black Comedy at times too cracky for me at times,(e.g. the Wizengamot scene). PS If you're the same person as Lane Anasazi as on ffnet I really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959046/1/The-Lesser-Sadness][The Lesser Sadness]], great idea and somewhat unique take on the Harry-comes-back-from-the-dead-thing, hope you'll continue it.

*** I've googled around and can't find the Blackman Trilogy. It sounds interesting from your description and if it is still out there I'd love a link if you could share it. Thanks!

***** Ohh, I thought that was to something else for incorruptible. They must have purged old DLP names because mine doesn't work and it doesn't recognize my email. Ah well, I'll make a new one. Thanks!

#+begin_quote
  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
#+end_quote

I've said it before, I think this is probably the fic with the most potential I've seen in the past year or so. The authoress spends time on this sub and DLP, and seems fairly open to questions.

*** thanks for the tip, I had no idea you could do that. always thought I either had to sort for "most recently published/updated" or "most favourites". I really should have taken a closer look at the search options.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/10/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][Lightning Dragon's Roar]] is a good, funny, easy-to-read fic. It has some flaws, and is quite cracky, but I like it. It hasn't been updated since October though, so I'm not sure about its status.
