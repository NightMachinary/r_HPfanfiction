It can be Harry with the gamer ability(definitely preferred) or Harry just being a regular gamer


** And what is this "gamer ability"?

*** Basically, your life turns into a game. You have leveling up, hp, special skills you can earn, etc. I've read 2 fics with this premise if you want to see for yourself.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

*** There's this webcomic called The Gamer where the main character can level up, read other people's stats, learn skills by consuming books, etc and becomes really powerful really quickly.

**** The gaming ability is not something that manhwa invented, you will find plenty of stories with game mechanics both in fanfiction and in original works, including plenty years before that manhwa existed.. Also, while many trash authors just copy that manhwa, others with actual imagination make their own stuff. Personally I liked those with pure RPG mechanics, but there are many that go full videogame with saves and even bugs, as shown by the example given by the OP, all of that is way outside of the manhwa's spectrum.

***** True. But, as far as I know The Gamer was the first massively popular "story" in which it was a main plot point. That drove a lot of attention to the genre.

** Just saying: “GamerHarry” fic is code for “abandoned by the second year of Hogwarts if it even gets that far” ... don't get your hopes up.

Now, if you want a different kind of gaming...

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

And using game-inspired mechanics, currently still being updated: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts)
