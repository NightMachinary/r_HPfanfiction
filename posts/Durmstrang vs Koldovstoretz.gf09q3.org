Why is there need for two eastern European schools? But only one school everywhere else? Non serious answers only please.


** Because Russia is not the Eastern Europe? And no I don't mean, that Asia begins at the Landstrasse, but that there is certainly space for two schools behind the former Iron Curtain (one for what are now Central and Eastern European EU states and perhaps Ukraine, the other for Russia itself). Much more interesting question is why the hell there is no third school for Germany?

*** Historically, Germany was united fairly recently (19th century). When you look at a map of Germany before the Napoleonic wars, it resembles a patchwork rug of small states and cities. If there wasn't a country called Germany, there wouldn't have been a wizarding school for it. In my headcanon, German wizards (and possibly other countries' wizards, as well) favoured a master-apprentice system over schools. One witch or wizard would teach at most a handful of students everything they knew. Later schools may have developed from this, but they would never be as large as Hogwarts, and therefore do not deserve a mention among the most famous wizarding schools in the world. I bet there are many small schools all over the world, they're just too unkown to be mentioned on Pottermore.

Why? I don't think magical schools are organized around the states (e.g., Beauxbatons cover certainly multitude of states, and I understood there are Irish at Hogwarts, I mean from the Republic, not from NI). Why there couldn't be one school for the area of roughly The Holy Roman Empire? (And yes, I am a Czech, so I know all about those weird questions like “are we Germans or not”? After all, Czech knights were fighting at the Battle of Lechfeld ;)).

And still nobody explained to me why Bulgarians go study somewhere to Lapland, or wherever Durmstrang is.

***** The borders of magical countries seem to be roughly where the real borders are, but probably not always (e.g. tiny Liechenstein is supposed to have a large enough magical population for a national Quidditch team). I'm not very familiar with the history of France, but I'm sure there are reasons why people in other countries speak French and why Beauxbaton accepts students from these places. Ireland used to be a part of the UK for a long time, so it makes sense for them to go to Hogwarts (Irleland only became independant in the 20th century). Maybe magical Ireland isn't independant at all.

The Holy Roman Empire wasn't really a country, or even a region where people spoke the same language (Germany, Eastern Europe, Italy were all part of it). If it had wizarding schools, I imagine they didn't survive to the modern age.

Durmstrang is a pureblood/halfblood only school, and apparently it takes students from all over the world. We know Krum from Bulgaria went there, Grindelwald from Austria?, and Draco's parents from England at least considered sending him there. So it's possibly the most international school of all, and all that matters for admission is your blood status.

****** For France, French was a lingua franca of high level European nobility for centuries - but that would also include England, so it's not really an excuse. France was probably closer tied to England than to Italy or Spain during the medieval period, too.

I'm not a fan of the canon schools and their locations myself - I'd much prefer to add a lot more schools in, specifically because it doesn't make sense for there to be so few.

Just to put it into perspective, Hogwarts was canonically founded before England controlled Wales or Scotland, far less Ireland - and yet Hogwarts is in Scotland and students from all over the British isles go to Hogwarts.

Although the HRE was a loosely organized empire (particularly post interregnum) that was not abnormal - France, for instance, was very decentralized for centuries, and in terms of 'country' they'd be fairly comparable for a few centuries. Language was also a barrier - we picture France as united linguistically today due to the 19th century, really, but prior to that? It was a patchwork of various patois and languages. That's obviously not even talking about the differences with the various Spanish languages/dialects, Italian, Dutch, or Portuguese, all of which are supposedly present at Beauxbatons. I think basing wizarding schools on history doesn't work for canon, unfortunately - it'd need to create from scratch a wizarding history to justify it even for just hogwarts, let alone the pan-european ones.

******* I think there is potentially hundreds of magical schools in europe. Hogwarts, Beuxbatons and others in rowlings list are in my opinion just the larger ones compared to rest(meaning hogwarts might be the cambridge of british wizarding schools while others might be just smaller, local schools.)

Rowling says smaller schools come and go, so the ones she listed are not the only schools, they are just better.

That may work as partial explanation. However, what all non-purebloods do if they don't speak French in your universe? Does most of Europe go to Koldovstoretz? That sounds weird (whole Europe+Russia having effectively three schools: one for England, one for France, one for everybody else).

I prefer the German School in the Harz mountains, and the Central European non-German school at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeč]]) (there is the Czech server [[http://budec.net/]] which is based around that school).

******* As I said, I imagine there are many smaller schools (like one class per year) all over the world. I bet there would be at least 4 or 5 German speaking ones, probably each with a different focus, e.g. one specializing in Charms, another in Potions, the next in Transfiguration etc.

*** Because the Germans go to Durmstrang where, chances are, the probably speak German.

The way JKR set these schools up is insane.

**** Except the German-sounding Durmstrang with name written in Cyrillic is located somewhere in the Northern Scandinavia and all people related to that have Slavic sounding names (or whatever origin [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff#Etymology][Karkaroff]] is). And one school in the Northern Scandinavia servers whole half or so of Europe from Greece (? I can imagine that Italians go to Beauxbatons?) to Norway.

Mrs Rowling truly combines her heritage of English ignorance with French arrogance with regards to her knowledge of Europe outside of her front garden.

** I'm still not over the fact that she just named three of the magic schools “Magic castle” in different languages and apparently just assumed nobody would fuckin notice.

Like, how fuckin lazy can you get? Did she write that thing up in half an hour or something?

** Durmstrang was famously only taking purebloods (and from all over the world apparently), so there would have to be at least one other wizarding school for everyone else in that area.

** I theorize it as Durmstrang being a private school that's targeted at witches and wizards all over the world, while Koldovdstoretz is the state school for Russia like Hogwarts is for the United Kingdom (there has to be a smaller, unknown school for Ireland because I can't imagine them being happy about needing to go to the UK).l

Or maybe Russia gets two schools because it's so much bigger than...everywhere, really. The whole country is larger than Pluto. Eastern Russia is also very poorly connected to Western Russia, as you can see [[https://maps-russia.com/img/1200/russian-highway-map.jpg][here]]. There's a whole lot of nothing that still has people living there. Durmstrang could be in the western half of the country (which would also explain the rate of international students like Krum and Gridndelwald), while Koldovdstoretz is in the east.

Or maybe she just forgot.
