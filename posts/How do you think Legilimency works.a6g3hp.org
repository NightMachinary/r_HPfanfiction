** My headcanon:

Legilimency is the art of reaching out to other people's mindsets. On a surface level ("low-level" Legilimency, without casting Legilimens, and requiring eye contact), you get the feel of other people's emotions. For people with no Occlumency shields at all (even "innate" from how their general mindset works) who project all their emotions and thoughts openly, you might grasp images, words, or whatnot that the person is currently considering. This technique is how trained Legilimens figure out lies.

A second level is a direct and deliberate contact, using the Legilimens spell. This gives you access to people's memories, and you can control their train of thought by projecting emotions alongside hints, using people's emotions against them. For example, if you want blackmail material from Harry about his love life, you can use Legilimens, think of various girls he knows until you can suss out affection from his emotions, and then follow that rabbit hole projecting strong affection (presumably from your own SO/whatever) and strong hints towards said girl.

On top of Occlumency, direct Legilimency is also a contest of willpower. Harry made for a terrible Occlumens thorough his adventures, but his will was strong -- he was able to /kind of/ repel Severus at times when he approached memories Harry /really/ didn't want him to see even though he never really got anywhere with Occlumency. One pitfall of direct Legilimency is backfire -- either though Protego (or similar protection spells), or through very overpowering will. Considering that Legilimency relaxes your own Occlumency shields, this can be a major problem. This is the reason Severus used a Pensieve while he (tried to) teach Harry Occlumency.

I also believe that Obliviation is closely connected to Legilimency in how you target things you want people to forget. Thus, skilled Legilimens make a good foundation for a skilled Obliviator. The opposite is also true -- you can't reliably Obliviate people who has mastered Occlumency. This, however, makes Obliviate fatal if it backfires -- it traps you in your own memories as they dissipate, and as you forget them, you're unable to figure out what is happening until everything is wiped clean (Lockhart).

Thus, I think that no, you can't manipulate people with Legilimency /directly/ -- allthough you can obviously do it indirectly by forcing people to relive memories they would rather forget.

  The way I understood it, from reading the books, was this:

  The legilimencer is suspicious of his victim. Suspicious of something that would be associated with the emotion of guilt or fear (or even happiness). The guilt or fear emotion is tied to a memory. The legilimencer traces the emotion to the memory. He sees the memory and knows why the person is guilty or fearful.

  The occlumencer, in order to evade the legilimency, clears his mind, "emptying himself of emotions" because the emotion is the breadcrumb to the memory. It would probably require a strong will.

  #+begin_quote
    I told you to empty yourself of emotion! ... Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily --- weak people, in other words --- they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter! -- Snape, OotP

** Personally i think most Magical's in harry potter realize how strong and versatile it is.. The most skilled user's have been seen . a comment from Snape on Voldemort was. " Voldemort could not only read, but also control and unhinge the minds of others, with him often enjoying telepathically invading the minds of others, creating incredibly realistic visions designed to torture them into madness "

â€‹

also this explains how harry got sent the "false visions"

** Legilimency clearly works somewhat akin to reading a mind. Snape was just needlessly adversarial and pedantic, because he loves to belittle Harry and make himself seem more complicated and grand (narcissist).

Similarly potions is mostly like cooking, you just follow the recipe (see Hermione and her Polyjuice). Snape just has his head way too deep up his own arse to admit it.

I can't believe how often readers take blatantly unreliable characters like Snape, Bellatrix,Crouch Junior or Dumbledore at their word when doing a surface level analysis of HP.

I don't really think so about this part. If I remember correctly, Harry made Legilimency appear to be similar to muggle mind reading, which is really just reading the at the moment thoughts. However, Legilimency is quite more than that as it does allow you to go into the mind and recall memories, which is significantly different then mind reading imo.

** My favorite depiction is from linkffn(The Changeling). Legilimency allows you to experience someone's thoughts and memories as if you were them, and requires great discipline and emotional detachment to use effectively. Occlumency requires you to be able to tie your thoughts into such a snarl that even you probably can't untie them again. Both are dangerous skills to learn, especially legilimency, since you basically have to entirely stop caring about the target as a person, just as a source of information, in order to read them without getting pulled in and lost.

** I liked White Squirrel's interpretation of Occlumency, where it's not really even magic at all, just really good mental discipline. So why not Legilimency as well? I like the idea of it being akin to a Sherlock Scan, since I personally find people easy to read in real life. Magical means of mental infiltration and fortification would just make it easier to do.

**** I can see why a lot of people don't like the "mind palace" fanon, but really we're given little to no explaination on how mind-magics really work in HP, and what we are told is by Snape, a horrible teacher with a hate-boner for Harry, so it's easy ebough to disregard what we are told and make up anything we want.

**** Mind palaces are so dumb. And they defeat the purpose. The legilimens is not supposed to know that the occlumens is deceiving him otherwise the legilimens would just torture/kill/other shit. You want to be able to succcessfuly lie and have him go on his merry way. A giant ass house castle kinda gets in the way and just proves that you're hiding something

***** A mind palace doesn't have to be a giant ass house castle. . . it isn't a literal term but a concept. I'm not saying I'm right, but a mind palace concept isn't exactly what you think it is, and isn't exactly a dumb idea when we have virtually zero information. I was saying that what I imagine is that the mind palace concept is sort of what everyone's mindscape is like.

#+end_quote

Uh what? Occlumens has more use than when you are captured. Talented Legilimens can perceive your thought without a wand or word, Occlumency would prevent that and would result in anything other than privacy. Just because an Occlumens deceives a Legilimens, doesn't mean they are going to be killed or tortured. If that were the case, advanced Occlumency wouldn't be to fool a Legilimens, that would just be basic Occlumency; which it isn't as Occlumency in the most basic form is to prevent external penetration of the mind. The mind palace doesn't exactly stop that if it isn't know what their mind palace looks like as everyone should theoretically have something different.

Despite that, a "giant ass house castle" with zero defenses wouldn't exactly stop a Legilimens from accessing their thoughts and emotions if the Legilimens can just go into said "giant ass house castle." The Occlumency part would be accessing their own and building defenses for the "giant ass house castle" is how the mind palace concept would work for Legilimency and Occlumency.

***** Ok, but Harry has a special connection to Voldemort. He also doesn't initiate the visions. They just happen. The closest we get to him purposely going into his mind is at the end of DH, and even that can be taken as him simply no longer resisting the connection.

I definitely wouldn't take that as proof he can just go around and perform Legilimency on whoever.

  Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort's thoughts? He closed his eyes on [Hermione's] command, and at once, the screams and bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them.
#+end_quote

It's sort of implied that he only entered because his scar was yearning for him to for hours. Remember, at this point Harry was employing Occlumency against Voldemort. It seems more likely that he simply stopped employing it and the vision came.

It feels like a stretch to say he knows how to go through someone's mind based only on that, especially when that one moment wasn't him even going through Voldemort's memories, but only looking through his eyes.

*** For the record, its *Occlumency* and *Legilimency.* The '-mency' part is latin for mind (hence the terms roughly mean to hide and read a mind respectively).

You seem to be mixing this up with the commonly used magical suffix '*-mancy.*' Oddly enough thats, a greek term to, and actually means 'to divine,' rather than a magical catch-all additive to words. Examples from Harry Potter would include Tasseomancy (divine with tea leaves) and Oneiromancy (divine through dreams).
