I can imagine somebody who sees the suffering of a muggle w/ an otherwise terminal illness and decides to heal them via magic. They like being able to help people so they continue to help other people in similar situations. Then the aurors get sent out to stop the healer because they are violating the statute. I feel the perspective of the healer or the aurors would be interesting.

If you have any fics to recommend that fit with this prompt feel free to rec them too :)

*** For a one time thing, sure. But for somebody who constantly repeatedly uses magic on muggles and refuses to stop (which I probably should've been more clear about), I could see that going to the Aurors, Hit Wizards or whatever enforcement branch you wish to use to catch magical criminals.

***** I'll agree that there is a lot of confusion about magical law enforcement. We know about 3 groups (that might actually be two groups?):

1. Magical Law Enforcement Squad - Fudge mentions that “no one but Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad” (paraphrased) could have brought in Sirius Black in /Prisoner of Azkaban./

2. Magical Law Enforcement Patrol - Arthur mentions them as being the group responsible for dealing with the culprit in the regurgitating toilets in Bethnal Green issue in /Order of the Phoenix./

3. The Auror Office - Mentioned first in /Goblet of Fire/ in relation to Moody, they specialize in apprehending dark wizards and witches, as well as bodyguard duty for high profile magical and muggle officials.

Honestly, it feels like JKR wanted a title more special than Hit Wizards (maybe because of the negative connotation of “hit men”?) for Moody and wound up, as per usual, creating a jumbled mess.

****** We hear of three branches of law enforcement empowered to make arrests: Aurors, Magical Law Enforcement Patrol, and Hit Wizards. Possibly a fourth with Dementors, who are specifically prison guards but also used for apprehending escaped convicts.

Aurors we see the most of- they seem to be a combination of VP bodyguards (Harry, the Muggle Minister, the Minister for Magic), spies (Dawlish is sent to tail Dumbledore, Kingsley works undercover), and counterterrorism. In real world terms, they're like a hybrid of the Secret Service, FBI (especially the counterterrorism divisions) and SWATT. Or maybe the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted police), who act as a Federal police force, security for the PM, and as cops for rural areas and such without their own police force. Given the elite training they reportedly undergo, however, and the small size of magical society, there are probably not a lot of them- the dozen or so referenced in canon might be the entire British force for that time period.

Magical Law Enforcement Patrol are, as per Arthur Weasley, used to arrest more minor offenders, petty criminals. They'd likely be analogous to beat cops, more numerous than the Aurors, but not as well trained, and not up to telling with the most dangerous violent offenders.

The Hit Wizards are mentioned only once to my recollection, in the context of Sirius's capture. My headcanon for them is that they were something that was created specifically for the war with Voldemort, and disbanded upon its conclusion- a unit that wasn't as small or selective as the Aurors, but more empowered to use lethal force to take down Death Eaters, as per the name. A force trained specifically for combat, perhaps, to augment the Aurors' numbers, but without the additional law enforcement, undercover, and investigative training of Aurors. But that's just my guess.

Then one day he sees harry get hurt by his cousin and thats how harry discovers the truth. And the rest of the story is the both if them hiding from their respective sides healing random people.

Edited another idea

And then end up retired in london with a giant sanctuary for like wearwolves and vampire to live out their days with out having to worry about the magical gov on their tails

**** Ooh! The war was started not because of blood purity, but because voldemort wanted to heal the world, so the name flight from death. The Dumbledore-ministry faction wanted to stop him, do a war happened. This was in the 60s. In the 70s, when the next gen was in Hogwarts, due to propoganda, they were co-opted.

***** That would make for a fantastic story, honestly. Turn the Death Eaters and Voldemort into something most people would find positive. Instead of a battle of good versus evil the series becomes a fight over the issue of how to use the gift of magic and what wizards may or may not be obligated to do with their powers.

I'm picturing the purebloods as a group of philanthropic/well-meaning individuals who want the magical community to intervene more in the mundane half of the world. Stopping famines, curing cancer, and solving issues like resource scarcity instead of hiding away in their own little paradise while the muggles suffer. Oh man, a plot like that would need an entire re-imagining of the basic plot and characters, in all honesty. Harry probably wouldn't be an orphan, Tom Riddle / Voldemort probably wouldn't be hated or feared, and the house dynamics at Hogwarts would be radically shifted.

****** Yeah, you'd have to change the entire story past, oh, most of book one. There's no way you could make some of the acts we see canon Voldie commit sympathetic.

But as an interesting alt universe story, it could be interesting. As long as it doesn't just turn Dumbledore into the bad guy.

Maybe, to make this Voldemort still have a bit of his arrogant canon self, and make the Ministry/Dumbledore side not completely the bad guys, this Voldemort actually wants to abolish death, make everyone immortal, which would have really serious reprecussions (overpopulation, evil people living forever as well as the good ones, etc). So there is still a genuine reason to oppose him, even though his motives are a lot more sympathetic.

** I actually had an idea for a story somewhat like this (maybe a crossover with one of Rowlings' non-Potter crime dramas). An Auror saves a Muggle from something (not imminent death, they're allowed to intervene then, but something chronic like drug addiction that is likely to eventually kill them), and Harry as head Auror is forced to discipline them for it, leading to a moral crisis for Harry when the Auror calls him out and resigns in protest. Basically a "what have I become" moment for Harry where he realizes he's grown into a Ministry suit not much different from the guys who followed Fudge and Umbridge's orders.

Also you could write a great courtroom drama in the Wizengamot around this, and I don't think it would be clear cut. IIRC witches and wizards are allowed to break the Statute to save lives (or was that the Reasonable Restriction On Underage Wizardry- well, they're closely-related laws). So the question becomes "What is "saving lives""? You're allowed to break it to stop a Muggle from being soul sucked by a dementor or eaten by a dragon. Are you allowed to break it to prevent a "natural causes" death? What about curing a chronic condition that won't kill them today, but probably will kill them in a month? Or a year? Where is the line?

For extra drama, Harry (as head Auror) is prosecuting the case, and Hermione is the representative for the defense.

Definitely the moral dillema aspect of was what inspired me to write the prompt. It's too easy to say "oh we gotta stop the bad guy from hurting the innocent," but if the "bad guy" was actually the one helping others when nobody else would, how would that change (or not) the views of those who would judge the healer?

** "Guys, we have a bit of a problem."

"What is it? Did someone use Weasley fireworks in public again?"

"No, they've not been a problem since they added a muggle repelling charm into the explosions. But do you know of this new drug the muggles are using, miraculin?"

"I heard it uses mRNA Crisper or something like that, complicated muggle gene stuff, and cures cancer? Pretty big breakthrough, it was in all the muggle news."

"Yeah, I just ran some tests... The gene stuff in it doesn't actually do anything. There's two potions in it, one that dissolves all of the CRISPR stuff as soon as it detects that it entered a human body and another one that cures cancer."

"So someone's selling potions to muggles? Why didn't we notice this sooner?"

"Whoever did it disguised it really well. If any muggle runs tests on it all they see is a mess of genetic modifiers that somehow works."

"So what do we do, arrest them, obliviate everyone involved and revert what they did?"

"That might not be that practical. As you said, it was in all the news. The entire world knows of it. There have been millions of cases of successful treatment already. We can't really undo that."
