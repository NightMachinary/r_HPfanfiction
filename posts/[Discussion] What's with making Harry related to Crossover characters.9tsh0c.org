I like Crossovers, and I like action filled Crossovers but much to often in these stories Harry has to be someone's son or hidden brother or nephew or something. And it usually isn't done well thought out but rather usually involves Lily cheating on James, yet James is still the bad guy somehow because he didn't bend over and take the Cucking and fuck you if Lily is seen as a moderately bad person. It also doesn't help that much of the time this is used to give Harry a power or skill set already held by someone else usually his father. And despite his new daddy also existing in the story and always portrayed as a bad ass Harry also must have those powers usually shown to be at a weaker level.

I mean what ever happened to just meeting people or making friends or just running into people while doing the same thing. Does EVERYONE who does interesting shit EVERYWHERE in your story have to be related?


** Surprise blood relations is an easy way to make a crossover; it's an immediate excuse to make the two fandoms meet without having to come up with things like plot.

But I have done it for an unposted fic---Harry Potter/Criminal Minds where Spencer Reid's mother is older sister to Lily+Petunia, so Harry gets raised by her in America instead. No superpowers from that, of course, and no issues with adultery, so probably not one that qualifies for your little rant. :)

I have the whole thing plotted out in my head, but whenever I try to write it I just fail.

** On one hand, I agree with your points. On the other, I quite like the idea of someone being "different" because (s)he have a different lineage, as long as it's not unreasonably OP and the characters are not tranquil and calm on the face of rape/adultery.

For example, in the HP x Naruto fusion crossover that I'm writing, Lily is the result of a one night stand between a Naruto character (that I kill, with most of his family) and Lily's mother (that I widowed because I don't want to deal with the "father"). In that way, I evacuate a lot of problems (IMHO).

.

Also, what you might not have considered is that it's a very easy way to make a character OP by handwaving all possible problems that stems from that situation. Or in other words: wish fulfillment.

** linkffn(Mutant Storm)

In this fic Jean Grey and Lily Potter are twin sisters. Both mutants & both magical. However Lily's magic is more dominant, as is the mutant side in Jean, so they get separated before Hogwarts.

Story begins after book 5, when Harry is grieving at the Dursley's who abuse him (which release his mutant powers). His anguish is felt by Jean and she comes to rescue him.

In conclusion: so, yes to conjuring up a surprise blood relation, no to James being at fault.

** Totally agreed. I began to read a Marvel/HP crossover recently but I quit because everything was related to the magical world in the end. Like Coulson was a squib and I don't remember half of it but everything was linked and it seemed so artificial. Best crossover is when the link are few or even nonexistent (like with dimension travel). A bit of family of maybe one person who is a link between the two universe isn't too bad but when everyone is... well nope

*** *CHILD OF THE STORM*

â€‹

It actually becomes better towards the end with the author taking on multiple DC/MArvel/Dresden villains. And it was connected so much because Dr. Strange designed it that way for few characters.

**** Are you sure it's this one? This one I read and I didn't have too many problems with it but the one I was talking about had Coulson as the new History of Magic Teacher for some reason (as he was a squib).

I may be mistaken but I don't think it's in this one.

[EDIT] indeed it wasn't the one I was talking about. Just found it back it's Loki's Family linkffn(12380647).

In this Darcy is Loki's daughter and Harry his grandson. It's not really bad but the "everyone is related to Marvel characters" or "every Marvel characters is linked with the magical world" annoyed me quite a bit.
