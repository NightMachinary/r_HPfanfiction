What i remember is that somehow Harry ended up in the marauders era and ends up in a relationship with at least on of the black sisters Think it was similar to laughing all the way to London and wind shear and I'm fairly certain it wasn't one of the fics by (Jacob/appo)apples


** Delenda Est by Lord Silvere is a harry/bellatrix story with Harry going back in time

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** That describes a ton of different stories. More details would be very helpful.

What do you mean when you say it was similar to Laughing all the way to London? Did Harry take over someone else's identity? Did Teddy come along? Were other magical races involved? Or is it just similar because it's a Marauders' Era time travel story?

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
