I'm bored and I don't want to think. Give me your fics where Harry is ridiculously overpowered, or else posesses so much power that all (or at least most) fights are exceedingly one sided.

  (Or - The Time MoD!Harry Got Fed Up and Dealt With Loki Himself, to the Consternation and Confusion of Everyone Else.) Some days, dealing with a bunch of bratty quasi-immortal beings and their temper tantrums just wasn't worth it. Especially when they kept causing him so much extra paperwork.

** Anything by Jeconais will fit the bill nicely. Dude used to write stupidly OP Harry and turned it into an artform. Some of his shit is so over the top that it crosses the line twice and actually turns out kind of good.

** Technically, linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) qualifies though neither Harry nor the story is in any way stupid.

Harry is ridiculously overpowered though there is a very very good reason for it. He has some glaring weaknesses though since almost nobody knows about them, most of his fights are completely one-sided.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
