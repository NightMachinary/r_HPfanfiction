Title. I would like to see more fics where Cormac Mclaggen is basically Gaston and where Daphne is a fun loving extrovert. And although I've never seen a single fic which uses this,the idea of Michael Corner being a tsundere towards literally everyone appeals to me for some weird reason.

Charms like Cormac, has buff arms like Cormac, no one else causes poison alarms like Cormac!

"I'm especially good at exaggerating!"

Hey, what a guy, that Cormac!

**** Love it! <3 I always kind of compared him to the character too, the way he boorishly tried to horn in on Hermione.

** Dean Thomas as a Muggle pop culture junkie, who keeps quoting Monty Python and Red Dwarf and things like that, with none of the Purebloods understanding what the hell he's talking about. I've read a couple of fics with him having that characterization, and I really liked it.

*** Have you seen any of The Dom's Harry Potter reviews where he compares the books and the movies? In about half those reviews, he assumes the role of "Terrance Boot," a Ravenclaw student who never quite gets around to answer the question whether he's the same Terry Boot as the one in canon.

This Terry Boot, while firmly on the side of the heroes, fery smart, and quite gifted with words, is a total jerk and a snob who considers everyone to be inferior to him. He has a special hatred for Hufflepuffs, and who thinks Muggle-baiting (using magic to mess with Muggles) should be legal because it's "good fun." He's a pretty unlikeable person, though over the course of the reviews you do learn that he's horribly unpopular at Hogwarts as well....

And saying this I realize this sounds like character bashing, but it isn't really... it's just taking a character who had no personality in canon and giving him a personality... just not an admirable one.

*** I actually came up with a little something for Terry - he's the shortest boy in the year and hates it especially considering his friends are two of the tallest.

** McLaggen as a Barney Stinson like wingman like in "Whatever happened to Bromance?"

It was hilarious and I want more of the same.

** The characterization of Daphne Greengrass in Letters by TheEndless7 is one of my favorite things of all time. I love that she was snarky and a bit abrasive, but once she'd decided that she wanted something (ie Harry) she was damn-well going to get it! No other characterizations of Daphne have every lived up to this one in my book, even the other Daphnes written by TE7.
