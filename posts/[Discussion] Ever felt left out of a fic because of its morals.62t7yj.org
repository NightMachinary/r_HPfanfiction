-- Important note: I am /not/ trying to cause debate about the morals themselves of any specific example that may came up. That woudl just be begging for trouble. Please refrain from doing so. --

So... has it ever happened to anyone else that they were very much into a story, one that was well-written and smart, but suddenly couldn't read it anymore because the author's morals were shining through and you just fundamentally didn't agree with them? It happened to me in /Blindness/, when it revealed its version of the afterlife, which I find nightmarish but both the writer and the protagonists apparently find heavenly. And I just couldn't keep following a Harry who genuinely thought organizing the afterlife that way was a good idea.


** I'm not sure if it's the author's morals /per se/, but any time Protagonist-Centered Morality gets too heavy, I click away. Of course, this correlates strongly with Super!Harry, so it tends to have bigger problems than that.

The worst offender I've seen was a story I can't remember the title of where the notion of "One law for the +king+ Noble Houses and another for the commoner" was codified in all but name and advanced proudly as a moral good. It usually takes a lot for me to abandon a story once I get into it, but what finally did it in for me was when Harry called down divine judgment on Jerk!Ron just for being a jerk, and it worked.

Edit: I found the story. It's linkffn(6906107), and it's messed up in a few other ways, too, that I'd forgotten about.

** I'm not really picky when it comes to complex concepts, or straight up non-issues (for me) like the afterlife.

I nope out of a fic when it goes into heavy nationalism or racism. The first being way more likely to happen than the second. Especially fics that fall into a heavy 'murica-wank or japan-glorifying fics fall into a nationalistic tone pretty easily. I also can't read fics where I get that feeling that the author genuinely thinks that torture (or similar things) are in any way excusable.

And shit like "The Real Us" I even report. Pedophilic erotica is simply so far down the deep end, I couldn't even begin to tell you how disgusted I am with the author.

**** But the books also never described it as something /possibly/ used for good, like some authors when they go on about "reactivating nerve-ends" or some mental gymnastics like that. We as readers are well aware of the evil harry commits by casting it. The heroes in HP aren't perfect. Harry is often driven to a point of severe hate where his curse strikes true. But we also know that the hate necessary for it isn't his nature, but only comes up when he's driven to the very edge.

But I see what you mean.

#+begin_quote
  Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said,“You shouldn't have done that.”

  As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!”

  The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through theair like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then,with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor.

  “I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, “you need to really mean it.”

  “Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. “Potter --- you're here! What --- ? How --- ?” She struggled to pull herself together. “Potter, that was foolish!”
#+end_quote

McG's "that was foolish" is more directed to him attacking Amycus, than the actual curse he used. But then again, the reign of Amcyus and Alecto probably left 3/4 of the school hating their guts with a passion. It still damages the image of how we as readers should view this curse, though.

****** No information can be better than false information. That is a simple fact. It doesn't matter if you quote Sun-Tzu, Machiavelli or the publicly available CIA reports. False information is your worst enemy and torture /predominantly/ produces false information.

There is no question of the amorality of torture in a kantian morality system, such as its mostly the case, for example, in Germany. But also in more utilitarian cultures like the United States, the morality of the act is put into question by the uselessness or even potentially harmful information gathered by torture, if not checked for its accuracy. Torture alone is useless.

It may be a matter of personal opinion. More accurate would be to say that it is a matter of upbringing and cultural imprinting on your morality system, intermixing with personal experience. Depending on where we set the standard, either of us can be wrong.

In the context of the HP world, we are presented with an extremely vindictive and utilitarian society. Its a society where Guantanamo times 1000 is the normal prison even for small-fry criminals. Thinking in that context would get me to the conclusion that your more utilitarian approach is probably the way the Wizarding World would see on the issue.

Still, the author doesn't live in the wizarding world. Therefore I greatly dislike reading a positive attitude towards torture. I find it amoral and despicable, being born and raised in a more kantian society that does not easily condone the suffering of one for the good of the many.

*EVERYBODY* can say my opinions are wrong and tell me so. Everybody has the right to an opinion and also a right to criticize everybody else's opinions. It is even advised, for every responsible citizen of a free nation, to be skeptical and critical of their own and other's opinions. I'm not sure where you're from, but that is the very core of our democracies. I respect that you *have* an opinion and that you have a right to it, but that does not mean that I have to respect the content of that opinion in any way.

If you don't want a discussion about it just say it. That's alright. I respect that you probably aren't on [[/r/HPFanfiction]] to discuss the differences between utilitarian and kantian morals. But as a last comment on this, if you want, I would tell you that our world would be a dystopian shithole if everybody would leave everybody else to brood in their own little world of ideas and ideals.

And about your dystopian statement I said respect others opinions as in understand people see things differently and acknowledge that. Respect allows debate to be civil. It doesnt mean. "Oh well he thinks different from me on this shitty situation I cant disagree with him and try to fix it." I dont believe torture is evil by default. The large majority of the time it is. But there are few situations where I wouldnt lock a person up for it such as when theres desperation in a lack of time or something similar. My intentions in this were not to attack you or force a debate but I probably went about it badly.

** I've stopped reading a fic when the protagonists either take part in creating or at the very least endorse straight up totalitarian solutions to defeating the death eaters.

For example, in one fic, either by Wizengamot vote or MOM edict, everyone who worked in the Ministry of Magic had to swear a magically binding oath of loyalty to the Minsitry. Yep, no way that could every be used for evil, because of course, forget the real world, all of the authority figures in Harry Potter were clearly 100% benevolent, right?

To be clear, I would definitely enjoy a fic where the plot is that our heroes have to fight evil from two sides, especially since overreaching and misused government power is something that happens in canon. Give me Voldemort on one side, a Minister who has used Voldemort as an excuse to make himself dictator on the other, and Harry and Friends in the middle and you might just write one of my favorite fanfics of all time.

*** If you can swear magically binding oaths that easily, then any Minister/Wizengamot who'd not have had at least all Death Eaters caught in book 5 swear such oaths to not support Voldemort any more would have been incompetent or a traitor. More likely, those "Imperiused" in the first war would have been "asked" to reaffirm their claims with such an oath.

Adding the Unbreakable Vow was one of the worst mistakes in world building JKR made.

***** From a certain point of view, it makes sense, but it is also grossly misused by authors. If we think about traditional magical agreements, in older stories, it seems to center a lot around fairness. You get into an agreement with someone else, and you have an exchange, quid pro quo. The more magically powerful you are, the more you can bend the rules.

Rapunzel for example, had a storyline that had a couple living next to a witch. The wife was pregnant, and had cravings for herbs from the witchs garden, so the couple stole them to make a salad. The second time, the witch caught them, and forced them to agree that they could have all they wanted if the firstborn child would be given to her. Now, admittedly we have to read between the lines a bit. First of all, lets go ahead and assume that this was a magically binding agreement. Now lets examine what the parties got. The witch got a baby, and the couple got unlimited salads. Well, the wiki page indicates that the general superstition was that pregnant women with cravings could get ill or die if they didn't have what they were craving, which in a certain sense isn't all that off, given the bodies needs for vitamins and minerals. And not only was it a craving, but she was described as desperate to the point of death, so going off the beliefs that were held back then, if she didn't get it, she might have died. So now we have the exchange, a life for a life. Similarly, we can see deals with a demon, souls for power, bargaining with Death, Rumplestiltskin, etc.

Where authors fail, is that they don't make the deals fair. So, if instead the only way to force Death-Eaters into Vows like that would be to guarentee them power equal to what they would have had in Voldemort's faction, then it makes a lot more sense why the Ministry would be reluctant to give deals like that to say Lucius Malfoy. I could easily imagine him bargaining to never directly oppose the Ministry and it's workings, if they never directly oppose him and his plans. He is then free to do all the corrupt stuff he wants, as long as he doesn't touch politics.

*** I've always been thinking that might actually be the case after the war. Given the postwar information (JKR interviews, Pottermore, CC), I can derive a much much darker interpretation of what they had become 20 years later (The DA could become the acronym for 'Dark Army').

I think their generation was completely fed up by the failures of their predecessors, and wanted to do things THEIR WAY. Core DA members had to come to an understanding after the War, that things in Magical Britain were no longer sustainable and revolutionary changes had to take place. This mindset provided the ideological underpinning of their movements, which centered around Hermione and Harry.

They gave an almost perfect public image (model families, modest living), ran on great sounding platforms (equality, justice, love, peace, and prosperity), had hordes of hardcore followers (DA, Quidditch fans, Hogwarts graduates, werewolves, fanboys/girls), turned the military/police (the DMLE) into their private army, became filthy rich (confiscated Death Eater wealth, memory charmed Muggles, Weasley owned businesses, royalties from their 'heroic deeds'), dominated the public media (Ginny was the real force behind The Daily Prophet, Luna owned the next largest publication), were utterly ruthless to their enemies (real and perceived), and most importantly, firmly believed what they were doing was right and necessary to protect their 'loved ones'.

Threats to their power base would have unfortunate accidents or die in embarrassing ways (what? he had a heart attack while engaging in autoerotic asphyxiation? oh dear...), or even accidentally blow themselves up while attempting dark rituals. People who opposed them politically would have their positions undercut through media and rumors. Some PIA would be taken care of by street violence, such as an angry mob demanding the head of that 'Slanderous Rita'. Meanwhile, Hermione would be the calm, thoughtful, considerate leader who seemed really nice, while Harry would be the brave, energetic, and powerful hero who kept everyone safe.

I can very well imagine the following conversation: "Yes, it really is necessary, and I prepared this 400 page document that makes it all clear, so you go read it and come back if there's anything you don't understand, and we'll have a lovely talk about it." (person leaves) "Harry, I want that arse investigated so hard it scours his floors. Find something, and if you can't find something, make something up. Perhaps plant some naughty ideas in his head first."

These people would eat Frank Underwood for breakfast.

Then the main conflict became wizards getting pissed off at some Muggles killing their magical children. I find this plot line not convincing at all. For thousands of years, Wizards have known that many Muggles freaked out at magic, so why should they suddenly act up now? In fact, the declining religiosity in Europe all but guaranteed declining Muggle hostilities toward supernatural powers.

It was really not. You could make a case for /using lethal spells/ (such as a license to /Reducto/ people's necks), but Avada Kedavra itself is a fundamentally evil spell that literally corrupts your soul when you cast it, and can only be cast with true, deep hatred.

If someone killed my friend, id hate them. And does AK actually damage the soul, or simply the act of killing? What does that even mean?

I know a few fics that actually go into this. Off the top of my head Prince of Slytherin has a discussion between Dumbledore and Scridgemore about wheter AK is justified.

******** It's not hatred that fuels it(in my headcanon). What fuels it is absolute killing intent. You have to want to kill them, similar to the Cruciatus where you have to want to hurt them. There is a very big difference between righteous anger, a need for revenge, and legitimate sadism. It isn't the same feeling as shooting someone in a gunfight, because in a sense, that is self-defense. The requirement to cast the Killing Curse is the same if you had to shoot someone in the head, even if they are unarmed and defenseless. Voldemort is a sociopath/psychopath type of character. Of course he can toss out Killing Curses like candy, he has been killing in cold blood since he was 16. Do serial killers hate their victims? The hatred thing makes a lot of sense, because for a normal person, they are going to only really see that sort of killing intent if they deeply hate their enemy and think they don't deserve to live. But anyway, that is why it is illegal. Not because it shatters your soul or anything, regular cold-blooded murder does that perfectly well. But because if you cast it, it somewhat takes all consideration of intent out of the equation. You can't say it was an accident while dueling, because you can't accidentally cast it. You have to know what you are doing. That is why it is Unforgivable.

****** But that case only applied to Stan Shunpike, whom Harry felt was imperiused. He had no problem with others blasting Death Eaters out of their ways.

They didn't kill Dolohov later mainly because they wanted to cover up their trails. But since Dolohov killed Lupin in the Final Battle, that should give Harry a serious lesson.

I don't think JKR was that into non-lethal morals. Harry crucioed Carrows without any remorse, Molly killed Bellatrix, and Voldemort got to rot in hell forever. The 2nd part of the Final Battle was excessively bloody for the bad guys ("trampling over Death Eaters' bodies"), but I guess JKR didn't want to write the scenes too explicit in an YA book.

JKR also indicated in her post series interviews that not many Voldemort minions got away. Malfoys were probably one of the few exceptions since they defected before Voldemort had fallen. Generally speaking, such defectors were often spared by victors throughout history.

In my opinion, if you need to kill people, it's acceptable, but if there's a non-lethal alternative, it's always better; so while it's not practical in real life, it shouldn't be a problem to wizards, as a lethal curse and a non-lethal one have an equal chance of succeeding (except for the unblockable Killing Curse, but the good guys can't use /that/, since it requires deep, soul-tearing hatred to cast and permanently corrupts you).

****** I don't think that's a good comparison (in fact, it would be a false equivalence). Yes, wands /can/ be weapons, but they do not have to be, and an average witch or wizard during time of peace might as well have never actually used spells that are deadly.

Don't get me wrong, I do understand that there will be people in whose hands wands will always be weapons because they are just those kinds of people. But in the hands of someone who somehow does not know any offensive spells, it really can't be; sure, you can use it for combat anyway if you are desperate enough, but there are a lot of things you can do that with if, again, you are desperate enough; craftiness is part of why we, humans, rose so high after all. Heck, I'll give you an example by throwing a name of a video game here: Dead Space; most of the “weapons” you used aren't really weapons but bona fide industrial equipment that is getting used as weapons because there's nothing else and the character is desperate.

I will admit that there is something wrong with the stuff like the Reductor curse (as well as quite a few others), sure, that pretty much is a spell the primary use of which is combat related, meaning that using it does make one's wand into a weapon. However, we do not actually see that curse being taught at any point during the Hogwarts curriculum, for we know Harry taught it to himself before the third task and then taught it to others the next year, and they were specifically learning how to fight rather than anything else so the chose one of the many possible things one can do with a wand, that thing being “harm people”, and it wasn't because the wand /is/ a weapon but rather because it /can be/ a weapon and they wanted stuff that made this happen.

And yes, I do agree fully that a wizard saying that nobody should use guns does make him a hypocrite of the worst order. I do also agree that a wizard saying everyone should have guns is no better, however, and this is why I am going on; there is a spectrum between those two points, and if the authors can't see that spectrum, well ... it's just sad, and let's leave it at that.

Wands can be used as tools, but also as weapons and shields. Almost anything a wand can do, another wand can defend against. And the only spells that we canonically know of which can't be defended against are outlawed with automatic life-sentence. Guns can be used for offense, but not quite as much for defense. You have bulletproof vests for that.

It also counts as a cultural thing. Wands are tools first and foremost. They are absolutely integral to their society, and a wand would be more important to a wizard than a cell phone to a muggle. We can use cell phones to hack people, track them down and invade their privacy, but we don't ban them just because some people use them badly.

Culturally, I admit that it is very open to interpretation. That said, how often do you find yourself actually using your guns. And how often for their purpose. Wizards might find themselves using wands for virtually anything. Summon a sandwich, make dinner etc. It would be used dozens of times a day. Where as with a gun, what are you going to do with it? You can practice at the range, which is like practicing spells. But do you often go hunting? Do you often get assailed by intruders in your house? The point I am making is that a wand is a way to kill someone about as much as a fire is a way to burn witches. Focusing in on that one little part and assuming that the weaponized abilities are all that a wand is about is frankly somewhat ridiculous. I guess the point I am trying to make is that guns and wands are fundamentally not comparable. They are really too different to be held to the same standards. Would you apply gun laws to bombs? Would you apply gun laws to bomb ingredients? I perfectly understand that your personal view is rather pro-gun leaning, and that is fine. But my objection is with you pushing that by claiming that wands are guns and because wands aren't banned, neither should guns. They are not the same, but if you truely believe that they are, I suppose we will have to agree to disagree.

I won't try and argue with fiendfyre. I can only really argue that Wizarding Britain is probably blaise to the idea of WMDs, simply because of all the WMDs sort of pop up in canon.

But even if wands would be treated as tools, that doesn't mean they should be permitted since ultimately, wands are not necessary for anyone. Muggles do fine without wands, after all, so any claim that someone needs a wand as a civilian are already proven false. They make life simpler, but is that enough to compensate for the danger their abuse causes - especially for muggles? Those wizards who need wands to deal with magical threats could still have them, but why should every wizard be allowed to walk around with wands just because they want to be able to use Magic for shit and giggles?

************** Well, the Wizarding World is totally reliant on them. To take away wands, would be worse than taking away electricity for us. Keep in mind that the Wizarding World doesn't really have scarcity. Their entire economy is set up differently and it all relies on wands. To take that away would basically mean the end of the Wizarding World and total assimilation into modern countries. A death of a society if you want to be dramatic. Now stick with me, I know these are extreme claims.

First of all, material goods are created by wizards. Everything related to material goods is made by wands, whether it be furniture, or cooking utensils or whatever. Even food is all duplicated. Getting rid of wands would very abruptly put an end to the ability of the Wizarding World to feed itself. Anything that you could possibly get or need at any muggle store would abruptly vanish. At that point, what. After centuries of being advanced, they just get tossed back to the dark ages. The Wizarding population is simply not high enough to constitute a society the way we have it. They don't have any automation without wands, and even if given out on a restricted basis, it would be extremely difficult, and probably require a government controlled economy to even have a chance of working. Capitalism would fail in such a situation.

That is the point I am trying to make. Banning wands from a post-scarcity society of an absurdly small population is tantamount to killing off the society all together, because there is no way that it can work otherwise. Imagine if electricity were restricted in the US. Restricted to businesses and government, in this day and age. People would riot. They might stay alive, but it would severely hurt even the biggest countries.

And for that matter, it is probably a better society than the Muggle ones in some respects. They do police themselves, and they do outlaw all the actions you mention. Keep in mind, that using the Unforgivables is a life sentence to one of the worst prisons in the world. Azkaban is no joke, and if you are caught using an Unforgivable, it doesn't matter who you are, you are going to prison. So the deterrant is much higher than in the outside world, and the population much smaller, cutting way down on the crime rate. I would even wager that the crime rate is lower than the Muggle world because of the extreme isolationism and far steeper consequences.

In the end, it isn't about the possible abuses, it is about the consequences to the society and the population. What happens when children who don't know who they are use accidental magic to harm others. Ariana Dumbledore killed her mother, a fully grown witch. Tom Riddle was fully capable of torture and control before he had a wand. Wizards are wizards. Denying wands doesn't change that fact, it only makes the situation that much more dangerous. Would you advocate taking away their abilities? At that point you have a slippery slope argument. With that sort of reasoning, you could argue for gay-conversion therapy, and similar abuses. We already have examples of what happens when you try to control a culture for their own good, and Africa still has problems from the colonial era. And this is a first world country. It would be like colonialism except against a small country like Switzerland. I could easily see wizards going to war for that. To basically destroy and dissolve their way of life, is like a declaration of war. Forgive me, but I am not overly fond of the idea of basically destroying another country, and taking its citizens and leaving them unemployed, or coerced into working for the government.

If there were a society reliant on daily hunting for sustenance, then yes, protecting their right for weapons makes sense, because without it, they are destroyed. And there have been hunter gatherer tribes, or warrior clans who have operated like that. But you can only really make that argument for a society that will collapse if they restrict guns. Lets look at Costa Rica. No standing military, and guns are categorically banned. Yet, they are one of the most prosperous regions in their area. America will not collapse if guns are restricted, or taken away outright. Yes, it will have negative consequences for the small percentage which rely on their guns for survival. But it would not be catestrophic for the rest of the civilian populous. If you gathered 50,000 people in one area, and tried to make a society, first of all it would be pretty difficult, as all of the citizens are still under the purview of the government, and it would lack a certain legal standing. But lets roll with it anyway. The only possible way that you could make that equivalence is if that society relies on their guns day in day out to maintain their lifestyles. Maybe if the society had it so that everyone had to hunt and catch their own food, it would make sense. But otherwise not.

And honestly, you could make the same arguments of not having historical value about any society. Point to a first world country which cannot be accused of oppression, torture, slavery etc.

What I am trying to get across is that you cannot compare the Wizarding World to our world, because they have fundamentally different needs. The Wizarding World is simply too different to try to apply our laws to. The only options are allowing their autonomy, or annihilating them. There is no in between.

  Wands are weapons.
#+end_quote

Right, however the primary function of a gun is still to shoot and potentially kill, while killing with a wand isn't its primary function. Look at the subjects they teach the students, especially in the first few years: Nothing that would make it /easy/ to actually kill someone. In the case of magic I'd say "Wands are weapons /with the right instruction/" - which they don't give out until a few years later.

Additionally the true weapon is /magic/, not the wand.

To make a very clear example: In the Fantastic Beasts movie (spoilers ahead, duh) Credence specifically develops and obscurus because he /doesn't/ have a wand and use it, instead suppressing his magic. In the end he actually kills the senator without a wand. Dumbledore's sister kills her own mother because she can't control her magic and tries not to use it out of fear.

Sure, both of these are coupled with disorders, however I think we can assume that the situation could be worse if children wouldn't have a wand and/or were actively discouraged from using magic by saying it's deadly. How would you think Harry would have reacted if this was the first thing Ollivander had said to him? I think Harry (or at least some other child - especially if they had seen some evil wizards) would be outright scared of having it with him all the time, and thus suppressing his magic.

While I am a supporter of anti-gun views I don't think "We give eleven year olds weapons" is the right way to think about a child getting a wand because some stuff is simply not as easily applicable.

***** I wouldn't think so. His ability to see souls in general makes fake souls kind of hard to confuse with real ones. Anyway, why do you ask that? It's sort of an odd thing to ask. The Stone Ghosts being fake is just a /HPMOR/ concept, isn't it?

******* Ah. My mistake, then. Disagreements over the quality of HPMOR aside (that is really not the point here, and anyway, all arguments have been made long ago on that topic), no, he doesn't. Flamel has little reason to lie at this point, and Harry's experiments with the stone seem to confirm his statements.

*** It's when they study they resurrection stone, they bring back Flamel and Flamel basically describes it as existing in a peaceful state and 'living' your life in reverse, letting your memories and life experience dissolve back into the fabric of the universe.

***** A bit mixed, I like the idea of becoming at peace with all the regrets of life, and just being able to let go of painful moments. But as it's being introduced in an HP story, there is something fundamentally sad about this afterlife. Harry, having never 'understood' the love of his parents as a child, will be never be granted a reunion, as by the time he dies, his parents and ancestors will have 'dissolved'.

That being said, there is something fundamentally beautiful about becoming one with the universe as part of the afterlife. All pain, all pleasure, all experiences within life essentially become an expression, a way for the universe to 'know itself'. Andy Weir's story [[http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html]['The Egg']] is a great rendition of this idea.

****** Hm. I see. I really, really, fundamentally disagree, for reasons that are a bit long to explain. But I see where you're coming from. Let's drop the subject here, since as I said in the disclaimer, arguing about the moral issues themselves is not the point here.

** This isn't morals per se, as most of that stuff had been covered by others, like not killing death eaters, etc.

I remember this one decently written fic, I was about 80k words in, and Harry visits Hermione. Turns out they're Catholics or some shit, they start praying and then talk to Harry about Jesus and Christianity.

I noped the fuck out. As an atheist, I can sympathize with the agnostic or deist position, even though it's still unlikely to me. But honestly I can't bring myself to read religious dialogue from a Catholic theist. So much cringe, so much bullshit. Especially when it comes out of left feild like that.

And fyi, Hermione's family is the last one I would expect to be religious. A deeply religious family simply would not not could not have raised Logical Hermione. It felt really fucking OC. Suddenly Hermione is talking about Jesus, and I'm here wondering what her problem is with crumple-horned snorcacks.

And there are cool stories where God, angels, all of that is real, like in the Denarian Renegade series. And those stories were really fun to read because it read like a story, not the author using fanfiction to proselytize.

*** I agree, it'd be hard to read for me too. On the other hand, I think it's going too far to say it's completely OOC --- I believe J.K. Rowling pretty clearly meant her characters to be Christians or some sort, especially judging from her personal beliefs. It is implausible for Hermione to have been raised in a very religious family (though not impossible), but I'm afraid that it's not that far off from how Rowling would see it.

** Hasn't happened in a HP fic that I've read yet, but I've gotten annoyed with author tracts before, even when I agree with them. I feel like good, subtle writing shouldn't make it entire obvious what the author's morals are - we should see the characters' morals and then be able to judge for ourselves.
