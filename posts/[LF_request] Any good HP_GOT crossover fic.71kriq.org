*** Isn't this the one where he decides to really minimize his magic usage?

That's pretty much the exact opposite of what I think I want out of this crossover. I want Harry dragging Westeros, kicking and screaming, into a more enlightened state - through liberal use of magic.

**** I'm not sure if i'd say "minimize". He just doesn't give a damn about most of Westeros and Essos until they get nosy. First Forge is basically built on his magic. He also uses it liberally when he needs to show someone who's the one up in the foodchain, but he's also well aware that just plowing through, killing and torturing everything into submission isn't exactly the way to make long lasting alliances and friendships.

[[/spoiler][Yes, he has started to interact with the cast after the economical might of the First Forge made waves around the seven kingdoms. He interacts with the Dornish, the Starks, the Targaryens and indirectly with the King himself. Especially the Starks play a bigger role since they're geographically and culturally the closest to the wildlings. Ned Stark even comes to trust him to some degree. And yes, he has some kids. I think there were 4 in the last chapter (can't remember), which makes sense. Witch King without Witch Heirs ain't happening.]]

** Linkffn(11362863)

Its an acceptable fic. No glaring grammatical or spelling errors, no horribly cliched plot or ass-pull twists. Also not terribly impressive in terms of plot. But its complete and not too long, so give it a whirl.

But yeah, it seems there are few quality GoT/ASOIAF crossovers. A discussion previously posted mentioned that HP Magic is too OP for any meaningful struggle in terms of plot.

*** An obvious solution to the OPness of the magic is to have untrained wizards. Third year Trio would be an interesting story, because they'd really struggle. Fifth year is the highest I think they could get away with without being super powerful, but even after defeating Voldemort....they really don't have the necessary life experience to prevail. One wizard in a battle can only do so much, and they aren't exactly experienced Aurors. They barely survived camping, and unless they suddenly lose their morals, they won't go around confunding and obliviating and imperiusing people.

The mistake people make is using a MoD Harry who has centuries of learning or experience. What I'd prefer is a Harry, or Dumbledore, who emulated Gandalf - wandering, helping where he can, befriending and settling problems, healing, sorting the odd battle out, but not settling down and taking a position of power.

**** Those are some very good points. I made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3zsu73/any_fics_that_have_harry_and_daenerys_from_game/cyqjyt8/][similar observation]] a while ago and my opinion hasn't changed since then.

Unless the protagonist is a fully qualified wizard, even surviving the daily grind will become a challenge in any pre-industrialization world. As soon as that wizard does something to call attention to himself - depending on the time and setting, the act of using magic in Westeros, where the Faith of the Seven is the prevalent religion, would already be enough to stir a hornets' nest - he opens himself up to being taken out by any number of powerful and amoral factions he most likely knows nothing about.

That's also why I believe that your idea of a wandering wizard befriending and helping out the common folk would not work in ASoIaF/GoT. The region/setting is just too unfriendly when compared to other fantasy like Lord of the Rings, where your idea with a Gandalf light came from. Religion tends to have a very strong influence on the uneducated masses and with the Faith of the Seven having such strong feelings against magic (and a whole lot of history to go with as well), I cannot imagine how someone could openly show his magic without a large enough power base to defend himself and his heretic ways. That's assuming his magic would be accepted by the populace in the first place and it's also not taking into account that the most learned faction of the realm, the Maesters, are generally very anti-magic as well. Who are they, if not the first place nobles go to for knowledge, education and advice?

So yes, an interesting thought exercise about an experienced wizard wandering the lands Gandalf style, but instead of help and salvation he would only bring (religious) unrest and violence to the realm. In Westeros at least, but placing him in Essos would not necessarily be better. With the kind of religions they have over there, his problems would just come from another source instead.

** Skipping the ones that have been suggested already. For the record, I endorse 'The Difference One Man Can Make' and 'The Wizard of Harrenhal'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11661067/1/The-Travels-of-the-Master-of-Death-The-Prince-that-was-Promised][The Travels of the Master of Death - The Prince that was Promised]] -- I enjoyed this one immensely. The politics are believable and fun. It's a crossover with the books though, so some details may be lost on some people.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11388514/1/The-Last-Lion-of-House-Reyne][The Last Lion of House Reyne]] -- I absolutely loved this story, until a certain point where it goes downhill. Won't spoil what that event is, though. Harry is the son of a member of house Reyne, and they manage to escape Tywin's massacre through accidental magic (sort of pushing it, but whatever).

Edit: The Last Lion was suggested while I was typing this, leaving it for the explanation.
