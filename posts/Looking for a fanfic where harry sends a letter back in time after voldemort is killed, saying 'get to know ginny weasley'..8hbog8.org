EDIT: I've mixed up two fanfics. Harry and ron do a ritual but there's no letter thats a different fic. I'm dumb.

Harry and ron go back in time, hermione and ginny are killed in the final battle and they both go back in an attempt to change the future etc etc. Involves a ritual called merlins tears or something? I've just remembered it now and it's bugging me.

Appreciate any help a lot!!!


** That's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/][Backward with Purpose I]], linkffn(4101650). They used Merlin's tears, but Ginny wasn't killed and traveled with them.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!

** You are mixing up two stories. The "Get to know Ginny Weasley" story is [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=11253][Harry Potter and Fate's Debt]]. The story has more chapters on FFN but the version on SIYE is better edited. I recommend reading it on SIYE then switching to FFN when you run out of chapters.
