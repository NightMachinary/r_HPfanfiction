** I'm now imagining a Harry Potter-ified version of Look Before You Sleep. With Luna taking a leaf out of Hermione's book and literally bringing a 'How To Have A Sleepover' guide and trying to follow it to the letter.

Additional hijinks ensue when Fred & George find out and swap some of the pages in the guide with a mix of prank instructions and famous wizarding heists, leading the inexplicably competent yet oblivious Luna to drag Ginny along on a whirlwind adventure in an attempt to have the perfect sleepover.

I've actually never heard of /Look Before You Sleep./ What's it about?

Bonus points is it's filled with relatively mundane activities--hair-braiding, nail=painitng, etc--that Luna is equally unacquainted with.

Oh, it was an episode of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, way back in its first season. As a result of a sodding wet thunderstorm, a cowboy (Applejack) and a fashionista (Rarity) end up sharing the library with the nerd (Twilight Sparkle) overnight, with the latter trying to turn things into a slumber party according to the book. A pillow fight happens.

** “Luna... We don't need the banana necklace tonight.”

“But what if... we get teleported to Mars? Who will protect the aliens if I don't wear the Banana Necklace?”

Ginny was speechless for a moment.

“Don't you worry about that. I promise I will protect any aliens that I come across.”

Luna made a face, but then threw the necklace through the window.

“Good. Now do you have any ideas on what we should play?”

Luna pulled out a list longer than her height. “Uh... How about... The Wand Measuring Contest?”

“Wand Measuring Contest?” Ginny asked.

“Yes. First we remove our pants and underwear ---” Ginny tried to interrupt here but Luna went right ahead, “--- then we pull out our wands and compare their length, hardness, girth, flexibility, etc.”

“Why do we need to undress though?” Ginny asked.

“I don't know... But when I asked Terry he said that's what they do in the boys sleepovers, so I thought we should do it too.”

Suddenly, Ginny understood. She also made a mental note to have a /discussion/ with Ron.

“How about, we /don't/ do that? Yes? I brought Exploding Snap.”

“But I really wanna measure our wands!”

“No!” Ginny said, with a little too much force.

“Is everything alright dear?” Molly asked as she entered the room with two glasses of pumpkin juice and some snacks.

“She doesn't want me to see her wand!” Luna complained.

“That's not... I...”

“Be nice dear. What's the harm in showing her your wand?” She looked at Luna, “If you need anything else, or have any problems, just ask, alright?”

“Yes Mrs Weasley.”

“Ok dears, enjoy!” with that, Molly closed the door.

“Come on! Show me yours and I'll show you mine.”

Ginny looked at the clock. Only half an hour had passed.

This was going to be a /long/ night.

** " So,any boys you think are cute " Luna said in a near robotic tone.

" Why are you talking like that " inquired Ginny

" That's what Felicity and Kimberly ask each other when none of us can get to sleep " chipped her friend before adopting a quieter tone " They never ask me though "

Ginny made a mental note look for anything she could use as leverage over Luna's roommates before she responded.

" Well you know I dated Michael and he was very cute " Their mutual first breakup had been a bad experience but they were back to being friends after Michael had hexed Zabini after he made a rather repulsive comment. " Justin and Roger from Hufflepuff are cute as well and so's your Potion partner Luca "

Luna took her response in " So.. you like Harry "

Ginny sputtered " No..No..No.. we're mates ! Just like I am with Neville and Colin and Seamus and Dean and Tony and Terry and Michael and Ernie and.... ! "

" Aren't you dating Dean ? " quizzed Luna

More like trying to get him to finally make a move for Parvati,Ginny thought before answering " Well it's not very serious you see "

Luna nodded " Uh,huh "

I don't know what else to do with this

Ah, Vengeful Protective Big Sister Ginny is Best Ginny.

I also love how Luna is apparently completely aware of Ginny's feelings for Harry, but also completely Luna about it.
