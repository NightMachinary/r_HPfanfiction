The fic should describe why there is an advantage to being a pureblood and talk about culture.


** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) in addition to the political rights associated with being a pureblood (right to go to Hogwarts, etc) purebloods have less chaotic magic and have magical alignments that muggleborns lack. Fem Harry is a halfblood who feels her lack of pureblood rights keenly.

Linkffn(the long game by inwardtransience) wizarding Britain is based on feudal culture and pureblood Houses and those who marry into them are given many rights that those without a House lack. For example, when a House pureblood and a muggleborn divorce, child custody is automatically granted to the pureblood. Over half of the wizarding population is disenfranchised in this way.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/][Only Enemies]] had some pretty cool inherited magics in there if I remember right. Dumbledore teleports Harry and accidentally Bellatrix to an alternate dimension where Voldemort is dead. The dialogue in it could use a bit of work but it's still a fun read for the most part.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
