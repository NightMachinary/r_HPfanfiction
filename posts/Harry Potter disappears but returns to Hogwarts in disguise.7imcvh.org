So I had an idea and wanted to know if it has been done before. Harry gets sick of the attention as the Boy-Who-Lived and decides to start afresh. He creates a back story for his new persona and learns how to permanently change his features, including getting rid of his scar and glasses. After meeting McGonagall as his new character a few times to arrange everything for starting the next year at Hogwarts (so that Harry disappearing and this new character appearing don't happen at the same time), he disappears from the Dursleys house and slips into his new persona.

So, anyone know if it has been done before?

Edit: Does it even sound like something you would want to read?

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

**** This is the first one that came to mind. The whole concept cracks me up and I liked it a lot, especially since most of the other stories I've seen where Harry comes back under an assumed name are much darker.

Linkffn(The Bone Man)is the only other one I could remember the title of lol

**** I honestly don't know if there's any really good ones. I read them all when my standards for fanfiction were quite low. I'll list a few I can remember off the top of my head though. Don't remember how good they were though. They're all incomplete though.

Linkffn(Season of Change) I think this one is good.

Linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) This one has that dumb political shit where 15 year olds speak all formal and whatever to certain people.

Linkffn(To Reach Without) Big angst here, awkward dialogue pacing (giant paragraphs of text between single lines of dialogue make it feel super slow), and the author feels kinda pretentious with his constant changes of spell incantations.
