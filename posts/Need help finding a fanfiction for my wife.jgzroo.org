:END:
She is trying to find s specific fanfiction and is having troubles finding it. This is what she said she remembers:

"Its a harry potter fanfic where vernon kills harry but voldemort saves him by sacrificing Peter Pettigrew and reviving harry whom becomes his heir. He then becomes friends with the inner circles children and goes to Durmstrang with Theodore Nott, Draco Malfoy, and a few other children from the inner circle. It is a TheoxDracoxHarry ship but is not tagged as so. Also, he never went to Hogwarts. "

Any luck finding it would be INCREDIBLY appreciated!
