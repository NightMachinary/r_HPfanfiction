So yeah, I love when Dumbledore is not the paragon of the Light he claims to be, but I don't actually want to read any fics where Dumbledore shouts "FOR THE GREATER GOOD" every second sentence (unless it's well done AND a crackfic).

Let me put some examples of what I like:

- Anything by Athey (Rebirth, Meddling of a Mischief Maker, Professor Monroe, Again and Again...)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3471134/1/A-World-of-Difference][A World of Difference]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6747856/1/Forging-Destiny][Forging Destiny]] & sequel

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6990881/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Alternative-Tournament][HP and the Alternative Tournament]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Irish-Choice][HP and the Irish Choice]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][HP and the Summer of Choice]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11494723/1/Memoirs-of-Consort-Slytherin][Memoirs of Consort Slytherin]]

I don't mind if it's het or slash, or if it's explicit in nature, or if Harry goes either neutral or dark. I just want Harry not being one of Dumbledore's (or the Order's) lackeys. I don't care if it "bashes" other characters. Please no Robst.


** I don't think liking manipulative Dumbledore makes you trash. I think the idea is interesting in theory, but in practice, its often a bunch of writers who hate Dumbledore and whose writing of him is the equivalent of an older siblings repeating what you say in a stupid sounding voice to mock you.

*** thank you! I know there are plenty of Dumbles bashing lovers out there, but I wouldn't count myself with them because I don't want to read about idiots (e.g. I HATE with a passion a stupid Harry or without basic survival skills).

Albus falls out of the picture pretty early but Harry grows a set and the bit of Hermione's crisis of faith is beautifully written.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** Linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind) This has to be one of the best manipulative!dumbledore fics I've read. It is one of the few fics I've seen where dumbledore isn't incompetent, overly arrogant, or constantly shouting "The Greater Good" at every turn. I would highly recommend it.

Wherein Harry raises his younger self, dances the political dance with Death Eaters and a resurrected Tom Riddle, and searches for a way to stop the destruction of the magical world. OldHP/TMR.

** I mean, have you never read HPMOR. To me, thats manipulative Dumbledore to the max, without the cliches. Harry has a pet rock as a child, and Dumbledore removes it. How much more manipulative can you get.

And if you haven't read HPMOR, the common complaint is that Harry is too smart. There is a reason for that, and its explained well.
