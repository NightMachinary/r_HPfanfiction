I've read a few, one that sticks out in my mind is one where Bellatrix sexually tortured Harry in great detail. Another one was where Harry essentially summons some demons to take care of Voldemort and the Death Eaters, which they also do in great detail.

I /wrote/ part of one as my Camp NaNoWriMo fic for July 2015 and I haven't really looked back at it since. It was set in the next gen, with Harry's daughter and Neville's (OC) daughter getting caught up in human trafficking and actually made myself actually cry when looking at stories of people who had actually experienced it and trying to apply it to my characters. Then there was one character whose father was involved in the whole thing who was best friends with the OC Neville's daughter (purely platonic) and when he found out the true depravity of his father's actions, he had a nervous breakdown.

I /may/ consider tackling that fic and doing a tamed down version someday, but for now... nah. I don't like (seriously) hurting my characters. I don't think I can really /do/ disturbing.


** I tend to outright avoid fics that are intended to be disturbing, and don't really read smutfics so mine might be a bit milder then most. I semi-often nope out of slash fics when they involve obsessive, stalkerish behaviour or someone trying to 'convert' Harry. It seems to be a common trope with those and as someone that was briefly on the receiving end of that sort of attention, it creeps me out a ton.

** A year or two ago, I read a few rape fics in the hope that "brutal revenge" would be the endgame, "law-abiding citizen" style. Needless to say, I got disappointed again and again. However, one which stuck out was FemHarry being forced into sexual slavery by the goblins and ending with Stockholm syndrome and FemHarry returning to the goblins after her /term/ was over.

Around the same time, a mate suggested a victorious goblin rebellion prompt. So I fused that with the desire to see the goblins punished from the fic above and then came up with a fic set in the early 70s where Bellatrix is the (anti)hero and basically an IRA-style terrorist against the goblins. I think it says a lot about the first fic when I made terrorist!Bellatrix the hero against the "love interest" from there. Never published it, but it's still on my GDrive.

There's plenty of other disturbing shit on Ao3, but nothing which made me hate a "love interest" that much.

**** I mean, you could literally do a "law-abiding citizen" style fic where you are not sure whom to root for, the guy enforcing the law or the vigilante because the vigilante has a point but is also going way too far. But far too many fics end up with Stockholm syndrome, intended or not. And way too many romanticise that kind of shit.

*** Ao3 is like the most evil website when it comes to fanfiction. Yesterday I was scrolling through it and saw a fic with a description that basically said it was about adult Harry and Draco violently sexually abusing baby Scorpius.

Time and again I'm convinced that they can't sink lower yet I'm proven wrong.

I won't be hypocritical and say I haven't read/enjoyed many high quality smut stories on ao3 but that website has ALWAYS allowed the worst of the worst people to post their shit on it. There's so many truly fucked up minds on that website.

More and more I'm of the opinion that that website should be removed from the internet. Mostly because it's virtually impossible to truly filter out ("creator chose not to use warnings") all the depravity and there's no way to make sure only an 18+ audience uses it. There are very few fics exclusive on ao3 that are actually good and you can't find on ffn.net so it wouldn't that big of a loss.

Also, ffn.net doesn't beg their readers for money every month or so. What they do with said money? Well, they certainly don't pay moderators to filter out pedophilia and rape. Then again, ffn.net makes its income with ads and I doubt any self respecting company would be willing to place ads on a website like ao3.

Perhaps Raid shadow legends might be interested?

** I can tolerate 99.9% of disturbing topics, but I noped out of a fic that had a 16-year-old commenting on a 12-year-old's arse out of the blue. Disgusting.

The most disturbing fic I've ever read, though, had Harry getting possessed by Ignotus Peverell, raping Dumbledore's corpse, and killing Ginny to rape her corpse as well. At least it was written as a horror story, not fucked-up wank material.

** I once read a deeply disturbing fic that was basically about Harry having to become a sexual slave for the Greater Good â„¢. It was horrifying and not at all what I'm normally into, but it was so well-written that I couldn't stop reading. The topic itself was handled very well and the author clearly understood the nuances of what they were writing, but I seriously regret ever finding that fic.

** I see in replies most going for particularly savage torture or rape and things along those lines but for me the most disturbing stories are the ones with angst filled Harry who has PTSD, anxiety attacks, panic attacks, with wild mood swing and all the rest of the depressing thing you can think of. A Harry that depressed to the point that he barely functions.

I try to avoid stories with this kind of Harry but every once in a while one slips thru or I gave one mild looking story a chance and regret it fairly quickly.

** there've been a couple. there's one fairly popular series with a fem!Harry (the name escapes me), that was engaging enough that I let the poor grammar and squicky storyline slide, but oof. definitely not on my "re-read" list.

then there was a story I legit couldn't finish (which almost never happens). it was definitely a case of dead dove lmao, the author said very clearly, "here's what's in the story" and my dumb butt read it anyway ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜µ (eta, I read about half because the author did a really good job of writing about it, and the plot was legit engaging, but eventually the combination of squick and I couldn't suspend disbelief anymore just made me nope out)
