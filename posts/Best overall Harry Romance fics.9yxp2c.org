** You're pretty much left with Hinny or Harmony, both of which I hate, Harry/Fleur or Tonks which I've never read done realistically, Harry/Daphne tend to come off as forced, and I refuse to read harem fics. Harry and Luna work, but only if Luna is not written as a seer or a lunatic.

**** Yeah, I suppose... I personally like crossovers, but even those tend to have a lot of slash.
