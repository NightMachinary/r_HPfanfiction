  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

** More or less anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1508866/Voice-of-the-Nephilim][Voice of the Nephilim]]. They are incredibly good at writing horror and even if the story isn't overtly horror there's still going to be lots of scary shit involved.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** Somebody already mentioned VotM, but I'd like to rec their Sole Survivor and Concentric Wavelengths in particular. Sole survivor, rather fittingly, given your comment, is about a disease outbreak. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6888519/1/Sole-Survivor]])

Concentric wavelengths is my favorite version of the Department of Mysteries debacle. FYI, it discounts DH lore. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/Concentric-Wavelengths]])

That which Holds the Image is a Dr. Who crossover, but you don't need to know anything about Dr. Who to get scared. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/]])

Deathly Hallowed is incomplete but also scary. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/]])

  A plague has swept across Britain, wiping out the Muggle population. Ignorant of his heritage and the magical world, a ten year-old Harry Potter is left to fend for himself against two factions, each plotting and conspiring to find him before the other.

  Trapped within the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Harry is entangled in a desperate, violent battle against both the Death Eaters and a horrifying creation of the Unspeakables, with time itself left as his only weapon.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.
