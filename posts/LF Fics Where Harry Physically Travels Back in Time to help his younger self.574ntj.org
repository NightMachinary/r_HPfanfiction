Time travel / redo fics have always been a guilty pleasure of mine, but almost all of the ones I've read have had Harry sending his soul / memories back into his younger body, but I wanted to look for more traditional time travel fics, where Harry from the future physically travels back in time to help his younger self. I read something sort of along these lines the other day. Harry was attempting to send his memories back to his younger self but they accidentally get obsorbed by Lochart. Its pretty funny. The only other one I remember was one where Harry & Daphne send themselves back in time to help their younger selves and try to help them get together earlier. Anyway, let me know any suggestions you guys may have. I would prefer the person being sent back is a future Harry but I'm ok with other people too, I just want the fic to be Harry-centric. Thanks!

  What if Voldemort had not called for a cease-fire half-way through the final battle? What if the death toll had continued to mount until in the end, Harry stood victorious but alone?

  Wizard lack common sense. Hermione had declared that in their first year at Hogwarts. Well, even after the war, with Voldemort dead, wizards refused to change the things that were important to prevent events that led to the war in the first place to repeat themselves. Time for Harry to make sure, at the right time and place, to teach them.
