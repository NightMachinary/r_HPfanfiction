I was actually reading an article on My Immortal (I never read the fic and wanted to understand why so many hated it so i researched it a bit) and alot of different things said ff.net was probably the trashiest place for fanfic, which shocked me because it is the largest, it is where most of the fics i love are on, and there are tons of excellent writing there. I plan to post my fic there anyway.

But where do you all post? What do you think? And is My Immortal up to still be read cause I'd like to just lol at the few snippets i've seen posted


** When you get right down to it, Quotev and Archive-of-our-Own are the best sites in theory --- the formatting is easier, posting is easier, and in /Archive/'s case, there's a really great tagging system. On the other hand, while fanfiction.net is home to a lot of bad fics, it's also where most of the /really/ good ones are. /Seventh Horcrux/, /Red-Headed Stepchild/, /The Arithmancer/, /Methods of Rationality/, /Forests of ValbonÃ«/, it's all there. There are certainly a couple of good stories on Ao3 if you look long enough, but there's a /lot/ of bad ones, and most importantly there's a /lot/ of smut and shipping. Fanfiction.net generally has more traffic, as far as Harry Potter fanfiction goes --- at least more of the /respectable/, pants-wearing traffic.

The tagging system is /awful/. It's impossible to search for anything on AO3 with the unlimited tags and character/relationship listings. People end up listing every single thing that appears in the fic no matter how minor a role it plays. 90+% of your results in pretty much any search will be completely unrelated to what you're looking for. It'll be Drarry instead. Everything on AO3 is actually Drarry fic.

There should be an option to filter out any fic whose tags have a higher word count than the summary.

**** an option to filter out by tags would help a lot. like include/exclude options. does this exist at all on ao3? perhaps i have just not mastered the site yet, but tag searching has proved almost useless to me

like, for example, at least on ff.net i can exclude draco from my character searches if i want to avoid certain types of fics

Heheh. Look, I agree, but I wouldn't blame it on the system itself --- it's the writers using it. In theory, were fanfiction writers reasonable, the tagging system would be perfect. It just should be made clearer in the rules that small details oughtn't be tagged. (For character tags, maybe they should make two separate fields: "Major Characters" and "Characters Featured").

***** It was inspired by Charity Burbage's line in the beginning of the Seventh Movie (Severus please...we're friends). So I thought I'd write a fic coveing books 3-7 showing their friendship (How they met, their relationship (Not romance), etc.) It kind of sounds boring but I have alot of ideas for it, and I am trying to keep it very much in character. I just think it's a story that needs to be told.

Snape is my favorite character, and all the sacrifices he had to make, this one seemed to hit hardest for me. Like Snape I don't have alot of friends, I have 2 total. I find it hard to trust so I treasure the ones I have. And after everything thats happened and everything he's hard to go through and do to make sure Voldemort dies, and then to watch his last friend (As the others must have abandoned him due to killing Dumbledore) die as she pleaded with him to save her must have just been awful.

Anyway, I really want to tell that story well, and give it the utmost respect. I think I've seen it done a few times, but not alot like Severitus or others. I hope anyway or :((

******* Oh, thank you! I'm still on the first Chapter, I have my chapters planned out, so it's much easier I find to write that way (Even if it takes a bit longer) than writing on the spur of the moment with only your main plot in mind for the entire story.

It's been a bit difficult. Not much information is given about Charity, I've researched her as much as possible, but I also looked up a bunch of character studies to help authors build characters, and filled out a bunch of info on her and added more in, so I'm hoping she's okay. She's pretty much an OC besides her name. OC's I find hardest to write, cause you don't have the structure of the character to go by. So I know I should probably never write my own stories. But hopefully I can be decent enough at fanfiction XD

** I haven't written much and nothing HP, but I've posted my fics on ff.net. I find ff.net easier to search through when reading HP. Ao3 HP fics are mostly tagged with everybody that is ever mentioned in the story and I find that frustrating when searching for fics. But I agree that the rating/tagging system could be better on ff.net. I've never found a fic on my own cause there's like 40 people tagged and every freaking warning. The tagging is longer than the plot. So for me it's ff.net for HP fics and ao3 for my other readings.

** Fanfic.net is that place where there's a lot of bad, but when you find a good, it's really good. But my beef with it starts with it's rating system, and where an M is not really an M but a PG13. A lot of people on here and on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] prefer Ao3 because of how free it is, and how great the tagging system is. There's also not the fear that there's going to be a great purge like fanfiction.net circa 2012, and you're going to end up with your pants around your legs and all of your work gone.

My Immortal was a troll fic, making fun of a lot of the tropes found in HPFF and in general FF, so if I was going to call FFN a bad place to post, I wouldn't use that as my example. BUT I don't think it is. You have a larger audience, people are more willing to leave reviews compared to Ao3, and it has its share of great authors and good works.

** Like some of the other folks here, I post on both AO3 and FF.net. Back in the day, I used to post on Checkmated and Simply Undeniable (RIP). When I started writing again, I looked at FF.net, but their rating system seemed way too restrictive regarding adult content. Spoiler, I write a lot of adult content. So I went to AO3 and posted my stuff there. Then I started reading on this sub and seeing what fics are recommended on FF.net made me go, "Wait a minute! That's pretty dirty!" so I started posting things up on FF.net as well. If the smutty bits get taken down, oh well, I have another home.

Each site has its pros and cons. FF.net has a much wider readership--I've only been posting on FF.net since shortly before Christmas and some of my stories have gotten way more hits in a month than they ever got in a year on AO3. I like the stats on FF.net and how they break out hits and visitors, but the posting method leaves much to be desired. I'm on a Mac and there's an option to upload a file, but that doesn't work for me. Instead, I have to copy and paste, but the method doesn't accept any html tags. I use three asterisks to denote sections within a chapter and I didn't realize that when I save my file, those get removed. I have to go back and edit the uploaded document, find all of the section transitions and use their horizontal line tool. So now I have all 39 chapters of California Dreamin' without any section separators. Sorry for the confusion, people. I need to find a method of separating sections that FF.net won't reject.

Posting on AO3 is pretty easy. I go through and tag all of the italics, copy and paste into the text field and that's pretty much it. I don't go overboard with the tags and the ones that do annoy me. I do like that you can list more than four characters on AO3, unlike FF.net. Oh, also I like that AO3 has sections when you post for Author's Notes and you can choose to do either at the top or bottom. On FF.net, any Author's Notes need to be in the main body of the text.

** FFnet's only benefit is really the size of its audience. The description is very limited, you can't put many content tags on (but readers will whine if you don't warn for content/ships, etc), it's not very searchable, posting content is awkward through their shitty docs manager, and it's just plain ugly.

My favourite site to post to is Ao3. People usually have two complaints about it on this subreddit - that people overtag, and that there's too much slash. Tales of overtagging are vastly exaggerated, and when you see it, you pretty much know not to read the fic, and the complaint about slash is just silly. Ao3 was founded, in large part, for slash writers. As for its benefits, the reader base is often more mature, and I find the comments more helpful and less prone to trolling or childish complaints than FFN, though this is a generalization.

There are other sites, but there aren't much better alternatives.

Quotev is a very easy website to post to, but the userbase and content posted are both abominable. The majority if its userbase are young children below the age of 13, and this is reflected in the nature of the fanfic posted; Wattpad is much the same, the site populated by children. The children are demanding and entitled, but they are enthusiastic, and I'd recommend Wattpad or Quotev to someone starting out, who wants people to cheer them on from the out and are worried about their quality.

Adult-Fanfiction.org is a site to post smut and porn, and if you're writing oneshots or longer, plotty smutty stuff, there's a small but active audience there. They're not big commenters, though, and the site itself is both ugly and unwieldy.

Then, there's HarryPotterFanfiction.com and the archive at HPFanFicTalk. Both of these sites have small, but very active and responsive reader bases, primarily of more mature fans. The issue? The posting rules are insane. On the former, you cannot MENTION celebrities in your fic (even political figures, such as Elizabeth II or Tony Blair), and on both, if you quote one of the HP books, you have to cite the book and page. This includes if you include popular dialogue quotes.

The reason everyone uses FFN and Ao3 is because even though they have their respective flaws, the alternative sites have MUCH smaller audiences and are often more difficult to post to. There's more pay-off in posting to these two, and you're generally best off cross-posting on both sites.

For one Harry Potter AU, I update on Ao3, FFN, AFF, Wattpad and a Snape&Harry archive called Potions & Snitches, but for the vast majority, I post only on Ao3, sharing a handful of fics on FFnet as well.
