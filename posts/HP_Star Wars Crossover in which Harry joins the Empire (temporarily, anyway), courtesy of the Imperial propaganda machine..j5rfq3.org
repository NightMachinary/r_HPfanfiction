Hear me out. Harry arrives in the Star Wars universe via time turner accident or accidental magic. Instead of landing on a neutral planet or with the Rebels, he lands right in the heart of a major Imperial planet (say Coruscant or Naboo, both centers of Imperial control). He finds himself surrounded, not by squalor, slavery, and war crimes, but by what appears to be a thriving near-utopia. The only problems he can really see are caused by "political troublemakers" and "bloodthirsty terrorists", as the Rebellion is referred to in the news cum propaganda.

Even if Harry chooses not to believe the Holonet media, the people he talks to discretely are quite happy with their lot in life. No one talks about gauche subjects like Wookie slaves or the poverty on Tatooine in public. The people who DO know the truth about the Empire's excesses are unlikely to come into contact with a nobody like Harry; in that group are high ranking military officers, some Senators (assuming Harry comes around before the destruction of Alderaan), and the system governors.


** I'd expect Harry to have a serious distrust for authorities in general, and the Empire's anti-alien propaganda would really get up his nose.

*** Really depends on who he runs into and how well they sell the empire.

“They call themselves ‘Rebels,' but really they are terrorists - murderers and thieves, using propaganda to destabilize and destroy everything they touch.”

If it's Palpatine, he could easily spin them as a parallel to the Death Eaters.

**** Note that that's EXACTLY what Voldemort and the Death Eaters said; Death Eater propaganda stated that they fought for the rights of Purebloods and the restoration of the old ways. Coming from the Rebels, by all appearances a terrorist organization, Rebel propaganda is going to sound EXTREMELY familiar in the worst way possible.

***** Yess

Also if someone dropped out of the sky from a completely different galaxy, Palpatine is going to take interest

****** Depends on how he arrives. If he arrives in a giant explosion of light and Force Energy, then yeah, Palpatine and just about everyone on Coruscant is going to notice. If he just wakes up in a medical center, having been found unconscious and bereft of any form of id, it's more likely that he'll be able to spin a story that satisfies local authorities.
