Is there any story, that has more "human" races? Preferably on both side of SoS but I'll take what you have.

Preferably the mainstays of fantasy like Dwarves, Elves (proper ones), Halflings. Maybe even some more exotic ones like Tieflings.


** *[[https://www.quotev.com/story/10314057/Harry-Potter-The-Fight-For-Rights/1][The Fight for Rights]] has a lot of sapient species, both humanoid and not. It's pretty nice. My own linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor) is all about sapient species, but I do not plan to add any more than there already are in canon (but then, dwarves and ogres and alizors and vampires already exist in canon even though they're underused!).

linkffn(One World) also has a lot of sapient species (inculding drow) but they don't appear a lot.

linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) worldbuilds a lot about Goblin culture, and features an interesting take on what the /Harry Potter/ universe's Dwarves (who were namedropped once or twice but never featured in canon) might be like.

*** Thanks!

I don't like goblins, so I probably won't touch the last one. So, can you spoil to me how the author portrayed the dwarves?

One World premise seems interesting, although I have a particular dislike of the two youngest Weasleys, especially as a pairing materials (that's why I hate canon shipping), so I don't know how it'll go for me.

The Fight for Rights... is this fem!Harry or am I missing something coming back here after just first line?

The one by you seems interesting. I'll check it out.

Yeah, I know, I'm very selective. /shrug/

PS. What the hell is an "alizor"?

**** /Vaults of Stone/: Dwarves were portrayed as living Wales; they were shown to have long been close rivals of the Goblins before the wizards began fighting both into servitude. But where Goblins eventually gave up and submitted (later Goblin Rebellions notwithstanding), the Dwarves refused to surrender and were hunted nearly to the last. They are widely believed to be mostly extinct today, except for some rootless Dwarves living on the edge of the wizarding world in places like Diagon Alley, but there is actually still a full-Dwarf fortress hidden somewhere, which the Goblins are aware of. Dwarves can use magic like Goblins, and used to use staves as opposed to wands, which they are expert at making (woodwork is their specialty in contrast to the goblins' smithing), and the wealthier goblins work around the wand ban by buying staves from the Dwarfs.

As far as I recall, /One World/ was abandoned long before it got late enough for ships to matter. I could be wrong, eh.

/The Fight for Rights/ is a fem!Harry, yes. (A lesbian fem!Harry, for the record.) It's not a perfect story, but it's certainly unique and the worldbuilding is on point.

I hope you'll like my story! By the way, I just remembered an additional one that may interest you, linkffn(Harry Potter in the forests of Valbonë), which is an awesome story by all accounts and has a race of Albanian creatures more or less resembling fey, they're hard to describe. It also has goblins, but mostly as an unseen antagonistic force.

An Alizor is [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/7/71/Alizor_of_Westacottus.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100624142303][this thing]] --- a sort-of-elf-like underground-dwelling creature. They were created for the movies, where they appear as one of the creatures shown in /The Monster Book of Monsters/. They're very debatably canon, but I like them, and they're prime material for a fic trying worldbuild more races into the Potterverse while not straying too far from canonnish material.

Maybe I'll check it out, but I was counting more on human-like races.

By the way, canon elves /are/ the original standard --- Tolkien messed everything up, but it's not like Rowling picker her elves from a hat, they're very similar to what everyone described elves as /before/ Tolkien. (Tolkien's Elves, if they resemble anything, are more like the Fair Folk than elves.)

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

***** I read many stories with sympathetic Goblins. Making them anything from poor oppressed minority up to born soldiers on par with the Turians. None made me drop the story, but if it was mostly focused on them I would abandon it, or rather wouldn't even start reading it.

To be honest, I don't hate them or anything, I just find them to be unexciting as a story subject. Using the ME as a metaphor again, they're like Volus. No matter how awesome you made them unless they'll be so AU they'll be Volus by name only, they'll be just that. Volus. Same goes with the Goblins.

************ Ah yes, the old sandwiches problem. Well, while McGonagall is the Transfiguration Professor, there's no telling that this plate was Transfiguration --- I believe it was actually a plate to summon normally-made food from the kitchens, in the same way as the food appears on the Hogwarts tables.

As for the "Transfiguration is permanent" problem, that's where we run into a snag that Rowling didn't bother to properly fill. Were food easily transfigurable, wizards would seem like utter jerks for not using that power to solve world hunger among muggles, not to mention they wouldn't have any use for home-made Weasley cooking, House-Elf kitchens and all that stuff. So obviously there /must/ be an objection, but no one knows what it is.

I have a few theories running about.

The first is that Transfiguration is only as accurate as the mage's idea of what they're doing --- so if you try to transfigure a chicken, it'll /look/, /feel/, and, if it's alive, /act/ how you think a chicken ought to act; but unless you're a wizard with very precise knowledge of biochemistry, it might be made up of all the wrong chemicals. There could be cyanide in that Transfigured pizza you made, and copper in that maple syrup.

The other is that a living being's magic (and they all have a /bit/ of magic, though in humans only wizards can use it to a meaningful degree) will revert a Transfigured item to its former state as soon as it ends up inside the body, with all the problems that entails.

(This is why Transfigured gold is essentially worthless --- sure, it's gold at first glance, but it could vanish with a quick spell. Alchemy cannot be reversed and that is why the Philosopher's Stone is so special.)

Also, you slipped and used "magician" again instead of "mage", when Adelyn explains she has lived for longer than Annabelle could imagine and blah blah blah. About that, also, Adelyn says she's been saving up for 300 years --- is she only 300 years old? Because there /are/ wizards who lived that long, not to mention Flamel and his wife with their Philosopher's Stone, who lived forover 650 years...

Oh, and I can't help but notice there is a dearth of male characters in this story. I understand if you're more comfortable writing females, but for reasons of sheer realism, at least /some/ incidental characters like some of the Spiders and Inn patrons ought to be male.

I thought canon wizards only lived to like 150 at most? Like it was not THAT crazy long than normal humans? Sorry Achille! I guess I have forgotten a lot of minor harry potter details!!! I have not read them all through the whole way in a while I think!

But yes, Adelyn is meant to be OVER 300 years old. Her original thirty years as a human, and then a hundred years or so trying to get acclimated to being a vampire, and then the three hundred years she started to get into her groove and start her wealth accumulation. :) A lot of her backstory is going to be shown later, because it is VERY long. :P

And Achille, yes I noticed it too actually... :( Achille I'm sorry, I suppose it is just that yes I am a girl, and there are way too many shows and movies and video games where the girl characters are all minor or absent or written badly or kept away from plots and so much else, and so I just wanted to make up for that for my own gender and give lots of girls good and major roles and plots and stuff! :( But Achille I do understand what you mean that I have like no boy characters at all because of this, and I think I went overboard with it, and I am sorry!

**************** A good character to include (unless he's dead in this story?) might be Dumbledore. He sounds like he'd go along with Annabelle's movement, at least support it in private, and at best help her influence the Wizengamot into giving Beings more rights.

As to wizards living for such a long time, it's certainly /unusual/, but remember that Grindelwald is the same age as Dumbledore (so about 115), and his /great-aunt/ Bathilda Bagshot was still alive and well in 1998 when Nagini killed her. If you follow the movies' canon, Dumbledore's predecessor as Headmaster, Armando Dippet, also live well beyond 250, dying at some point in the early 1990's (though he was getting senile by the second half of the 20th century).

And ah, your story's vampires /did/ use to be humans? I tend to have them as a separate species, but of course canon doesn't answer that question, and both ideas are equally valid.

You can NEVER stop thinking. So yes that will be me going to a very disturbing place for a few seconds. :)

Also I did this because it would explain why Voldemort or anyone else wanting to be immortal didn't just go find a vampire and ask to be bitten by them. :)

****************** I noticed all those aspects, yes, and it's a very clever and creative concept. Love it, looking forward to see where it goes. (Where do those vampires stand on the blood-sucking and hypnotic aspects, though?)

As I said, in my headcanon, I worked off the fact that vampires in canon are mentioned to be Beings (not cursed humans like werewolves --- /being/) and a namedrop of a "half-vampire". So for me Potterverse vampires were never normal humans, they're a separate species like Veela; they, naturally, feed on other creatures' blood, and, if they suck off the blood of a wizard, can absorb part of his magical ability. However, they aren't specially SUPERAWESOME --- they can turn into bats or wolves, yes, but Animagi can do that too, and climb walls barehanded, but wizards can easily do that. Overall they're much like Goblins and Veelas: just another magical humanoid species who was fearsome to medieval muggles but not any serious threat to wizard domination.

But again, that's just /my/ headcanon, and yours is wonderful too!

******************* Oh! Well Achille my vampires will still have to drink blood, and they do get some classic vampire powers like hypnosis and turning into bats, but that is it. :) I want them to stay as something you would NEVER want to be turned into. :)

I had no idea vampires were a separate, unique species in harry potter world!!! :) Yes I do really need to reread the series, because I have forgotten a lot of details it seems! :) :) :) :) It is a good thing I love reading harry potter. Your headcanon is very interesting, more than mine, because yes yours are their own thing! I have rarely seen that done except I think in a movie once where they were more like giant bat monsters natural to the earth like dogs and stuff instead of intelligent beings. :)

******************** It's not cut-and-dry in canon --- after all, the Ministry does classify Werewolves as "Beasts" even though they're just cursed humans. So don't worry, while canon may /hint/ otherwise, your version doesn't /contradict/ anything; and as I said, it's really nice!

By the way, have you edited "acromantula" out of references to Nyllia and her colony?

****************** Yes! That's very good! Maybe she could join Annabelle in revisting Hogwarts someday. She'd know about things like the Room of Requirement (and maybe even the Chamber of Secrets, and things /no one/ in the present-day even remembers!), but at the same time she'd be kind of lost because of how much the building must have changed over a millenium (seeing how its corridors and classrooms move around slightly ever year).
