** Seems inevitable that "other" is going to win, given the small number of options.

(Also doesn't include non- Harry related pairings, which I personally read a lot of but again aren't as popular on this sub).

Example, you have James/Lily, but no Severus/Lily or Remus/Lily. There's no Wolfstar or Drarry. It's also lacking in Slytherin characters, which I feel might be popular like Narcissa/Lucius or Bellatrix/Voldemort.

I've also pointed out that for this one, if you're only asking reddit, you may want to change the nature of the survey from "Most Popular" to "Most Popular on Reddit". The community on reddit, I feel, is predominately male, which is actually very different from most HP ff groups I have been on, which have been predominately female. Just that alone is going to give you very different results in terms of preferred pairings. Look at the survey Taure posted from DLP. That gives Harry/Fleur as their most popular Het Harry pairing when I would have thought it was Harry/Hermione just based on the amount of Harmony stuff on ffnet. To better claim "Most Popular" you'd have to take this survey to different communities, which you stated you don't have the time to do.

** I would assume that quite a few of the people who voted "other" would ship Drarry, because that seems to be one of the most popular pairings.

That said, I'm surprised by Harry/Hermione leading over Harry/Ginny, especially since I've seen unbiased polls on other sites having Harry/Ginny by far over Harry/Hermione. Then again, this poll is in the realm of fanfiction communities, so I guess I should not be that surprised.

I really think that the Top 5 most popular pairings among the HP fandom at large (from what I've seen), and not just fanon communities are:

- Draco/Hermione
- Ron/Hermione
- Harry/Ginny
- Draco/Harry
- Neville/Luna

***** Let's take a look! I'm listing fics based on a specific pairing in the tags for AO3 (archiveofourown.org) because they are a fairly popular archive and they have a better tag system than fanfiction.net.

So doing a quick tag search on AO3 for all stories, no matter the length, language or completeness:

Draco & Hermione - 2,267

Ron & Hermione - 3,275

Harry & Ginny - 2,468

Neville & Luna - 345

Snape & Harry - 5,588

Snape & Hermione - 1,426

Draco & Harry - 10,863

According to this, Snape/Hermione is more popular than Neville/Luna but less so than Ron/Hermione. Also Snape/Harry is a lot more popular than all of these except for Draco/Harry.

This list is not 100% accurate because those numbers reflect the pairing as tagged in any given story. For example, I read a lot of Drarry stories and Ron/Hermione often appear as a side pairing so I believe their larger number here likely reflects stories where they appear as supporting/side characters, because if you compare stories on grangerenchanted.com (Hermione centered fic archive), there are only 30 fics for Hermione/Ron compared to 594 for Hermione/Snape and 1,211 for Hermione/Draco. But for the sake of argument, I'm willing to let it stand as is. So based on this, we were both correct. Ron & Hermione are popular but so is Snape/Harry.

****** I don't doubt these numbers. But one needs to put them in context. Not every fan writes fanfiction. When I talk about the pairing popularity, I'm not talking about number of fics. I'm talking about the fandom as a whole. For example, according to Fanlore.org:

#+begin_quote
  As of May 13, 2010 there were 14,142 fics marked as Harry and Ginny on fanfiction.net, though it is unknown how many of these are not about a Harry/Ginny relationship but rather about them interacting in some other context. This compares to 14,689 marked as Harry and Hermione.
#+end_quote

Yet, on Goodreads.org, which has nothing to do with Fanfiction, I saw a poll, that Harry/Ginny have 58.1% of the votes and Harry/Hermione have 21.9%, where 1204 people voted. Most polls on Fanpop.com on the Harry Potter fanpage confirm these numbers, despite the Harry and Hermione fanpage having more members than the Harry and Ginny one.
