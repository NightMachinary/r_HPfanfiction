So I just finished slogging through the Firebird's Son trilogy, and I feel the need for something light and a little stupid. I've had a look through some older posts but can't quite find anything that fits.

I'm looking for something where Harry fixes every problem, he free's the elves, finds common ground with the goblins, redeems the bad guys, helps everyone with their homework and everything work out perfectly in the end.

No bashing, no dark!harry, don't care about pairings and not interested in OC, AU or OOC stuff. Correct spelling and grammar a plus, but not essential.

  A young boy in a dark cupboard is in great pain. An unusual power will allow him to heal himself, help others, and grow strong in a world of magic. Eventual God-like Harry, Unsure of eventual pairings. Alternate Universe, possible universe/dimension traveling in the future.

***** I second this. /Core Threads/ is easily the best Super!Harry fic I've read, mainly because it's extremely creative and doesn't pretend to be plausible or that the canon enemies are still a serious threat.

It's trying to pretend to be plausible that trips up the otherwise decent /The Unwilling Participant/ and, worse, /Runemaster/.

***** Does it look like it's wrapping up any time soon? It seems to be updated fairly reasonably, and I like to wait to read fics until they're finished, or most likely abandoned. (I already have so many fics I'm following I can't keep them all straight.)

** I think linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow]]) falls in the category. Now if you like it is not it's a matter of preference. I'm sure I have more, but off of the top of my head that fits all of your categories.

For a good laugh linkffn(make a wish) and any other story by him is quite good and always puts a smile on my face.

** Well, since you asked for over the top things, take this:

linkffn(7370842)

It's ... a story, that is quite over the top. That said, it's a crossover that's more wacky than anything so I don't expect it to be what you asked for (but if other people come in looking for over the top stuff and happen not to have such a filter, they'll have the link).
