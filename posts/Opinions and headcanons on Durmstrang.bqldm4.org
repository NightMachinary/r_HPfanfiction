** I like the headcanon in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Boy_Who_Lived]]), with the proviso that we get a biased view of it in that story, because we see it through the eyes of its top students.

From the point of view of someone with an average or below-average talent or work ethic, there would be less of how many First Places who is going to earn, who might skip how many grades, who is being courted by which Professor for an apprenticeship, and how much more stimulating Durmstrang is than Hogwarts; and more of the fear of being hexed (or worse) in the hallways for fun, of the desperate scramble not to fail a subject twice when the teacher won't give you the time of day much less any actual help, of a friend dropping out due to not being able to continue, all amid rumours about the kindly and supportive cultures of Hogwarts and Beauxbatons.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** In a broad sense I think it's status as the Dark Wizard school is vastly overblown due in part to being Grindelwald's alma mater and it's location.

Viktor is the school's current poster boy and he's most definitely not evil.

** I think Durmstrang takes the secrecy of its location much more seriously than Hogwarts does, and have established in my story that the only language allowed to be spoken there is Esperanto (or, if you prefer, some purely wizarding conlang), so as not to give the game away.

It is, besides, an entire school of Slytherins, namely one that, while not necessarily evil, thinks the dark wizard æsthetic is hella cool, and where, on orientation day, “dark overlord” is a completely expected career path for most students. Again, this does not necessarily mean that any of the people involved are particularly evil, though it does by definition produce more Dark Wizards than Hogwarts does. They just think dressing in black, having henchmen and fancy aliases, and getting your way by virtue of demonstrating great power make up a very cool attitude to strive towards. They set themselves apart from Slytherin in that they're not as much about scheming as they are about raw might. Dragons more than snakes.

Consequently, and much unlike Hogwarts, Durmstrang exists to raise /powerful/ wizards, not good ones. The Professors aren't trying to raise evil wizards, but neither are they trying for heroes; they're just here to help students realize their full potential; how they apply it is entirely the students' concern. With such an attitude, on the other hand, they must strictly enforce what discipline they do have, which includes not, for any reason, cursing at your teachers. Hence Grindelwald's expellment.

To try and explain what the frick Karkaroff was doing getting himself hired as Headmaster, I have long held the opinion that Durmstrang's protective enchantments are as strong as, if not stronger than, Hogwarts's own. Therefore, Karkaroff got the job because it guaranteed him as much protection against vengeful sold-out Death Eaters and a possibly-surviving Dark Lord as humanly possible.

**** Oh, Durmstrang isn't really prominent in the story at all; I just happened to mention that bit of my headcanon in it. The story's /The Parselmouth of Gryffindor/.

** agree with many of your ideas although I think they separate students based on their nationallity to have lessons in multiple languages. It is way bigger than Hogwarts because of this
