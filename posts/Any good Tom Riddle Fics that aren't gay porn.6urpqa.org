Hey, I'm new here. I feel like every time I go to look for TMR / Voldemort fics, I find Harry / Tom ones. And I don't want that. Ships are fine, but I'd prefer gen. AU and canon-compliant are fine. I just want something featuring Tom Riddle that isn't utter crap to read.


** linkffn(3155057) Altered Destinies is pretty good. It's a time travel fic to Riddle Era and has Harry raising Tom.

** The Right Hand Path - Fairly tame AU at first, but gets quite exciting towards the end. linkffn(3221511)

insurgere - Uses the rather fanon-y idea of Hufflepuffs having potential to be super dangerous. Great prose, from what I recall. linkffn(5846518)

A Very Secret Diary - Scariest Tom Riddle in the fandom, hands down. linkffn(10705988)

The Difficulties of Avoidance - Has certain plot contrivances, but I'm impressed with both Tom and Ginny's characterisations. linkffn(3833975)

** linkffn(The Evil Overlord List by boomvroomshroom) is always amusing, as, of course, is linkffn(Seventh Horcrux). My own linkffn(Tom Riddle and the Sorcerers' Stones by Achille Talon) has the premise that after the Forbidden Forest scene in Deathly Hallows, the Scar-Horcrux's piece of soul is sent back in Harry's body instead of him. linkffn(Rectifier by Niger Aquila) is pretty good too.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione has always been a warrior for the Light. But when an attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands her in 1944, she quickly realizes that sometimes it is best to allow a lesser evil to flourish, because defeating it only creates the conditions for a greater one to rise. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?
