So, recently, someone on that sub recommended linkffn(Harry Potter becomes a Communist) and I naively thought it would be a good fiction with arguments or a discussion about how it would applies to HP world. Turns out it is the most ridiculous communist-bashing but in a way so poorly written! Was any of you was really disappointed recently about a fic concept very poorly written (or completely delirious)?


** It's literally marked as a parody. I'm not sure what you were expecting.

** Ah, I saw that too but didnt start reading it yet. Sad to hear it /bashes/ Communism, since unlike for us Muggles, its a perfectly valid theory for Wizardkind.

Edit: I gave it a try. Wtf...

*** It could have displayed some kind of pro communist Harry, with a joking tone and some exaggeration, here it just sounds like some guy on Twitter feeling offended and trying to mock someone else
