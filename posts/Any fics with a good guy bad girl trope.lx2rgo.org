A lot of media and fics (especially dramione ones) have the good girl bad boy trope or like girl who saves brooding bad boy through love...

Any fics that have bad girl and good guy?

I feel like Pansy or Daphne could be good for this role.

** The Triplicity series by Idleside, starting with Best Behaviour, has Harry with Pansy and Daphne (and others). Warning, lots of smut, starts out almost PWP, but then a plot emerges.

  The wedding was lovely. Really. It was. Harry isn't even jealous that Ginny is marrying Draco, more frustrated that he's wound up at yet another wedding without a date.Pansy, still somewhat of an outcast after the war, has been left behind by her own date/flatmate after Blaise spotted a boy he was interested in.Daphne, having lost her standing in Pureblood circles thanks to a failed teenage romance, has shown up mostly for her own amusement. When these three "leftovers" find themselves without any other prospects at the end of the night, bemoaning their singledom at an afterparty at Daphne's flat makes sense, right? After all, they can't stay on their best behaviour forever.

*** One, this series is outstanding and I love it.

Two, I think only Pansy has a "bad girl" vibe in it, and even that is just... Olivia Newton John at the end of Grease sort of "bad" to me.

** I think you should look for stories with a Pansy/Neville pairing. Those, in my experience, are very much "Bad Girl/Good Guy".
