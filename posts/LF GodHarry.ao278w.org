The journey to becoming a God, or what he does after, I don't mind. Something like Frey of Asgard, or Dark and Light. Not just Godlike Harry, but God Harry. I want him to not only be OP af, but also be slightly detached from humans.

Gen or slash only please.

**** I haven't watched it either, though I have read some other crossover fics as well. If I remember correctly, the events are pretty far removed from storyline plot. You should just know who the main characters are, like who are the Winchesters and that Loki is a name the Archangel Gabriel uses. Then you should be good to go!
