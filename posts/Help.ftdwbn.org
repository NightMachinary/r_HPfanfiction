:END:
Harry goes to ‘elf' dragon school and is shunned because he can't do their magic. Tries to kill himself is saved by a dragon. Makes a friend of one of the people. And wins the battle competition with him. Also Harry learns the magic of the ‘elves' because he had to copy the magic books of the ‘elves' in class because the teacher hated him. Post prisoner of Azkaban or just pre goblet of fire. Ugh I can't remember. He was 14 or so. I forget.

Thank you May the Three Friends smile upon your path james
