Let me preface this with /”Yes, I am an idiot”/. I was reading a fanfic on incognito mode and it's gone with the wind.

It was my first time reading it, but I gathered it was an established fiction. Here is the basic plot that I had read so far:

Retelling of the story, Harry is raised by Aunt Petunia and her Professor husband (she dumped Vernon long before), to be very smart and follow scientific method of thinking.

Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw (“Better be Slytherin.... just kidding I mean Ravenclaw”)

Hermione is also sorted into Ravenclaw

Harry by the use of snapping his fingers, saying Abra kadabra and the use of a time turner has been able to fool the school at large to thinking that he has extra-wizarding powers

Has deduced that Voldemort is alive and using this, has blackmailed Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall for some school improvements

I haven't got much further than this and would really like to see where this plot goes! Help?

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** Note that the fanfiction community is rather divided over this one. Lots of people love it, while other times, just mentioning it can get you heavily downvoted.

If you've read that far and are still enjoying it, though, you're likely to enjoy the whole thing.

*** I'll be honest, I'm still divided by it, but now that I've started it I'm determined to see it through. I've read a lot worse for longer before giving up!

** I know that the ffnet version was already posted, but if you happen to be viewing this on mobile, the dedicated HPMOR website comes out looking much cleaner.
