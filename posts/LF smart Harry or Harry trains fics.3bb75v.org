Looking for fics where Harry trains or is trained to fight. It can be almost anyone (Dumbledore, Merlin, The Founders) as long as it's believable (no Voldemort) Snape is ok as long as it makes sense. They can even be fics where he trains himself or with Harmonie,Sirius or Remus. Just let them make sense. OK now what I don't want, I'm not into slash and people not making sense. Like, I don't want Snape to hate Harry for years than one day...BAM he has Lilly's eyes so I must help him. Can you help me out. Thanks ahead of time.

#+begin_quote
  Shortly before his 11th birthday, Harry Potter disappears from Privet Drive. Accidental Magic takes him halfway through the country, and while Harry tries to find his place in his new life of magic and mystery, the Wizarding World is left to deal with the consequences of his disappearance.
#+end_quote

Harry runs away from home, meets a certain someone (don't want to take the surprise away) and trains with him and alone. He has not yet returned to the wizarding world, but everything hints at that it will happen soon.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero) This is the first of a three part series, the second and third book take some weird turns but if memory serves me right the first falls in exactly what you are looking for.

On a side note, I HIGHLY recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time) by the same author. It isn't what you are looking for at all, but is a fantastic read in my opinion.
