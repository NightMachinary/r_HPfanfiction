Looking for serious politics-heavy fanfiction. Should feature no extra-powerful characters, no chessmaster things and absolutely no Lord Potter. Realistically written in terms of character's emotional development. What I'm looking for is something concerning Minister of Magic elections, or media in the wizard world, or judicial process, hopefully gritty in style.

I despise Methods of Rationality, so similar works are out.

There was this one fic on FFN that was written in a style of radio interview transcript between Lee Jordan and Finch-Fletley (I think), where they're talking about post-war trials. That's precisely something I'm looking for. If someone could help me locate that one, I'd be really grateful.


** I've written "Democracy", which deals with political reforms after the war. Politics also play a role in many of my other stories, though they are generally too AU to qualify as "Post DH".

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** You're looking for linkffn(An interview with Justin FinchFletchley)

And if you don't mind going old school, try linkffn(after the end by sugar quill) -- it's a very well done post war fic, written before OotP. The Ron and Hermione arcs were particularly well done.

  In the morning after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry felt tired. In the morning after the morning after, he was downright exhausted. The war may be over, but there are still battles to be fought.
