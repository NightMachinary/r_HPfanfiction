Looking for a fic where it's set in the future where sirius is a ghost type thing and Harry makes technology that can interact with magic, and he reveals magic to the world by hacking into everyone's TV and giving a broadcast where he explains magic, and making a book appear in all houses that further explains magic. I know it's at least somewhat epilogue compliant because Teddy is there. Thanks in advance!


** It's linkffn(unified theory by bouncing soul) and it's not very good. Start's out interesting but the ending is meh.

*** Holy shit thanks I've been looking for this fix for years now. Yeah I know it's not that good, otherwise I would have finished it, it just bothered me that I couldn't find it. Thanks so much!

**** The author's story, James Castle, is a fair bit better. The abandoned Green Dawn I had such hopes for.
