Cause I got one in my one shot collected. It was just some small stuff that they were peeves about saying it didn't happen but it actually was in the book. This case was Harry not knowing what a Death Eater was in GoF, which he didn't. Bill and Mr Weasley had to give him the run down.

You guys ever get one?


** Yeah. The one I remember off the top of my head was someone who came across as super condescending as they explained Hermione wore a pink dress to the Yule Ball, not a blue one. And all I could think was 1). This is a super petty thing to nit pick,and 2) book description versus movie costume.

***** Yes......

Read the first chapter of Deathly Hallows. The movies make no mention of it for some reason and had a deleted scene (that was still shot but didn't get put in the movie) where Dudley sort of apologized and told Harry that he (Dudley) didn't think Harry was a waste of space and shook his hand.

** If you have been a long while into Harry Potter and the associated fandoms it's pretty easy to mix up some facts about book-, movie- and head-canon. Doesn't necessarily mean that the person hasn't read the books.

I definitely read every book before I saw the associated movie to that book and I made mistakes like that.

Though the overconfidence deserves to be criticized.

** I sometimes get reviews that make me question whether these people are reading the same story that I'm writing :')\\
I have come to find that a lot of people have only seen the movies, rather than having read the books as well. Context or characterisation becomes very debatable because of that.

** I had someone sent me a private message, asking me if I could explain the Harry Potter series AS A WHOLE in a summary. They wanted to read my story, even though they had never read the series or watched the movie.

My story is set in Goblet of Fire era, and they asked me if Ron was a traitor in the series, like in my book, and that Harry and Hermione were a couple in the series.

Like... what? Never happened to me before.

** Well, it's not exactly related to HP, but I had a reviewer try and correct me when I described Hedwig, a snowy owl, as barking instead of hooting. The reviewer just told me that owls hoot, not bark, which is true for most owls, but not all. Snowy owls do bark.

** Reviews? As a reader, the fics are much more important than the reviews, and so many reviewers complain about ships or slash that I never read the reviews. But I've seen plenty of fics where the author obviously never read the books. Mostly it's spelling, spelling, spelling.

Creature/Kreature, Alohamora, stupify. Please read before you write.

**** Yeah, in most translations every name, spell and term is different than the english one so it matches the right "feeling" with it, except those of the Potters. I read them in Dutch, and the translations are suberb, honestly. Every one of them matches the exact right tone. Voldemort's birth name was also changed, so that the anagram worked in a Dutch sentence. Stuff like that.

Took me a while to connect every English name in the fandom to the ones I grew up with.

****** Marten Asmodom Vilijn, => Mijn naam is Voldemort.\\
Vilijn is quite a good translation, as it sounds very sharp, cruel and villainous (eeh) and Asmodom sounds very old and wizardry too. Marten is not a very common name though, not nearly as much as Tom at least.

It's most of the other translated names that just sound right on the spot. The Lestranges became The Van Detta's for example, that's just cool. Most others are delightful gibberish.

******* So they changed they translated name of other character too. In French, they did some little change (Longbottom became Londubat, Wood became Dubois and Snape became Rogue but that's pretty much all the change made.

Londubat and Dubois are pretty much litteral translation.

Someone "Rogue" is someone who is insolant, condescending, contemptuous. So work pretty well with book Snape, and is juste perfect for the film version.

******** It's a mix. A very few remain exactly as they are (the Potter) or are literal/phonetic translations (Lupin->Lupos / Snape->Sneep) but most are very different in order to convey the same feeling they evoke in Dutch language. Dumbledore becomes Perkamentus, after the dutch word of Parchment.

Maybe we should make a discussion tread about the translations in comparison. Just all the names alone are pretty amazing. Is it true that in French, a wand became a baguette? Or is it Baton?

********* Yes, the traduction of "Wand" is "Baguette" (the magic one, not the bread), a "baton" would be the bigger model, the Staff (though for magic, "Sceptre" can also be used depending of the item).
