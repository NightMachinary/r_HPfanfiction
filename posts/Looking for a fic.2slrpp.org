A teenaged girl - not sure if muggle or witch - named Serafina somehow gets caught up in the books-era war. I think she spends at least one night at Grimmauld Place before McGonnagall takes her to Hogwarts (its summer so no other students).

Some of the chapters focus more on Tonks, who in this story had a twin brother named Toby who disappeared (or was killed?) when they were children.

It was such an awesome fic but I just can't find it, and it physically pains me that I'll never read it again haha.


** It ~sounds~ like it might be a His Dark Materials crossover, though I could be wrong. It's happened before.

** Hmm I'm not sure it was, as I never read crossovers (but I guess it could have been?). I just tried to search for HP & HDM crossovers but nothing fitting is coming up. Ugh. I feel like this fic is gone forever :( haha

Does anyone else have any suggestions?
