Hi,

I'm looking for recommendations of post-war fics that focus on characters. Either the marauders era after they've left school, Harry's cohort as adults or next-gen learning about the war.

Ideally, the fics would be gen or at least not smutty. With well developed, sometimes fallible characters who develop friendships and have disagreements. No bashing.

Something like Pitry's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7374621/1/War-Is-Over][War Is Over]] and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7961051/1/Inter-Arma][Inter Arma]] would be great. I'm not looking for heavy action war scenes.

*** Thanks for the link. I'll give it a try, although Northumbrian's style usually isn't for me.
