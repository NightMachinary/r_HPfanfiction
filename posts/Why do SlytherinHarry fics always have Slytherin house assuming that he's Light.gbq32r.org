This is a classic attribute of the trip and it always confuses me. Every Slytherin!Harry fic I have has all the students shunning him for being the BWL, bullying him, etc.

But that /completely contradicts/ the information we get from Canon. Here's Snape talking to Bellatrix in HBP (when Narcissa gets the unbreakable vow):

  But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord's attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lord's old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle.

Seriously - this suggests /completely different/ Dark expectations of Harry than any I've ever seen in fanfic. Based on this, I'd expect a Slytherin sorting to result in fear and awe. They definitely wouldn't be bullying him straight of the bat - this is the kid /that defeated the Dark Lord./

It's kinda ironic. In fandom, usually Harry ends up proving his badass power to people who assume he's ill-educated and average. If this happened in Canon, the Slytherins would assume he's badass and powerful then slowly come to realize he actually knows nothing of their world and has zero training or experience.


** And of course there's Draco's overture to Harry on the train in book 1. Based on what he's learned about Harry Potter from his family, he seems to expect Harry to be friendly to him and the other 'right sort of people'.

*** I've always felt that no one (that I've seen, at least) correctly portrays Draco on the train. Until Harry said... I can't remember exactly. It's after Draco says something about 'the right sort'--- until then he wasn't hostile to Harry at all. In fact, while still his usual pompous self, he was rather agreeable, in a formal sort of way. Ron, however much I love him, was the first to snigger at Malfoy's name. Rather ironic, considering how much they're aggravated later, by Draco making fun of the Weasleys (to a further extent, granted.)

Hope this makes sense, I'm rather tired.

  ‘Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,' said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. ‘And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.'

  Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger.

  Draco Malfoy looked at him. ‘Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles and more children than they can afford.' He turned back to Harry. ‘You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.'

  He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it. ‘I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,' he said coolly.

  Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. ‘I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,' he said slowly. ‘Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riff-raff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid and it'll rub off on you.'
#+end_quote

Draco starts out polite, but he does go from 'Hi I'm Draco nice to meet you' to 'I hope you die like your parents' pretty fast.

****** We don't know that. We just know he wanted to ingratiate himself to the most famous person in his culture which with how self serving the Malfoys are he would do whether light or dark. Look at Lucius playing all oh poor imperioused me and pretending to be light for over a decade while using his wealth to buy influence and pretending to be the friend of the light MoM.

****** Actually it's quite an intelligent view that Draco knows that he can easily bring Harry to his side of the court if he becomes his friend. Harry's eleven and doesn't really have the strongest views about anything. If he was Draco's friends and in Slytherin I could easily see him becoming a blood purist. Not a sadistic murderer but still believing in the strength if blood.

******* Add to it that most the muggle Harry knows aren't nice to him. Whether it's the Dursleys, or people the Dursleys have convinced that Harry is a trouble maker. His teachers, neighbors. Even Arabella Figg, who he acknowledged as being better than others, ended up being a squib.

** In a word, Tradition. The Potter family is supposed the be light, just like the Blacks are supposed to be dark(this is why Sirius got shipped to Azkaban so quickly and without fuss).

As for Severus, he's likely talking out of his ass. iirc there were a lot of people in Azkaban with the mark, they had family outside, that believed Riddle wasn't dead. So why would their younger family flock to Harry if Riddle wasn't dead? That's just asking for trouble when Riddle inevitably comes back.

** In-universe? Tradition, defeating Voldemort, and being associated with Dumbledore/seemingly light figures. These fics tend to have an assumption from everyone that he'd go to Gryffindor.

Out of universe? A mix of wanting him to start isolated, and likely viewing canon through the lens that /of course/ Harry goes to Gryffindor.

*** I'm pretty sure it's canon that Lucius thought Harry was the next big thing in the Dark Lord Inc. line of baddies, until he actually showed up again and showed the world he was willing to literally kill himself just to stop the baddies again.

**** Canonically, we don't see Lucius mentioned until book 2 - by which point it's pretty clear that Harry isn't dark. (As in, the first mention of the word 'Lucius' is in book 2, chapter 3).

We can /maybe/ infer from how Draco acts earlier - but the thing with infering is that it's hard to say. Eg, the way it comes across to me is that for Draco, purity of blood is more important (Harry might have a 'mudblood' mother, but he's still a Potter, so he's acceptable as a friend/relation) - vs anything about being a dark lord/bad guy.

At least, if Lucius were seriously thinking that, I feel like he'd have *way* more heavily pushed Draco in that direction.

#+begin_quote
  Many different theories had been in circulation for years as to how Harry survived what should have been a lethal attack, and one of the most persistent was that Harry himself was a great Dark wizard. The fact that he had been removed from the wizarding community seemed (to wishful thinkers) to support this view, and Draco's father, wily Lucius Malfoy, was one of those who subscribed most eagerly to the theory. It was comforting to think that he, Lucius, might be in for a second chance of world domination, should this Potter boy prove to be another, and greater, pure-blood champion

** 1.) We don't even know if Sev was telling the truth or not. He's trying to make Bellatrix not think of him as a liability to the cause so I don't for a moment think he's telling the truth.

2.) Someone had to spread the idea that Harry survived. Someone who had him taken from his guardian before his guardian was in legal trouble. Someone had to spread news of the Boy-Who-Lived. Someone had to try and raise morale. By this I mean Dumbledore. If Dumbles acted as Harry's spokesman in any way, it'd be understandable. I mean, the dude controlled every aspect of Harry's life despite having no right to, so who is to say he didn't do this as well?

3.) James Potter was a bully to other students, especially Slytherins. Even when he promised Lily he stopped, he never did. He had it in for Slytherin before he even officially started at Hogwarts. His dislike of Slytherins and people on Voldy's side is well-known to everyone but Harry apparently. It isn't a stretch to think Harry was raised to think the same way. No one knows where he lived after all.

4.) Also, Harry refused Draco's offer. Draco is a whiner and the moment he doesn't get what he wants, he tries to ruin whoever refused him. If he opened his mouth against Harry, that wouldn't shock me either. He has connections Harry doesn't after all. And Draco hates Ron's family.

5.) Voldemort being killed puts the whole plan of his on hold or simply stops it. He, in broad terms, wanted to put Purebloods on top. So the Purebloods of Slytherin, who are from families who supported Voldy, are especially sore over this supposed loss. Harry is directly the reason they can't be in control. tbh Purebloods ARE in control already, it's just that all the opinionated people not like them aren't making it as fun as it used to be. They want those people gone in whatever way, so they can be in control but enjoy it again.

6.) Some people just genuinely don't like someone based upon the family they're connected to. The name Potter could be enough to make them hate him. I mean, James married a muggleborn, siding with blood-traitors in the process and ruining the purity of his line basically. That's got to rub the supremacists wrong too.
