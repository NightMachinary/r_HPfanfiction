No Slytherin girlfriend, no slash, no Hermione bashing (she's stealing money or spying on Harry), and definitely no Harry/Hermione pairing.

An example would be:

linkffn(What Would Broz Do? A Harry & Ron Series of Events by vlad the inhaler)

Edit: No whitewashed Death Eaters or their kids. Seriously.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]]

Harry doesn't get into any relationship throughout the series, and there's no white washing. Harry gets angry at Hermione for being too controlling and it takes them years to be friends, but even then they're not close. It's long and complete, the slash is for minor side characters. May not be exactly what you're looking for, but close enough that you may find it interesting. It's very lighthearted and avoids angst and tween politicians.

Harry prays for help from Loki just after Dobby ruins his summer and Loki helps him become more competent. Regarding Death Eaters, Voldie went crazy psycho due to some accidental magic and everyone who followed him is regretful, dead, or in Azkaban. Loki helps Diary Tom heal and build a new identity for himself. A lot of the bashing is explained as a result of a curse - even Dumbles gets better as the story moves along.

******** Yeah I finished reading it and it ended up disappointing me. It started out great, nice worldbuilding and pace, then it seemed like all Harry was there for was to be technically in the story and kiss Daphne's arsewhile she treated everyone like crap, including victims of abuse. The double-standards were particularly galling Pureblood attack muggles and muggleborns with a slap on the wrist, Muggleborns doing the same get Azkaban. The temporary revenge of the muggleborns leaving was overshadowed by the Ministry still wanted to keep the disenfranchised underfoot while the Purebloods go back to business as usual.

What really hit was the Muggleborns still willing to go back to Hogwarts instead of homeschooling or going overseas for education. Justin FF really screwed the pooch though, planning to bomb the Hogwarts Express and kicking Hermione out of the 7-person government she created while looking for refuge

Overall, the story felt rushed towards the end, and it ending with Daphne deciding to change things for Muggleborns, for the better, while still remaining the b$tch of the whole fic and treating Hermione/other 'lessers' like crap some copout made me feel cheated.

** Maybe linkffn(Saviour of Magic by Colt01) Harry flees from the Dursleys as a child and is raised by his grandfather's portrait in Potter Manor. Harry ends up being anti-muggle, but not a Death Eater, just pro-magic, Hermione loves her muggle family and thinks the magic world is barbaric so they clash a lot during hogwarts years and beyond. It's heavy on muggle-bashing, but it's explained in-universe why.
