I've posted a couple times before buuuut now I've read all of those, so I'm gonna try again! I'm looking for fics of sixth and seventh year (or fifth sixth and seventh whatever) that are true to canon but take off where the last book would've left off. Some of the best examples I have for what I'm looking for are the Refiner's Fire series and the Psychic Serpent trilogy. Not looking for slash or ridiculous pairings or crazy AUs. Just a legitimate take on where the story could've gone before the final books were released. Rating doesn't matter, M is fine

Edit: thought of some more details to add. I'm looking for something that's FINISHED being uploaded so I can read it all straight through and not wait for chapters to be released. Something that was published even before HBP was released is great I also want something that ends... with an ending, you know? If they only did a sixth book, for example, but it's clear there should be a seventh... no thank you.


** Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion on fanficauthors.net

The ffnet has been hacked and someone is posing as the author on fanficauthors but it is great.

*** What do you mean it's been hacked? It's not the original author? Is the story finished?

**** Went back to check and I was mistaken about it being hacked. It is almost certainly the best post-ootp fic, and utterly worth reading. It is also north of 300k words, with a kind of ending that at least is not abandonment. Check it out.

***** how good is it per-word, would you say? is it fairly dense, with a crapton of content to get it up to 300k, or is it 100k words worth of content spread over 300k words? I've read several of the latter kind of fic lately, would prefer to avoid another.

****** It is better than 99 percent of hp fanfics - more interesting and better writing than psychic serpent and wholly better than refiner's fire et al...it was written by a good writer and it is full of novel and worthwhile insights into hp magic, culture, and setting. It is wholly worth reading - again likely the best post-ootp fix there is. Don't just take my opinion, [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Years_of_Rebellion/Through_The_Looking_Glass/]]

****** I'm halfway through this now. I'd recommend it, but this is without doubt the angstiest Harry I've read. Any time something goes wrong (every day) he flies off the handle. The writing is great, so it's kept me interested, but seriously, Harry needs a fucking xanax.
