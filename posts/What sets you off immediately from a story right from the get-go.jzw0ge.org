** Bashing, especially when it is done basically done for the sole purpose of breaking up a canon couple to get your idea pairing together.

Misspelling of important character names. I don't care if you misspell Trelawny, but if you constantly misspell Hermione or say that Harry's name is actually Hadrian, then I won't stick around.

Bad formatting. I want paragraphs and I want sentences where the first word being capitalized.

** Canon rehashes. I like to read stories that have intriguing divergence plots. But often, the set up is the same. I'll skim the first few chapters to see if things change quickly. But so help me, if we go through the shopping, the train ride, the sorting, and the troll without any changes then I will lose my mind. Then, I close the tab.

** Since you asked for "right from the get-go," I'd like to mention flashbacks.

In my opinion, flashbacks should almost never be used. They tend to be used as a bad band-aid for bad writing, and are almost never actually necessary anyway. But they're /especially/ bad when they show up a few paragraphs into a chapter, /especially/ */especially/* the first chapter.

**** If the entire prologue is a flashback then sure. Though I'm not sure that would even really be a flashback at that point. The problem is when a fic starts with something like this:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter paced around the abandoned classroom, angsting about how terrible his life was. His life was defined by dead parents, abusive guardians, and a bunch of other issues that you already know about but which I will waste time explaining to you anyway.

  And now he had been entered into a death tournament against his will. But the worst part was that his supposedly loyal friends had abandoned him.

  /Flashback/

  "I don't believe you, Harry, " Ron sneered. "As punishment for not admitting to entering the tournament, I have eaten all of your possessions. Especially your invisibility cloak and photo album."

  "Books! Book book books!" Hermione added.

  /End flashback/

  Yup. Harry's life sucked now. Luckily, Harry knew the perfect solution: Angst, Slytherin hotties, and more angst.
#+end_quote

If the story really needs that scene (and it never does), then why not start the fic there? But the better option is to accept that telling is sometimes better than showing and just say what happened (which they usually do anyway, as in the last sentence before the flashback in my example).

** Haphne pairings. Don't get those at all. Or anything with a teacher/student pairing or OC as MC, especially if said OC is ridiculously overpowered and/or a self-insert in Harry's same year. I also stay away from MC being Harry Potter's twin sister and from Dramione. But then again I don't read much HP fanfics xD only those that really interest me which mostly follow canon.

** - Bad grammar.
- Misspelling basic stuff like quidditch consistently, "quiddage" ????
- Bad harem fics where its (harry, everybody) and not (everybody, everybody).
- Unjustified bashing to get rid of a character or bring in a new pairing.
- Fics that are cannon up to a point, like just start the bloody fic from where you're diverging from?? everyone's read the whole series a million times.
- When the fic is abandoned after a few chapters and the writing is not good enough to continue reading the fic.
