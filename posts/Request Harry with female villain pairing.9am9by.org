*** Well, Limpieza de Sangre turned me onto the idea - there was a female Voldemort, except her name obviously was a bit different.

Sadly though, there was less romance then I'd like, and afaik, no physical intimacy.

I don't know, there's something appealing about a (preferably) strong main character getting with a powerful woman like that, gives it a sort of Anthony/Cleopatra vibe. Maybe even Harry is the one to start pursuing her? Or reverse.

**** Having read this one but not your original, I have to say that it's quite good. "Voldemort" is inconsistent, but that doesn't seem to go against her characterisation.

***** Voldemort is not supposed to be attracted to Harry. Harry is a tool to help reach a goal not some prize to be lusted after. The entire point of LdS is how they change each other without quite realizing it through the scar connection. Harry becomes harder, less trusting and more worldly and Emily rediscovers her capacity for Empathy which results in an ending role reversal of sorts. IE Emily does what Harry would have done and Harry is left trying to figure out what Emily would do.

Yet here...it commits all of my cardinal sins of (fanfiction) writing. It exists purely for the 'ship'. It forces the ship through stupid means rather than actually bothering to develop it organically. And, it removes the agency of the characters outside of the ship.

It's literally everything lazy bit of cliche I hate rolled into one with the added affect of throwing my name on it purely, from what I can see after two chapters, because they wanted to keep Female Voldemort's name Emily. Given that she thinks of herself as 'Riddle' and not 'Price' I'm assuming it does not keep her backstory.

****** Like I said, I never read the original. And congratulations, someone wrote a fanfic for your fanfic. Given that you are less than happy about it, well, dunno?

******* I don't really care one way or another that someone wrote a fanfic about my fanfic.

I dislike stories like say, Hope, for the same reasons. Sure, Hope is well written, but despite the incessant claims that 'Gabrielle is not some gift' and 'Harry wont fall in love with a doll' the story is presented in such a way that that is exactly what happens and what the entirety of it is about.

******** What do you consider the right amount of romance? I always feel like gen stories, at least the longer ones, are missing something quintessential, yet at the same time I agree with your statement that a romance just for the sake of shipping isn't really all that interesting outside of one-shots.

****** I just finished reading the 90k words posted so far, it's not that bad for what it is.

It's fanfiction, for God's sake. It's great that you feel you write more meaningful or "deep" fanfiction, but at the end of the day... It /is/ just fanfiction. Whether you want to admit it or not, everyone got into fanfiction for some sort of fantasy fulfilment within the HP framework.

Given that I've seen literally only two fem/Voldemort pairings - and yours wasn't even really a pairing - I think you're being a tad harsh.

Well that's certainly not why I got into it. I loved the original books and wanted more. And then I discovered that there was "different" as well as "more". I enjoyed discovering the things people with the characters and the world. This wasn't for wish-fulfilment but a desire to see Rowling's fascinating world explored more fully.

Limpieza de Sangre was an incredible journey of exploration. I haven't seen anything that explains why Tom (or Emily) Riddle became Lord Voldemort in as much depth. As TE7 has already described, the view into Emily's past changes Harry and his love of life changes Emily. The story /only/ works with Harry and Emily. And it's not a love story, it's a shared journey.

This fanfic La Puissance est le Contrôle is absolutely none of that. Emily isn't anything special. She could be replaced by Narcissa, Bellatrix or any generically "bad" woman older than Harry. The direction of the story is obvious from half way through the first chapter and loses all the complexity of the original. It's like writing a fanfic of Romeo and Juliet where the two title characters aren't from violently rival families and end the story by calling it a day and agreeing to date other people.

So write a story about a "bad" girl dating Harry. Go for it. Explore Rowling's world. But don't pretend it's anything to do with someone else's exploration of it.

*** I kinda like it. Sure it's cheesy and not the best written story, but it's not as cheesy or badly written as it could be - it didn't require me to ignore any bad grammar or /too/ much suspension of disbelief. Thanks for the link.
