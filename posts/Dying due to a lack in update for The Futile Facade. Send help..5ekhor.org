If there's anyone else on this subreddit who is pining as deeply as I am, what are you looking forward to seeing in the chapter(s) to come?

I want more advanced alchemy, political pureblood pitfalls, and someone discovering the ruse. Just one person. I'm ready.


** The Triwizard Tournament! I'm pretty sure 'Rigel Black' will be the name that pops out (since the TT is definitely taking place) and Archie and Harriet are going to FREAK trying to figure out if Archie is the one being compelled to compete.

Also, if the Quidditch Cup happens, I'm looking forward to seeing if vowed-to-silence and Quidditch-mad Flint is the first one who figures out that Harry is Rigel's replacement at school. He works with Quidditch so he'll probably get tickets to the Cup.

*** He would be the perfect person to learn, too, considering the binding curse! He already knows half of it, though, which will unfortunately somewhat temper the 'oh-my-gosh' reaction. BUT, yes, my bets are on him learning sometime soon. So excited.

Also, I read someplace that the three challenges will be different from canon, which I honestly couldn't be more happy about. In addition to your identity crisis mention, I'm pretty sure Violet will find some way to make it all the more difficult to ensure the secret remains such. The title is a little ominous, there.

edit: Oh, and I wouldn't mind Snape learning belatedly about Rigel doing Flint's assignments, either, though that will likely come to the forefront in fifth year when she actually has to do the OWL assignments with her own yearmates and the professors note the similarities there.

**** I'm looking forward to Rigel taking the Potions OWL/NEWT early and becoming a formal apprentice too. Also for Rigel to make friends with some Beauxbatons students and surprise her friends with her French.

** I've been feverishly anticipating the next chapter as well, to the extent I've actually begun reading the fan forums and checking her profile every few hours, which is stupid since I already have the story followed.

** Don't take this as me maliciously [[/r/gatekeeping]] here, but for real come talk to me when the fic you followed for 3 years through 600k words hasn't updated in 3 years. Or any of the other ~2400 fics that reached 100k words but are still incomplete and haven't been updated in over a year (Compare [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=1&len=100&s=1&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][total incomplete (~3500)]] to [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=5&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=1&len=100&s=1&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][incomplete but updated this year (~1100)]] and for reference, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=1&len=100&s=2&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][total complete (~4000)]]) and I'd wager half of those ~1100 that did update this year will never update again. And that's just on ffnet. AND that's me being too lazy and too mobile to also check the 50k numbers which I imagine are even more skewed.

Sadly, even though many authors do their best to keep going, writing is fucking hard and keeping it up as an unpaid hobby amidst all of life's typical difficulties is often impossible. Muses and plots come and go, and though we pine so desperately for more, at least as many fics are abandoned as completed. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=1&len=0&s=2&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][~273k complete]] vs [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=1&len=0&s=1&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][~300k incomplete]] with only [[https://m.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?srt=1&t=5&g1=0&g2=0&r=10&lan=1&len=0&s=1&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][~22k updated this year]].

Anyway, I just wanted to remind everyone to be realistic in their expectations from authors especially in this case where the author has posted 5 chapters and 55k words in two months and then nothing but a minor bio update for over 5 months.

Be excited for what you have and what may happen next, but don't get your hopes too high and don't get angry when you have to move on.

*** I haven't yet had my dreams crushed by an abandoned fic, at least one that I am attached to - this is just an upcoming chapter that I believe is in its late editing stage. I can afford to pine when I'm 99% sure we'll get something within the month.

I'm certainly not angry, though. It'd be different if I approached it like, 'omgwtfbbq where is upd8 I will Kill Author Nao if I don't get it'. I get what you're saying. Despite my facetious title, though, I'm hyping here, not whining.

** I'm ok, I've been reading murkybluematter's fics for several years now. Their updates are always between several months, but the wait is made up for with extra long chapters. At least we know that murkybluematter is consistent and won't drop the fic.

*** While I definitely don't think this fic is abandoned or likely to be abandoned in the near future, many fanfic authors are consistent, until they very suddenly aren't. By this I mean there are a lot of fics that are updated regularly for a long time, then the updates get infrequent, then the fic gets abandoned. Even authors who prior to this point had communicated regularly with their fans and where actively engaged in communicating progress.

** Pining as well... Sometimes I feel bad for recommending it, since it we've been waiting so long for a update. And I only started reading in August =P
