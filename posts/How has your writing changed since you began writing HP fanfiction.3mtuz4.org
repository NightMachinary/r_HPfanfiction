Have you changed genres? Converted to a new ship? Begun to hate a character you love in canon? Stopped writing long-ass authors notes?

(I'm guilty as charged on all).


** The more stories I viewed, the more I hated Ron. When I started writing my own stories, I based the characters off friends, family, exgf's, ect. I ended up liking Ron a lot more than I did in canon or fanon since he was partially based off of my best friend.

I've also started writing reviews on stories I read, which is something I never did before.

**** I still review, but less than I used to - instead of every chapter, I usually review the whole story at the final chapter posted. I need to be a better citizen...

***** Perfectly acceptable unless you are editing. You don't need to interrupt your reading to critique every chapter, just post what you think at the end.

** 1. I like seeking out characters I didn't like in canon and writing about them to understand them, or at least, their motives. I'm much more sympathetic to Lavender and Cho now, and I've dabbled in writing Peter.

2. My prior experience in writing was mostly theater scripts for Speech. I was a dialogue nut and descriptions terrified me. The best thing that I did was alternate between a third person rotating PoV story and a first person present story, because it forced me to write two different styles of descriptions, and they would improve the other. Also, tenses don't deter me from reading anything anymore.

3. I have an immediate reaction based on writing style that'll determine whether I'll likely like the story.

*** I totally agree - I love seeking out those characters. Can you link to your Peter fic? I've never tried to read from his POV or on his experiences before.

I agree, writing in different tenses is a great way to shake things up.

I click out of a story, even if the plot seems promising, if someone hasn't formatted their dialogue correctly. Especially with a space after a speech mark eg. " Harry, what's wrong?" gahhhh

**** Peter still lives mostly in my mind! I have two very short ficlets [[http://hpedit.tumblr.com/tagged/peter%20pettigrew][here]]; I've been more interested in writing about the perception of him, because fandom like to ignore him or put up giant warning signs going "hey, this boy's gonna turn out evil." The girls I like to explore more in how they challenge the perception of bravery.

I read very little nowadays, so I always choose the stories that have a strong voice, because that's usually an indicator of quality elsewhere. For me, if the prose is boring, the story is boring.

** Nothing's really changed in terms of HP fanfiction. In terms of fanfiction in general, my first few fics are a special kind of crap, but I like to think I've gotten good at it by now. And yeah, what author hasn't written a stupidly long author's note? I used to be one of those writers who would make characters blush a squillion and a half times a second. It was baaaaaaaaaaad.

Haha I think anime taught us blushing was a thing everyone does!

*** My authors notes actually exceed the length of my actual stories. I have to keep reminding myself that I don't have to justify every single choice either myself or a character makes.

** I think I've gotten more nitpicky about what I read since I started writing fanfic. Bad technical writing is even more painful to trudge through now.

** When I started writing, I tried to judge characters by the actions they took in canon. These days, I pick and choose from canon so the characters don't act out of character.
