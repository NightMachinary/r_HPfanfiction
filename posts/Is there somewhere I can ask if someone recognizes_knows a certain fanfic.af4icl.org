I know some fandoms have ficfinders groups or sites, and I was wondering if the HP community had one, too. I'm trying to find a certain story that I can only remember bits and pieces of and going kinda nutty. I wasn't sure if asking here was allowed, so instead, I'm asking if there is a better place to ask...

** Make sure to use the title though or you'll get less replies. Like have everything or most everything in the title.

**** Oh my bad, misunderstanding. I was referring to the title of the reddit post. People will be more likely to ignore it if the title is vague.

** You can ask here, though I would recommend looking at a best-of list first. It does get kind of tiresome when people are looking for a fic and it happens to be like the sixth most common fic in the entire fandom.

*** I'll check the lists, but the odds of it being on one of them is pretty slim. It's still an excellent place to start.
