Looking for a fic in which the one to defeat Bellatrix is not Molly Weasley but Augusta Longbottom as I have to say she has the better claim!

I would prefer something in which Augusta wins if possible. Thanks!


** Not really what you are asking for but IIRC in a Cadmean Victory, Death Eaters attack the Longbottoms while Harry was visiting.

Augusta was pretty level headed there, and although she was grievously injured she did put up a fight.

As I am writing this, I am starting to doubt if she fought against Bellatrix or her husband/husband's brother.

** This fic is a series rewrite that changes several things about the final battle. I quite like a lot of the changes, especially with Bellatrix's end.
