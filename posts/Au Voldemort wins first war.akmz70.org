Are there any fics where Voldemort won the first war and Harry, his parents and others are forced to live in a wizarding England/Europe where Voldemort reigns supreme? Could have his parents either dead or alive, Slytherin is the supreme house etc

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power. Translated from Russian.)

  Harry is a man broken and weighed down by regrets. He is past the point of caring, until one day he takes the opportunity to change his fate---blast the consequences. "I've jumped through worlds for you, Hermione. You won't be taken from me again." A Dimension travel harmony story.

** Here are three fics in which Voldemort reshaped Wizarding Britain after winning the first war.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12885827/1/The-Ward][The Ward]] - A few surviving members of the Order of the Phoenix are banished after Voldemort wins the first war. They survive and raise their children within a wilderness prison infested with dangerous magical beasts. linkffn(12885827)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12228520/1/Consuming-Shadows][Consuming Shadows]] - Rather than sacrifice herself, Lilly escapes to raise Harry secretly in France. They return to England under the Dark Lord's rule when Harry's class participates in the Triwizard Tournament. linkffn(12228520)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14527497/chapters/33565593][The Philosopher King]] - Voldemort reshapes the world into a feudal system with powerful noble wizards ruling society. Harry is raised as a ward of the Malfoy family to ensure his parents' good behavior. linkao3(14527497)

*** Without giving away too many spoilers, can you tell me a bit more about the pairing in "Consuming Shadows"? I really like the idea in the summary but when I saw the pairing it made me very hesitant.

**** Both Consuming Shadows and The Philosopher King have slash pairings, with the storylines slowly working their way towards HP/LV. There's no underage pairings, but the version of Harry in each story is very different from canon due to the different ways he was raised. I suppose you might want to skip them if the relationship is not to your liking, since it is a central part of those stories.

***** My only real gripe with those pairings is it being underage and of course Canon Harry would never be with him. But in an actual AU where he has grown up differently they yeah it can make sense. I honestly would rather read something with either no pairings or where it is in the background. Romance is tough to write.

****** I agree on all counts. I usually don't care for romance focused stories, so a fic with a prominent pairing has to have a great plot and/or world building to draw me in. In my opinion these fics do well on those counts, but your mileage may vary.

******* Awesome, thank you for the recommendations! I've been reading HP fanfiction since Goblet of Fire and lately it's been getting harder and harder to find anything decent to read. I think it's just my growing apathy toward the fandom itself rather than a lack of good stories.

  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

  Gen, AU. In 1980, Voldemort won. Harry's parents and their allies fled to live safely in total isolation. But 15 years later, when a wounded Bellatrix breaches the walls of their sanctuary, Harry realizes his parents haven't told him everything - and to save those he loves, he'll have to face whatever destiny awaits him in the world beyond.

  On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son and flee to France. She trained him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard. But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, Harry is forced to return to his once-home, and he finds himself engaged in a game he might not want to play.

  AU: Lord Voldemort wins in 1981. This is a story of a man that's finally gotten what he's been fighting for, but now that he has it, he doesn't know what to do with himself. For eleven years Lord Voldemort waged war. For longer than that he hated Dumbledore. Once both are taken care of, Lord Voldemort is left with a hole in his soul to fill. Professor!Voldemort
