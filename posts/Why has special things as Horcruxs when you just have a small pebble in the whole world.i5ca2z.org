** Harry brought up exactly the same issue with Dumbledore in HBP, who rejected this possibility because of Voldemort's arrogance.

But there could be more reasons. Since Voldemort wanted to make multiple Horcruxes, he might have found out that only using magical objects could keep them stable. He might have also believed that using important, magical objects would make Horcruxes last longer.

*** It's also important to remember that Voldemort was very much a sentimental sort. He hated being an orphan, and his magic was the one thing he had going for him in comparison to the minions he terrified into submission before Dumbledore found in in Wool's Orphanage.

Every Horcrux Voldemort intentionally made had some manner of sentimental attachment to him.

- The Diary memorialized his pride in being a Parselmouth and how it connected him to his ancestor, Salazar Slytherin. It also immortalized his opening of the Chamber of Secrets and perhaps his first murder via the Basilisk.

- The Locket was a memento from his ancestor, and also one of the few possessions his mother had which she sold to keep herself alive long enough to give birth to him. He took it back because his mother had been cheated when she sold it in desperation, and as the Heir of Slytherin, Tom felt it was his birthright.

- The Cup and the Diadem were marks of his connection to Hogwarts, the only place he ever felt at home. Wool's Orphanage held no affection in Tom's heart, especially not after we was forced to stay there over the summers... even during the Blitz at the height of World War 2, when London was under attack from the skies. No, Hogwarts was the only place Tom Riddle felt at home, surrounded by magic and history. Given his connection to Salazar Slytherin, he also felt an attachment to the relics of the Founders as part of his attachment to Hogwarts.

- The Gaunt Ring was his legacy from his mother's family, the mark that he was descended from wizards and that his family was pure-blood... until him. Even so, he felt it was wasted in the hands of his deranged Uncle and better suited his more noble stature and mind. Even so, it was yet another reminder that he was not a Muggle-born, but was actually a Half-Blood and that he did have a family in the wizarding world... even if his father was a loathsome Muggle who had abandoned his mother and left her to die of grief after giving birth.

- Nagini was the snake that allowed him to regain his strength even as a specter, nursing him on her milk so he could keep living after being cast out of Quirrell's dying body and protecting him while he was vulnerable as his minions carried out his whims.

- Harry was an accident, but it was also the mark of his greatest defeat. After being obliterated when trying to murder Harry, Voldemort developed something of a hatred for the boy, so I suppose that's sentiment enough for him, even if it's negative.

But yeah... Voldemort was pretty sentimental about his choices for Horcruxes. Each Horcrux he made intentionally had some connection to events or details of his life and himself that he felt were important enough to be immortlaized as hiding-places for fragments of his soul.

*** I read in one fic, it was some interesting head cannon that it was impossible to put your soul into something you didn't value greatly. Not like â€˜he tried and it didn't work' but more like it was impossible to even think of doing otherwise. Attempting to make a Horcrux requires and item of some sentimental value or something.

** Could be many things. The first and simplest is that Lord Voldemort is an egomaniac with serious delusions of godhood --- even if no one else than him /knew/, it would have hurt his mythologized self-image if the Artifacts Containing The Soul Of Lord Voldemort had been a shoebox and a candlestick instead of already-legendary artifacts of power.

But if that doesn't do it for you, you could certainly posit in-universe reasons why he would pick existing magical artifacts. One that I believe is hinted at in the books is that he wished it might stay the hand of someone looking to destroy his Horcruxes --- would they dare destroy the Diadem of Ravenclaw or the Resurrection Stone, even if they knew what they had become? Heck, that gambit seems to have very nearly /worked/ in Dumbledore's case with regards to the Stone. The allure of having found these legendary artifacts could even help the soul-shard use that desire to worm their way into the mind of the would-be Horcrux-destroyer --- planting the idea that it was worth taking the time to find a way to extract the soul-piece /without/ destroying the item, during which time the soul-shard could then do its thing and fully possess the would-be destroyer (as Locketmort attempted to do to Ron).

Going further off the canon rails, we could also posit that it was, to an extent, experimentation; with the Diary, it's clear that Voldemort was experimenting, pushing the boundaries of what Horcrux magic could do. He may have been interested to see if he could increase the power of the Horcruxes, or his /own/ power, by implanting part of his soul in unique already-magical artifacts. Assuming he was aware of the Gaunt Ring's true nature, for example, he might have wanted to see if adding his soul to the Resurrection Stone would give him free passage back and forth from the Afterlife, or something of that nature.

*** Or better yet, objects of /personal/ significance, so that the split off soul shard will have a direction to latch onto once it separates from a living body, or be willing to separate itself at all.

It makes sense. The soul shards are semi-sentient, and one of Voldemort's latched onto Harry entirely by accident because he was the only living thing nearby, which proves that a Horcrux have some measure of control over where it chooses to reside, even if it's a choice that happens on a subconscious level.

*** Once Harry blurted the secret out in front of hundreds of witnesses during his final confrontation with Voldemort, they better come up with an alternate solution to this Horcrux problem.

The next dark lord will certainly try to make a little compromise such as using a mixture of artifacts and mundane items. Throw one into the bottom of the Pacific, and a Horcrux hunt as in canon would be pretty much futile.

On the other hand, Horcruxes are not something new, but then it begs the question why the world is not being ruled by immortal dark wizard kings. Are there alternatives to destroy an individual with Horcruxes? Are there more vulnerabilities in those individuals? Can something be done on political level, such as making a mandate within ICW that treats individual with Horcruxes as big of threat as the violation of the SoS?

JKR's Horcrux Hunt is certainly not the only way.

**** Horcrux knowledge in Britain was kept to a low following Dumbledore's removal of all books related to the subject, but that doesn't rule out students learning about it overseas.

Perhaps the process of creating a Horcrux is so disturbing that the average Dark wizard isn't willing to go ahead with it. We know that it takes more than just murder to create one.

It also begs the question of whether there might be some places in the world that teaches a bit more with regards to the subject.

Perhaps there was some Horcrux spirit back in the day who just couldn't stand being trapped in the living world anymore and begged someone to destroy their Horcrux.

That would be a nice way of informing would-be Horcrux-makers of the cons of trapping your soul in this world. Double benefit if, somehow, some people out there might know about the inability to move on from Limbo as well.

- Obliviate Voldemort completely with Elder Wand
- Dose Voldemort with Draught of Living Death
- Transfigure Voldemort into some kind of hard object
- Lock Voldemort first in a Fidelius protected location
- Smuggle Voldemort onto the next NASA interstellar probe (New Horizon for example)

** In Canon, Voldemort's choice to use both items and places or personal significance for his Horcruxes can be explained; inside the story by Voldemort's arrogance, and outside the story by Rowling's need to have the locations of these Horcruxes predictable by the heros. But outside of the canon events, I never liked the whole "Pebble Horcruxe" idea (that seems pretty popular on this sub).

â€‹

From what we learn in canon, in order to create an Horcruxe, the Dark wizard need to be pretty talented, devoid of any morality or remorse, and afraid enough of Dead to believe that ripping his own soul is an acceptable condition to ward it. Would such people really leave the protection of their Horcruxes up to luck?

I know that such people would try to put any protection they can think of on the Horcruxe before putting him in the ocean, but there are so many things that can go wrong with these protections (especially if the Horcruxe is part of an immortality plan). Did the wizard managed to protect this pebble against all the potential threat living in the ocean, or did he forget one? Will the enchantment stay active once in the water or could the pression, the cold (or anything else really) could erode the protection over time? And what if the water currents slowly push on the ocean floor until he ends up on a beach, where he could be destroyed by something as stupid as an apprentice Dark Wizard practicing Fienfyre?

Any of these bads things may happen, or they may not (though the potential immortality of the wizard raise the probability of any potential events, especially the bad ones), the problem is that the Dark Wizard would never be sure that they didn't happen, since he would not be able to check on his Horcruxe. Without going as far as Voldemort, I really think that the Horcruxes need to be into somewhat accessible locations, so they can be retrieved by the Dark Mage if needed (and also because I can't imagine them trusting any protections unless the one they had put themselves).

Also, the Horcruxes aren't just there to maintain the soul of the Dark Wizard in this world so he could live as a wraith. Without some extremely specific potion (like Voldemort used) or an access to the Philosopher' stone, the Horcruxe is one of their very few option in order to gain back a physical body so they could continue their rule. Putting the Horcruxe into a truly innaccessible location take out this potential use.

In the end, I could imagine a Dark Wizard with multiple Horcruxes putting one aside that would go in the ocean, the inside of a volcan or even in space. But Voldemort was presented more as an exception than a rule, and I can't imagine someone with only one Horcruxe putting such hald assed protections.

Same way he could've left Harry alone, not trying to kill him year after year, then Harry most likely wouldn't be so driven to kill Voldemort. He made his ultimate enemy himself.

** I've seen a few different justifications for that in fanfiction.
