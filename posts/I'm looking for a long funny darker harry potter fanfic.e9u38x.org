I just started reading harry potter fanfics I've stuck with dbz and naruto fanfics the past couple years for some reason I'm having a hard time finding good harry potter fanfic my favorite story I've read so far was the black comedy and I really liked it but NO SLASH OR ANGST Fanfics thank you for your recommendations I appreciate it a lot


** I highly recommend this one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125771/1/Ah-Screw-It]].

It's a Stargate crossover in the later part of the book. Harry isn't dark, but he gets pretty ruthless. There are some very funny bits in this one and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

**** You don't really need to know much about it. I never saw the shows myself and have only a vague idea about the series. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the fic.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
