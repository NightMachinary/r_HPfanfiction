  But I was wondering, would you guys read that pairing? I have a feeling a lot of people do not like Ron.
#+end_quote

No. I don't read slash and i don't like Ron. (But to be fair, Harry/Ron is one of the better slash pairings, it can't be denied that Harry is super into the guy, platonically)

#+begin_quote
  Also, what about Ron did you find interesting from the books?
#+end_quote

His background is interesting... being overshadowed by his brothers and having really shallow dreams of standing out on his own. Sadly nothing ever came of that, besides whining and complaining.

#+begin_quote
  What type of humor do you think Ron has? (again this is just to see how people saw him and to compare it to how I'm writing him)
#+end_quote

Situational humor, commenting on events happening around him and other characters in a unique way.

#+begin_quote
  Pet peeves about representation of homosexual relationships on fanfics?
#+end_quote

Suddenly everyone is gay! It seems like you want to keep everything canon except for the epilogue? There's really no indication that either Ron or Harry are even a little bit gay.

*** Thank you so much for your feedback! And sorry, I just signed up on reddit, so I am still not really sure how the formatting works.

Yeah I agree with you, about â€˜suddenly everyone is gay' think on fanfics just because it fits the plot. But, I am going to use my personal discoveries about my sexuality and going to do more research to explain Ron's sudden attraction/ crush/ longing for Harry, so hopefully, it won't read too much like that. Thank you again :)

** I'd read it. A relevant trope I'm tired of would be the "Ginny potioned Harry", so don't use that as a reason for Harry and Ron not hooking up before in your story!

Ron tends to do situational humor. A pet peeve of mine on this would be the relationship cause it to tear them apart from apart from all their friends. Hermione and Neville at least should be pretty understanding to them.

*** Yeah, I don't think I would use that plot. Ginny in the books did not seem like the type to resort to that. and thank you for the feedback!

It's a boring cliche, but at least that would be one of the very few plausible reasons that Harry never had a gay thought during all of his teenage years. I don't know why it's such a big problem if it's just used as a premise for the story and isn't the actual story.

** Personally I wouldn't read it. That being said, something that I like about Ron is his growth, at the start he wished to be the best of all his brothers but never worked for it, then he was jealous of his best friend. When he came back in DH it was after he accepted exactly who he was, the side kick, its why I could see his relationship with Hermione working. He grew up and understood that his friends were ahead of him in a lot of aspects but you know what, that's okay.

Another thing that Ron has that helps him in an interesting family, all of his brothers are fleshed out characters with interesting backgrounds and varying strengths. Whatever way the plot goes he has people he can turn to for help. He has a supportive and close family.

Something that annoyed me about slash fics is the need a lot of them have is to turn everyone homosexual. It got ridiculous, that and the fics lacked any subtlety. A person's sexuality and what they and their partner(s) get up to in their own time is their own private business, we really don't need to have them bring it up and everyone confront them on so the author creates a podium to sprout their views from, its the same issue I have with the majority of fics that try to be political. Its not even that I have to disagree with their views, its just obnoxious and derails any fic. Obnoxious behaviour for me kills fics faster than poor spelling and grammar. I can forgive small mistakes for a good story. Just make sure its a story not a manifesto.

** I'd love to see some Harry/Ron fics. I think I tried looking for some years ago and just couldn't find any.

I haven't really read canon!Ron for a while so I don't know if I can accurately answer what kind of humour he has. I do think it would be nice if we don't get a gay-dilemma coming out type of story. There are much more interesting conflicts out there than people being prejudiced. (Of course characters can be prejudiced, but I'd rather not see that as the central storyline.)

Idk if any of this helps but good luck writing!

*** Yeah, there is so much about his character to explore, that I don't think I'll end up doing a coming out story, but more of finding himself story. And thank you btw! Your comment was really encouraging :)

**** I'd love to see where that goes! And aww. I know not a lot of people are fans of Ron/slash which can be discouraging, but I'm sure you'll find an audience. c:

** I absolutely would read a well written fic with the pairing!

I just love the ship, and there aren't may fics with it.
