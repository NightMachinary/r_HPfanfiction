It always makes me smile when someone takes a liking to some of my writing. I love receiving kudos and follows/favorites. They make my day to think that someone out there in this wide world enjoyed what I wrote down.

Some of my all time favorite work that I have personally written...are my oneshots. That no one else likes ü§£ü§£ I worked harder on those then I did my actual 25 or so chapter story. I don't even like my long story! I actually hated writing it and it put me in an uncomfortable situation where the pressure was eminent and the thought of letting people down was terrifying. But my oneshots are my babies and I worded them just so and drew out diagrams to make sure certain things were perfect.

Has that ever happened to you or have you ever felt that something you worked tirelessly on wasn't as appreciated as you wished it was?


** I love one-shots. Sure, multi-chapters are something you wait for; you check for updates and gets all excited when you get an alert with a new chapter, but one-shots are those precious gems hidden in a bunch of long fics (completed and abandoned) on the page.

I love fics that focus on the character instead of action, big battles and other flashy stuff. One-shots are perfect for that.

Unfortunately, like you, I've noticed people kind of shy away from one-shots in favour of multi-chapter fics. It's a pity. I've read hundreds of beautiful fics that only had a few kudos and zero comments because they were one-shots, while long fics with unoriginal plot and many plot-holes got all of the attention.

** FWIW, when I wrote fanfic (albeit in another fandom) I got a lot more comments when I put all my one-shots into one story collection. Maybe that's something you can try?

However, that only works when you write for one specific pairing or one specific character. I've seen one shot collections that include characters and pairings from the entire fandom. I never click on those because it's too much work sifting through all the stories to find the one or two I actually want to read.

ETA: I have to admit that I do comment a lot less on one shots. I usually sit down to read for a block of time (45 minutes or so) and I'd rather read one longer fic than have to find a bunch of individual one shots (which might only take me 5 minutes to read.). I usually only comment on one shots if they're really exceptional---a different idea executed brilliantly, or hard-hitting and powerful character insights I've never thought of before, that kind of thing. However, that changes if someone has a collection of one-shots about a pairing I like that I can sit down and read for a good block of time. I'll usually leave a comment when I finish telling them I enjoyed their stories or whatever.

** Oh, I'm the same. I think my best writing is in some of my oneshots, and to get me through a very difficult year I ended up writing literally hundreds of them and going right off longer stories. I can see why people prefer longer stories, but I was able to pour far more emotion and character depth into my oneshots, and I'm far more attached to them than I am to my longer pieces.

** One shots - with which I mean short stories; if you split your 5K story into 5 chapters, I still think it's a one-shot - rarely capture my attention. There are very few stories below 10K that I consider well done. Most are either too short for my taste, skipping too much, or ending prematurely without considering the consequences - meaning, I would prefer them to be longer stories - or too "introspective", perhaps. I like my stories with a problem for the protagonist who has to find and does find a solution, not just some musings while watching the clouds.

*** Not the OP but for some reason, stories longer than 100K words rarely capture my attention anymore. Many stories just lose focus after a while and it gets boring and it gets boring fast. Also, I like one-shots more than multi-chaptered stories. Maybe I'm more into reading traditionally-published books now?
