:END:
I remember this fic from ten years ago. I've looked all over and can't find it, so I hope that this community can help me!

I think this fic was called Jigsaw? I think it might have been a fifth or sixth year fic. In it, Draco abandoned Voldemort's side and ran to Dumbledore. He brought his necromancer cousin, Cassandra, with him. Dumbledore put them in Grimmauld Place. There was some kind of necromancy where they created a body for Sirius. Harry, Snape and Cassandra went into the spirit world to find Sirius. Harry met Morgana (I think?) and she allowed him to pick one person to take back with him: Sirius or Snape. Harry chose Snape because Snape didn't have to risk his life to help, but he did. Morgana (?) allowed him to take back both. I think Cassandra betrayed them at some point? And then came back? She was definitely a coward. And Tracy was a Catholic. She was in Slytherin because she had ambitions of politics. Also, I remember Harry and Draco having to go to some sort of cabin with an estranged family member, possibly named Julius or Julian.

Thanks in advance!
