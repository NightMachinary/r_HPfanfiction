I remember reading it quite a while ago on ffn, but absolutely can't find it anymore.

It was about Harry being unable to clear his mind (or just plain sucking at it?) so he used his own method; constanly playing some obnoxious melody in his head.

There was a bit about Snape projecting the potions instructions from his mind onto the board or something, except with the 'song' stuck in his head it ended up being... the pac-man sounds I believe.

  What if clearing your mind isn't the only way to keep people out of your head?
