It's another one of these! Yes, if you've been keeping up with posts in the past months, you might know that this isn't the first time I make a post like this. This time, I will try to be as clear as possible.

I'm looking for what you you might say is a type of AU fanfic, in which one or more characters are transported, stumble upon, travel to or otherwise find themselves in an unknown location, that they must then explore in search of a way out.

An example of a story that /doesn't/ fit this description would be linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero). Sure, Harry is transported to a different world, but it's not a new one. It's still the Wizarding world, just one that played out slightly differently to what he knows.

A story that does fit would be linkffn(In Atlantean Caves), because the main characters find themselves in a place which, as far as I know, is OC for Original Content. It's not quite an Alternate Universe, but more of a Different Universe, and not a crossover either. All the other examples I've read are linkffn(Harry Potter and the World Beneath), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ«) and linkffn(By The Diving Light), and even those only half-fit.

If you know of just one other story like this, I don't care how good or bad it is, I don't care if it's unfinished, please let me know. I'm begging you.


** Hmmm. So you want new settings, right?

linkffn(Elizium for the Sleepless Souls) is excellent. Harry is locked in the sinking island of Azkaban, and must find his way out. I would say it counts as original, as we know nothing about the setting of Azkaban from canon.

linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find them) is humorous and fun. The whimsical tone fits the story extremely well. I liked it better than Forests of Valabone.

I think that's all I've got. linkffn(Down the Rabbit Hole by Accusatrix) deals with themes of isolation very well, but it is mental isolation with the entire wizarding world turning on Harry and Ginny, not physical isolation.

There are quite a few crossovers like this, but I'm not whether you're looking for crossovers. If you are, then try linkao3(Island of Fire by esama), linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar), linkffn(Failsafe by Hannanora Potter) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Assassin's Creed).

Someone who used to be a member of reddit had written a Harry/Hermione one which I thought was readable but rather average, but both the story and author seem to have disappeared from the internet.

*** I'm definitely interested in Elizium for the Sleepless Souls, and I'll check out Failsafe and the other fics as well even though I'm not too into crossover fics. Thanks for the recommendations!

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Freak's first day at school takes a strange twist when he squeezes through a gap in reality into a medieval fantasy world, complete with an evil wizard who claims him as a slave. Can Freak find his way to a family he has always longed for? Or will he die trying?

  #+begin_example
            The beginning of the epic\. Freak's first day\.

          Hello Readers\! I will hopefully provided you here with a little insight \(none of which is needed to enjoy the story, but there's no Death of the Author here\!\)\. This story is a cross over of the fantastic works of Roberta Williams, published by Sierra Entertainment \(at the time known as Sierra Online\) in the 1980s and early 1990s\. This is mainly the King's Quest series and The Quest for Glory series\. In this world, both exist on a single land mass\. The events of KQ1 and KQ2 have already happened, without the influence of our Hero \(which will be explain when it is important\)\. Harry \(who here has only minor thoughts that that is his name\) takes the place of the Hero\. Where possible I have tried to stay true to the timeline of publish dates of the games and Harry Potter, meaning that here in 1987 \(a year later then KQ3 was published, but the earliest I could really expect to see a Harry with the independence needed\) Harry is 7 years old\.
