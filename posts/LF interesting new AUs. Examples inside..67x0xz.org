LF interesting new AU's that do not abide by the stations of canon AND have been published recently (past two years).

For example

1) Black Luminary: linkffn(12125300) A slightly weird but reasonably interesting remaining of wizarding Britain. Cons: being Harry is suffering. Pros: a sexy teacher, interesting magics, and a cool relationship with his 'grandfather'.

2) The Red Knight: linkffn(12141684) Characters are pretty OOC, but once you accept that, they are interesting characters. This is a weird story because while it suffers from rather obvious plot contrivances, it is still decently written, and the vicious fem!Harry is a delight to read.

3) The long game: linkffn(11762909) Completely AU w/o Riddle. Exceedingly interesting read.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][Sum of their Parts]]: Harry becomes a 'Dark Lord', enjoyable read. Published last year.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]]: My favourite AU, the world the author created is very interesting . The characters are definitely OOC however. Incomplete at the moment with sporadic updates-outside time parameters but is still active (updating).

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: Slightly outside time-parameters. An AU in which magic doesn't exist and is replaced by technology.

#+begin_quote
  In Alex Mack's universe -- a universe without magic -- there is also a Hermione Granger. A teen Hermione who has her own Ron and Harry. A Hermione who will have to deal with their very own He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

#+begin_quote
  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

** linkffn(Knowledge is Useful But Power is Power) has very interesting ideas on what magic is. A bit edgy with the anti-establishment themes, but a good read.
