I'm looking for fits where Harry goes to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts. If he transfers in one of the first few years that's fine too. I'd like it if Harry played Quidditch pro at a young age. I would also like Harry to be intelligent, and possibly a bit grey in the fic.I know it's a bit specific, and probably hard to find, but if you have any suggestions, leave them below. Thanks.


** Linkffn(9939304) Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum by Irish216. Harry, Draco, and Krum go to Durmstrang together and are pro quidditch players. Pretty sure this is the one, you may have to get a chapter or 2 in before it's gets to that part maybe.
