The amount of Serious/Sirius puns would actively cause the world to implode.

"Why so Serious?" "It's my name, I can't be anyone else, that'd be boring"

Then they decide to mess with Batman's head together, with entirely nonlethal, but actively irritating pranks, like turning Batman's suit Pink.


** There's a /Worm/ crossover in this direction. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/not-quite-sirius-worm-hp-crossover.333113/][/Not Quite Sirius/]] It's not really a full fic though. It's reasonably close to crack too.

He joins the local superhero organization.

** Yes, of course Sirius would support the insane massmurderer against an actual hero.

*** The Joker is convincing, and why would Sirius know who villains and heroes in the "Muggle" world are. He might see the Joker as a funny clown wihout knowing who he is, it's all about perspective. A Guy dressed like a Bat might remind Sirius of "The Dungeon Bat/Snape" and the idea of messing with him would be too hard to pass up.

The entire prompt was a joke on the "Sirius Serious" puns that are made in a LOT of Fanfics and the Joker using the phrase "Why so Serious"...

That, and it's Fanfiction. This still makes more sense than "Harry decides to bang Voldemort" fics.
