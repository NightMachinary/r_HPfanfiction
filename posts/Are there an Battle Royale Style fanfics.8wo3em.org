DidnÂ´t know as what to flair this (request?), so please tell me what I should flair this as.

So, with the haye of Battle Royales being around 6 months old now, has anybody seen a Harry Potter fic with a Battle Royale integrated yet? Maybe a AU HP that partakes in an Duelling Championship thats in an Battle Royale format? Or just uncreative way of saying : HP takes part in Fortnite.

If you are wondering why I am asking this question, I love playing games, sometimes also Fortnite and was browsing this subreddit while waiting for the game to start.


** Linkffn(8379655) has a couple bigger battle scenes and regularly has battles of around 20 people in different environments. Solid fic, unique world building, well thought out, although the characterization struggles at times.
