Looking for a fic post battle where Harry goes to Auror training and its detailed more than just anecdotally. Would prefer as close to canon as possible.


** OK, you just *have to* read stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter)!

Also, “Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian” linkao3(1857084).

#+begin_quote
  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with “The List.” The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.
