** I would love to see this, too. But it would be really hard to pull off, Sanderson's worldbuilding is way more rigid than Rowling's.

*** That would depend on which world are you using. Concepts from the Archive would easily fit in the HP-verse. HP-verse magic would just wreck stuff in the Archive.

***** If you're refering to the ministry battle then it would be highly unlikely they all fall into the plot device that is the Veil. I was thinking along the lines of Fannon MoD world already ended and the MC was an unwitting inheritor of one of the 10 shardblades.

It could even be one of those lost magicks wherein it was rediscovered accidentaly by one of them within the HP verse considering that the Archive's magic system is made of glyphs which could be twisted as Runes.

It could even be â€˜the power he knows not' as the shardblade kills souls and not the vessel. As mentioned by [[/u/puppetpal][u/puppetpal]], the sword of Gryffindor can be a shardblade considering that i pops up everywhere. It fits!

****** No, I was thinking more along the lines of Post-War period. Have them scattered all across Roshar. Ron could end up with Kaladin, Luna with Szeth, Neville with Jasnah, Hermione with Shallan. Harry and Dalinar would be interesting dynamics
