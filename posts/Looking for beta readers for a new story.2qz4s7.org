I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I am looking for a beta reader or two for a new story I am writing. It will start in First year but will eventually encompass all 7 years, and possibly beyond. I can PM some more details of the story to anyone interested. Also, I am not British, so I am concerned about missing or screwing up the British terms and slang (I've seen people complain about American-isms and how they aren't english, so I assume the British stuff would = good in most readers eyes).


** I'm willing, and I happen to be from London, which is where a lot of the books takes place in, and more importantly it's where Harry gets his accent and slang.

Note that this will be the first time beta'ing, just and FYI. :)

** Possibly interested, what are you working on that will span all 7 years? I am not British unless you have a genealogy report but I have a good grasp on the culture thanks to an unrelenting need to absorb anything related to the HP universe.

*** The plan was to do a series that was largely a re-telling of the books (lots of individual plot lines changed, such as Harry/Voldy, Hermione/SPEW, Ron's relationship with Hermione, etc), while also expanding on certain points (more quidditch, more classes, etc). It will feature a 4th member of the "Golden Trio" from the start, and that member will be an OC. I'd rather not reveal everything in public, so I'll PM you a better description later tonight.

**** OCs need to be handled very, very carefully as they can quickly take an otherwise good story and send it spiraling down into the shitheap.

That said, I'm game if you still need peeps.
