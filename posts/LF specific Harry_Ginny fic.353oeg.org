I'm looking for a Harry/Ginny fic that I read several years ago. As far as I recall...Harry was living as a muggle in muggle london in an apartment complex and Ginny, posing as a university student, moves in to the flat next to Harry's. At the end of the fic, Harry finds out that someone (an ex-friend? the landlord?) had set up recording devices in Ginny's flat and had been creeping on her. Harry looked into this and found out that the specific flat had been let to young university girls at a cheaper rate so that the guy could creep easily.

I feel like this fic has been taken off the internet because I haven't been able to find it through my own searches. I really appreciate any help you can offer me! :)


** I remember this one; I'm not sure about the name but I'll try to think of it.

EDIT: I think this is it: [[http://countwestwest.livejournal.com/5220.html]]
