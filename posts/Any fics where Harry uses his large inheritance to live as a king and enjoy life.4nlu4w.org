So many shitty fics make Harry to be the richest person in magical Britain cause of some inheritance by his parents or the blacks or some other died out pure blood royalty that he is eligible for. Yet, I've never actually seen any of those fics have Harry live like a King, I can understand that thanks to living at the Dursley's and not being a snobbish person at heart and meeting Draco Malfoy he isn't that interested in money.

Then I am wondering if there are any fics where there is a Harry that just uses money like it is toilet paper and just throws money at everything till it works.

So, he'd get a lawyer or nine, get away from the Dursley's, buy his own family and mansion, eat what ever he wants, wear what ever he wants, build his own libary, get his own tutors since he has a shit ton of cash. Yeah, that always surprised me, why with so much money he wouldn't get his own private tutors after being in that so called death trap for more than a year.

Of course in the books he never had that kind of cash but I'd figure it would be interesting to see that kind of Harry.

I mean with all those fics giving him all that cash, you'd figure he would spend some money on getting some dark mages across the globe, to get rid of Voldemort.

I'd like for Harry to be cruel and a lot more arrogant, I guess more Slytherin or Ravenclaw then Griffonboar.

Harry has to be the protagonist and no slash or angst.


** in Path of Conquest he does pretty much all of that, but he also turns all the females who scorned him into sex slaves, and he marries Gabby + light bondage scenes (its mainly smut with some plot)

I swear I've read like 5+ of these kind of fanfics the issue is none of them were very memorable and i think all were abandoned or incomplete

**** true, but its the "veela's have magical puberty early" trope IIRC, also how would sex slaves ever not be non-con?

** Didn't that crazy Harem Wars fic where he has dozens of women in it have Harry basically a ruler of an independent country?
