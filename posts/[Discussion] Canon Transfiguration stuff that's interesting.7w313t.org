I am rereading all the books lately for my stories, and I found this relating to transfiguration!

“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. “It is used to /return people who have been transfigured/ or cursed to their original state.”

So the mandrakes work on TRANSFIGURED PEOPLE TOO! That's a super cool detail isn't it? :)

Here's another one!

They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows.

That means TRANSFIGURATIONS can change COLORS! Color changing is not a CHARM it's a TRANSFIGURATION of something! :)

Also I'm still trying to find canon evidence of actual BOLT SPELLS or VISIBLE EFFECTS for transfiguration, but I'm sorry I just am not finding any so I don't think it's right. At least I won't use it in my stories.

Here.

"No!" cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face.

It says there's a SOUND EFFECT, but no flash of light or a bolt or anything. It just says, the noise, and then he reappeared. Instantly. The same thing is said when Moody transfigured him in the first place, that there was a loud BANG, but no flash of light or anything.

So yes, I'm just not convinced there is any actual magic bolt that has to hit a target to transfigure them. It's just instant wave your wand and it's done.


** With the colour change thing, I always imagined the charm as being like "painting" the target whereas transfiguration would be changing the material of the target to one with a different colour.

The mandrake detail is a nice catch, thanks for posting :)

Maybe the size difference between Malfoy and The Amazing Bouncing Ferret(tm) meant that the air was displaced extremely quickly, causing a tiny sonic boom? Both transfigurations appeared to be pretty much instant.

** In Harry's first Transfiguration lesson McGonagall transfigures her desk into a pig. Earlier in Philosopher's Stone Hagrid attempts to turn Dudley into a pig but only manages the tail.

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pure-blood][Pottermore]] says that /"the pig is often considered a particularly non-magical animal and is notoriously difficult to charm."/ I like to think that McGonagall is showing off her skills to the class and to the pure-blood children in particular who would've been taught that pigs are non-magical and difficult to make magically.

** Sound is easily explained by the presence of air around the subject, the difference in volume between Malfoy and a ferret means that when his volume shrinks drastically, there would be a sound resulting from air rushing in to fill the space. When the reverse happens, the ferret suddenly takes up as much space as Malfoy, and the air has to move away from him, which of course means it creates a pressure wave, commonly known as sound.

**** I'm not sure if that's /why/ (or at least why according to JK Rowling) the sounds occur, but it's certainly a reasonable explanation, in my opinion.

** In the films, there is a subtle light from the wand to the target. It's mostly shown when they're turning animals into goblets.

*** The movies yes, but I'm not going off the movies, I am going off the canon book series. :) And the books have given zero indications that transfiguration is not instant, OR that it is FLASHY. :)

**** Flashy, certainly not, but as I told you, I think it's likely the spell still has to "travel" from the wand to the target, even if it is invisible and /very/ fast (like, speed-of-sound fast).

***** :( Ok Achille, but I don't see travel time evidence. It even says once explicitly that "it happened from one second to the next." Besides yes it's MAGIC, so why CAN'T it just have no travel time? :( If nothing says it does.

****** I guess it's just because of how I think magic works. As a "wave" of magic shaped by the wand and sent towards the target, it would obviously take /some/ time (even if it is much too short for a human to even notice) to get to its location.

******* But I guess your way is right, even if it's like the speed of light thing where light ALSO does travel from one thing to another, it's just so fast there isn't a delay for our eyes! :) Because yes in canon Snape did say that "Time and space matter in magic." So I guess yes it's like light that it WOULD take travel time, it's just so fast we don't notice a delay for MOST spells? :)

***** I had an interesting brainstorm this particular topic.

My current headcanon is that some spells have a more distributed magical profile and other spells need to be focused into smaller time and space. Spells also lose power faster over distance when they move, so the further a spell needs to travel the more likely it will be condensed by the caster into a projectile.

For example, a stunner is a focused spell that overcomes a wizard's nervous system by applying a great shock to a specific point. Thus, every stunner travels as a highly compressed red bolt that's easy to see. Where as something like McGonagall transfiguring the desk into a pig, that's diffused magic over a larger area. She was also likely standing right next to the target. The magic of her transfiguration would require a much higher sensitivity to see, enough that first years and muggles wouldn't manage it at all and adult wizards would have to be looking for it.

This also leaves open the idea that different wizards have different spell profiles for the same incantations and wand motions, given their competency at the intent part of magic and shaping the magical "energy". Invisible spells would be just as much a sign of a skilled wizard as nonverbal incantations. Flashy spells could serve the same purpose for different reasons.

****** That's very reasonable. And it doesn't quite match up with some of my headcanons, but in part it does.
