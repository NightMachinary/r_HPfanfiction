No Weasley Bashing where the Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche, as I love that family.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash. Doesn't have to focus on pairings.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** loose cannon has him deciding to play quidditch. it's super long and still updating but updates regularly and has been a lot of fun so far

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** It's new, but in this fic Harry gave up being an auror to become a kind of magical Indiana Jones.

  Thousands of years ago, a corrupt and decadent empire vanished forever, buried beneath the ocean depths. Several millennia later, the Man-Who-Conquered is drafted by an offshoot group of Tamil wizards to do the impossible. The only thing standing in his way? Just eight immortal wizards, an entire magical nation, and one smart-mouthed Ravenclaw witch. Piece of cake.
