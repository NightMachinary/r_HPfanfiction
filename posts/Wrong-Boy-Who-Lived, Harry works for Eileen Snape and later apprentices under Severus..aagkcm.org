  Harry has a twin, and everyone thinks it was Nick who survived. What will happen when Harry is pushed aside? Will he fight for a world that didn't want or care about him? Will Dumbledore or the Potter's grovel at his feet? What happens when the world finds out he was the one to survive that fateful Halloween night? Fourth year summer fling HP/VK! Primarily Snarry SS/HP! SLASH
