I always liked the idea of Dumbledore training Harry.

So I am looking for fics in which Dumbledore wants Harry to take his place in his numerous government posts and as Headmaster after he dies. He trains Harry in magic, politics, and old wise man eccentrism (dressing oddly, confusing people with riddles, and lemon pops!).

Any type of fics is welcome: AUs, timetravel, dimension hopping, etc. Pairings are welcome except for slash and Harry/Ginny.

I do not mind if Harry is not trained by Dumbledore, but I want to see him acting like him.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
