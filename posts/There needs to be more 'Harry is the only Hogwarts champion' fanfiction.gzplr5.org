For one, I have a hard time swallowing that and ancient artifact like the Goblet of Fire was fooled simply by making it think there were four schools, even though historically there have never been more or less than three school participating. A school that possibly doesn't even exist and even if it does, Harry is most certainly not a student there.

Two, that Dumbledore somehow did not think about the loophole that simply a person older than 17 could add someone else's name.

Three, that simply writing your name on a normal piece of paper, doesn't even matter by whom, is enough for the Goblet to accept it.

​

*How I'd like to do it:*

-There is no age line. The champions have almost always been sixth and seventh year students for obvious reasons. The youngest even in history was a fifth year. Maybe Dumbledore suggests it thinking that with the kind of things Harry had been through, if he did put his name, there was a very good chance he's be chosen as a champion, and he genuinely cares about Harry's safety. But none of the others see any point of the age line. So Dumbledore agrees remembering that Harry never really wanted to be the center of attention and he wouldn't want to participate in the tournament. And on the off chance that he did, in the end, it was his life and his choice. Absolutely no bashing allowed here.

-You'd have to smear a slight amount of blood on the paper with your name to be able to put it in the Goblet of Fire.

-Karkaroff was tasked with getting Harry's blood. Not for the tournament, but for the ritual to resurrect Voldemort. The ritual never mentioned the the 'blood of the enemy' needed to be fresh.

-In this verse, Harry's encounters with Quirrelmort, Basilisk and dozens and dozens of Dementors is sort of a public knowledge. Especially, the Basilisk one(it's honestly impossible to ignore). Most don't believe in Quirrelmort(though Dumbledore keeps insisting that Voldemort is not gone), but they do believe that the DADA teacher went mental and tried to kill Harry and he somehow defeated him. Same way, most don't believe in Diarymort, but they do believe Harry killing a Basilisk, because the evidence is a big fucking snake's dead body shown all over Daily Prophet. There was no witness for the Dementors encounter. But it is well known that Harry can perform a Patronus and with all the other crazy things he did in the past two years, people don't find it too hard to believe.

-What I'm trying to get at is, the public perception of Harry Potter is nothing sort of a legendary figure who was truly living up to his name. And Voldemort is angry as hell about it. He keeps on insisting that Harry is nothing special and he was just getting through by luck(he is only partially right, just like canon).

-So Karkaroff also wants to believe him. But just to satisfy himself, and seeing that he was already tasked with getting Harry's blood anyway, he plans to use a little blood to put Harry's name in the Goblet. Pretty sure that he won't be a champion, and he'll finally have the satisfaction knowing that Harry really wan't nothing special.

-Obviously, that doesn't happen.

​

P.S. If anyone wants to write this prompt, a small request. Write a supportive Ron. Please please /please/ don't write his fall with Harry. Just for once, let him believe in Harry. Please don't use canon as an excuse, it was already out of character for him there. And it's fanfiction anyway, you can do whatever you want.

** *My Response to the Prompt - I'm adding on to it, obviously. Also, there's some direct quotes from* */Goblet of Fire/*

Harry was shocked as he heard Dumbledore's starter to his yearly Welcoming Speech:

“It is my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.”

A hush befell the room. The silence was, ironically, deafening. Then, the uproar followed with even /more/ power than the silence.

“Ridiculous!” one of the Weasley twins shouted. Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw Malfoy fuming. His eyes immediately darted over to the Ravenclaw table, where he knew his crush, Cho Chang, would be sitting. She was laughing with her girlfriends about something unimportant, but her smile was enough to make Harry's insides squirm. Oh, how she was /cute/ when she laughed.

Harry jumped a little in his seat when Dumbledore bellowed, “SILENCE!” All at once, the houses quieted, and the silence was deafening once more.

“Now, as I was saying, we will not be holding the Inter-House Quidditch Cup in lieu of something even /more/ exciting that will take place. This year, we will be holding the centuries-old Triwizard Tournament!”

Immediately, more shouts of excitement and awe and curiosity could be heard in the room. Again, Dumbledore had to bellow, “SILENCE!” to quiet the Hogwarts students.

“As I was saying,” Dumbledore continued calmly, “we will be holding the Triwizard Tournament. This tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities -- until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.”

“/Death/ toll?” Hermione sputtered out in disbelief.

“Yeah,” Ron replied. “The tasks were probably bloody /dangerous/, ‘Mione.”

Harry noticed Hermione blush a little at the nickname. Ron didn't seem to notice.

“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very successful. However, our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short-listed contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”

“I'm going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed from down the table.

“Me, too!” George agreed. They high-fived each other.

“As eager as I'm /sure/ some of you are to submit your names for a chance to compete, I must implore you to really /think/ before you do,” Dumbledore warned. “The Triwizard Tournament is a difficult /and/ dangerous competition that, like I have said earlier, has had a high death toll in the past. I will not attempt to hinder you from submitting your name if you wish to do so, but be warned that you may or may not survive if you are selected.

“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!”

With the end of the speech, all the students got up and started heading to their respective common rooms. Harry walked quickly to catch up with Ron and Hermione.

“--and Harry should totally put his name in!” he heard Ron saying enthusiastically.

“Ron! Don't you think Harry's had enough to deal with?” said Hermione's no-nonsense voice.

“What's going on, guys?” Harry cut in.

Ron turned to Harry. “C'mon! You've /got/ to put your name in! You've got to!”

“Don't listen to him, Harry! Ron doesn't know what he's talking about!”

“Of course I do, Hermione!”

“But yet you want him to enter his name in a deadly tournament!”

“Guys,” Harry cut in again. “I think Hermione might be right. I'm not cut out for this, anyway.”

By this time, they reached the common room. Hermione said the password, and the Fat Lady's portrait swung open.

“You're kidding, mate?” Ron asked Harry as they crawled through the portrait hole. He turned to Hermione. “Tell me he's kidding!”

“I assure you, Ron, I'm not,” Harry replied.

“But you've defeated a /bloody/ Basilisk!”

“That was just luck.”

“What about Quirrell?”

“I had /you/ guys! I most probably would've died without your chess skills and Hermione's potions skills.”

“But still! What about the dementors? You can do a /bloody Patronus!/”

“I don't know probably /half/ the spells that the sixth and seventh years know, though. I think you should bet your money on Fred and George. They seemed real excited about it. Maybe one of /them/ will be the champion.”

“But they haven't done the stuff you have! C'mon, ‘Mione! Help me out here!”

Again, Ron called her that nickname. Harry turned to Hermione and saw her blush. Again.

“You know what?” Harry finally conceded. “We'll talk about this tomorrow. A'right?”

“Yeah,” Hermione replied. “Goodnight!” Then, she walked up to the girls' dormitory. Ron and Harry went up to their own dorm room.

As soon as Harry opened the door, they heard Seamus in the middle of making a declaration.

“--and no matter what any of you say, I'm entering my name!”

“Yeah, me too!” Dean cried.

“But you might die,” Neville countered timidly.

“Harry's joining the tournament!” Ron suddenly shouted, announcing his and Harry's presence.

“RON!” Harry scolded. He turned to his roommates. “No I'm not! He's making stuff up! Don't listen to him!”

Dean, Seamus, and Neville looked at the pair.

“Actually,” Dean said, “Harry /is/ the only one of us who defeated a Basilisk. He should enter.”

“/Again/ with this?” Harry said, exasperated. “It was luck! If Dumbledore's phoenix hadn't come in, I'd've been dead by now!”

“Quit bein' so modest, will yeh?” Seamus asked. “If you enter, Hogwarts'll win the Triwizard Cup for sure! No one can stand a /chance/ against Harry Potter!”

Rolling his eyes, Harry headed to his trunk and changed into his nightclothes. Then, he climbed into his four-poster bed, pulled the curtains around him, and he fell into a deep sleep.

  Despite the flaws, I do like some of what this fic has to offer, though it breaks off quite a bit from canon. I like Hermione and Harry, but an adult Harry(mentally, anyway) lusting after ANY 12 year old is creepy as hell.

  Particularly, pardon my language here, but Dumbledore is a fucking IDIOT in this fanfic, and if this fanfic is ever revived, I hope you can get the Dumbledore/Harry scenes to be something other than a repeat of every other interaction they've had.

  Sorry. The whole thing with Dumbledore is grating on my nerves at this point.

IIRC, Dumbledore kept skirting the edge of violating an Unbreakable Vow he made not to manipulate Harry, to the point where he nearly died from breaking said Unbreakable Vow on multiple occasions.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

Or maybe just have like a regural school year for him, him cheering on to Cedric, with all other students of hogwarts. Then when Voldemort is resurected he is brought there in some other way, though maybe this time without Cedric dying as Harry never took part in the tournament, the cup would not have transferred him to the graveyard, but Barty somehow still was able to have Harry appear there, maybe at different time (before or after the last task)..

Nothing special really needs to happen to Harry, let him have relatively relaxing year watching the tournament, fight against Voldy. And as Cedric never dies, maybe we will see him in the Order of the Phoenix the next year, as he might have been asked to join and then he might have a bigger role..

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Why on earth would it be harder to confund an ancient artifact? Magic continually improves and it's nowhere near impossible for an ancient thing to be worked around. It's not easy but it can be done.

Once you work through the realization that the goblet can be confunded into believing there are four schools and that Harry is the only one entered from the fourth school, you see that the second and third point suddenly seem less fixed.

What loophole? It took an immensely difficult confundment charm to fool the goblet into letting Harry in. Age line seems to have worked well elsewhere. I find it far harder to believe that no other student tried the "have an older student put their name in" than the idea that a decrepit artifact used for traditional value can't be fooled. Magic is conceptual in Harry Potter and it's more than probable that an age line does stop many of the loopholes people have come up with. The goblet spat out the name's of a physically older George and Fred Weasley, why on earth would it not spit out the name of someone entered by someone older?

To counter three, you're right it's not enough. Again, it took confundment, difficult magic.

*** I dont think we've ever seen any examples of magic improving in canon though tbh, I think snapes the only person who's canonically made a new spell in the series, (maybe voldemort with his specific dark mark as well)but from what JK has revealed most of the spells used in Harry's time were from the middle ages, and other than that we dont really have any information about how strong magic was in the past so I think that's just up to each person's headcanon

Here, you literally agree with me when you say it's implied. Ever heard of the concept of an unreliable narrator? Harry is an above average, though not exceptional, student in school. He's not going to be learning about the advances in bypassing magical artifacts and confundment. If it was Albus Dumbledore, we would see much more of the advances in magic.

I'm not quite sure what you're implying here. Are you saying there's no higher education in the wizarding world? Albus Dumbledore's apprenticeship and auror training say otherwise. I'm not even going to touch the poisoned fruit of the computer engineering metaphor. Actually, you know what? I will. The whole point is that Harry isn't the computer engineer in this situation. You know who is? Crouch Jr., who had to study the goblet's enchantments and figure out how to confund it.

Way to backpedal. We see advancements in all branches of magic from transfiguration to charms to potions. And you're telling me that advancements in charms, likely published in /Challenges in Charming/, don't deal with undoing charms? So magical researchers in the 1300s or 1400s, back when they vanished their own shit, came up with an ingenious set of enchantments that surpassed the constant developments in charms ever since?

I also love how the strongest possible evidence I have that wizards and witches have developed magic that can overcome ancient magic is /the fact that/ */Bartemius Crouch Junior overcame said ancient magic with a confundment charm using modern magical theory/*. So yes, given that he succeeded, I find it unlikely that ancient magic is superior to modern magic.

I agree. They would have made it as hard as possible at the time of invention for the enchantments to be broken or bypassed. But 700 years have passed, so it stands to reason, that those strong and advanced enchantments are no longer as strong because modern magical developments means that there are new techniques that can bypass said enchantments.

Also what organization? Nothing in canon says the Department of Mysteries studies countering curses and enchantments. Of course, it's implied that they would study it, but then again, apparently implications are terrible. And they would break those curses and enchantments through innovation.

You know show is literally all about the imply right? Instead of saying "Harry felt happy" (tell), you say "Harry felt his lips involuntarily twist upwards" (show). You know how the readers knows that Harry is happy? Because it's implied from the smile that itself is implied from the lips twisting upwards.

Instead of saying, "Harry felt angry", you say that "Harry snapped at Ron". Again it's implied that Harry is angry in the later because Harry snaps at Ron.

I'm confused by this. Could you clarify? I'll clarify my line of reasoning as well.

Crouch bypassed the goblet's enchantments. Unless those ancient wizards using ancient magic meant for said enchantments to be bypassed, they probably made it impossible at the time to bypass it. But 700 years have passed and now Crouch is able to confund the goblet using modern theory. Why? Because modern theory has advanced since 700 years ago. Now of course, you're going to tell me that because it isn't spelled out in the Goblet of Fire by Moody going "ah yes, he must have used the method published in /Challenges in Charming/ two years ago", that means that no magical innovation occurred for this to happen. How unlikely, given that we see magical innovation occurring constantly.

That's just good writing. If she had taken the time to spell out every detail for her readers, not only would that be the paragon of telling by devaluing a reader's ability to make inferences, it would make for a terrible book series.

Edit: Also, there's a three year auror training program. It may not be a muggle "formal education program" but for the wizarding world, it certainly seems to be given that it's where the elites go for their education. Apprenticeships seem to be the really formal educational programs though. Dumbledore apprenticed under Flamel.

*********** Yes but my argument is were not shown that it quacks acts or talks like a duck, were just told it's a duck, were just get told that theres something more in the HP world but it's barely ever explored, which I do agree is entirely because of the decision to use harry as a medium but even in other material like pottermore and quotes form JK herself we still never get more than skin deep on almost anything in the HP world, for example we know more about the life of a minister and his visit to azkaban than we know about where criminals go when they dont go to azkaban. That type of thing is why I'm saying shes good at writing stories, but shes not good at writing worlds.

Just as I'm saying that writing stories is her strong suit, I'm saying that worldbuilding is her weak suit

When I say that my argument is as good as yours I was referring to my argument that curse breakers proving that ancient curses and spells from ancient civilizations are still considered complex and powerful, is just as good as you're argument that crouch being able to confound the goblet proving that ancient spells are not still considered complex and powerful. Because neither of our examples are properly explained in canon.

Speaking of which curse breakers is what I meant when I said there was an organization devoted to breaking and deconstructing ancient spells and curses and such.

The wolfsbane is a good point, to add on to that in HBP the potion is a good example of what I'd consider advancement, in both examples were made aware of what things were like and we actually see how things have changed, we see that in the invention of wolfsbane (something thought impossible)and we see that in how snape alters the instruction of his potion book.

That's what I'm arguing is lacking in terms of proof of spell advancement, though funnily enough you're example of Voldemort's unaided flight is part of what I was saying earlier when I said that we see those advancements more by way of quidditch broomsticks than anywhere else, imo that's probably her best example of worldbuilding where she lays out a timeline of why and when and what happened to get from point a (no flight) to point b (unsupported flight). I have no clue why that's more explained than how spells are actually created but point still stands that it is explained well.

But back to my point, I'm saying that outside of the process of flight charms we dont see that type of progression at that scale anywhere else in the series, we know for example that Fred and George made unique things but we're not given any indication as to what they started with, was it entirely new spells they made or did they just "repackage" things. Same thing with the map, its defiently impressive and it's the first hogwarts map of it's kind but for both examples we dont see the before, just the after.

And for the cases that we are given the before theres usually not much if any change, ie protego, stupefy, expecto patronum, etc, all being used in the same way and form they were hundreds upon hundreds of years ago with little to no change with the same exact equipment and words.

Again, this is from the perspective of Harry Potter. He's not going to tell the reader about every little detail. You have to look at what's being implied. That's what show is all about.

*Committee on Experimental Charms - Literally a goverment organization dealing with invented spells, but of course the British being the British like to pay their employees to do nothing*

Expelliarmus - 1379

Levitation Charm - 1600s

Obliviate - 1600s-1700s (canonically unclear, but the two options reside in these centuries)

Stupefy - First use we see, 1900s

Sectumsempra - 1900s

Unaided Flight - 1900s

Multiple Horcruxes - 1900s

All of this, in addition to the fact that, not only do wizards invent more spells, but improve on how to cast them.

#+begin_quote
  Harry still hadn't mastered Summoning Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help

  He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer.

  Brilliant,” he said softly. “Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.”

  /They then spent over an hour revising Summoning Charms, which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their OWL, and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest ever amount of Charms homework./

  But Sirius snorted. “I don't need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.”

  Hermione Granger
#+end_quote

Theory improves, spell casting improves. Let's see this principle in action.

#+begin_quote
  He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx.
#+end_quote

Then

#+begin_quote
  Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving color illustrations of all the counter-jinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the D.A.
#+end_quote

To:

#+begin_quote
  He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, “Protego!” Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville's jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.
#+end_quote

Theory, and practice with putting theory in said action later, Harry's stopping Dolohov's curses.

Where does improvement to theory get published? Books, journals, conferences. What do people get awarded for improvement of magical theory? Awards, or in Grindelwald's case, expulsion.

All the hints throughout the books come together to give a reasonable person the correct idea that yes, in fact, magic improves, and not just through spell invention. In the unlikely (bordering on ludicrous) scenario where all the spells involving the goblet have been around in some form since the first fish decided that land was a great way to escape predators, the magical theory behind them and thus the spells would still have improved.

I'm going to quote Taure to explain JKR's worldbuilding since he does far better creating an eloquent and polite argument.

#+begin_quote
  The problem with this is that the real world is complex, and our attempts to describe and explain it are messy. Our scientific theories are incomplete, sometimes contradictory (for example, the famous tension between quantum field theory and general relativity), and fail to answer more fundamental, philosophical questions about why. Perhaps as a result of this, we naturally associate messy complexity with realism. Brandon Sanderson's magic systems, for all their functionality for storytelling, feel far too simple and too neat to be real. You should not be able to summarise how the world works in a paragraph.

  The truth of the matter is that no author can hope to simulate the complexity and mess of the real world. Any magic system that you attempt to explain comprehensively so that the reader “knows how magic works” will feel too simple. If you want your world to feel real, the reader shouldn't really know how magic works, just as we don't really know how the natural world works in real life. And I propose that this is the type of worldbuilding JK Rowling is attempting: she wants her wizarding world to feel authentic, and to do that you have to sacrifice Sanderson's first law.

  So what is JK Rowling's approach to worldbuilding? I believe it is what we might call “worldbuilding by allusion”. The books do not explain magic to the reader, but rather allude to the existence of explanations. Like the real world, these explanations are incomplete and at times contradictory. This helps the world feel authentic. Like in the real world, wizards are attempting to understand the world around them, and we as readers can glimpse this activity.

Also my problem with JKs worldbuimding isnt that its simplistic, it's that the things that are explained in detail are not nearly as important as the things with no explanation at all.

For example the entire series leads up to a war about blood purity but never once do we actually hear any sort of theory about the purity of blood from either side, just vague things like "its bad/good"

And in a book about magic highschool we have no clue how magic works, its affect on the user body, any limitations it might have in terms of power.

Those are fundamental to understanding huge chunks of the series but yet are never even sorta explained.

Hers the thing though, I LIKE that theres so many blanks in her world, that theres so many linchpins to her world that are entirely ignored. It's why the community for fanfiction of HP is still larger than most other fanfic communities, theres so much empty space that you can nearly reverse the entire series and still have it be mostly canon compliant.

**************** Where does ability to learn come from? That knowledge doesn't come from nowhere. It comes from studying the research other people have made. So yes, modern magic is superior to ancient magic by the sole reason that the wizarding world keeps studying magic, leading to advances in spell-casting.

So now you backpedal and switch to this. Yes, people learn to cast the spells better as they study the theory. Switching to a more apt analogy of studying biology because magic is all about intelligence, when people learn about biology, they're improving their own understanding of it. However, people in the 1800s who studied biology didn't know about Taq polymerase. Because of research and innovation published in research journals (like advances in magical theory and new spells published in magical research journals), students learning about molecular biology learn about Taq polymerase nowadays. Why? Because the collective understanding of biology has improved over 200+ years.

You, probably because my argument relies on readers being able to understand the warrants, did not make the connection between understanding theory improves spells and theory improves. The connection is thus:

Harry in the 1700s learns stupefy. He studies the theory behinds it and manages a good stunner.

300 years of innovation and research go by. Spell theory improves.

Harry 2 in the 1900s learns stupefy. He studies the theory, now improved, and manages a great stunner.

Harry 2 in the 1900s learns stupefy he studies the theory behind it and, same as before, manages a good stunner.

You're examples were not of harry casting the spell better than his ancestors or something, it was of harry casting the spell better than HE personally could before.

That's like saying a three year old who learns to walk is proof that the theory behind walking has improved significantly.

Harry is not improving the theory behind anything, hes just understanding the theories that are already there better

****************** But that's not the case. Multiple examples of innovations Harry /does/ see, research awards, research journals, everything I've gone over before does happen. Advancement has occur. It is canon and indisputable that the wizarding world has not stagnated. You're clinging on to these notions because of other fantasy tropes that are very common. It's just not true with the Harry Potter world. Wolfsbane, sectumsempra, obliviate, arthur's sweeping legislation that led to massive changes in proscribed objects, and many more examples are all evidence of change. And in the end, ancient magic is not stronger. Even in the impossible situation where you are correct, ancient magic wouldn't be harder to break because it'd be the same as modern magic. Of course, ancient magic is actually easier to break.

They very much weren't. What I'm getting at (for the third time) is that Harry's stunner in the 1700s would be weaker than in the 1900s because of improvements in the spell.

In any case, how on earth does your theory pass the common sense test? What, wizards who are also human have spent 2000+ years doing nothing?

******************* Okay first off I've been keeping this discussion as civil as possible but you've taken at least one potshot at me every reply so I'm flat out telling you bow that you NEED to take a chill pill, get some good sleep, eat some balanced meals, and stop getting so defensive over something you had not a single part in creating. I get that to many this book is part of thier identity but you're treating this like it's your religion or something.

Secondly theres is not a single thing in canon to suggest that a stunner would be more powerful using modern theory, nothing, not a single scrap of info to suggest that. If anything we know that besides "dark magic" has been the only field besides flight with any true advancement and its considered forbidden, and we know that theres recorded cases of protego being much more powerful than 99 percent of modern wizards due to a story JK tells of a witch throwing back both a horse and its knight rider during a jousting match.

The raids and legislation by mr weasley points more that the world HAS been stagnate as its made out to be like this is the FIRST time this has been an issue for purebloods. meaning up to that point there hadn't been much in terms of change for them.

Oblivate is from the 1500s so that's another thing where you're proving my point. We already talked about the wolfsbane and I agreed with you that the field of potions has seen some advancement but anyone who's read the first book knows that potions are not the same as spells. and sectumsempra has only been known by like 2 people and it would a hundred percent be called dark magic and forbidden if the ministry found out about it.

And also you act like it's a wild assumption that wizards who still wear robes, bo next to nothing about the outside world, uses quills, scrolls, castles, and literally shat themselves for centuries may not be the most progressive of people.

******************** Not really. Frankly, it's been frustrating outlining evidence only for someone to continually disagree with ever-changing points, shifting evidence, occasional confessions of agreement, and yet a lasting inability to admit the evidence is in my favor. Yes, wizards wear robes, yes wizards belong to a different culture. Are you going to call some asian cultures stagnant because they still eat blood? Some african cultures stagnant because they eat mosquitoes? Yeah, they use quills. Quills that auto-refill ink and can answer questions on tests for you. Seems a bit of a step up from pens and pencils. Again, I've also provided evidence for subjects beyond potions. 1500s is not that long ago, certainly not ancient by most definitions, and definitely beyond the 1200s or 1300s.

Multiple entire comments full of evidence to the contrary counter this, but of course, you seem to always forget the multitude of evidence I've brought out to demonstrate this. Again, I reiterate. What is the point of research journals if there is no advancement?

It's hard keeping a debate civil when your opponent constantly changes their points as needed, refuses to engage your evidence, and can't quite seem to admit their case is weak.

I have a feeling you're one of those people who will never understand that magic overrides mundane nature (JKR quote). But, to try, look up the energy in the conjuration of water. Magic does not relate to mundane energy in the Harry Potter universe. It takes magic to defeat magic.

But to show a better-cast recent protego, under your beliefs, what about Grimmson's protego against an obscurial? An entire building directed at him, and his protego blocked it all.

No, the legislation shows progression as in any country. Do you believe a country is stagnant because society has just now changed enough to allow for certain legislation? Would you call the US stagnant for its 200 years of existence because it's taken massive protests and a death for a bill to reform police to be introduces to Congress?

They know little about the muggle world. If I was to ask you about the culture of Nauru, would you be able to answer me? Unlikely, given that I can't answer some questions, given that none (most likely) of us live in Nauru. It seems odd to call wizards stagnant when as you put it "know almost nothing". You have admitted in the past that wizards have advanced, but of course now you're back to a lack of true advancement. Also given that there appears to be no racial or sex based discrimination in the wizarding world, it seems just as progressive as the actual world when it comes to social issues. We might not discriminate based on blood and magic, but we certainly discriminate on race, sex, sexuality, religion, and ethnicity.

1500s is only 400 years ago. Sectumsempra is known by at least 5 people given that Remus Lupin identifies it, Harry Potter uses it, Ron Weasley knows of it, Hermione knows of it, and Snape uses it. It still demonstrates progression.

The stagnant wizarding world is a trope and simply not the case. And if it was, I repeat, how on earth would that make sense?

********************* ...400 years ago IS a long time but anyways rapid fire time, stagnate wizarding world is a trope BECAUSE of Harry Potter, harry and snape are the 2 people who know it and everyone else that's knows OF it are people who personally know the 2 who can use it. The FB movies are pretty unreliable since they get basic timelines wrong alot so I haven't been including them for that reason but in this case that still makes me correct that only 1 percent of wizards have shown anything close to a witches protego from the dark ages.

Also I keep changing arguments cause you're all over the place with your arguments as well, weirdly enough when you bring up different points I have to also bring up different points.

And yes there has been advancement in some forms, but if you remember, my argument has been theres been no shown advancement that would suggest wizards are any stronger or more competent spell casters than they were hundreds of years ago.theres been small advancements in potions and a wierd amount of advancements in flight, but theres been nothing to suggest that the average wizard/witch now is stronger or more competent than he or she would be 300+ years ago.

You bring up research journals as if that's a silver bullet all the time but you do realize 90 percent of research journals are just over analysis of mundane things or have a ton of overlap with previous research it's not like a currency that you can buy progression with. +1 research journal does not equal +1 progress.

Also yes taking 200+ years to pass a simple thing of legislation is an example of stagnation, almost every nation has somewhere it stagnates in, it's just that in wizarding britain it appears as if MOST of it is stuck a century or two in the past. I was specifically targeting your point about mr weasleys legislation because you were using it as proof of a long history of progress when it's only the FIRST bit of progress theyve made in that aspect of thier society.

Plus what are you talking about with the Nauru point, you're aware that wizarding Britain...is in britain right, if I lived in Nauru and I went to school with people who were from Nauru yeah I would know a little about Nauru culture.

Also I get it, I'm just as frustrated as you are for the same reasons but the difference is I'm not taking that out on you because I understand that this isnt worth insulting a stranger over
