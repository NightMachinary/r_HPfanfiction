So the thing I'm searching for was a collection of one-shots. I think they were a collection of Harry/Fleur but I'm not absolutely sure.

One I remember specifically. Fleur died because Harry accidentally forgot to check his house's wards and Harry time travels back to save her. Fleur then dies in Diagon Alley and Harry time travels again to save her. Another time has Fleur dying again because a car hit her. Generally it repeats until Harry learns that Death doesn't like being cheated and resolves to allow Fleur to stay dead
