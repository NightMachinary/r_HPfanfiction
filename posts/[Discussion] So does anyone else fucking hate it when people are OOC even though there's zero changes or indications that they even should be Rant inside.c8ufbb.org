Like mother of all holy fucking BULLSHIT, i was reading this story about harry being sent to another universe on accident, one where he became a death eater and his parents were alive and he had a sister and shit. so when canon harry, CANON HARRY up to book like 6 i think, shows up in their world he's totally confused and everyone around him treats him like the enemy. it was a pretty good story, except some questionable shit that started cropping up toward the middle/end...

a load of UTTER BULLSHIT, with harry suddenly turning into a psycho who kills innocent people to "put them out of their misery" instead of just, you know, killing the people doing the torturing and then getting the victim out of the situation to somewhere safe...because fuck being a sane and rational good person i guess. And he was on the goddamn HOGWARTS EXPRESS for this scene, not in the middle of fucking Voldemort's stronghold with no wand where it could MAYBE be fucking believable - EXCEPT NOT EVEN THEN! You know why? BECUASE THAT ISN"T FUCKING HARRY!!!!!

It is just a HUGE dissonance going on there with the fact that we're supposed to buy that the guy who tore off his invisibility cloak to defend McGonagall for being spit on, the guy who faced Riddle and a basilisk to save Ginny from her soul being drained, the guy who escaped Malfoy manor's basement to rescue Hermione from her torment, the guy who willingly walked to Voldemort in a forest to save the entire school...is the same guy who in this story taking place like, fucking during summer of sixth year, is supposed to seriously be capable of making the dumbass horrific decision to MURDER a torture victim after standing by and WATCHING THEM GET TORTURED, I might add, AND DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT HIMSELF?! Like SHIT, he's just like seriously, "Oh well, guess two minutes of torture means they can't handle it, I'll just kill them on the spot!"

FUCK THAT! Then by this sudden and inexplicable characterization he should've killed Hermione because "She can't handle bellatrix's torture!" or killed Ginny in the Chamber because "Oh her soul being drained is too horrible for her to take!"

The guy who literally chose every single time to SAVE SOMEONE, no matter what the situation, would NOT literally stand by and WATCH Death Eaters torture someone, and THEN think he has the fucking godlike ego to decide to personally execute them and walk away from it because his personal opinion was that they couldn't handle it! That. Is NOT. CANON HARRY. He would've fucking turned on the Death Eaters and apparated the victim away to the Order!

FUCK. Seriously oh my god. It is beyond annoying, it's INFURIATING, that you have every single event and character action up to sixth year of canon, and then out of fucking NOWHERE Harry is all of a sudden acting like an entirely different person! What the FUCK? Don't tell me that's fucking CANON HARRY when it's clearly somebody wearing his face like a meat suit!

That's why I fucking cannot STAND divergence fics that DO NOT KEEP SHIT IN CHARACTER. Because it isn't! They just turn on a dime and become somebody entirely different for no reason at all! It's goddamn stupid and fucking terrible to even try to read.

Don't write shit like that if you can't keep them in character! You CANNOT make anyone believe that they're even the same person. They got swapped out with polyjuice is what happened.


** Did you post this rant at the author directly? If so, what's the response?

Yes, ridiculous OOCness is why I hate “Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness” so much. It's my number 2 pet peeve after mindless canon rehash.

**** Never, I consider this thing for the equivalent of Dragon Ball Evolution for the Harry Potter universe. Except Dragon Ball author decided to write a sequel after seeing it, he didn't go and say "Yup that's good, consider it canon ".

Whats your favourite OOC part in Cursed Child: ○Harry "it's ok to be in Slytherin " who treat his son bad because he is in Slytherin ? ○ Ron "a love potion almost killed me" who give love potion as a joke. ○ Snape "I'm proud he carries my name " ○Diggory the "I'm a ridiculously likeable character " who become a Death Eater cause he did bad in a Tournament ?

I also love how Rowling said Ron and Hermione are not a very good couple and would need counseilling, but accept that fic where Hermione is just miserable without Ron.

** Yes, Harry Potter who use disarming Charm in the middle of an ambush because even Stuner could have killed the guy (who try to murder him ), which is so characteristic of him that's how they identify him will kill someone to put him out of his misery. Right

**** I agree with you. Canon Harry would NEVER kill anyone, and Rowling did put a big emphasis on how bad Killing was. Harry almost killed one character in the show, and it's Malfoy with a spell he did'nt know the effects.\\
Even while facing Voldemort (both times) he uses a fucking Experliarmus. And technically Voldemort killed himself with his own Killing Curse.

At this point I want to add, if Harry had managed to disarm Voldemort. Then what ? 1st time you are still alone surrounded by Death Eaters and Voldemort showed he knew some wandless magic (at least enough to conjure his wand ) 2nd time you are still in the middle of a battlefield.

What was he trying to achieve with this spell ?

** If you're talking about Stranger in an Unholy Land - it's not canon Harry, it's a version of Harry who has absorbed the memories and instincts of his Death Eater AU equivalent.

** I read it only a month ago, I think. Maybe I'm much much more immune to OOCness but it made a certain amount of sense at the time??

For context to begin with, this isn't Canon Harry. He has instincts of his Mirror self. The narrative made it very clear that he could not save all the children himself if he turned. There even was the chance of Voldemort joining the fight if Harry clearly betrayed him which Voldemort already suspected. To avoid a slaughter of the children he redirected the death eater's focus to the engine which had already crashed into a big tree trunk. He wasn't expecting anyone to be alive. Also, he was playing for time because he had already sent a message to Dumbledore and was expecting him any second. Now here Canon Harry's Instinct would indeed be to save everyone but this isn't Canon Harry. He has the instincts of a killer and judging the trolley witch to be a lost cause that would not survive this ordeal no matter what, kills her. The same Harry a few minutes later risks the whole charade to save a little girl since she was not a lost cause.

I did stop reading the fic soon after when Harry got led into a trap on a ship. It just didn't hold my interest too much because it didn't feel like anything that he would feel terrible about was coming out of Harry's other instincts. It was more of a switch when I like a slider bar.

I suppose OOCness never bothered me at all. My first proper fic was HPMoR so you can guess that the idea was practically shoved in my face. It's only when the plot stops moving anywhere significant that I leave a fic. It's also why I can't handle Canon-compliant character fics. I know the significant plot already so I can't bring myself to care. Same reason I never reread or re-watch even my most favorite things until I have well and truly forgotten them.

**** I wasn't arguing or anything, in fact I agree with you in principle. Ron, who I am more attached to as a character is often all of a sudden worse than a death eater with no indication of why. I hate that wholeheartedly.

It's just that I remembered this particular fic and wanted to explain my thoughts so as to reduce any frustration you may feel and start a discussion on more civil terms. No harm done.
