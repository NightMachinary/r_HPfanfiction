#+TITLE: I've wondered about the magic schools around the world. And I stumbled upon the topic of a school existing in Russia, I do not remember the name, but what surprised me the most was that Poland, Ukraine or Hungary do not have any school, and it is not known whether they attended the one in Russia.

It is surprising and confusing. What do you think about this?


** JKR's approach to formal magical education is to make it relatively rare, with just 11 formally recognised schools of magic in the world. This is actually not so unusual as it sounds - universal education is a fairly modern invention, and for much of history education was by private tutor only, with "schools" being restricted to, for example, clergy.

To supplement the 11 major schools, there is also an implication that there are a number of smaller, more transitory, more informal schools.

My own interpretation of these smaller schools is that they crop up as a kind of extension of home schooling. A person is teaching their kids, and agrees to teach the neighbour's kids too. Word spreads, and they take on a few more. They may even get an assistant. Before long you have a community school, small in size (limited to the local community), and rather informal in nature, with the kids not necessarily receiving a broad education but rather learning whatever the teacher happens to specialise in.

Then the local kids all become adults and there's no one left to teach, at least for a few years, and the school stops. Or the teacher gets too old and retires, or dies. Or there's an accident or a scandal and the school's reputation is tarnished. Whatever the cause, the school doesn't last - doesn't gain institutional momentum of its own. Just like the vast majority of small businesses in real life.

In addition to this type of smaller school and home schooling, I also picture there being apprenticeships - like Stan on the Knight Bus.

Personally I quite like this system. It makes inequality a major theme of the work, which is a theme I tend to enjoy - inequality within a country like Britain between those who attend the major school and those who do not, and inequality internationally between countries with a major school and those with a more informal system. History is full of winners and losers in the never-ending contest within and between nations, and an unequal magical world feels more authentic to me than some egalitarian utopia where everyone gets a quality education.

** The magical school system outside of Britain is extremely under-explained, and is quite inadequate. JKR simply didn't care much about that, and it shows - understandable, since it simply isn't the focus. Like, AFAIK we still don't know 3 of the 11 major schools ><

From what we do have, there's plenty of nonsense. South America has one school - and it's in Brazil, which is the only major nation there that doesn't share the same language (and is literally called 'Wizarding Castle'). Africa gets one school in Uganda (called Uganda School of Magic). Asia gets one school in Japan (called 'magic place'). North America gets Ilvermorny.

By that standard, at least Europe gets a few schools. But we can tell by density that even there, Britain was the only one she bothered to think about, because there's one school for the British isles, one school in France, one school with a german name & balkan students in Scandinavia, and one in Russia. That's still a lot of areas untouched and bustled into a foreign language/culture institution.

In the end, if it's not the focus of a fic, it's not /that/ important. And when it does become important, well... it's one of the things that I think should be fixed/improved, so sticking to canon on it is meh in my opinion. Canon wasn't meant to stand up to scrutiny on the non-british parts, and it doesn't.

** It surprises me that Romania doesn't have one. The country is quite unique in its part of the world because of the fact that its a Latin based language instead of a Slavic one like the ones spoken around and has its own culture having borrowed from the Austro-Hungarians, the Slavs and the Balkans. Yet Romania and its folklore play quite a significant background role in the HP lore.

*** There's a lot of places that are lacking one, and become less surprising when none of them do. Eg, China, India and the entirety of the spanish speaking world have a combined total of 0 major magical schools that we know of.

Romania not getting one in that context isn't too surprising. It's more surprising which countries /do/ get a school like that :P

** The way I view it is that if it's a main school like Hogwarts, assume there's some type of smaller branches of it. They're still part of the school, but it also helps explain how Ilvermorny helps Mexican and Caribbean students

** The Magic Schools that JKR choose was for maximum pandering to today's demographics without really giving any thought to it.

No magic school in Greece, ROME, Egypt, or Fertile crescent is a meme.
