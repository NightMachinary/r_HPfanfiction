how about where another character is reborn as harry. like Hermione, Mokoto Kusanagi, Chell, GLaDOS, John Cena, Deadpool, female Deadpool, whoever the fuck else you know who is not harry (or Voldemort cuz he kinda already is harry).

cuz wouldn't it be nice if he were older

then he wouldn't have to wait so long

and wouldn't it be nice to be a rebirth

in the world the don't belong.

you know it is gonna make it that much cooler

when you can say goodnight and be reborn

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up

In the morning to defeat the dark lord

after having spent the day together

attempted murder the whole night through

happy times alone we've been dying '

I wish that every death was never ending

wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think, and wish, and hope, and pray, it might come true

Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do

We could be reborn

And then we'd be happy

Wouldn't it be nice

You know it seems the more we talk about it

It only makes it worse to live without it

But let's talk about it

Wouldn't it be nice?


** There was one with the undertaker from kuroshitsuji being reborn as harry potter and it looked so interesting... Ended up absolutely disappointing.

  Anko dies in the cave after she is left by Sasuke. She is drawn into the body of Iris Potter to take over her life after an unfortunate event that lead to little Iris's death. How will Anko react to a world full of wand wielding fools in the body of a child? Warning! This is rated M for a reason and there will be Femslash! You are warned

** In Tardisistheonlywaytotravel's like a bat out of hell ( linkao3(10382739) ) the kyuubi no kitsune from naruto is reborn as a female harry. It's kinda crackish so far, but really entertaining.

  When Naruto died at the hands of a civilian during his academy days, so did the Kyuubi no Kitsune. Now here the Kyuubi was, reincarnated, and bouncing around in an eleven year old girl's body, while half the wizarding world treated her like the second coming of Merlin (whoever that was)... and the rest didn't know what to make of her...[HP/Naruto fic utilising dubious canon elements. You have been warned!]
