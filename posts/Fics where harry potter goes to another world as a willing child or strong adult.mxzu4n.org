Looking for fics where harry potter leaves earth and goes to another world without being kidnapped as a child, especially post canon adult harry. As long as harry doesnt get kidnapped as a child. Like in "the shadow of angmar" where harry goes to lotr (during that time he was dead in the white train station) without his wand and unable to use magic, its fine because he's just old enough to be an adult but if he was younger then I'd be annoyed. Basically I want harry going to another world, if he's young he has to be happy to go to another world.

  Elia Martell expected to die in King's Landing, but through some force found herself in the home of a war-weary Harry Potter. She just wants to return to Westeros; wants to see her family, wants the sandy dunes of Dorne and the peace of the Water Gardens. Aegon and Rhaenys are all she has, and for their sake she might have to reclaim a throne that nearly cost them everything.Harry Potter had died in his war and returned to a Wizarding World hell-bent on remaining in the throes of war-time politics. He was tired of Magical Britain, tired of fighting a useless war, but he has a son to care for and no force on earth would stop him from doing so.Raising three kids is hard, raising two of them to eventually rule a kingdom even harder, especially when you're trying to find a way to Westeros.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
