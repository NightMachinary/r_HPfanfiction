No right? It uses electricity so they wouldn't work so how do they store the foods in need of refrigeration? Is there like a big box with preservation charms or something?


** Ive read fics where they call it an icebox but to my understanding there's no ice or anything to make it cold, it's just preserves the food with a stasis charm.

But in most that make sense, and I think it's like this in canon too, they keep their food in a pantry and that also has stasis/preservation charms on it. If their pantries are charmed to keep everything in the right temp, I guess that means they can keep their milk and eggs and butter and stuff in there too and if they can do that then they'd never really need fridges.

*** Preservation charms seem unlikely, because in DH the trio has bread that goes mouldy. If there's an anti-rotting spell, Hermione doesn't know it, which suggests that either it doesn't exist, is advanced magic, or simply obscure.

**** You can freeze bread. And I dont really think keeping something frozen is beyond a wizards capability. There was a fair amount of stupidity going on in that camping trip, which I suppose any group of 17 years olds would do. Think of how students behave.

**** I'd definitely believe that Hermine isn't up to date with household spells - why would she know them? She's 17, she doesn't seem to care that much about food, she has a lot of other things on her plate. She also grew up in a muggle house; her parents wouldn't have taught her, and at Hogwarts, the Burrow or Grimmauld Place those things are already cared for by others (so even if she's seen where the food is kept she wasn't the one to set them up)

**** she's muggleborn, she's used todoing things the muggle way. She was more concerned with other things.

** Obviously, they do not have electrical fridges lol.

However, historically, fridges evolved from large insulated boxes that were filled with ice, and those boxes evolved from deep holes in the ground that were filled with snow or ice. That works surprisingly well -- in moderate climates, you can easily keep the snow and ice of the winter past the summer. If you dig deep enough, 15 or so feet, the temperature is around 8Â°C year round. Snow and ice melts very slowly then.

So I suppose they could use that. Or ... they simply use magic to spell food not to spoil.

Like some castle dungeons, perhaps?

IIRC, Snape's classroom in the dungeons is described as being quite cold. It would make sense for some potions and potion ingredients to need to keep refrigerated. And the kitchens are down near the dungeons too, so it's not hard to imagine there being some cold storage areas down there somewhere.

** preservation charms is something that is often used in fanon. No need to slow down chemical reactions when you can stop them completely with magic.

I prefer to imagine that Wizarding cuisine is more 18th century in form. Lots of saltings and preserving in clarified butter, that sort of thing. What you're likely to see on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN9AnOxpA0U][Townsends]] for instance.

Maybe the existance of vanishing charms and magically aided cooking means that every meal is cooked from fresh ingrediants and the idea of storing stuff isn't really culturally engrained. After all, the market is only ever an apparation away.

Thanks for the interesting question.

** I've see 'cooling cupboards', which is basically the cupboard under the stairs: food storage edition. More often than not though, it's preservation charms.

** Or they could use an actual ice box? And transfigure/conjure ice for it? You know, those things that have been very common in the 19th/20th century?
