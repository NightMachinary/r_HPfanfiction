Griphook stole the sword of Gryffindor, ownership seems convoluted, and they have a monopoly on banking. Is there any fanfiction where the Goblins flaws are highlighted.


** Linkffn(Firebird's Son: Book I of the Firebird Trilogy By: Darth Marrs) has Greedy Goblins, Goblin wars and postulates that the entire race is dependent on inter-species rape as their primary form of procreation.

The Entire work is profoundly OC and is worth a read for the audacity of it's ideas alone, if not its execution.

It is also, that rarest of things, complete!
