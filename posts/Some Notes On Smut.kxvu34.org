It's not always necessary. Here are some pointers:

- It should never come following the big confession. People /will/ bully you about it.
- If you're going to write the scene, have a basic grasp of anatomy. If characters are sticking their boy bits into the girl's ladybits, you're too young to be writing smut.
- Understand some basic components of sexual activity; i.e. oral, anal, etc.
- If you don't want your characters to get pregnant, try and avoid characters just behaving like a firehose of semen. Or a morning-after pill. It‘a common to have two characters have sex for the first time in an unusual occurrence. The chances of being on birth control hit zero, and there's not a condom in sight.
- If the sex isn't directly important, you might want to ditch it. Sex filler isn't great.
- Sex is important if adds characterization to a relationship. Example: For a couple that only stays together because of sex, seeing sex can help contrast their everyday interactions
- If characters are going to come to emotional realizations, don't put it in during the sex. They can have their realization while caressing the dude's finely muscled chest or whatever, putting it in the sex is kind of odd.
- The morning-after can also be used as an emotional scene.
- There's a thing called a scene break which will assist you in the above endeavors.
- There's a rule in writing, cutting your writing down by 10% makes it better. Not always true, but should be considered.
- Don't do it in fluff fics.
- Sex is an activity, not something inherent to relationships. Characters can have sex. Try and be thoughtful about the relationships of the characters.
- None of the above applies in any way to porn. Edit: removed pulling out, because it really didn't get my point Edit: clarification

** So I'm actually a plot+smut writer (among others). And I'm not sure how I feel about this post. (Had to post twice, posted early on accident.)

1.  "Not following the confession." Strong disagree. I think this only works if there's not building up to the moment, otherwise sex is a very natural reaction to mirrored interest. Now, a fourteen year old Ron pining for Hermione for years and he finally tell her? Eh, yeah. Def need to see the relationship first. A majority of fics had a steady slow burn or are injected with the background info to skip that.

2.  Fully agree. Get artsy it you want to. "And they collapsed into the bed, learning each other until the dusk blurred to dawn. Time slipped away until nothing existed but the feeling of him pressed against her." But if the idea makes you uncomfortable, just literally never mention it and let readers assume.

3.  Yes-ish... but pulling out does nothing... so not that unless it's a suprise pregnancy fic. I don't think you have to include the potion/contraception charm line in small fics like one shot. Usually I work it into longer fics elsewhere separate from the sex scene. Like when talking to Madame Pomfrey about medications or when another charater is dealing with period symptoms and MC is not. Also fics that randomly get preachy and clinic screw up the pacing and should be avoided.

4.  Amount of semen does not equate to likely hood of pregnancy. Particularly if MC is on BC of any kind. Your BC doesn't just get overwhelmed by seven. Also, addressing a problem that doesn't need to be addressed for plot purposes just comes of preachy and pads word count. Ie. Draco and Ginny get together. The next morning he freaks out about pregnancy and she starts a fight about blood status? Needed. Ron and Hermione finally getting together in the last chapter before the HEA? Not needed.

5.  Sex filler sucks and it's usually bad. Hard agree.

6.  Agree, mostly. But I don't love when fics try to show the rainbow of emotions through sex. Ie. Angry sex, sad sex, comfort sex. You get one, maybe two a fic.

7.  Harddddd disagree. There is nothing more intimate and personal than looking someone in the eye during intercourse. It is a very frequent moment of revelations. Should they confess mid doggy style? No. But can Hermione realize that she actually lives Fred during a 'just' friends with benefits session? Hell yes.

8.  Yes.

9.  Omg yes.

10. And back to no. Nothing disappoints me more as an author than when a fic is wonderfully written, emotional, slow burn andddd... the sex is rushed and poorly paced. I have betad for at least ten authors and this is ALWAYS the problem. If your sex scene is done in two paragraphs just don't write it.

11. Agreed

12. Also agreed.

13. Def. I've written PwP as well and that's a whole different ball game but it does make me a better smut writer. It's honestly probably the best way to improve sex scenes for novice authors.

Ultimately I think you've got your heart in the right place but smut writing is way more nuanced than simple rules and tips. Its personal to each story and everything I've written goes out the door depending on what's going on with the plot. If you are writing a fic about a sex Ed professor at hogwarts, get clinical and preachy. If you are writing a fic about two people who are just trying to be strangers who meet up and leave, don't worry about the relationship.

The best way to handle smut is to find someone to read it and give honest feedback. They'll help your sort out where it reads wrong and where it needs more.

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk

*** Thanks for responding. First, I'm being hyperbolic. There are exceptions to every rule in writing. These are meant to be general tips that are also funny. (I failed at being funny.) Tips don't always apply, but if they can help, I want them to help. Context matters, /always,/ but occasionally these can help. I focused on what I see most; the first sex scene between the two kids who just confessed. I don't read a lot of smutcentric fics, so I went with advice that helps for the most common fics I see.

1. Context matters.

3-4. The point was more about having some clue about sex. Oral is a thing. Anal is a thing. Pulling out matters, because if I have to read one more fic where someone gets pumped full of semen like the dude is a firehose, and then there's no concern about pregnancy, I will lose my mind. This is only really bad in fics where they do this right after implying that this was an /unexpected/ outcome for both parties. The rest of the time it's cool, but telling me that these characters wouldn't be on birth control and then doing the scene makes the problem occur. It's a problem stories make for themselves. The firehose of semen was making fun of the way it's commonly written, not a comment on the amount itself.

1. I think we agree on this.

2. Context matters. I was being hyperbolic. That's definitely a pattern in this list.

3. You're agreeing with me. You are advocating cutting a scene to make the story more solid on the whole. That's the idea behind the rule. Ditch the extraneous. Ditch the bad. Keep the good. It doesn't always apply, but it's helpful in the revision process.

11-12. Hermione and Fred in a friends-with-benefits scenario? Interesting.

1. This was a joke, but I honestly think you're right. It removes the need for a larger story and allows you to focus on writing a good scene. Short stories are similar, but for main plot stuff, rather than smut.

**** 1. Def disagreeing or even just dismissing the point as extraneous in itself. Saying ditch the bad and keep the good kind of is assumed. Noone wants to keep the bad but they don't /think/ it's bad. Honestly me (and my classically trained SO) have always hated the writing 'rules' like this one. It's fine for teaching ten year olds but lack the neuance to go father. Other examples in this category are "said is dead" , "5 paragraph essay", "show don't tell" , and "adverbs are bad" (that one doesn't have a witty saying).

Even if you can't write smut, the story sometimes demands smut depending on how you wrote it until that point.

11-12. If you wanna write it... I won't be mad. Just sayin~~~~ (huge fan of the rarepair)

***** If you're talking about the semen firehose being extraneous... It is. It's just a pet peeve. If you're talking about rules... I don't like rules either, but I don't think they're useless. I like tips. They give a new perspective. I like writing funny lists more though. I've noticed that the more useful 'rules' tend to be for writers, rather than /writing/

90% is a good piece of advice for writers because it encourages you to consider pieces of the story seriously. In revision, it's easy to become stuck on liking everything. It forces the writer to think in terms of an overall story, rather than just what you like. I should probably clarify, most things are only bad in context. A 'bad' smut scene might be a 'good' smut scene somewhere else. But when it shouldn't be there, it becomes a 'bad' smut scene. That's what this rule refers to. The good is useful, the bad is extraneous.

Rules for /writing/ are much less useful, as they simplify the cause of an issue and lack nuance in the solution. 'Said is dead' addresses both overuse of the word 'said*'*, as well as the overuse of dialogue tags. Both are an issue, but not always. If taken too far, you end up with scenes where you have no idea who's speaking, and when you do, it's because the characters were just tagged using a word you will /never/ see again. I don't think I need to explain the ideas for the other ones.

It's those rules that I don't like, and would rather replace with tips. Tips make you think. I mean, look at the response you had. You just thought of so many places where they wouldn't apply. You gave me ideas for when to ignore the tips, as well as anyone else who reads this thread. That's /exactly/ what I want :). I'll abstain from the evil laugh, it doesn't translate to the page well.

** Regarding the anatomy thing...I prefer it when the author can actively describe the sex act but doesn't need to explicitly say cock etc...but it's still very clear what's happening. In well-written fics it shows how the sex doesn't overshadow the story. However that doesn't mean saying ridiculous things like 'ladybits.' Not that explicit smut is a bad thing I'm just saying I think it's my preference. This fic is an example, not that I'm expecting anyone to read it but it's evidence of sex without coming across as porny IMO: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9117322/1/But-I-Want-You]]

*** I think the point is, that if you don't have a proper grasp on Sex Ed, you are too young to be writing smut.

The boybits ladybits is just a joke about how you can sound if you don't understand how sex works when you write smut. See what happened in My Immortal's sex scene if you want an example.

** I disagree with the pulling out bit.

USE CONDOMS.

They are essential. Yes it might tear in certain instances, but it's far more effective and less risky.

Condoms are practical, effective and far more simpler than the other things out there.

Also important note, birth control pills, in my knowledge, can effect women's health in a bad manner. This can go in a large spectrum, from depression to change in hormones and other health problems, depending on the individual.

Just a dose of friendly advice seeing that many schools refuse to impart it.

*** I just want to point out a topic that recently came up in another post, these guys are wizards and witches, why would they be using a 100% muggle thing like a condom or the birth control pil??

I believe with all my heart that the magical community has something better and easier to use with only a swish of their wand, if not then I don't think Hogwarts, the big castle full of hormonal teenagers and very few adults around, would be so pregnant free as the books allude to.

So no dear authors! Don't use condoms! Use a magical contraption of your own imagination!
