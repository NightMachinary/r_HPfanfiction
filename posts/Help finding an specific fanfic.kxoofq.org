:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
PLEASE help me, I have searched for this forever and I can't seem to find it. It's one of my personal favs of all time Ok so, the story is about a Harry that gets betrayed by Dumbledore after killing Voldemort so he goes to the past. In the past he discovers he can't die bcs he's master of death so he turns dark, super powerful, and learns how to do some creepy version of inferi. Then he lets himself be captured until he's back in his time, escapes, breaks havoc and ends up winning and letting Voldemort take over That's kinda what I remember about it. I thiiink it was on fanfiction.net
