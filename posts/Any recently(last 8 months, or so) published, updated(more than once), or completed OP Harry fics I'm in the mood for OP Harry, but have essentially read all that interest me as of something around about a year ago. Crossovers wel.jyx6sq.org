** Can you link some of your favorite OP! Harry crossovers? Been looking for a while and i've seen you post about op harry alot.

​

Edit: Forgot some links for OP harry stories here you go.

​

linkffn(13563881) - Writing is OK, from what i can remember it gets rambly in some areas and there's alot of information dumps.

linkffn(13701065) - Harry potter and World of Warcraft crossover, linking this one because it's recent, if you want you can read the authors previous stories if you haven't, lots of smut though and if you're one of the people who gets triggered alot i would definetly recomment you stay clear of this and the prequels.

  The Fates of the MCU have written for Harry Potter to die during a failed Obscurial Transformation. A drunken conversation between the heads of the Marvel verse has changed that and Harry has ended up with Gamer powers among other things. Watch Harry go through Hogwarts, Kamar-Taj, and Xavier's institute as he learns to use his powers and level up. Contains a Flerken. Harem by Arc3

  Third in series, read prequels or be confused. Harry had spent his whole life wishing for magic to be more abundant, and that was precisely what he got. He wasn't even particularly upset about the many serious dangers inherent in such a thing, for what was life without challenge? The irony of ending up in Azeroth after all the references was a bit on the nose, though.

*** Itachi is that a baby([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby]]) is one of my all time favourites. It's got a Dumbledore who's given up, and goes along with the crazy. A Byakugan using Harry raised by the Akatsuki(with the results you'd expect), and can't forget GIRL-TOBI.

A few by Clell65619 like Sun Source, and the Bewitched one is also great.

Seventh Horcrux linkffn(10677106) gets mentioned here all the time, but in case you haven't read it.

Here's a DxD cross with him being literally God linkffn(12098778).

That's the few I can think of off the top of my head. There's also stuff like Core Threads, and anything, and I mean anything written by stargatesg1fan1. I don't read his stuff anymore since I saw him write a lemon scene between a mentally hundreds(or at least like 50+, I can't remember) of years old Harry, and an mentally, and physically 8 year old Tonks. I mean his stories were already having lemons of an uncomfortable nature for me, but that was the final straw. If you ignore that one story though(the 1 million+ word story), the others have an OP Harry. Lots of lemons though.
