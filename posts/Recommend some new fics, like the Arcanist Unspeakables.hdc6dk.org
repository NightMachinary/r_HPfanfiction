I read the arcanist and finished it in one sitting. I liked it very much. The plot and character development could have been better but the sheer scale of the world the author built was amazing. So, please suggest fics like it, where dumbledore is powerful, harry is also powerful but within reaosnable limits.


** I would suggest whitesquirrel, they do fantastic worldbuilding. Try Accidental Animagus by them, from the fanfics I can remember I think that fits what you're looking for best.

  Adversity has formed Harry into something more than a mere wizard. Terrifying magical warriors whose mastery of the arcane arts have struck down armies now count him as one among them - a Battle Mage. In distant Britain, the rise of a Dark Lord brings him into conflict with the nation that had birthed him and abandoned him. NOT Slash. First five chapters written already.
