I can see this going either way - some adults could see Hogwarts houses and their rivalry as juvenile nonsense that they've long grown out of.

Alternatively, given people's liking for tribalism it could remain something that matters a great deal to some. Giving preference to alumni of your house, and discriminating against those from others might well happen (called in-group bias). Networking is a thing in real life, as is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_boy_network][Old Boy Network]], so, for example, would a senor ministry person choosing one of two candidates for promotion always pick the one from their old house because they simply "knew them better". Would Molly Weasly be completely happy, without reservation, if one of her sons brought home a Slytherin girlfriend for her to meet?

I think this comes up in canon is when Hagrid shows himself to be rather prejudiced against Slytherins. But it's anybody's guess whether his attitude is typical or atypical. And we hear at second-hand that Lucius Malfoy is keen for Draco to go into Slytherin; clearly it mattered to him.

I'm interested to hear opinions on this as I'm mainly writing about adult characters in non-Hogwarts settings. So clearly this sort of thing could be a distinct undertone.


** I reckon house based nepotism is absolutely a thing, especially for high ranking positions, or even plain old bias. Would a former Gryffindor choose to promote their hard working Hufflepuff subordinate or would they subconsciously think that a Gryffindor would do the job better? Would they pass over hiring a Slytherin because they can't be trusted, while a former Ravenclaw wouldn't be as prejudiced since the had no rivalry with Slytherin at school. Bias ingrained at a young age is a powerful thing and we see how prejudiced the wizarding world naturally is anyway, plus as you say proof is absolutely seen IRL with the old boys club, so I reckon the housing prejudice still exists, it's just not actually verbally acknowledged.

*** I agree with you. It'd be an uncouncious action. Harry wouldn't assume someone is likely a liar because they are Slytherin but his trust in them would suffer and if a Gryffindor and a Slytherin gave two different accounts about something, he'd be more inclined to believe his alumni. On a similar vein, he'd uncounciously expect a cleverer solution from a Ravenclaw while would expect a hufflepuff's solution to focus more on effort.

A belief system engrained in a child at such an impressionable age tends to stick around and show its face in subtle manner throughout one's life unless the person makes a councious effort to stay objective.

** Think like how people treat their alma mater. Some would continue to live it up, some would look back wistfully, some would ignore it except maybe during a particularly big time sport event or happening.

It may matter more among a bunch of parents during the school year if there kids are in the same house at their parent and the bunch is bragging and such.

** I see it more like confirmation bias. Everyone was in a house, and many know each other from school, so if someone does something, they try to fit it in the school cliché - like "Well, he is a Gryffindor". Or they use it in conversation - "You're a Ravenclaw, use your brain". But things or traits that go against the cliché get ignored in such situations.

** I remember a story talking about how because Dumbledore favored the Gryffindor's so much, they didn't get many of the higher jobs in the ministry and ST Mungos (except Aurors as expendable) because they had gotten all the breaks in Hogwarts. I think it was a discussion with McGonagall who had her eyes opened to the blatant favoritism of Dumbledore and his mistreatment and neglect of the other houses. Can't remember which one though, sorry.

** I would say definitely yes, even if they don't realize it. People already like to mentally sort people into categories and, well, the Sorting Hat does that literally. It's probably impossible for it not to at least somewhat affect your first impressions of people in both professional and social settings.
