What sort of ideas does everyone have for rituals what would you think they would need and what would your ritual do ???


** Mine tend towards two different things. In one fic the Black family have total circles that look more like a basin or bowl because they use a lot of blood and other liquids, and the magic ‘drinks' the liquid.

I don't want to go too much into it, because that's all part of the story.

The other kind in my stories have either a live person bleeding, to again ‘fuel' the magic, or either conversely or concurrently use crystals, locks of hair, or another kind of sacrifice for the ritual. But I look at the ritual and what the intended result is and then pick things for the sacrifice. Narcissa is wanting to know how her marriage will go? She sacrifices a skein of her hair. Regulus wants to know about the future of his family? He sacrifices some of Sirius's hair or even a lock of Nymphadora's hair (as the first baby in the new generation).

For me it's all very emotional and passionate because the Black family are so wildly emotional. If I was crafting rituals for other characters, or even other species, they might be a little more formulaic.

In the end because they're touted as the ‘old ways' in my fics and any others I think that they are a little more heavy handed and generalised than something that would be worked out or written by sa Hermione. Hermione would want to be very precise, where as the others are like ‘I want children so I'm going to use some of my jizz in this ritual' lmao

** There are a bunch of fascinating rituals in linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13051824/1/New-Blood]])

And Kiera Marcos has a bunch in her fics that use deities and/or human sacrifice

Then of course Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11800899/chapters/26618625]]) where demons are obviously involved

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
