I don't remember much about it, but I do remember Harry leaves Hogwarts for a school in the US... If I remember correctly it is a split story, the author wrote two versions using the same prompt, just with different choices. I know the American school incorporated technology and he winds up with a gf. Sorry I cannot remember much more.


** Bellerophon30 - the brave new world. The other story is “Harry Potter and the final straw”

*** You wouldn't happen to know a place I could download Final Straw at? I found A Brave New World, but cannot find the other... And Bellerophone30 has removed everything.
