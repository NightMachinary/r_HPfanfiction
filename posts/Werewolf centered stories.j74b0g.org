  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

  When Remus came back to himself, he was in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, naked, shivering with pain and with cold, and he could taste blood.“I don't have the full story,” said Madam Pomfrey. “You'll have to speak to Minerva or Albus for that. But Black has escaped, and - Remus, I am so sorry. You bit Hermione Granger.”or: a story of innocence, experience, and prejudice, spanning the summer holidays after Prisoner of Azkaban.

  “You know Professor Lupin was a werewolf?” Hermione said, ten minutes into a very awkward lunch she had asked for in an equally awkward letter. Lavender pushed a sauteed carrot through a little puddle of pasta sauce. “I think everyone heard about that one. Someone told the papers, or something, right?” “Er, yes,” said Hermione. “Snape did. Which is what I-- I mean, it's related. Oh, I wish you'd gotten to talk to Remus about this. He was a lovely man.” “Not as lovely as Lockhart,” Lavender said and she and Hermione spent a moment in wistful remembrance. “God, I feel old,” Lavender said. “Anyway, Snape,” said Hermione. “Snape and Lupin. When Lupin was at school, Snape would make him a potion that would... tame him, on full moons. He could just curl up in his office and sleep by the fire. If you're interested, I'm trying to learn how to brew it myself.” Lavender shook her head. “We're not friends,” she said. “Never have been. So why are you doing all this?” Hermione looked like she was trying to say “we're friends,” but she couldn't get it out. -- Werewolf!Lavender, post-canon

*** Well, Lavender kickass werewolf (not from the Battle, it was not the full moon night then, it happened later) is in all [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] post-war stories. And she is awesome, “iron hand in the pink laced velvet glove”, the magical Legally Blond (almost, she is an Auror, not a lawyer).

** This one is great: Remus is undercover with the werewolves and is sheltering a muggle prisoner.

  When a human is captured by werewolves, escape is impossible, but she might be able to accomplish one thing: kill Remus Lupin. He's the most evil werewolf in the pack because he's the best at pretending to be human.
