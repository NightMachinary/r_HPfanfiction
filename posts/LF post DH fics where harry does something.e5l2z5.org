Fics where Harry doesn't settle for mediocrity where he does something other than just being an auror

i have read plenty of one shots where he becomes a curse breaker or mercenary or just fights against the dark because thats who he is but he doesn't have to be a warrior he could do anything as long he doesn't settle down and waste his life

linkffn(Novocaine) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13365454/1/Casting-Shadows]]) are good examples of what i meant

no slash or hinny or harmony


** One that I really enjoyed (note that it has fem!harry and f/f later in the fic but not the main focus) was linkffn(13318951). Harry was an archeologist/curse breaker and then becomes Hogwarts history teacher.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): Harry, who was raised by Sirius and never went to Hogwarts, hires Ginny to accompany on some postwar adventures.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): The incorrigible establishment of Magical Britain added a marriage law to their long list of atrocities, so Harry joined Hermione in overthrowing the decrepit Ministry and Wizengamot. But that's only the easier part.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929): The Earth is slowly turning uninhabitable for Magicals. Harry leads his people to convert the retired aircraft carrier HMS Invincible into a spaceship. Out there, they meet the remnants of the Colonial Fleet and Cylons.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): My favorite postwar fic overall. Here, Harry and his friends declare war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They begin with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who have escaped justice again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971): Still the only non crossover “Wizards in space” story. Lots of problems, but still worth reading imho.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

*** And you missed the point of fanfiction... Holy fuck, how can you be active in this sub if you nag about a simple request like this? I wonder how you react to the really outlandish requests if you feel compelled to comment on this for not being in line with canon... Fanfiction is all about playing "what if" in the sandbox JKR provided.

**** You have to be kidding me. Disagreeing (even strongly) with very strong original opinion (“settle for mediocrity”) is suddenly a bashing? I have never said a word /ad personam/, I hope that all what I said was /ad rem/. If I have in any way offended the author of the original post, I am seriously sorry for it, please, speak up, so that I can apologise properly.
