I mean the charismatic, manipulative Tom. NOT The insane megalomaniac Voldemort. I Would Like Tom to corrupt harry in some way. Harry doesn't have to be The BWL, but i can roll with it.

RECOMMEND AND I'LL SEND YOU A FREE HUG!!!


** All Right! Sorry it took me so long, had a weird day at work, this is the first chance I've had to sit down at my computer. Also, I would like to take a moment to say how much it annoys me when HP/LV posts get downvoted... I don't downvote when people ask for fluffy HP/GW fics, so canon shipers should leave my Tomarry slash alone... /pout/

(Ok, it may have taken me even /longer/ because I got distracted when I started re-reading/skimming some of my suggestions. Oops, lol)

My absolute bloody favourite, by a sadly large margin, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]]. I think it was actually the first Tommary I ever read, and it frankly spoiled me, as I have yet to find another that is quite as good. The thing I love most about this fic is how believable it is. The characters stick pretty close to canon (personality wise) and if someone is acting OOC, there is backstory as to why. It also had some amazing explanations, like why Harry didn't die from the killing curse (and explanation that has actually become my headcanon), why the Dark Lord went insane, how he ended up good-looking and not insane in the story... Harry is Grey, but believably grey, and still very much Harry. I could rant more, but I don't want to give it away, lol. The only downside is that it's not complete, and is very very slow to update (last update was in April). But it doesn't leave you at a cliffhanger, and I've probably read it 5 times or more lol.

Next, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/380762/chapters/622118][Abandon]] and the sequel Reclaim. Slightly fluffy Dark Lord, but it's highly amusing. I wouldn't call is realistic, the Dark Lord falls for Harry pretty quick, but it's still a fun read. Actually, this author had written quite a few HP/LV fics that I enjoyed, including [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/209494/chapters/313282][Xerosis]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855/chapters/5254943][Stand Against the Moon]]. They're a bit fluffy/cracky, (Xerosis is bloody hilarious, and Stand Against the Moon is fun if a bit darker) but they're also pretty quick reads. I con't remember if those two are Human or Snake-Face though... Abandon and Reclaim are definitely Human Dark Lord, he uses a glamour to look snakey to scare people lol.

Next, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3502418/chapters/7698044][Moments in Time]]. Not exactly time-travel. Basically, the Dark Lord dreams about Harry when he's little, and they become friends as they grow up. I'm not very good at summaries, but in my defense, the story summary isn't much better. It's a really interesting way to introduce a HP/LV relationship, and I thought it was a really interesting read. If you're interested, there's a Snarry called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10507879/1/Dreams][Dreams]] that follows a similar plot line (meeting in dreams, out of sync time) that I liked as much if not more. I know this author has written other HP/LV fics, but I don't remember which ones I liked...

Ok, last list. These are all fics that I have favourited, but I don't actually remember them.... So either I liked them but haven't read them in a while (thus the earlier note about getting distracted lol) or I faved them to read later and forgot about them. Point is, they may or may not be what you're looking for, but I figured I'd post them and let you take a look, lol.

Ok, I think that's all I've got... I feel like I'm forgetting some, lol, but I'm still working on coming up with a system for organizing my read fics... Let me know what you think! Especially Again and Again. I really can't rave about that one enough LOLOL!

** Wow, how did miss this thread? This is totally my thing!

For Tom/Harry with fantastic characterization of both of them, anything by The Fictionist ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2227840/The-Fictionist][FFN link]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/The_Fictionist/works][AO3 link]]) but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]] linkffn(5725656) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player][Past's Player]] linkffn(5736901) are particularly excellent in my opinion. Tom edges on evil and not very very well, and the dialog is snappy and smart. Harry also /isn't a doormat/, which I think is a problem in a lot of Harry slash.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865][Again and Again]] linkao3(439865) has been recommended before I'm sure, but if you haven't seen it, it is worth a read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9214710/1/The-Vitruvian-Man][The Vitruvian Man]] linkffn(9214710) is an old favorite of mine with a nice developing relationship. Tom pulls some very manipulative moves during it.

I can not recommend [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/384445][SCHOOLED]] linkao3(384445) enough for the plot, but it hasn't updated in a while, and lost its way a little in the later chapters. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10461074/1/The-Devil-s-Playground][The Devil's Playground]] linkffn(10461074) is excellent with a great possessive/manipulative Tom. Epic Solemnity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] linkffn(5402147) has a human looking sane Voldemort, so that may not be quite right for what you are looking for, but I tend to like Epic Solemnity's writing, and it is complete, which is always a plus. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11203822/1/For-the-Good-of-Us-All][For the Good of Us All]] linkffn(11203822) finished recently, and is pretty good. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7040089][Consuming Shadows]] linkao3(7040089) is a WIP, but has great promise for manipulative Tom (and already has manipulative Harry). Same with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1161859][House of Snakes]] linkao3(1161859). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3168581][Your Name on My Heart]] linkao3(3168581) has been updating regularly, and while not very dark, Tom is still pretty in control of basically everything. While maybe a little too evil for you, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11538927/1/Mine][Mine]] linkffn(11538927) and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11685657/1/Hauntingly][Hauntingly]] linkffn(11685657) are new favs. Voldemort is still evil and still sort of insane, and Harry does not have a good time. Later chapters really have Tom shine through. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6778783/ObsidianPen][ObsidianPen]] is shaping up to be a brilliant author, and you should think about checking out their other works too.

If do don't mind MPREG: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some other Beginings End]] linkffn(9591343) is good, but its a one shot. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/526351][Je Souhaite]] linkao3(526351) is pretty good too, but does have LV basically raping Harry.

  7th Year Gryffindors learn why it is never a good idea to piss off Ravenclaw Hadrian Morgan. His payback during Professor Slytherin's class is BEAUTIFUL. In carrying it out, orphaned pureblood Hadrian catches the interest and libido of the present Lord Marvolo Slytherin, who -- with the assistance of the entire Slytherin student body as well as a few other surprising characters -- tries to lure Morgan into his life and his bed. But just how naive is Hadrian Morgan, really?1945-era mash-up of most major and minor characters of HP and other fandoms, as well as historical characters. [WAIT, PLEASE! .... ahem.... If you just heard a mental screech of brakes, please understand that this is not a farce, nor crack, nor crap. This has many reviews from now-devoted readers who almost bypassed it, but are now glad they accepted the dare to just try chapter one.]Chapter 13 is co-written by Marksmom.This story has devoted readers who take joy in wicked humor, intense slash romance, and surprises at every turn. I have been coerced by fans into giving this next bit verbatim: "If you don't think you'll like this, at least read Chapter One; odds that you'll regret it are vanishingly small."

  When Harry finds out he's a Genie, he vows to never be enslaved by anyone, ever. Of course, that doesn't really work out for him. When he ends up enslaved to Voldemort, of all people, nothing will be the same for anyone, ever again.

  His attention skipped passed the students and moved to the politicians' pavilion. His gaze locked with crimson, and he nearly faltered under the sheer hunger in those eyes.   It unnerved him how fixated the man was on his dirtied, bloody, exhausted figure. But what troubled him more was the slight smirk he could make out on the man's lips. It was almost pleased. On the night of the attack, Lily managed to escape with her infant son, but at the cost of her husband's life. Distraught and distrusting of her friends, she fled to France with Harry, to raise him away from the corruption in Britain and the rising influence of the Dark Lord. She trains him to the best of her abilities, shaping him into a dangerous, intelligent and powerful wizard.But when Britain re-establishes the Triwizard Tournament, and Harry is forced to return to his once-home, he finds himself questioning whether he really wants to kill the Dark Lord. Voldemort finds an unexpected challenge in the child, and as his intrigue and amusement grows, so too does the desire to possess the spark in those defiant green eyes.

** I'm not sure you'll see this, but I figure I might as well mention some stuff I forgot the first time around:

linkao3(266699), The Love of a Good Wizard, which is timetravel with Harry & Pansy going back; there's quite a bit of fluff, iirc.

linkao3(5745595), Sleeping Somewhere Cold is by Dark_Cyan_Star, which is Epic Solemnity's old penname; there are some grammar things in the first bit, but it gets better.

And for good measure, linkffn(6996054), Dreams and Darkness Collide by Epic Solemnity, because they're really good at writing interesting plots and plans.

Then, linkao3(5937535), "love is touching souls (surely you touched mine)" is /quite/ fluffy, though it mostly lacks that corruption element.

I figure linkffn(6486690), Rebirth by Athey, ought to be mentioned since Again and Again and The Descent Into Darkness (both of which are quite fantastic) were mentioned already; Rebirth is also quite fantastic. SCHOOLED, House of Snakes, and Your Name on My Heart have already been mentioned as well, but once again -- they're pretty great.

  REPOST: SLASH LV/HP: AU: Lucius has twin boys. Voldemort is asking for his servants' firstborn child. Thinking it's an honor; Lucius gives Voldemort the healthy child, Draco, who happens to be the younger twin. Harry grows up the black sheep of the Malfoy family and befriends Mudbloods and the boy-who-lived, Neville. Eventually, he ends up being disowned from the Malfoy family. Things spiral out of control when Voldemort finds out Harry is the firstborn. He'll stop at nothing to get Harry on his side. After all, the ritual Voldemort wants to use will not work without Harry. For the Dark Lord wants to eat off the children's magic once they are of age.

** linkffn(6592361), Words Fail

linkffn(5925524), Twist of Fate

linkffn(5402147), Death of Today, might(?) be a bit of a stretch and is a bit AU, but it's pretty good.

Tentatively recommending linkffn(5992579), Chocolate Frogs and Time Turners -- it's more of a friendship fic, and what's there is good, but there's not much and it seems abandoned.

From AO3, linkao3(2296544), Lithium has Harry interacting with Riddle's Diary.

Also, linkao3(294722), The Train to Nowhere.

Finally, linkffn(5736901), Past's Player, the counterpart to Fate's Favorite (which was recommended already).

  Harry is taken the night Dumbledore is about to leave him with the Dursleys. With forces meddling in the timeline, Harry and Tom become the Riddle brothers. Follow the boys from the 1930s, WWII & Grindelwald, to canon years and a much changed future. Slash.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

#+begin_quote
  The smallest change in details can lead to vastly different outcomes. When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he befriends the entity that resides within. This simple act results in a ripple effect that tears the story as we know it apart, causing a descent into the madness that is the human psyche.

  "Mother's fulfilled her promise at last," Tom Riddle said, grinning widely as he struggled to get onto his feet. The blood pouring down over his broken nose and dripping over his teeth made his smile significantly more sinister than it would have otherwise been. "Does it hurt?" "What, falling five-hundred feet from the sky?" Harry started, with a voice as sweet as burnt sugar. His broom was smoking in a pile next to him. "Why don't you try it and then come back and tell me?" he said, flat-toned, and then - "Gosh, why aren't you dead, I landed on you from five-hundred feet!"
