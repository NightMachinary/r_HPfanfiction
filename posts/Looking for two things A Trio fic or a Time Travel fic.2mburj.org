I'm open to any fic focused on the trio, either romance or friendship between all three. It doesn't matter. Also, any time travel fic. Either can be unfinished or finished.


** Why not both? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8326928/1/Three-s-The-Charm][Three's the Charm]] by MissCHSparkles involves the trio going back in time to their first year.

My favorite trio friendship fic (no time travel, FYI) is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] by Myst Shadow.

*** I love Threes the Charm. My only problem is the updates are so slow in coming out. The Last Casualties is another favorite of mine but updates are getting slower and slower.

** For a time travel fic I'm currently on chapter 18 of 50 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/1/Pride-of-Time][Pride of Time]] which is a Hermione to Marauders time fic and enjoying it. It's complete at 554906 words.
