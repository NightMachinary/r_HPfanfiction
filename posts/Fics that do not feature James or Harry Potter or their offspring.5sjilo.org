While I enjoy what people do with the Harry Potter world, I am sick to death with Harry Potter. I'm not a fan of James Potter either, and next gen fics don't particularly interest me.

What is there that doesn't involve the Potters?

I'm aware of linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter) by Nim-the-lesser and the Alexandra Quick series. Anything else worth mentioning?


** Well it's technically not harry though it does mention him linkffn(12141684) The only thing else that comes to mind while fitting you criteria would be a grindewald/dumbledore or Tom centric fic

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)
