Im looking for fics -long or short- where Harry causes the bloodwards around privet drive to fall. Hopefully in hilarious ways. Such as harry stating hogwarts is his home, never seeing 4 privet drive as home, etc etc. Especially if its to fumbledore's face :)


** linkffn(Tempest of the Fae) Harry, Hermione, and Luna sabotage the wardstone to fail explosively, turning most of the area around Privet Drive into a Dr Seuss book, and Dumbledore gets in trouble with the DMLE because he made the wards.

  A basic rule of time, it will fight change. Harry, Hermione and Luna return to stop Voldemort thanks to the last of the fae. But they are not alone and time will not bend to their will easily. They will fight, they will prank and they will be followed through time. Dumbledore, Ron and Molly bashing. Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith"

If you want them having less trouble with a similar premise, go with linkffn(Faery Heroes)

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

***** Yeah but how much does he do? I've already read all others, it's just this one that I haven't read because of that part of the plot. I usually prefer stories with minimal conflict or drama and more humor.

  Due to a severe head injury, Harry experiences a rather extreme change in personality - namely, a sudden tendency to kill people he doesn't like. Awesome!Psycho!Harry, Harry/Luna main pairing, Ãœbermanipulative!Dumbles, major Weasley-bashing
