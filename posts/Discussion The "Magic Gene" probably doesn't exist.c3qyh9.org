Using genetics to disprove the pureblood ideology is a common trope, but it doesn't really fit how magic is actually inherited.

As far as I know, in all cases where at least one parent is magical, the offspring is also magical or a squib.

Since squibs still have limited magic (Filch can interact with Peeves) and aren't repelled by muggle repelling charms, squibness is likely a mutation or birth defect that prevents them from fully developing their magic. As they often appear even in ancient pureblood families, inbreeding probably increased the risk (so much for toujours pur).

If we simplify squibs as still magical, then what we see is that at least one magical parent guarantees magical offspring. Nonmagical parents still have a (really) tiny chance (1 in 100 000) for magical offspring, and one sibling can have magic while the other doesn't even though both are from the same parents.

This behavior doesn't really fit genetic patterns, which means that there probably isn't a magic gene. HPMoR's explanation with basic Mendel doesn't fit the facts in the case of Tom Riddle (Tom Riddle Sr. would have to have been a squib, the chances are tiny).

What's much more likely is my theory that magical ability is triggered through the presence of magic.

If one parent is magical, their presence automatically gives the offspring magic. But magical offspring is also possible with completely nonmagical parents if there's some other magic present during early embryonic development, for example accidentally running into a muggle repelling charm. Given the relatively small number of magical locations that muggles could accidentally run into, a one in 100k chance for someone in the early stage of pregnancy to run into one is possible.


** Filch can interact with Peeves because Peeves has a physical body. Muggles could interact with Peeves, too.

Literally the only thing separating squibs from muggles is that Squibs are children of wizards and witches, and muggles are not.

*** Aye, don't let fanon fool you. Squibs aren't magical at all. We don't even know for sure that Muggle-Repelling Charms don't affect them; could just be that Filch was "keyed in" somehow when he was hired. I know some fics posit talismans which can be given to Muggles to allow them to visit Diagon Alley, explaining how the Granger parents could go there; why couldn't Filch be given something like that?

If you take Pottermore as part of canon, this isn't exactly true.

***** Yeah, like [[/u/Astramancer]] and [[/u/Taure]] said, the idea is absolutely that Figg was lying, and that they're so confused about how Squibs work that Dumbledore can tell them any old fib is yet again more proof of the Ministry's bigotry.

****** Its not necessarily bigotry, I mean really how often would the question if Squibs can see Dementors come up. Probably not that often considering how rare Squibs seem to be and how little time the Dementors in Britain spend outside of Azkaban. Otherwise I agree fully.

******* Well, the idea that they could see Dementors seems to imply that the wizards care so little for Squibs that they overlook the fundamental fact that they're just plain Muggles who happen to be wizard-born, as opposed to wizards who didn't turn out quite right --- possibly because the former possibility is too hideous to contemplate.

******** That depends on why they think Dementors are invisible to muggles. Sure it could be because of the lack of magic they share with Squibs(like it really seems to be), but for all the average person knows it could easily be something like the Leaky Cauldron which apparently can only be seen by people who know about it.

Well, obviously not, or none of the kids on the Express would have seen them. And I don't know about you, but in these kids' place I'd definitely have owled my parents about this first thing. Plus, i the kids had just felt a gloomy aura without seeing anyone, I feel like the Ministry would have had the perfect excuse to just deny everything /en masse/, anyway. So no, the Wizengamot knows full well that Dementors are visible even to wizards who have no earthly clue they exist.

***** It's not clear whether Mrs figg could /actually/ see them or not. I could easily see her choosing to lie or being convinced to lie by Dumbledore to protect Harry. After all, the others were surprised that she could see them. I'm not saying common knowledge can't be wrong, especially about uncommon interactions like squibs witnessing dementors, but it's not as clear cut as it might seem.

** It's far more likely that a genetic explanation of magic would require a set of genes, nor just one specific gene. Very few things are only dictated by one gene (things like eye colour)

The definition of a squib is someone who has at least one magical parent but is not magical themselves, so yes, your point is factually correct.

#+begin_quote
  Since squibs still have limited magic
#+end_quote

No, they do not. According to Harry Potter Wiki "A Squib is a human who is born with at least one magical parent, but does not inherit any magic from said parent." This could mean that magic is a recessive trait and requires homogeneity to fully develop. This is backed by other information from Harry Potter Wiki "[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Muggle-born][Muggle-born]] witches and wizards are descended from Squibs who married Muggles: the magical ability *unexpectedly resurfaces after many generations.*" Recessive traits have a habit of doing that.

If a pureblood child inherited one corrupted copy of the gene and one healthy copy, they would still develop magic because there is no muggle gene to get in the way. If both copies are corrupted, then the pureblood child has no working copy of the magic gene and does not develop magic. There is no muggle gene to trigger the muggle repelling wards.

** Most genetics don't follow the simple Mendel punnet squares. It's entirely feasible that magic has a generic component, and is just more complicated than a single set of dominant vs. recessive genes.
