Which house do you like to see Harry sorted into and what types of stories you like?


** I tend to love Harry in Hufflepuff. They are very rare, but I've liked the ones I come across. Harry tends to be friendlier. Hufflepuff helps him adjust better from life in a abusive house. And like serenehime said for Slytherin, Harry tends to have a wider circle of friends and interactions when he is in Hufflepuff.

*** I've only come across two Hufflepuff Harry fics, and I know both are most likely outliers (one is a borderline crack fic and the other one is a crack fic oneshot that got lengthened into a real story and straightened up it's act as it went). Do you have any good ones to recommend?

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Gryffindor because it's is usually the most versatile (although it could just appear this way since he's a Gryffindor in most stories).

It makes him befriending/dating Slytherins a story in and of itself. Of course, he can do the reverse in Slytherin too, but just as often you see him dismiss all the other houses for no reason other than they aren't cunning enough (read: they're 11).

I haven't read much Hufflepuff Harry but the ones I have usually have him sorted there because he wants to fly under the radar and be a loner, which can be quite dull.

Ravenclaw Harry is usually the most stereotypical i.e. he's a genius and everyone else is stupid (read: they 11).

I think because Harry is a Gryffindor in canon, authors can sort him there with making him a stereotypical Gryffindor, whereas stories that sort him elsewhere are usually written with the intention of writing a fic centred around him being in that house. This often leads to him being a stereotype of that house and making him sort of one-dimensional.

This is very interesting to me because it's been something I've been considering for my own story lately. A reviewer commented that the changes I've made to the characters (it's a 'Malfoys adopt Harry' AU, because I have a problem) mean that Harry and Draco don't really fit Gryffindor and Slytherin, respectively, anymore. They said this makes them excited for my story to get to Hogwarts. Taking a step back, the reviewer is absolutely right - Harry's influence has made Draco more of a Gryffindor, and life with the Malfoys has made Harry's character much more Hufflepuff than in canon.

I was originally going to leave them in their canon houses, but now I feel like that would be adhering to canon 'just because' and wouldn't make sense for the story. OTOH, I don't want to fall into the typical 'different Sorting' tropes and make that become what the story is about. :/ I mean, my /premise/ is an overused trope, I don't need to add more!

** Overall, I enjoy Ravenclaw Harry fics the most. I tend to find that I lean towards superHarry style storylines and as others have said, a Harry that is willing to knuckle down and learn is the one that's most likely to end up as a Dumbledore-esque wizard instead of a Ron Weasley (not that there's anything wrong with Ron, no Weasley bashing here).

However, if we talk about specific Harry incarnations, my favourites rarely come from Ravenclaw. My top 2 are the Harry depicted in linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry Do) and linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff), but they aren't really what I'd call indicative of the typical house values.\\
The rest are actually 90% made up of plain old Gryffindor Harry; I like stories that branch off of canon at a certain, defined point so a large number of fics I read are ones where Harry was sorted into Gryffindor and went through his adventures as normal until the fan author decides to intervene.

** Obviously, the one where Harry is in a Secret Fifth House called Merlin is objectively best house.

*** Or [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/][Jeconais]]'s Hogwarts' Dawn, where Harry & co. are resorted into Your House.

It makes for some nice puns, at least.

** Slytherin and Ravenclaw, but particularly Slytherin. I really like dark!Harry, and it's when Harry is in these houses that authors usually delve into magical theory and pureblood culture, which I find incredibly interesting.

** I've read good Harry's in all four Houses. My favorite house, in terms of what tropes and friends usually come with it would be Ravenclaw. I like a Harry that studies hard and becomes powerful through the gathered knowledge.

** It's Harry/Draco but the slash is not the main plot at all. The plot is that all the 7th and 8th years are resorted for house unity reasons. Both Harry and Draco are in Hufflepuff (I think Neville too iirc). Magic in Britain is somehow tied to certain plants (this is well explained but I'm forgetting it now) and muggle pollution is causing pockets of Britain to be magical dead zones. All the older students are researching the problem and hufflepuff house does a bunch of cool hufflepuff things to help fix it. There's also some really interesting fanon ideas about the hufflepuff common room and an initiation for new hufflepuffs.

** Hufflepuff (for comedy) or Gryffindor (for everything else). Fics that put him in Ravenclaw invariably have to rewrite his personality from scratch to make it work; and fics that put him in Slytherin slip into similarly personality-erasing power fantasies all too easily, though there are exceptions.

** None of them. My favourite version of Harry is actually as Jamie Evans, and s/he isn't Sorted at all.

** I like the Gryfindor Harry in Forging the Sword best, I think. Nice blend of various traits.

**** Because it's more interesting in my opinion, especially if they make Harry have actual Slytherin traits (ambitious, cunning).

It's rare to find good characters in fiction with such traits.
