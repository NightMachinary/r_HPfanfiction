  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

*** This fic is probably one of the best fics I've read in maybe five years? It's incredible - I can't find anything else like it.

** The Snape Chronicles is canon-compliant, but it has an alternate ending where Voldemort was clever enough to best him rather than kill him, and he goes on to infiltrate the surviving Death Eaters.

** I did a search on AO3 for “snape lives” excluded Snape/Hermione and Snape/Harry, picked complete fics only and sorted by kudos and it came up with 260 stories - enjoy!

** Well, most of that will be Snape/Harry, are you ok with that?

Anyway, check out the author suitesamba on ao3. Lots of Snape-centric fics. The majority are Snape/Harry but a few are gen or with other partners as well.
