I've read this story a few months ago but can't find the link now. It's incomplete and maybe has a dozen chapters. Here's what I remember:

- Lily and Harry both survive but James doesn't. Voldemort is vanquished in the same way as canon.
- Lily nearly kills Snape with the killing curse when he turns up at the house.
- Lily goes to Petunia for shelter where she discovers that she's pregnant.
- Vernon wants to throw Lily and Harry out. He fights with Petunia on this and she leaves him and takes Dudley. They divorce.
- Lily gives birth to a baby daughter.
- Lily and Petunia are neighbours. I remember Sirius and Remus coming to Lily's house on Christmas. Even though it's been over a year, the three of them are still grieving.

  "The sorrow birds find what is weak, my chest, beak-marked, my eyes long gone." - Ann V. DevilbissLily Potter is dead.No.Lily Potter should be dead.The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.(Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)
