I just finished rereading linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon). One of the best parts in my opinion was how in depth the author went with the warding sections. Can people recommend me other fics with that same kind of interesting detail? They can be about warding or runes or whatever branch of magic. No explicit slash please


** I don't have a link, but The Arithmancer and Lady Archimedes (both by White Squirrel on FFN) are really good. Basically Hermione is a super math genius and makes spells.
