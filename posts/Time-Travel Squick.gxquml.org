A Noodle Incident flings Harry back in time... into his father's body.

Realizing what's happened and that the timeline is either a) now completely buggered (due to butterfly effects such as blinking one microsecond differently from what his father had done originally) from even the most minor of changes or b) that it's been branched off into its own timeline from his own due to his impromptu possession, Harry is actually relieved.

After all, he /really/ didn't want to try to fall in love and eventually bone his own mother in a vain attempt to get a timeline back on track.

Unfortunately, "James'" very sudden lack of interest in pursuing Lily Evans (avoiding the hell out of) and lack of interest in harassing Snape has consequences the opposite of what Harry wanted.

At first Lily was relieved, though a little disappointed inwardly, that "James" stopped hitting on her and professing his love -- even more relieved when his harassment of Severus practically died overnight, even as their friendship was pretty much dead at that point.

Then confused and curious as he did his best not to be in the same room with her, treating her as though she were a plague-carrier and avoiding eye-contact.

...And, ultimately, she finds herself intrigued and, to her surprise, /attracted/ to this more responsible, mature "James".

It escalates.

Poor Harry eventually finds himself in a completely reversed situation where his /mother/ ends up perusing him in the way canonically James did Lily.

Much to everyone's hilarity as they watch their antics over time.

Remus is surprised and happy about his new work ethic and maturity: Sirius is disappointed he's become more "boring" and has stopped his harassment of that "evil git Snape", but their friendship weathers and becomes stronger over time: Peter is confused why "James" is suddenly acting oddly at times with him, such as trying to include him more (basically, Harry is trying to prevent Peter from joining Voldemort by being a better friend).

They're all convinced this is a massive plan to get Lily to fall in love with him, though... and it's "working" (though, they can't understand why "James" is trying to tear his hair out all the time -- a sympathy angle?).

And Snape? He's convinced it's all a big plot against him that's yet to spring, and becomes more and more paranoid as a result (alienating his friends in Slytherin and essentially torturing himself).

...And then, a few years later, he and she are picked to be Head Boy and Girl.

Welp.

Morally, as I also mention in another answer in the thread, I see it more as 'the commissioner supporting my being an author' than 'the commissioner pays for this very specific thing', which helps. Honestly, I don't have any moral issues with it. It's not costing the original author anything, and it isn't like most of them aren't set for life multiple times over. I'll worry about the morality when I'm not working 60 hour weeks to remain capable of doing my groceries and very much need the breathing room things like these offer.

***** I will never understand commissioned fanfic writers, honestly. I just don't get how someone could do that. It sounds like torture to write stories someone else dictates everything for. Not to mention the yikes of demanding that much money for a story that bases itself on /another/ person's work. 15 bucks for 1k words is ridiculous. I've written a lot of stories in my time, and 1k flows like nothing. It's a single dialogue-heavy scene, or half a small exposition scene.

****** '1k flows like nothing'

For you, perhaps. However, there must be some quantifiable manner to determine pricing. This is, as far as I know, a very common price point. I'm not even close to the most expensive here, either.

For me, 1k words can be anything from 1 hour (which, with conversion rates to euros and taxes, would be about minimum wage) to 5+.

That being said, there's a solid disconnect here. Yeah, it's not great to write something that isn't your own idea, but it's a little extra money. Money that some of us need. And yes, it bases itself upon the work of the original author, but so does the work of the original author base itself upon other things.

If course, there is a very large difference in the amount of 'basing upon' here, but the core concept is much the same. If I this story ends up becoming a thing, then I'll have created dozens of side characters, created full plot threads, defined core rules of the universe and more. A lot of it is similar to the work I'd do for an original work.

Essentially, there's a lot of work that goes into it, and it's pretty much exactly what the reader wants to see. That's why it's not even cheaper.

In the end, I just write. I don't 'demand' that much money for any writing. I don't demand any money for any writing. If this goes nowhere, I'll have a RWBY work to finish today, another HP:YBD chapter I need to progress with, etc. Those are not commissions, and beyond my lovely patrons I don't get anything as a 'thank you'. I'll write regardless.

Sirius nodded emphatically. "Listen to Remus, he knows his stuff."

And like honestly, that just isn't good in any way. Not narratively, not in-universe, not as a look for the author; If I had written that scene, I'd have had old Harry be purposefully vague, but reassuring with stuff like

"Aight lad, you need to watch out for yourself. There's gonna be a lot of people who want to be friends with you just because of your fame, but also a lot of people who might be awed by it but would still make good friends once they get over it, so don't write anyone off but don't become best friends with the first other person you see just because they treat you better than our 'relatives'."

--------------

Minerva did not know when it had happened exactly, but what had lead to this, she could remember vividly.

The day James Potter had collapsed, right after returning from the Christmas Break, in his fifth year. His friend, Sirius, had caught him, and the boys had carried James to the Hospital Wing. They had stayed by his side as he lied insensate for a day or so, before waking with a bewildered look in his eyes. She had been there, seemingly to discuss matters with Poppy, but that was not all. Minerva never had children of her own, and she held her Gryffindors close to her heart, James more so than most. To see him just lying there had near broken her heart.

The wild look in his eyes left as he looked around. Good, he knew where he was.

''Hogwarts ? But why ?'' he said to himself, far louder than intended.

Perhaps she was wrong.

When James Potter was eventually cleared to return to class and his dormitory, he had been noticeably more shy and humble. Whatever had befallen him, had changed him. For the better, she would note. She had to write him up far less often for getting into trouble, and his academic results improved significantly. No longer did he trouble Severus Snape or bother Lily Evans, another favorite student of hers.

Which seemed to please Lily greatly, or at least at first. She could now study in peace. But it would soon fade. Severus Snape disappointed her greatly, and was given a week's worth of detentions after hearing what had transpired. That word would NOT be used against her students.

Now without her oldest friend, Miss Evans was somewhat cast adrift, and tightened her bond with her dorm-mates and Remus Lupin, somewhat unsurprisingly. Then, Minerva noted, she had started to warm to James Potter, who studiously ignored her very existence, and began to see the man he would soon grow into. One worthy of her heart, perhaps. But as much as Minerva had hoped they would get together someday, as she saw the potential, the spark, between them, her hopes, and those of Lily were crushed when James quite publicly stated he was firmly over Lily Evans, and would no longer seek her affections.

Blunt as that may have been, it was a Gryffindor's move. His friends thought it a joke at first, though later learned how serious he was. This did not mean James began dating wildly or seriously. No, while she occasionally found James fooling around with a girl, they were rarely the same. Whatever kind of man James would become, he was not it yet.

He would not settle down with someone more permanently until quite a bit after Hogwarts. It was Sirius Black that was the first of the four to get married, settling down with Marlene McKinnon, another former student of hers. Though reputedly, he was only swayed when he learned she was pregnant, and vowed not to abandon his child. For all his boyishness, a noble man hid underneath, and at a reunion, she could tell the two were happy, perhaps even in love. Their oldest child, Alphard, was another favorite of hers.

James was next, and he held to his word. His bride was a great-niece of her colleague, Horace Slughorn. Claudia Slughorn, a witch nearly a decade older, became Claudia Potter around a year after Sirius had married. Their first child was born August 1st, 1980, a boy, named Harry James Potter. The first time she had seen the little boy, she'd noticed the similarities to James, except for the eyes. Those were a bright blue, already final, quite unlike his father's hazel eyes.

While the Marauders settled into familial bliss and their life as adults, Lily Evans was focused more on work. She, along with her former friend, were the youngest Potion Masters ever. Her brilliance had seen her succeed.

But, as a confidante to Lily, she noted, that she had grown bitter and spiteful. Lily had always had a temper, but usually she held it well in check, and it was tempered by her other sides. These had started to fall away, leaving a very bitter woman who opened herself to few and far between. Only Minerva herself, Alice Longbottom (formerly Brown) and some other former Professors at Hogwarts were in that small group.

Eventually, she would learn why.

Lily had begun returning the affections of James Potter, when he had so violently crushed her hopes. She was not so much angry at him, but at herself, for missing her chance at love. His career and happy life proved that she had missed out, perhaps her only chance at true love. This was the final ingredient to an already deadly brewing problem.

The way her sister Petunia treated her, her parent's death and subsequent funeral, being forced to co-habitate with a James Potter that studiously ignored her affections during her final year at Hogwarts, it all mixed and added and reacted.

The result was a very bitter woman who threw her life into her work, who became angry and obsessed.

Her lack of foresight had cost her so dearly, and Minerva could not help but feel for her.

Lily became a more regular part of her life again not long after she had left Hogwarts, and after the war had ended. Horace Slughorn had retired. It was rumored that his great-niece would apply to succeed him, which she did, but Lily would not see that happen. Her application ended up being superior, which is how Lily had become Professor Evans at Hogwarts.

Her new colleague was kind and helpful to her students, much like her predecessor had been, though she could be curt and stiff at times. That changed further, though, when Alphard Black had arrived at Hogwarts, whom she had treated with a degree of disdain. But young Harry had it far worse. He was despised by Lily. Harry symbolized everything Lily had lost. To be in the same room with a boy that should, by all rights, have been her son instead, was painful, and it showed. Harry was one of few students his age to not fawn over Professor Evans. A common thing, as Lily was quite a beauty, and would remain so for a long time yet. Wizards and witches lived very long indeed, and Lily was only in her thirties, and to reach two-hundred was far from uncommon. Minerva herself was only in her sixties, too, and looked barely a day older. Magic was kind to a body.

Which is how the world now stood. Lily remained unattached, consumed by her work, bitter and angry at herself. Minerva knew not how to help her. She had tried, but Lily closed only further in response.

She wondered yet again why James Potter had given up on the beautiful red-haired girl, with the kind green eyes and the bright smile. Perhaps some things are simply not meant to be.

********* You think Professor Evans would look at Harry sadly/longingly, since his face is (mostly) James', but immediately look away when she sees his eyes (being that of his mother's)? Like a reverse canon situation where Snape hated Harry's face, but he couldn't help but look at his eyes, since they were Lily's?

It'd be even worse if Neo Harry had the positive qualities she saw in James, too -- especially if Harry's love-interest rejects Harry like she had initially done with his father.

Would she stand by and let history repeat itself with another girl? Could she handle the guilt that she may inflict her fate on another innocent witch? Would she have a heart-to-heart with the witch in question, encouraging her to entertain the possibility of dating Harry?

What if Harry's love-interest was just a nasty piece of work? Would Lily intercede, not wanting to see "James'" son sucked into such a black hole of misery?

*********** There are other red-haired girls canonically too, such as Susan Bones (though butterfly effects would likely result in Susan not existing, and anything could happen: from her original parents not having children at all, to their having an older/younger child, or to their even having twins/triplets!).

I find butterfly effects very interesting because even the tiniest of differences can drastically alter the world as time goes on compared to what someone would know in the prior universe/timeline.

Heck, the Weasleys having only one or two children, or a mixed group of girls/boys, or all girls except for the youngest, are possible. As is Molly or Arthur dying in an accident or attack before they even have kids.

Disgustingly enough, it could also lead Snape to have a loving relationship and children post Hogwarts (or during Hogwarts), too.

There are just so many possibilities... all that could stem from one original, single point of change that creates others, like "James" blinking a half-second too late than what James would've done.

Isn't the entire prompt sort of based on how Harry is relieved he doesn't have to "maintain the timeline"? If he were to care about stuff like that, he'd have to remain a hermit for the rest of his life.

*** Hospital Wing

"James Potter, what in God's name possessed you to duel multiple Death Eaters?" asked McGonagall, who alongside Madam Pomfrey did not look pleased.

Harry sighed, and began to recount the events that lead to the attack in Hogsmeade, with Sirius, Remus and Peter all coming to his defence. He had been forced to injure himself after subduing the Death Eaters to make it seem less suspicious as to how a Sixth Year can defeat Yaxley, Dolohov, Travers and Jugson.

He tuned out McGonagall's lecture about how foolish taking on the Death Eaters were. It was still hard to wrap his head around how he ended up in his father's body. After the fall of Voldemort, Harry became a Hit-wizard for the Ministry, hunting down dark witches and wizards abroad. The Aurors were his initial plan, but given that he didn't want to finish his Seventh Year just to apply he opted to become a Hit-wizard instead. After years of fighting, he discovered a conspiracy amongst the Original 12 American Auror's descendants to overthrow their Ministry, and after confronting them in the American Department of Mysteries he awoke suddenly in his father's body shortly after.

He had no plan to return back to his time. He was a Hit-wizard who specialized in direct action, not an Unspeakable who dealt with the most mysterious branches of magic. And so, he did his best to blend in. He stopped antagonizing Snape, which prompted Sirius to say he was becoming no fun anymore, and as the Marauders became more suspicious he told them the truth. None of them took him seriously until today.

Dealing with Snape was easy enough, all Harry had to do was to avoid him. Dealing with his mother's obsession with him was an entirely different matter. Harry was forced to conduct surveillance detection runs in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade to prevent Lily's friends from cornering him and dealing with offers to "study." He never would've thought that his counter-surveillance skills would be used against his mum.

As Pomfrey and McGonagall left, the Marauders turned their attention to Harry.

"Holy shit James, you weren't joking about you bein-" began Peter, before Harry struck him with a silencing charm. Harry then cast Muffliato and locked the door to the hospital entrance.

"That explains why the Death Eaters are disappearing," said Sirius. "And why you were gone for most of last summer."

Harry simply nodded.

"So, you're going after You-Know-Who then right?" asked Peter.

"Don't be daft," said Remus. "James isn't going after Voldemort, even Dumbledore doesn't know where he is."

"I am," said Harry. The Marauders looked at him awestruck. "Over half the Death Eaters are either dead or incarcerated. He's going to get desperate eventually and slip up. Might as well do some good while I'm here I guess. " Sirius was the first to recover. "That'll help you get with Evans for sure mate. Not that she needs much convincing anyways."

Harry groaned as he put his head in his hands. "Sirius give it a rest for fucks sake."

"You know you thought about it James," said Sirius who wiggled his eyebrows. "Otherwise you wouldn't be avoiding her."

"Not to mention you did save her earlier in Hogsmeade," added Peter. "She's shaken up by the way. She thought you were hurt badly."

"Ah, going for the wounded hero approach eh James," said Remus with barely contained glee.

"There's a Muggle expression that describes James' gameplan here" said Sirius. "I believe it goes, 'a shoulder to cry on becomes a dick to-"

Sirius' explanation of the Muggle expression was drowned out by Remus and Peter collapsing on the floor laughing. Harry just glared at the Marauders.

"If you're expecting us to crumble under your attempts of imitating a Basilisk we'll be here all night," said Remus. "You know you've thought about it. You can lie to us all you want but you can't lie to yourself."

Harry forced his expression to remain neutral. He would never outright admit it, unless he was subjected to Veritaserum while under the Cruciatus Curse of course. Years of fighting while remaining single and suddenly being thrust back in a teenage body riddled with hormones takes its toll.

"Ah fucking hell," thought Harry. "I'll have to Sectumsempra my dick off at this rate. I won't have the Potters be the next Gaunts."

"Severus, maybe you should take a sabbatical break this year. It seems like you still aren't over Lily's death since you can't see that Harry has his mother's eyes.

**** Because snarry is a widely disliked ship. They had no chemistry, snape is old enough to be Harry's dad, and all snape did was Harass Harry until he was about to die. Snape made it very clear that he still disliked Harry in his memories. If Harry is any older than 17(which depending on how old he is, this ship could in fact be pretty illegal), Harry would still despise snape. What could possibly change his mind? During Harry's fifth year, Snape threw a glass jar at harry. I understand what he did was bad, but he was 15. Snape more than twice his age. He knew better than to try to assault a child. Not to say that Harry didn't know any better, but that is considered child abuse and is way worse. Neither characters would ever forgive each other.

I get that Drarry is a very popular ship, and they roughly had a similar hatred for each other, they are the same age (even if you don't care about age gaps as long as they are both adults, many people find is odd/creepy). Draco was young and stupid when he did what he did. At the end of it all, Draco saved Harry when he had no obligation. It came from his sense of wrong and right, even when he was pressured to do the opposite. He wanted to save Harry. Snape did not. He did it so he A) could go back to hating James in peace, and B) because Dumbles told him to.

This isn't to condone anything Draco did by the way, he was a little brat, but snape made all the life choices that lead to the death of Harry's parents which I find it incredibly unrealistic that he ever forgave him for. Though I've always seen Harry as one to keep grudges for a lifetime, I think that's just a me thing.

Any way back on topic

It's one thing to imagine them growing a father-son bond (while I do not personally mind the trope, I understand how unrealistic it is) but them ending up together? That's a whole other level of how-and-why-would-that-even-happen

***** Whoaa there. Taking fanfiction a bit too seriously. I defenetly get your point, and Snarry is just as ridiculous as Voldemort and Harry or Tom riddle and Harry ( another big ship) but this is, in the end, fantasy. If the story is well written and you play with the character's ages and relationship, you can pull off about any ship you like. In the context of the post, it can fit in since Harry would be on the same age as Snape. Depending on when you pull Harry from the original timeline, or even if you want to pull him fron there or an alternate one, the dyanmics between the two can be easily changed with good writing.

It would be intresting to read this kind of story, no matter what the author chooses in romantic interests ( as long as its not Lilly, in this context).

***** While I understand some of your points, I disagree about Harry being one to hold grudges, especially concerning Snape. This can be seen when he tells his son why he names him Albus Severus and says that Snape was one of the bravest men he knew. Snape protected him throughout his childhood even if he didn't show it, and it wasn't because dumbledore told him to, it was because he cared about Lily and therefore felt the need to protect her child. Also Snape wasn't able to let Harry know early on that he was spying for the light side because then Voldemort could have found out through his mind link with Harry.

Anyway even if they have strong animosity throughout the series it is mostly resolved by the end of it all, so I think if Harry went back in time after Snape died, knowing everything he didn't know before, that he might see young Snape in a different light and maybe even try to prevent Sirius from provoking/ Snape and potentially try to steer him away from joining the Death Eaters. He might even end up befriending Snape, although him being James would make this difficult. Anyway in the case of time travel to Snape's time in Hogwarts, after Harry has learnt of Snape's alliegences and no longer hates him, I think that while Snarry might not be particularly likely, it isn't the most outrageous idea, and a friendship (or at least a common understanding) between them could definitely be a possibility.

****** Yes I agree that a friendship would be most likely out of the options (or at least them being not terrible) but again,(OPINION WARNING) i don't think snape was a good person. He chose to become a death eater. The hatred between James and snape isn't a one way street. Snape wasn't the best to James either. With him being rude to Harry, I doubt he would seek any friendship with him. If Harry was pulled after the war I doubt he would want to be friends with anyone because who likes being friends with people 5+ years younger than them. And if he was pulled before the war, I doubt he would forgive snape. I think that the war made him more mature, and before he was a very angsty teen (not to say Harry should suck up everything terrible that happened to him, he shouldn't, but he was definitely suffering from a bunch of undiagnosed shit). Harry knows about him is that he harassed him basically the entirety of the time they knew each other, and the hate was mutual. And if it was from 6th year, where Harry learns that snape is the one that told voldy about the prophecy? Yeah I doubt any friendship could ever realistically happen from there if Harry didn't have the memorable.

***** What do you mean? I was just being enthusiastic, cause it sounded like a really cool fic idea. And I just mentioned a ship I might like to see in it in a casual, not at all forceful manner. Didn't mean to annoy/offend anyone. I guess spending a lot of time in the slash fic subreddit got me used to people not minding Snarry all that much.
