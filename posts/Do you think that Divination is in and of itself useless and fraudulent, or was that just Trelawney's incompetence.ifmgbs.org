** Dumbledore explicitely mentions that Divinition as a school subject is pretty much useless. Prophecies and seeing the future are real things, but they are vague and not every prophecy comes true.

Just remember how Firenze taught Divinition in fifth book. It's not something that can be learned or even relied upon.

** I personally like the idea that Divination in general is more about scrying for information, whether that information pertains to the past, present, or future. In this interpretation, Seers would be closely related but not the definitive apex of the subject.

** I think it might just be that she isn't a good teacher. A lot of fan fics have the “you either have the gift or you don't” line of thinking which is sad because I believe you could certainly teach people to understand the subject more. If anything Dumbledore and the other teachers should've done more to help her teach better and stop making snide comments behind her back.

*** I too think that is overly simplified take on things.

Divination and similar things are based on *knowledge what a sign brings, symbolism *intuitive reading of those hints

So it's a unfair scare off to say you have to posses 'talent' or you can't get anything out of it

(I always assumed that line has sense only in relation of Trelawney gift where she spontanicly goes into a trance and makes a prophecy without any seeming outside help, like idk helpful hallucinogenic fumes in delphie)

** I both like and hate Divination in stories. As a reader, I like the idea that there are ways to gain insight beyond just forcing other people to tell the truth and I like how some insightful writers explore that. On the flipside, most writers who include it do so in the worst way possible -- as a monkeywrench to force situations on the characters, treating prophecies as if they were contracts with the Devil; y'know, the kind that can't be broken except at the cost of their dwindling goth-powers-sensing soul.

Also, as a writer I see the pitfalls of extra-narrative intuition -- the /idea/ of using Divination to answer questions is tempting, but the essence of drama is having characters explore and resolve conflicts with limited, incomplete information, and knowledge-giving magic shortcircuits that.

There's a great comic about the trio having access to a Google-esque search engine for the Hogwarts library that basically turns each plot in the series into a matter of look-up > read entry > problem solved.

My recommendation for anyone using Divination in stories is to make sure you emphasize the subjective nature of truth -- any Divination spell should be relying on some other point of observation rather than an actual immutable truth. I really hate when Sirius declares that 'the Map never lies'; how is it that an enchanted parchment cobbled together by some gifted students twenty years back is able to see through disguises, shape shifting, and other obscuring magic? It's an unforced error in world-building, putting an absolute barrier like that in place.

**** It's too powerful for what it is; if I were JKR's world-building editor back in the day, I would recommend some sort of underlying explanation of its capabilities, like 'it collects all the information being gathered by the portraits, plus some special enchantments we placed all over the school, using Homenem Reveleo and some other charms to label observed creatures with the name they call themselves'. Then I'd make it so that it wasn't Peter Pettigrew showing up in the map but 'Wormtail', unless he was in human form. That sort of thing can be useful for most practical purposes but not for exceptional situations.

Even JKR had to go back and revise the limits of Veritaserum to suggest that an Occlumens could resist it; absolute knowledge is bad for storymaking.

***** Thanks for the clarification. I wonder if there's a kind of magic to the way the map seems to put a name to people, because aren't names just social constructs? Why is Snape 'Severus Snape' and not 'Snivellus'. He is after all, known as both. That may be his most known alias but if the creators so preferred, couldn't they just brand their spots as their nicknames, and call people whichever they wanted? Same as your example with Wormtail, really. It's also the way that the map seems to know where it is in the castle. When Harry stood in front of the hunched witch, it immediately said 'Dissendium' as if it knew where it was. I can hardly see the Marauders going around 'tethering' the map to every single place in the castle; there must be some more magic in play other than the spell Rowling came up with. One thing that also interests me is the faint parallel between Riddle's diary and the Map's echoes of the Marauders, albeit the former is much more complex than the latter. It seemed like James and co. knew what they were doing when they implemented their personalities in the map.

I like the editting Rowling did for occlumency and veritaserum, I can definitely see how somebody skilled enough could navigate their way deftly around either

** It may be a valid field of study if you have the ability (even Trelawney makes legit prophecies), but IMO you should stay as far away as possible from prophecies since I can't think of a single example where they actually turned out useful. There are probably a few examples from antiquity, but most led to ruin.

** I don't value Divination because sometimes knowing your own future is more a curse than blessing. Even if it's in super vague prophecy form.

I mean Voldemort learning of his possible future led to his eventual downfall. So if he didn't listen to prophecies he could rule the world(at least Wizarding Britain), so that sucks for him at least.

** In my mind, Trelawney was a fraud but only in the attempt to ascertain the fortunes of Humans. In my personal headcanon, Divination can only tell you so much about the future and in the vaguest possible and probably most existential way, without an actual seer that is. I really like soft and vague magic. I like the Centaur style of divination, it seems the most useful and most interesting. Take one of the first things a centaur says in the books;

“Mars is bright tonight”

As explained later, it represents war, it being bright, likely means war is coming soon. In the wider context of the stars you could probably learn a lot.

For a canon inspired take on things, it ties in well with the astronomy class.

** I feel that Divination in canon is too focused on seeing the future.

My headcanon is that when properly taught Divination starts with remote viewing and finding lost items, then things like retrocognition for viewing the past, and finally ends with prophecy/precognition as a poorly understood NEWT level topic.

Trelawney is a fraud that relies on her innate talent for prophecy and its unreliable nature to conceal her incompetence. It might not be even be intentional as prophecy does seem to be an area of interest for her and may simply be uninterested in 'lesser' divination.

It is entirely possible that charms such as protective enchantments and summoning charms have devalued 'lesser' divination magic as well leading to a greater focus on divining the future.

** In canon, I think it's a little bit of both. Trelawney is mostly incompetent (other than her two real prophecys) but even when firenze and other centars tell the future it's vague and open to interpretation. Dumbledore and McGonagal speak about divination and both essentially say it's unreliable.

My headcanon though is that there is a lot of things other than predicting the future that divination can be used for example: scrying, or viewing the past associated with an object or location.

  While writing other Harry-after-DoM-debacle-gets-his-life-together story, I got this piece of conversation, which didn't fit anywhere. So, I am putting it here just as a separate one-shot. In my original story, they found out that Ginny is in fact a daughter of Lily Potter, Harry's sister. This story may very well be canonical (Hinny), but I haven't mentioned anything about their relationship, so it could be either. In the canonical world, it would be just that they were friends before they were more than friends (and Ms Rowling as usual forgot to mention any parts of relationship other than snogging).

** My headcanon is that Divining Information is a valid and learnable/teachable subject. But that Divining the Future is only really possible by real seers and is not something that can be taught.

The state of the subject and art is one of decline because the need for the divining of information is going away (no one out their divining water sources with dousing rods type of lack of need) and the only thing people are really interested in is the future, which requires "the gift."

** That is the exact premise of my [[https://redd.it/ifmblq][prompt from last night]].

My general view of the subject is that it's ill-treated in canon and fanon, as most universes with magic include more than just predicting the future under the umbrella of what could be considered divination. Even in the real world, we have people who used “divining rods” to locate things, especially fresh water.

** Divination has some specific things which can be taught, such as tarot cards, tea leaves, astrology, and dream interpretation. The ability to give prophecies is something else entirely, requiring a specific gift. I believe reading the crystal ball also falls into the "need a gift to use" category.

Trelawney is a fraud. She has the gift of prophecy, but gives fake prophecies and predictions all the time to make herself look better, most likely because she has no memory of her actual prophecies. What she doesn't realize is that she is sabotaging her own reputation when she tries to inflate it. The fact that divination is viewed so poorly as a subject by even Dumbledore and McGonagall is all due to her fake predictions.

** "Casual" divination outside of prophecies seems to work. Trelawney managed several accurate predictions, such as the rabbit's death, attacks on Harry, or Hermione leaving the class. She also divined the general aspects of Draco's plot "troubled man, lightning struck tower".

So I'd say divination itself is really capable of providing you with information about the present and thus accurate predictions about the future. It just needs a good interpretation.

Though I'd imagine that a general problem would be, that divination requires a certain level of intuition and trust to gather the divined information, and a high level of analytical, organised thinking. And those two traits rarely come together in people. Most people fall either on the intuitive side like Trelawney or Ron, or on the analytical side like Hermione. Reliable diviners with both are rare.

** I like to use it as Dumbledore being biased against it. He believes in the big stuff, but feels the only use of Divination is full on prophecy from seers and hasn't ever had a good divination teacher st Hogwarts.

Since Trewlaney is so bad at teaching it, the knowledge of all the useful minor Divination works is almost uh unheard of in Britain except to immigrants and expats.
