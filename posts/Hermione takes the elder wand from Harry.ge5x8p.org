:END:
I'm 99% sure it was on FanFiction.net. Hermione took the elder wand from Harry and made herself its master, but made him forget it. Mainly so no-one could take it and use it, if I remember, as everyone knew he was the master. Couldn't find it despite every combination and omission of “Hermione”, “Harry”, “elder wand”, “obliviate”, and “takes from” I typed into google. Anyone know the fic I'm talking about? It was only a one-shot, IIRC, but I might be wrong.


** I don't remember any fanfic like that. Last time I checked, Harry was the master.
