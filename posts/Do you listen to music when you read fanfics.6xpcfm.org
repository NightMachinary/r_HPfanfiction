If you do, what do you listen too?


** Just instrumentals, to be honest. The Skyrim soundtrack, for example.

** I kinda like RULES OF NATURE getting blasted in my ears at max volume when reading bad fanfics.

** I work at a desk all day, and it's hard to think of a situation when I /wouldn't/ want to be listening to music.

Usually anything from [[https://www.youtube.com/user/nyuualiaslucy][xKito]] (sometimes specific playlists) or just any rock playlist.

** Yeah, usually EDM or chilled out hip hop instrumentals.

Sometimes it catches me and whisks me away so I have to stop reading other times reading catches me and I have to stop listening. Certain artists I just can't listen to as they whisk me away each time.

** Epic instrumental music such as "Two Steps from Hell".

Politics and nationalism aside, I find [[https://youtu.be/D5lvmV2pH7M][Farewell to Slavianka]] to be the perfect Gryffindor March.

** Mostly instrumentals and classical music. I really like Mozart (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik is one of my faves). Debussy and Dvorak are pretty good too. Also soundtracks. Not really the HP soundtrack but I guess that could be cool.

** Yes, and sometimes it's hilariously out of sync with the tone of whatever I'm reading. I'm not really one to mind that kind of thing.

** Not often, I find it to be too distracting.

When I do, though, I listen to whatever comes up on my iTunes shuffle. 'Course, that leads to songs like 'Aligned With Giants' or 'Rapture Rising' by JT Machinima or 'One by One' by DAGames playing that have literally nothing to do with the fic other than language spoken/read.

** Sometimes I do, if I feel I want more atmosphere to surround the story I'm reading. I have a lot of bands I'd put towards certain emotions in the story, with jangle or math rock/midwest emo for gentle scenes, varying metal genres for charged up scenes (action or emotionally angry) such as thrash, grindcore, black, or varying death metal subgenres.

Mostly instrumental is what I go for, and the metal genres would accordingly need vocals that are more for sound than actually understanding every word.
