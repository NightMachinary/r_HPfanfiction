Are there any fics out there where Harry just gets fed up with his problems and solves them with violence? I only find fics where he takes the abuse, and I'd like something different for once.

examples: Rita Skeeter, Draco Malfoy, 2nd and 4th year isolation


** The first one is not exactly popular around here since it's filled with tropes. The second one has a darker Harry.

*** Thank you for a very accurate disclaimer. I tried, really, I did. But I OD'ed on cliche a couple chapters in. I was warned.

  At the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament Harry sees his chance to strike down his enemies - and takes it. Here is a Harry who knows how to think and reason. Really Bash!AD, EWE, Clueful!HP Eventual HP/HG/DG/FD NL/HA/SB and others. Unapologetically!AU.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

**** Cadmean victory was very very tough to get through. But it is worth the struggle around the mid point. Just push through.
