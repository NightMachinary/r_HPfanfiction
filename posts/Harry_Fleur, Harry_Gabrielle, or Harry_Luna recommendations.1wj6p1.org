I've been shipping Harry/Ginny for so long (and still do, probably) but have been more open to other ships, like the ones above. Would prefer multi-chaptered, longer fics if possible (+100k)?

And yes, I've read Hope, The Lie I've Lived, Bungle in the Jungle, Wastelands.

Thanks!


** How about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters][Letters]]? I liked it. The author is also currently (I hope he/she doesn't stop) writing a Harry/Gabrielle fic, so you got a two for one there. I also love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7680982/1/Unspeakable-Beauty][Unspeakable Beauty]]. It's a Harry/Luna story and I love it. I think nobody on Reddit has mentioned it so please give it a try. It's got lemons though, fair warning.

** Aye, I actually started a thread a little while ago dedicated to noncannon pairings. Most of the noteworthy H/F and H/G fics are [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1u5d2k/looking_for_fics_with_unusual_or_noncannon/][here]].

In particular I'd recommend When A Veela Cries. Just give it a chance, it /really/ picks up at chapter 6, when there is a gigantic jump in quality from the previous chapters. It's not bad in earlier chapters, it just gets so much better post 6.

** [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1jnwcd/im_looking_for_a_good_harryluna_story/][This thread]] has several good Harry/Luna recommendations.

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose][Dagger and Rose]] is one of the earlier Harry/Fleur stories. I found it a bit 'meh' but it seems to be recommended a lot.

Durararaaa's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/1/His-Angel][His Angel]] is another Harry/Fleur of note.

*** I liked Dagger and Rose at first but the treatment of Harry on no basis was way too exaggerated. I know that the school and people have turned on him before, but this story it went too far.

#+begin_quote
  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

Harry/Luna. It gets a bit weird towards the end, but it is quite fun.

I know I read some great Fleur fics, but I really need to dig through all the shitty wish-fulfillment stuff.

**** It's a weakness of the author's, I'm afraid. Very good technical writing, brilliant ideas, but cannot for the life of him figure out how to be concise.

Also, he /tells/ you a lot of things, but rarely /shows/ you. Still, worth a read.

** Well, I'm a Harry/Ginny(/Luna) shipper, so it's nice to see someone of similar interests.

I'm assuming that if you've read a lot of JBern's stories and have been an H/G fan, you've almost certainly read [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/][Jeconais's fics]], but he's got a couple of Harry/Fleur stories and Harry/Gabrielle stories that are lovely. Also lots of H/G, a Harry/Pansy classic, a Harry/Wednesday Addams crossover, and some nice Harry/Daphne Greengrass, so plenty to offer. ;-)

There's a lot of good H/L fic out there --- but a lot of it descends into Ginny-bashing, which seems needless. Of course, if you're going to hew at all to canon, in order to get Ginny out of the picture you've got to have /something/ happen. One piece that I love that does have a rather painful Harry/Ginny split but is ultimately about a really wonderfully drawn Harry/Luna relationship is Snegarochka Lee's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/31644][A Life So Much Less Than Ordinary]]. (NC-17, fwiw)

And if you're interesting in threesomes/triangles at all, there a bunch of great Harry/Ginny/Luna fics out there. The best place to find them is the LiveJournal community [[http://flamingnargle.livejournal.com][Flaming Nargles]].

Hope that's helpful!
