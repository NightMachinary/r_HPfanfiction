:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Someone mentioned this fic in the comments of a post a few weeks ago. I think the general gist of the plot was that Harry met a muggle girl at that park from OotP who had also lost a loved one recently. They bonded over it until the Ministry found out that he had told her about magic and Obliviated her.


** I know that one. Can't remember its name but I do know it. I can't remember the job of the obliviator but I do remember that he was part of the order and that the Muggle did have a relative who had been a witch. I do believe that they both got obliviated at the end of it.

** It's not exactly that, but just in case you're remembering slightly wrong, you /may/ be thinking of linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2163835/1/The-Refiners-Fire]])? In this fic, the girl has a dog named Sirius but she does help him get over Sirius' death.
