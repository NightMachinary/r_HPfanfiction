Inspired by this post of [[http://upthehillart.tumblr.com/post/164367299095/just-some-lame-70s-marauder-girls-ref][fanart with female Marauders]] (how gorgeous is that Sirius?!).

What is your favourite story with gender bent characters? Any ships/characters welcome.


** Weasley Girl is one of the best of the best. An excellent story in which Ronald Weasley was never born, but Veronica Weasley was. Genuine humor and heart.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** Linkffn(Gryffindor's Girl) is one of the best fem!Harry fanfictions I know of, if not /the/ best. I've ranted about its greatness multiple times on here, but not a whole lot of people seem to pay attention to said rants. Which is a shame, really.

Linkffn(11654455; 5883303) are the best fem!Harry one-shots imo. Not a Girl also had me pretty much crying by the end of it, which is something pretty unheard of for me when it comes to fanfiction.

Also, linkffn(12902633) is the best male!Ginny fanfic I've seen (and the only one where only Ginny is genderbended). It's also a one-shot.

Sure that she has just years before her inevitable death, Mary works to defeat Voldemort and keep her friends and family safe. Only fate fights her at every step, making her task even more difficult.

** How has no one mentioned the best two yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The-Pureblood-Pretense]] - This one is fairly AU in general, but the writing is top notch. Basically the premise is Riddle never became voldemort, and instead went the politics route, and succeeded heavily. Muggleborns and Halfbloods aren't allowed at Hogwarts and need to go elsewhere, such as America which is much more liberal. Since there was no war, Fem!Harry's parents are both alive, and Sirius never went to prison, so he got married and had a son. However Harry really wants to attend Hogwarts and Sirius son really wants to attend the American school, so they swap places despite that being super illegal. Sounds kind of weird but it's super interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]] - This fic is difficult to describe, and a bit polarizing as it is very surreal at times. But if you like the author's writing style it is great. Basically in this fic Death (the actual being, so not a MoD fic) is reborn as a Fem!Harry, and is thus incredibly powerful. However she doesn't remember being death previously and doesn't really know how to use said power effectively, and also doesn't really understand most normal humans, and as such there is still a lot of character based conflict as she can't just use her OPness to solve all her problems. In the fic she lives the life of being the girl who lived and is just constantly frustrated with all the bullshit that makes her have to deal with, which is very entertaining.

There's also a a Fem!Harry Naruto crossover that I like a lot. It's pretty early on thus far, as the author is rewriting a fic they started several years ago, but they are apparently much further along in the rewrite than what they have posted thus far, so it should at least get steady chapters for a while. I liked the original fic too, but this one is definitely better written as the author has improved over the years.

** I'm writing a very AU story where 90% of the magical world is female and things are very different. There's not a whole lot of it yet... I'm currently writing chapter eight... but I also drew [[https://www.deviantart.com/dinamnealey/gallery/66168649/Witching-World][some art of some of the characters to go wiih it]]

The fic is called "Holly Potter and the Witching World."

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)

*** It's actually fairly common. There are a lot of stories that make the cast more diverse and from what I've seen Indian Harry is the go to. I think the talking to snake aspect comes into play often when people decide on that.
