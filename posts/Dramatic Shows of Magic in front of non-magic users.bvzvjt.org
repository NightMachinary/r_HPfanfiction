Harry or other wizard/witch uses magic in front of those unfamiliar with it. For example, using the Patronus or fiendfyre, etc. It's become one of my favorite cliches.

Basically looking for some self-indulgence.

Crossovers welcome.

Harry is driving home with Vernon when he's confronted by a resurrected /Ringmort/, Crouch Jr, several Death Eaters and an army of Inferi. Harry destroys them all by unleashing Fiendfyre and then rips apart the souls of Ringmort and Crouch Jr. Chapters 13 & 14, I think.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
