** Most of the friction between Fleur and the Weasleys reads like culture differences to me. I don't actually know any British or French people so Idk how accurate that is, but it feels like someone from NYC visiting future in-laws in Arkansas. Fleur says things very bluntly, so even if she truly doesn't mean them to sound rude, the way she says them is so different from how the Weasleys have interacted with each other (and friends/acquaintances in general) their whole lives that they can't take it as anything /but/ rudeness. And they're saying the British equivalent of "bless your heart" meaning "you're the worst person I've ever met and I know Lucius Malfoy," but that level of passive aggressiveness doesn't register with Fleur who probably has a totally different scale for what counts as being rude.

Edit: although Molly straight up thinking she's only with Bill bc he's hot or whatever is an asshole move. No amount of perceived rudeness excuses that.

*** As someone who married a British guy and lived in France for a couple years, I absolutely agree that it reads as cultural differences written from the perspective of an English person with significant biases. I know several French-schooled people (both French and British in nationality) that deeply believe the French system is better than English/American systems. I took some classes at a law school while living in France and met several professors that perpetuated that idea among their students, as well. It could have been that Rowling had a run-in with people of that opinion (which, in my experience, is often bluntly and dismissively expressed) and, in combination with her obvious writing of all French people as snobs --- lazy and clich√© as it was ---, Fleur ended up treated quite awfully for as neutral a character as she is.

Also, Rowling wrote lots of people as "superior" and, therefore, (varying levels of) bad and championed those that were "looked down upon" in a manner I found uncomfortable and oddly defensive. Thinking about her TERF-y self-victimization, I wonder how many of more of those thoughts I missed or internalized as a kid.

Edit: I would really like to emphasize most of the bad guys in HP are obviously awful, but Fleur's slightly holier-than-thou characterization didn't/doesn't make her a bad guy and the entire class of young Slytherin students (literal children!) didn't deserve to be written off, either.

Yes yes yes. Nearly every scene with Fleur being "snobby" just made me like her more and like Ginny/Hermione/Molly less. I've been paying more attention to how jkr handles her female characters in my reread and this was one of the several instances where I was "ughhhhh"ing my way through.

** Imagine their situation in an AITA thread. I'm not sure on the ages, but you get the gist.

"So I (19F) have moved to live with my fianc√©'s (25M) family temporarily while we plan our wedding.

Unfortunately, it's a real culture shock for me. I've moved from France to be with him, and now live in what looks like a converted pigsty in the middle of farmland. They all seem to do nothing but look after their chickens, cook and sometimes play Quidditch, which they all seem obsessed with.

My future MIL really seems to resent me being there. I probably haven't made it easy, but I don't see the point in doing things I don't want to do (cooking, chickens), and have said so. Maybe she doesn't like me because she thinks I'm taking her first born son away, maybe it's because I'm French, idk. She also has the worst taste in music I have ever heard.

I'm not really sure how to get along with them, and I'm not sure that I want to. So, AITA?"

** There's a running (slightly serious) joke about the town I currently live in - there's only two things to do here, drugs and each other. As an asexual who doesn't even know what meth is, much less how to take it (do you sniff it, do you inject it, do you rub it between your toes - I haven't a clue), I feel about my town pretty much how Fleur feels about the Weasleys. It's rude to say it quite so bluntly, sure, but the sentiment is fine.

Same with the education conversation, I think. The sentiment is fine, but the tone itself is the thing that rubs people the wrong. There's a difference between "Ah, what a shithole!" and "Ah. What a shithole." y'know?

Tbh, I think most of Fleur's character comes from old English stereotypes about the French - pretentious about cuisine, supercilious, and hot, and also really obsessed with fighting with the English. She's basically two stereotype-levels up from the "Hon hon hon, your muzzer was a hamster and your fazzer smells of elderberries!" guy in Monty Python.

****** Like I said, I understand her feelings towards the Weasley place and even agree (I have very, very strong hayfever, so being violently allergic to greenery means my relationship to the countryside will never be amiable). Everyone has different interests, tastes, and comfort zones and there's nothing wrong with that. If the rural life isn't what interests her, that's completely okay and she has no obligation to get involved or do anything she doesn't want to. My only comment is that the way she expressed those feelings to and around the Weasleys is pretty blunt and poorly phrased and I'm not surprised it pissed them off and that there were better ways she could've said those things. Having to hold your tongue when visiting the in-laws you don't like is practically a cliche at this point, so it's not entirely outlandish an idea.

The better approach in UK Etiquette would be to be more polite about her disinterest, basically. I'm not sure how she'd say it specifically, because I've never been quite able to get my head around her way of talking, but taking an "I'm sure you like living here, but this isn't what I'm used to. I'm just here because I adore your son and want to get along with his family." approach would've been less likely to piss them off.

Again though, not blaming her, and definitely agree with drenlogib that both sides are being dickish in that situation.

EDIT - to give a weird example, talking to strangers without a direct purpose. In parts of the US, this is regarded as pretty normal. In the UK, you'd get a similar look as if you'd suddenly started telling said stranger about your last bowel movement in graphic detail.

From what I'm reading in this thread, the points of contention seem to be twofold. Some say that she was rude, yes, but she didn't mean to be (either cultural/linguistic differences or a personal unawareness). Others say that the Weasleys were shits to her, so she gets to be a shit back.

The reason why it's weird is that the Magicals seem like they should have influenced our government seeing as they came up with it 100 years prior. Besides I think everyone can agree that New York was the worst place to put it. The Woolworth building where MACUSA is located was built around 1900. By 1900 NYC was a massive trade center with a huge population. MACUSA is specifically known for being particularly harsh on segregation, that's why they used to hold their congress in Washington State. NYC just isn't conducive to secrecy whatsoever. Even if we ignore the American political values which MACUSA shares, it'd make more sense to put their seat of government near the No-Maj's so they could keep an eye on them. The MACUSA, I would argue, is the weirdest piece of canon by far.

  The Weasleys' and Hermione's objections boil down to, 'we don't like her because she's pretty.'
#+end_quote

That's not accurate at all.

Ginny's first complaint about Fleur is that she treats Ginny condescendingly, as if Ginny were "about three."

Having had /six/ brothers who babied her to varying degrees and now four of them have left home, Ginny resents being treated as a baby again.

We don't know the degree to which Fleur speaks to her, but it's hardly a stretch for Fleur who called Harry "a leetle boy" to speak this way to Ginny. Whether she realizes that Ginny--who is described as small for her age--is actually almost fifteen is another matter.

Hermione describes Fleur as "full of herself," and given Fleur's bluntness in putting down British customs in favor of French, that's not exactly a stretch for Hermione either.

Molly, it should be noted, does not approve of Ginny and Hermione calling Fleur "Phlegm." Her primary objection is that Bill and Fleur--who have known each other for barely more than a year--are rushing their engagement. Which is a /very/ justified stance.

#+begin_quote
  When in the Burrow, Fleur says that there isn't much to do unless you like cooking and chickens. This is not a massive dick move. This is someone not liking cooking and taking care of chickens.
#+end_quote

I would argue that it is too a dick move. One of my favorite places in the world is my aunt's farmhouse, and there isn't actually much to do there except talk to assorted family members.

Fleur is criticizing the Burrow--which has been the Weasleys' home and is now the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix--as inferior to her presumably much more urban lifestyle in France, and implying that it's inferior.

#+begin_quote
  The next 'rude' thing she says is when the OWL results come in. She says that they did the testing differently in France, and she says it's better.
#+end_quote

While I agree that this is not exceptionally rude, Fleur has a reputation for being harshly critical of Hogwarts. And I'd like to see how the curriculum actually compares. Viktor Krum, for his part, said that fourth-year Harry knew how to do things he did not.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny, Molly and Hermione go around trying to set Bill up with Tonks, and calling Fleur shallow.
#+end_quote

Molly did not try to set Bill up with Tonks. She gave Tonks emotional support for Remus' rejection. Hermione and Ginny merely thought that Molly was playing matchmaker because they were teenagers and teenagers are kind of stupid.

Later, Molly defends "dear Tonks" because Fleur snidely criticized Tonks--who was an Auror and a member of the Order. But she's not trying to set her son up with Tonks, she's merely defending Tonks' honor.

#+begin_quote
  Molly insinuates that Fleur will break off her engagement with Bill because he has scars now
#+end_quote

This was less insinuation and more "My son has been mangled by a /werewolf./ His life is ruined." Don't accuse Molly of things she isn't actually guilty of.

*** Please don't be rude. They are fictional characters in a fictional world. Am I offending you in some way by expressing an opinion? Mate, I like you. I like your fics. You seem nice and offered actual points, so what the hell did I do?

1. I reread it to further my understanding of an aspect of canon. I don't give a fuck that you don't like that, I will be intellectually honest about my reasons. I thought Fleur was decent but superior. I was then corrected and told that she was a horrible person. I remembered some lines from the book, and thought that it didn't make sense. So I reread it.
2. I said I was only looking at HBP. I wanted to look at Phlegm bit. Not an analysis of Fleur's entire character.
3. This is a misunderstanding of the point. I'm saying that their objections are wrong, and their arguments boil to down to we don't like her because she's pretty. This is part of a thesis, I had yet to start providing evidence. Everything you said about Fleur's behaviour towards them would have occurred off-screen. This is not good evidence. Molly is called out by Ginny for being a massive hypocrite in the rushing into marriage issue. Molly then proves that she doesn't think Bill and Fleur should be together when she says that it's different, she and Arthur were made for each other. She is criticizing the relationship on more than a, 'it's too fast,' level.
4. There's not much to do here is saying that there's not much do here. The context is that she's bored of seeing the same faces, and is happy to see Harry. Again, I don't agree with the chickens thing. I like chickens and cooking. However, I see no issue in someone saying that they don't. She does not criticize the house, she does not criticize them. She says that there isn't much to do besides cooking and chickens. This is not far from the truth based on how we see all of the kids spend their summer. Cooking, caring for the garden and animals, and Quidditch.
5. I think we're in agreeance about this.
6. Molly was inviting Tonks around for dinner a lot. The kids thought that her goal was to get Bill together with Tonks. I admit I was wrong. You were right. Molly almost definitely knew the real story with Tonks, and there isn't enough evidence to prove she was being a matchmaker.
7. Molly /was/, 'oh my god, his life is going to be ruined.' Fleur calls her on the fact that she /says/ the marriage will be off. I was wrong, it wasn't insinuation, she just straight-up said it. The interesting thing here is that it takes a moment for Fleur to stumble on the right accusation. She didn't know that they thought she was shallow. She thought Molly was saying Bill wouldn't love her anymore. She thought that was an insult to Bill, and was offended. When Molly said that wasn't it, she realized Molly thought she was going to break off her engagement with Bill. I don't have anything else to say here.

Now can we be friendly again? I don't enjoy this kind of dialogue. It's not fun.

** This is why I like the Harry/ Fleur pairing. I'll never know what she saw in Bill. Everyone apart from Harry and Bill was pretty horrible to her. Though in her defence I share her views on living in the countryside. Except it's plowing a field and drinking alcohol for men.

Why do you say that? None of their remarks had anything to do with her appearance, but with her snobbishness. Women can hate other women for reasons besides superficial jealousy, you know.

#+end_quote

Huh? Maybe I'm different, but if a guest rushed over to a family friend who's visiting and exclaimed how she's so happy they came since there's nothing to do besides (insert any two actives), I would be offended. It's such an unnecessarily rude thing to say. Like, even when I was a kid and visiting people I didn't like, I never said anything like that, because it's so mean and makes the hosts feel like they didn't do enough to engage me. If I could recognize that as a kid, Fleur should be able to do so as a 20 year old woman.

#+begin_quote
  The next 'rude' thing she says is when the OWL results come in. She says that they did the testing differently in France, and she says it's better. This is again, a fairly normal conversation. I've had the same conversation multiple times with friends who had different teachers in school or went to a different school.
#+end_quote

I'd say the next rude thing she did was smiling and saying how funny the twins are after Hermione was punched in the face by one of their products and was distraught about not being able to heal her black eye, but different strokes for different folks, I guess. Anyway, I think what she said in itself wasn't rude, but when and how she said it was. Hermione was acting hysterical (flapping her arms around, listing everything she failed, etc.), Ron was shouting at Hermione, and Harry was about to throw up, but she decided to insert herself into the conversation and talk complacently (which means smug or exceptionally pleased) about how Beauxbatons did it much better. That's a rude thing to do, and anyone with basic social skills knows that.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny, Molly and Hermione go around trying to set Bill up with Tonks
#+end_quote

Okay, this is the part where I'm actually confused, since it never happened. Ginny and Hermione thought that was what Molly was doing, but they never interfered and it was found out by the end of the book that Molly was actually inviting Tonks over to support her after Lupin rejected her.

Also, they were exceptionally kind to Fleur compared to Fleur's behavior towards them. Hermione only insulted Fleur once, and Molly was trying her best to be kind until she finally snapped when Bill was injured. Sure, sometimes her responses to Fleur were a bit clipped, but she tried her best. Heck, she even chided Ginny every time she insulted Fleur, and Ginny even stated that Molly was trying to act like she liked Fleur to everyone. I will admit that Ginny was a bit rude to Fleur, but she's not nearly as bad as Fleur. She only mocks her around 5 times.

#+begin_quote
  and calling Fleur shallow.
#+end_quote

When? None of them ever did that. Ginny implied that Bill was shallow, but she never said that about Fleur, and Molly implied Fleur was shallow after Bill was injured, but she never outright stated it.

#+begin_quote
  Molly insinuates that Fleur will break off her engagement with Bill because he has scars now. Fleur blows up at her because Molly just became a bloody asshole.
#+end_quote

So Molly, who was trying her best to be kind to Fleur for a whole year, is suddenly a "bloody asshole" for finally snapping at Fleur when her son was permanently injured? Sure, Fleur is technically right in this situation for once, but I hate how it suddenly excuses Fleur being a colossal bitch to everyone. Fleur should have apologized to Molly for how she came across, and /then/ go in on her for thinking she would leave Bill.

#+begin_quote
  This has been my Ted Talk
#+end_quote

No offense, but your Ted Talk was horrible and one-sided. You failed to mention how Fleur criticized everything (Molly's food, the house, Molly's favorite music, etc.), and how arrogant she was in general, and you instead treated her like a poor, innocent saint who was terrorized by three evil she-demons. Now, I don't think Fleur was totally wrong. She was thrust into a totally new situation, and the women around her avoided her and laughed at her behind her back. Molly, Ginny, and Hermione all should have been more understanding of Fleur. But you have to realize that Fleur should take responsibility for her bad attitude and arrogance. If she was nice and didn't criticize everything, they would have accepted her with open arms. They didn't hate her because she was pretty or anything like that, and saying that is dismissive of her horrible behavior towards them.

*** My whole point is that Fleur was not that arrogant and rude. You can't just use her being arrogant and rude as evidence. I said she's not arrogant and provided evidence. You said she's arrogant, and provided none. That's your whole argument. I explained the marriage thing [[/u/CryptidGrimnoir][u/CryptidGrimnoir]]. Read that response if you want, it covers all of your points.

But serious question, why are acting so hostile? Is it because I swore in my writing and used strong language? I usually don't, and I regretted it a bit afterward. I try to hold myself to a certain standard of writing, and this didn't meet it, but I don't think I got how bad it was.

#+end_quote

The whole point of my comment was to go through all of your points and say how you're wrong, since all of your so-called "evidence" wasn't very good. For example, you said that her saying that Beauxbatons' system was better wasn't arrogant, but I brought up the context and the way she said it as evidence. I fail to see how that is not sufficient evidence.

If anything, you provided less evidence. You totally ignored the context and tone in all of your points, and even made up things like the girls hating Fleur just because she was pretty and them setting up Tonks and Bill. I'm open to critique though, so if you feel that I have not provided enough evidence, feel free to point out flaws.

I'm sorry if you're under the assumption that I was trying to be hostile in any way. I didn't mean to appear that way at all besides when I remarked that women can hate other women for reasons besides superficial jealousy. Sometimes tone is hard to express online though, so I definitely can see why you thought that.
