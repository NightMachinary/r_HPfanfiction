I read this years ago and cant find it again. all i can remember is Harry goes to azkaban and is blinded. He plays telepathic chess with another blinded mage.


** I'm pretty sure this is it linkffn(5269970)

I remember really enjoying it a long time ago, I'll probably give it a re-read as well.

  COMPLETE: An AU Fifth Year fic written pre-OotP. Sword fights, apocalyptic battles, new kinds of magic. Love, betrayal, angst. Doing the right thing, doing the wrong thing, and doing it in style. This is epic. This is dark. *This* is TTK:Reloaded.

*** Gave it a read until around ch 26. It got to AU for me at that point and I had to drop out. Otherwise I enjoyed it.
