** You do not pay for materials, but for the time others invest. How much you pay per time-unit depends on the skills of the one you are paying.

Easiest: When you buy a book, you do not pay for the paper, but for the knowledge of the author, and the time invested to bring those to paper.

And since books are needed in the wizarding world, there is money to spend. Arthur couldn't just make Ron a wand, he needs Ollivander for it. Molly can't just write Bill a book about curse-breaking, and maybe she isn't the greatest designer so she can't simply conjure perfect dress-robes either.

And suddenly you need to have a currency, and have rich and poor people. The burrow isn't a /bad/ house. They have loads of lands (enough to play Quidditch on!), a big enough house for seven children and more, all based on a single income of a government official.

Money surly stretches far in the wizarding world, but not infinitely.

That's always how I saw wizarding society. Similar to this quote from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/91/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Prince of Slytherin]] (which agrees with my headcanon):

#+begin_quote
  The older man shrugged. "Most common wizards don't have a lot of currency because they don't need it. With limited exceptions for food and shelter, magic can give you whatever you need to survive. If you know how to apparate, you can transport yourself almost anywhere. If you're good with Transfiguration, you can make most everyday items you need. If you know the Reparo Charm, nearly anything tangible you buy will last a lifetime or longer. In all of Diagon Alley, there are only four stores that sell clothing because only rich wizard-folk -- or wizard-folk who want to be *perceived* as rich -- bother to pay for clothing produced by other wizards instead of simply transfigured out of used garments. I believe the comparable Muggle term is *post-scarcity society*.

  . Most wizard-folk only need galleons in large quantities if they decide to operate a business of some kind, and they usually get the money from investors among the old rich families."
#+end_quote

Wizards don't need money for anything non-wizard produced, and maybe food (but even then their expenses are much, much lower than ours). So, yes, the Weasleys are poor in that they can't afford Wizard-made books and gadgets, but they're not gonna starve any time soon, or be evicted from their home, or have to juggle 2+ jobs just to survive (the way we might think of poverty in real life).

***** I saw someone argue once that you would still get two full size potatoes, but the second one wouldn't have the same nutritional value, which I think is a good interpretation.

***** Why? It just mean that there is unreplicable outright trait of "foodiness" that you have to base on something. Stop thinking in muggle terms.

** By tying their potentially unlimited productivity to a very limited currency supply that was further controlled by a hostile specie, they were just asking for perpetual deflation and permanent economic depression.

** So two things, it's never directly stated, but from indirect clues (quintapeds, the description of the branch itself) we know that transfiguration is permanent.

But there is one thing - conjuring. There seem to be two types of conjuring.

The first is what I call "true conjuring" where you create something from nothing. It's not permanent.

#+begin_quote
  Something that you conjure out of thin air will not last.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm]]

And the second is what I call "de-vanishing", it's only implied, but that's how vanishing cabinets seem to work.

There are a few quotes supporting that which I can find and provide if anyone is interested.

Anyway, average wizard isn't that competent. Twins say that most of the wizards can't cast Shield Charm properly despite it being on the basic Hogwart's curricululum. And conjuration is NEWT level transfiguration (mentioned in OOTP). So it follows that conjuring, especially of complicated objects is something that most wizards can't do.

Also:

#+begin_quote
  There is legislation about what you can conjure and what you can't.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm]] again.

Now add to this that it seems that you can't conjure magical things (like elements of magical creatures etc.), that there are patents in the wizarding world (OotP), that you can't automate magical processes like spellcasting (and thus enchanting) or potioneering. And you have a lot of reasons for the economy going. Of course, it will be different than what we have today in our world. Food is probably much lesser concern, so is land (see Weasleys for both), but the manufactured products (especially magical ones) and magical resources will still be rare and thus have worth.
