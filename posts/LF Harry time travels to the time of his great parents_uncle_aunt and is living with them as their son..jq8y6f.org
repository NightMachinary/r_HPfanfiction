I'm looking for a fic where Harry time travels and lives with his "Potter-relatives" as their son and goes to hogwarts. He should be powerful but not like extreme op!

What I liked fairly much was Stepping Back

  During the battle in the Department of Mysteries things go very wrong. An errant spell changes things far more than anyone could've imagined. Despite the title, this is NOT a Dr. Who crossover fic.

  Harry, Hermione, and Neville are still stuck in the past, and have started to build a life for themselves. Things are settling down, but then darkness rears its ugly head again. Harry's once more drawn into battle against the dark. With his friends and family he just might be able to fight them off.
