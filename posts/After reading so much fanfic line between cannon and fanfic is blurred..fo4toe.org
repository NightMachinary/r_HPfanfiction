** I have read the books in German. So I just ask myself: Did you read that in German? If not, then itâ€˜s fanon. :D This of course only applies to the canon of books (i.e. no interviews, twitter, films etc.)

*** Same with Spanish for me.

Though I will never forget the LatAm translators for the "Not my daughter, you /bad witch/" line

*"Â¡Mi hija no, perra!"* would have been epic. (The movies kept it)

Also, I just watched the scene in the movies. Molly was throwing around voiceless /green spells/. That's pretty damn badass.

** I think this is definitely true. Not for the more unusual fanfic tropes such as WBWL, but often what you start to think are 'facts' about characters are actually just ideas that a lot of fic writers have used. (The first names of Hermione's parents, for example).

**** Why else would Snape stick his neck out for him over and over again? Draco is literally everything Snape accuses Harry of. Him being Slytherin should only take him so far. Double-Triple-Agent or not, Snape would be complaining about Draco just as much as Harry to the headmaster.

Him being his Godfather solves most of that.

I'm surprised JK didn't make it canon, it's good writing material.

*** Understandable. I am currently forcing my mother to watch all the movies with me, while I am also rereading the books.

It seems so...unreal, since I normally read fanfics that feature Draco, I just cringe at the parts where I remember how much of a prat he could be.
