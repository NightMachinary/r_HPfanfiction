The first chapter an assassin attacks the Dursleys and Harry shots him, then he trains in the Room of Requirements for a year with time outside the room stopped. He does bloodmagic to himself, and write a letter to the Headmaster at the school in Canada. Arken? Or something like that. He and and a group have to make it through a course to even enter the school and classes are on stuff like bloodmagic, soul magic and Maggie fighting.
