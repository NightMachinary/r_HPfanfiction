I say ‘largely', as in it's centered around an AU Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows. The former in canon being when Hermione begins to realize her feelings for Ron and vice versa, right?

Only in this, she would begin to realize her feelings for Harry and vice versa. Sorry, Ginny. And I guess you could also throw in things going better than they did between Ron and Lavender.

Given time, I can see Ron and Lav working things out. Ron and Hermione? Not so much.

Never considered myself a shipper at all until the past few months when I truly became a Potterhead. (It's been a slow past few years.) And I recently realized just how much more appropriate Hermione and Harry would have been, instead of Hermione and Ron.

So does anyone know of one that fits the bill for this? Preferably on ff.net? AO3 could be doable on the premise of getting to understand the site better, so it doesn't seem so alien to me, so that I might consider a move. And lastly, no lemons, I don't get down like that. Highest I'll go is T-Rating.

Edit: Thanks so much for all the suggestions, guys.

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

  Hermione and Harry have been friends since childhood. It has always been the two of them against everything, Harry has always been the one to cheer her up. When Ron leaves them during their Horcrux search it is no different.

  Just what the world needs, another Harry and Hermione fall in love in the tent fic. But! Hopefully this is done with heart and definitely no bashing.   They were a few spots away from the last location they were together with Ron, but it didn't stop Hermione from glancing up at the sound of breaking twigs, or the rustle of leaves, or the quieter whispers of wind. By some animal instinct, every time she glanced up he did too. He couldn't help but think of frightened deer, their ears pert and rotating, eyes focused, alert, listening for wolves. The main difference for them was that they wanted the wolf to come. His glanced away from the empty forest to Hermione's dark eyes, still searching. "He won't find us." He used the sharp tone again, he still didn't mean it that way. Her eyes moved to his, injured, her mouth bowed in pain. He felt a stab of remorse. To his surprise she moved closer to him instead of turning away. Their spheres of sadness had been separate the last few days, their moroseness quiet, however loud it felt inside his head.

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway. Anyway. During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.
