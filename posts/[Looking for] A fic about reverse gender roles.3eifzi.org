A while back I read a fic that was about canon Harry ending up in a universe where gender roles are reversed and everyone who was male in the canon universe is female and visa versa, not only that, females are the dominant gender and treat men like we treat women.

It was a very interesting read but I can't find it, I remember it was pretty short, only 10 or so chapters, and was incomplete, the last chapter being male Luna getting memory wiped by male Umbridge. Help would be highly appreciated!

*Edit:* Forgot to mention the fic was on FF.net.

** I remember a fic like that, but are you sure that EVERYBODY switched genders? Because I distinctly remember Luna still being female somehow.

*** I'm pretty sure that distaff side is the story the op is looking for, and you are right, not everyone has switched gender. Just most (99.99%) of them.

Not sure how you treat women, mate. But what you're hinting at is something only a minority of men believe in and even fewer practice.

And back on track; sorry, never heard of such a fic.

*** Sorry, might not have worded it as well as I should.

Imagine if you go on a date and you go to your girlfriends house and meet her parents, her father is very strict and gives you the evil eye, her mother gushing over your girlfriends dress. Now imagine it in reverse, a girl show up to a guys house and his mom gives the girl the evil eye and the dad gushes over the guys suit.

That's what I meant.

**** Well that works well in the wizarding world, considering the men wear dresses too.
