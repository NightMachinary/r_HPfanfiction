It's such a great play on the world and characters as we know them.


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5265569/chapters/12150143][Seven Names]]: Is an AU that's complete and had some of the elements that I enjoyed in Reign of the Serpent (namely interesting world-not as AU as Reign of the Serpent).

** I've written "The Dark Lord Never Died", which might fit your request - if you want an alternate Britain controlled by a (smart) Dark Lord in the name of blood purity.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?
