** I know people who obsess over sports, or fashion. I don't have high expectations of “a normal human psyche.”

** Counterpoint: Obsessing over someone's obsession to the point where you made a reddit post seems worse than people who are invested into something they like. Bashing is not good writing, but Sturgeon's Law applies everywhere. And I have seen published books which had flaws which would have them dismissed instantly by 90% of people here (eg 700-word chapters which resulted in chapters being a scene each not even filling two pages, consequently no transitions).

** As someone who likes to see Ron bashed because of his actions as a teenager first let me assure you Im doing ok mentally aside from the depression and anxiety of course. I will read ffs even if they portray Ron as a stand up bloke I'd just prefer if he wasn't is all and I don't see why him being fictional would matter. Why do you care how someone writes the characters in their fan fiction though?

I hope this doesn't come across as sarcastic or rude in anyway I'm just genuinely curious.

** Idk about what you've seen or your experience, but to me it actually seems pretty healthy. Like the fictional character just becomes a stand-in for certain qualities or actions that piss them off. I guess ideally the bashing would help them work through that and help them be a better person irl. I don't actually know anyone who writes bashing fics though so I have no evidence for this, but personally that's how I'd try to use it.
