TL;DR is at the end! Hey guys, I was looking over another post of mine (harry as a jedi) and saw so many good crossovers.. and that got me thinking. What is the worse Harry Potter Crossover? We give a lot of recommendations to read, but very rarely do we say nope (except in the case of HPMOR...still waiting for the decision on that ban [[/u/denarii][u/denarii]]) I think mine has to be ANYTHING on this list. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Naruto-Crossovers/224/1402/]] . So yea... I gotta say two of my favorite universes do not work well together.... the only exception I have read so far is by Cr4zypt (and that was microcross at best so far)

TL;DR what is the worse Crossover you have ever read?


** Well I remember the time Snape fought Spiderman with a light saber. Good times!

** It's really hard to point out the "worst" of any badfic category because once people see how bad it is they will nope right out of it. Therefore only bad fics that are at least entertaining are even read all the way through- and if they are entertaining, are they really that bad, or is some author just trolling? That said, I'm sure someone on here will have some contenders for you.

*** Yes its much better to ask which fictions crossover the worst. Which Naruto is probably the answer.

****** I think it has more to do with the type of author who writes Twilight fanfiction in the first place. Most the twilight crossovers have romance as the central and only driving plot, which of course leads to OOC (in both fandoms) to justify whatever pairing is being set up. There is also resolving the fact that Twilight vampires and werewolves are so very different from Harry Potter ones that they may as well be different species.

***** If you put down your bias toward Twilight and go read some fics, you will discover them quite good. Especially some of the hp-crossovers is rather decent, if lacking in imagination and scope.

** [[http://www.therobotsvoice.com/2008/12/fan_ficition_friday_goku_and_anne_frank_in_until_t.php][The worst crossover]] is pretty obvious.

The worst HP crossover I know of? Probably linkffn(Twilight's Bloom by Concubine99).

  Uzumaki Harry is the adopted brother of Naruto and Sasuke, under the guardianship of Jiraiya. Anko is his sensei. He edits 'Icha Icha'. Can you picture how messed up this is going to be?

** The worst I actually /read/, was Vulpine Wizard. Its a HP x Fallout story, Post-Hogwarts, Fallout New Vegas.

Its a clusterfuck of mini-stories weaved into one. Basically just Harry, who for reasons gets turned into a fox-hybrid right at the start. Something that plays no role whatsoever in the remaining story, which isn't really a story. It really isn't good, but I still made it through a lot of chapters. I blame it on the general lack of HPxFallout crossovers.
