So I would like your input on a question I've had. So far as the HPU goes, it seems there is a trend that if it is mythical and has a good amount of background, it's probably real in the world. General ideas would extend to dragons, pixies, goblins, etc. my inquiry is this: to what extent would that extend to the rest of the world? Is it a safe bet that folklore in other countries would have a large base in magical reality? And if so, would it be safe to assume that each country has its own list of what qualifies as a beast/being/spirit?

Also, on an unrelated note, do you think it possible that there could be a half-merfolk in the HPU?


** The great thing about the HPverse is literally anything goes. If you do your research and don't halfass things, people will generally just accept it because, magic.

As far as half-merfolk goes, it's a pretty safe bet considering their are half-giants and goblin human hybrids and the like.

** I'd say all creatures of legend are candidates for being 'real', but that it may be a case of a different name for the same creature. The book Fantastic Beasts... was intended only as a fun supplement and a way to generate charitable funds, but the attitude of it suggests that it was meant as a record of all 'official' beasts.

Then again, it's fiction- do what you think works and see if your readers like it or if they find some parts harder to swallow.
