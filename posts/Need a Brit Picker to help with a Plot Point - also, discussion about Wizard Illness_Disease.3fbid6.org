Quick Question: Writing a story about Lily and I have to kill her parents somehow. Chose cancer for her mother. She will be diagnosed late 1971, but it will be declared in remission by mid-1972. That round will be fairly standard and by the book. It will come back late 1974/early 1975, and she won't respond to treatment. Eventually dies early 1976 (Lily has a very bad fifth year).

Tbh, I don't know much about cancer other than what you get in your basic Gen-Ed biology course in college...plus, whatever information John Green or Jodi Picoult chose to include in their cancer novels. I'm reading some stuff online right now. The only experience I've had with cancer during a time where I was old enough to remember was with my grandmother. But she had such an aggressive type of brain cancer that there wasn't even time for treatment. Personal experiences (especially as a loved one) would be useful as well as anything else needed for a Harry Potter story. It's not a very big plot point, but it changes how Lily acts/sees the world/sees magic/etc.

I'm thinking I might make Lily obsessed with trying to find a cure for her mother. She'll give up when it goes away, but she'll research more when it comes back. I think I'll say that wizards don't suffer from standard diseases where things just "go wrong" because the magic prevents it. Does that sound reasonable? So, it's kind of a hopeless search, but she is very interested in potions and charms, so that will strengthen those skills.

As for the Brit Picker, I would like to know more about cancer treatment in 1970s British hospitals. Doesn't have to be a wealth of information. My character is 11 right now, so she's not going to understand too much. Things like, how long can you stay in the hospital/do you have to pay for anything at all (I know, I'm a dumb American). I lived in the UK for awhile, but never went to the hospital (luckily), so I have little knowledge to go on.

Also, I placed the town of Cokeworth near Manchester, so they go there for treatment.

Lily's mother was born in 1936. She has no idea who her father is, and her mother died in a motor accident when she was just a few years old. I debated on diagnosing her with Breast Cancer or Lung Cancer, but decided to go with leukemia since she's really young in the story (only 35).

Thanks in advance for the help, guys. I know this is a sensitive topic, and I want to do it justice. I hope I didn't sound too flippant while describing the situation.

*** Yeah, that's what I figured. It won't be a factor. I just wanted to double check. They are middle class, so money will never be a concern for Lily...although Sev is very poor.

** My family is unfortunately quite prone to developing cancer, usually breast cancer for the women and prostate cancer for the men. Lily's mom probably shouldn't get lung cancer at that age unless either she smokes, or the industry of the town of Cokeworth is known for causing serious lung problems. Breast cancer is very possible to get at that age, and when it happens to someone that young the odds are not good.

In my own family, my aunt got cancer and that showed up the first time she got a mammogram. Decent sized lump in one breast, inflammatory cancer in the other. Inflammatory breast cancer is nasty and vicious and usually fatal. My aunt was told that she had about a 30% chance of surviving the next 5 years. She got the tumor removed from the one breast and got her other breast, with the inflammatory cancer, removed entirely, and went through radiation and chemotherapy. They were able to slow it down, but nothing was working completely, and her odds looked worse and worse. Right about that time, my aunt joined a study for a new treatment, and thank god, it worked. She's been cancer free for around 15 years now.

My uncle had prostate cancer, once again, it was found the first time he got tested. The tumor was about the size of a lemon, so his odds were also dreadful. He did better than expected, and the cancer even went into remission for about 5 years, but he ultimately did die of it. It's possible that extremely invasive surgery (and by that, I mostly mean removing large parts of his body, stomach and down. His legs ended up completely full of cancer and his bones started breaking without much cause) that would have permanently severely crippled him would have saved him, but he opted not to pursue that path.

My mom also had breast cancer, but found hers incredibly early. Because she's a bit paranoid about my family's cancer problems having a genetic component, she decided to get a bilateral mastectomy to ensure that the cancer wouldn't come back. There was very little risk to her life at any point though, because it was caught so, so early.

One of my second cousins discovered she had breast cancer sometime in her 20s. Needless to say, it was fairly far along by that time, and she did not survive.

My family members have always done their best to be positive about their health and lives while undergoing treatment, but it's very difficult, and my mom was definitely not terribly pleasant during the time between when she found out that she had cancer and when she got her prognosis. It was understandable, obviously, but she didn't want to tell us she had cancer until she knew the prognosis, so we didn't know why she was being very not nice. My uncle apparently stayed very pleasant throughout, but his family pretty much went kind of crazy and not very nice by the end, because they'd been watching him slowly, painfully die over years and that's incredibly hard.

So, yeah, you can even make the cancer make Petunia more bitter about everything, partly because long drawn out death is awful, and partly because she's the one who's really there for it (Lily, of course, would feel guilty about being away).

My pet theory about nasty wizarding illnesses, particularly chronic or fatal ones, is that they get the wizard's magic involved. So, if wizards have cancer, the wizard's magic could end up working with the cancer instead of the person. If the wizard's magic rejects the tumor, it might resolve on its own.

** The impression I have is that wizards can get some normal illnesses, but that magic can correct for them fairly handily- the Pepper-Up potion is often mis-characterised as a stimulant when it actually is a cure for the symptoms of the common cold.

There are also a number of wizarding illnesses like spattergroit, dragon pox, vanishing sickness and scrofungulus. I've come to the conclusion (since these illnesses haven't passed on to muggles) that they are somehow fed or supported by the victim being magical.

For the tragic circumstance you're considering, it could be the case that wizards could find and remove a tumor with no problem, but that Lily isn't even told about the illness until long after it's correctable, since she's up in Scotland ten months of the year. How much more tragic to find out your relative is fatally ill, that there is a magical treatment for it but since you're underage you can't cast the spell to treat it and the victim being a muggle prohibits a magical healer from getting involved.

*** Yeah, Pottermore says that wizards generally don't get Muggle diseases, but we've seen people get colds in canon.

My explanation looks to Tonks in HBP: she was depressed and temporarily lost her ability to morph because of it. So emotional state can affect your magic. So if your magic is weakened by some circumstance, then wizards can get Muggle diseases. One such circumstance could be the stress of exams, which is why Hogwarts students might all go down ill at the same time.

Pottermore says Muggles can catch these diseases, it's just that they almost never do because the statute of secrecy prevents cross-contamination:

#+begin_quote
  I pondered the issue of illness and disability very early in the creation of Harry's world. Did wizards catch colds? Could they cure illnesses that baffled Muggles? Were there disabled wizards? What were the limits of wizarding medicine, or could it fix anything?

  Some of these questions went to the heart of the story, because the theme of death runs through every volume of the Potter books. Having decided that magic could not raise the dead (even the Resurrection Stone does not truly return the dead to life), I then had to decide what might kill a wizard; what kind of illnesses they could catch; what injuries they might sustain, and which of the last two could be cured.

  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override 'mundane' nature, but not 'magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason that Gilderoy Lockhart, victim of his own mangled Memory Charm, has permanent amnesia, why the poor Longbottoms remain permanently damaged by magical torture, and why Mad-Eye Moody had to resort to a wooden leg and a magical eye when the originals were irreparably damaged in a wizards' battle; Luna Lovegood's mother, Pandora, died when one of her own experimental spells went wrong, and Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after his meeting with Fenrir Greyback.

  Thus it can be seen that while wizards have an enviable head start over the rest of us in dealing with the flu, and all manner of serious injuries, they have to deal with problems that the rest of us never face. Not only is the Muggle world free of such perils as Devil's Snare and Blast-Ended Skrewts, *the Statute of Secrecy has also kept us free from contact with anyone who could pass on Dragon Pox* (as the name implies, originally contracted by wizards working closely with Peruvian Vipertooths) or Spattergroit.

  Remus Lupin's affliction was a conscious reference to blood-borne diseases such as the HIV infection, with the attendant stigma. The potion Snape brews him is akin to the antiretroviral that will keep him from the developing the 'full-blown' version of his illness. The sense of 'apartness' that the management of a chronic condition can impose on its sufferers was an important part of Lupin's character. Meanwhile, Mad-Eye Moody is the toughest Auror of them all, and a man who was very much more than his significant disabilities.

** So first of all, bear in mind that Petunia definitely mentions that their "mother and father" were proud of Lily being a witch, and their parents are mentioned as seeing Lily off before first year. You might already know this and just prefer to ignore it, but just a heads up.

This might seem obvious, but cancer certainly wasn't treated the same way in 1970s as it is now. We've made some enormous strides, so that has to be taken into account. The idea of cancer has been a known medical issue for quite a while, but different varieties weren't immediately lumped in with cancer. Names and categories will have changed as well. And FYI, I wouldn't consider 30s too young for cancer.

The other thing to consider is that /attitudes/ toward cancer have drastically changed over the years. For a long time, cancer was this incredibly scary thing that people didn't tend to talk about as openly as they did now. There were a lot more euphemisms and whispered discussions among adults only. If someone died, you would say they died "after a long illness" not "after a battle with cancer." When you read older books where a character dies from a vague unspecified disease, it's often not because they didn't understand their symptoms, it's because no one talked about it. It's sort of like how people tend to talk about dementia in euphemistic terms, though in general we're way more open about health issues than we were 50 years ago.

You might consider asking in [[/r/askUK]] for secondhand accounts of parents and relatives in the 1970s.

But the biggest hurdle I think is the physical distance between Lily and her family if she's at boarding school 9 months out of the year.

It would not be unusual for her to take time off if her mother was doing badly, and I'm not sure if Lily spending a term at home will work well for your story.

Even if she doesn't go home for longer periods of time, she would still want to be going back and forth and seeing her mother fairly frequently. The fact that she had instant magical transportation options would make quick weekend visits very doable. And going home on weekends too often would almost certainly have a negative impact on her social life and potentially your plot.

I live thousands of miles from my family, and I have a relative that's not doing well. But what makes me feel better is the fact that I know I can trust my parents to call me if something changes and I know I can jump on a plane. Lily would not want to go back to Hogwarts unless she was sure that she could be instantly notified (via phone/floo/etc.) if there was a change. She would also need an exit plan in place.

Petunia isn't so cold that she wouldn't tell Lily their mother was dying, but I have a hard time picturing her sticking her head in the floo to tell McGonagall that Lily's needed at home.

You also need to deal with the problem of Petunia being alone with an adult woman who is at times not able to drive herself or needs extra attention. A century ago, taking care of a sick parent wasn't such a crazy thing, but this is the 1960s. Petunia would not be old enough to drive her mother to doctor's appointments and would not be spoken to as an equal by the doctors. Realistically, someone else from the Evans family or someone appointed would step in on Lily/Petunia's behalf.

I also think you're going to have to spend a lot of time allowing Lily to angst for her mother lest she look insensitive. But the trips home, research, and the general angst are going to slow your story down. Even though Lily would obviously be attached to her mother, the reader is not. So they won't have a lot of interest in the plot line.

So to be honest, while I like the idea of lily reseaching magical solutions and not finding anything, I'm not sure if if a long drawn out cancer plotline is particularly practical.

*** From what I'm reading, there's four main different types of Leukemia: Acute Myeloid, Chronic Myeloid, Acute Lymphocytic, Chronic Lymphocytic. They show up in all ages, but Chronic is more likely to happen above the age of 55. Chronic is slow moving cancer. Acute is fast moving cancer. Myeloid means it's in the blood. Lymphocytic means it's in the lymph nodes. Leukemia is fairly common type of cancer in little kids, but (at least nowadays) they have a really good prognosis. Adults definitely get it, and it looks to be more common among them than children - because the most common age of diagnosis is over age 55.

I'm still not sold on Leukemia, but it's definitely something that can happen in an adult. Also toying with Breast Cancer.
