It has always bothered me that James and Sirius didn't make arrangements to help out Remus in the event of their deaths in the war, given that they were both wealthy, thought of Remus as a brother, and should have known he might have trouble finding steady work. I have read a handful of fics that address this, but I have long forgotten what they were.

I'll take anything that talks about this. It could be Sirius expressing guilt when they reunite, a delayed-will-reading fic where James leaves a bunch to Remus, Harry questioning their closeness because of the lack of provision, James/Sirius leaving money to Remus and him refusing to use it out of survivors guilt, etc., etc.

Thanks in advance!


** Technically James most likely did left some money for Remus, but Remus felt too guilty about taking money from his dead friends and simply felt Harry deserves it more than he did. Remember, Remus felt shame about his werewolf side for the longest time. Also the crushing depression that he lost everything he ever cared about, well he most likely would not think about money.

As for Sirius, he was not suppose to inherit any money from the Black family since he basically ran away from all of that and was disowned. I also kind of doubt Sirius wanted anything to do with wealth in general and earn just enough for himself. However, it makes sense he gained all that money anyways because he is apparently the last male Black after the Prisoner of Azkaban. It's doubtful that Remus felt like he deserved any amount of money from another dead friend.

*** I think both of these are super likely, I just want to see them addressed in a fic!

** At age 20 you don't think of writing a will, you'd be thinking about bedding witches.

This is my biggest issue with all the stupid let's go to the goblins and open the will tropes. Hell I don't have a will or anything in the event of my demise. No one thinks they will die, it's the "it can't happen to me" mentality.

*** It's not impossible though, I'm sure you'd agree. They were at war, and was specifically targeted by a very powerful madman. It's a completely different situation than most of us 20 somethings in this age have ever experienced. Also, James may have been one of those guys who thought he was invincible, but Lily would probably have had more sense than that.

It's not canon for sure, no, but it's not completely out there that I would think it's a silly notion.

*** I would agree in normal circumstances, but these 4 were basically soldiers for a rebel militia (OOTP) in wartime. And a ton of the other members died (Prewetts, McKinnons, Dorcas Meadows, etc.) before L/J died and Sirius was arrested. You would think that would make them aware of the danger and prepare for the future. Plus, usually folks prepare a will when they have a child, so that they know the kid will be taken care of if something happens to them.

** Linkffn(pureblood pretense)

No one is dead here, but the Marauders have a joke line, Sirius and James give their shares of the profit money to Remus. He doesn't know about it and thinks that he is only receiving his part.
