I'm looking for a very specific fic in which harry is a veela (or maybe another creature very similar) and he has found a long lost grandfather (aka his blood grandfather because his mother was adopted). Harry comes back to Hogwarts in i believe his 6th year presented as a submissive veela and guts Draco at the opening feast. He has thousands of suitors and he does traditional interviews and dates and such. I can't find it anywhereand its driving me crazy, any help would be deeply appreciated


** I'm not sure if this is it but I came across it when searching
