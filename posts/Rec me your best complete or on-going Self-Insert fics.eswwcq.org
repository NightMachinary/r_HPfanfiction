So I didn't like SI until I read a Naruto SI fic.

Is there any other good SI fics; preferably with SI!Harry or at least a main character.

As said in the title I would prefer complete fics or if not, on-going (as in not abandoned). Not too short too.


** I promised myself I wouldn't do self-promotion, but [[/u/15_Redstones][u/15_Redstones]] did so linkffn(13436100).

Be warned, it's /grossly/ self-indulgent and one of the written-but-not-yet-posted chapters includes Naked Dumbledore.

Given that we've already had Harry cosplaying as Dogtanian of Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, accidental magic lightsabers, speculation on the size of kneazle turds, a Good Boy Grim, and the possibility that the Power He Knows Not is cricket, I'm sure the warning is probably superfluous, but you never know with some folk.

Also, it's kind of poking fun at all the badly-britpicked (and updated to modern times to avoid having to do research) stories out there, so I've gone for a tone of So British It Shits Crumpets and as much accurate period detail as I can remember from actually living through it all.

Edit to add: it's also on AO3, same username, if you prefer to read it there.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI, no ships. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.

****** I lived through the authentic period in question and I /wish/ I was blissfully ignorant of some of it. There was a fashion for mismatched neon socks at one point, did you know that? You do now. I've always known, the memories gnawing like rats in the dark corners of my mind.

******* I thought the current trend for mismatched weirdly designed socks was bad. But neon? Neon isn't meant for clothing. I don't need reminders of people's ankles, I'm perfectly comfortable with passive awareness

*** Thank you I'll check that.

There is nothing to be ashamed with self-promo. It can broaden your audience and if you do it here you're more likely to have constructive criticism.

**** I wasn't /ashamed/ of the self-promotion so much as wondering how a well a story would do with no promotion. All promotion is self-promotion in the end, whether you do it yourself or delegate it to a publisher, if you write you're putting yourself out there.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.
