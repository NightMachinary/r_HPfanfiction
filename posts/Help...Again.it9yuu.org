Okay.So I read a Harry P fanfic a while ago.Obviously, it's haunting my memory and I'd like to read it again but I can't remember the title.The story was definitely Humor and I can remember a part where the First years put on a little X-factor worthy show before they get sorted to show their â€˜talents' cause they misunderstood (most likely intentionally) the contents of the Hogwarts letter.If you've read a fanfic similar to my description, I would really appreciate it if you gave me the name.Thanks!...again
