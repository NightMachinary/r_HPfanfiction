** Realistically it would just be whoever had the best generals. Leadership is always going to be the most important thing in war, and that can't be boiled down to just intelligence and cunning. There are too many intangibles that play a role to say one way or another who would win between any faction if you don't know who's in charge and what they're capable of.

** I wouldn't be surprised if both sides would suffer more from inside battles then attacks from the other... slytherin potentially will have powerplays, while ravenclaws wouldnt be able to agree on the best tactic at all

** Slytherins, I think Ravenclaws would be too passive to win on their own.

** Ravenclaw, they are actual cleverer than Slytherin, would win the tactical battles.

But it would probaby lead to some kind of cold war, were both thread each other, but don't actual go for it

** If we go by stereotypes (pure knowledge vs deviousness and ruthlessness) then I'd say Slytherin wins handily. One exception is if Ravenclaws start fiddling with exotic forbidden magics like Fiendfyre and end up destroying both sides.

That's provided Slytherin is led by someone so powerful it's in everyone's best interest to follow them (e.g. Tom Riddle). Otherwise I would expect a lot of backstabbing and scheming and everyone putting their individual well-being before their side's.
