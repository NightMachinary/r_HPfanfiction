** Diary gets passed to so many teens that eventually Tom's soul consists more of vapid teenage girl than it does of Tom. Eventually it just becomes a sentient cosmo magazine with no morals. Thus begins a new story: Mean Witches.

** Imagine them sitting next to each other but they write in the diary instead of talking because the vanishing ink is so awesome. Or Luna constantly draws her creatures and Ginny turns it into Quidditch scenes somehow. Perhaps they even ignore Riddle completely because the diary is so fascinating even without its odd comments.

*** Exactly! There's just so much potential there for Ginny and Luna just having fun with the Diary while Voldie's Horcrux is super frustrated because if they aren't really talking to him he can't possess them.

**** Word of advice: There is a pretty drastic change in tone towards the end and you may happen to dislike it (I certainly did). If you are looking for light hearted humour, you will be disappointed towards the last dozen or so chapters.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

*** Quite possibly. I was thinking more along the lines that since they are both writing in the diary together and and repeatedly lose interest in favor of talking to each other and treat it more like a magical toy than an actual conversation partner, Tom never can get quite close enough to either of them to attempt possessing them.
