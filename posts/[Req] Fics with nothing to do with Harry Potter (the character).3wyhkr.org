  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.

#+begin_quote
  Minerva has just finished her first term teaching. A series of misunderstandings leads to an embarrassing moment, injured feelings, regret, growing understanding, then resolution. A Minerva McGonagall fic set in 1957, with forays into the past. More than a romance; stories within stories. Voted Favorite Legacy Story in the "Minerva McGongall" category in the Spring/Summer 2013 HP Fanfic Fan Poll Awards.Main Characters: Minerva McGonagall, Albus Dumbledore.Other Canon Characters: Poppy Pomfrey, Rubeus Hagrid, Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank, Tom Riddle, Grindelwald, and others.Not DH-compliant. Disregards DH.Most content T-rated. Pertinent warnings appear in individual chapter notes. See individual chapter summaries for characters appearing in that chapter.Resolving a Misunderstanding was selected to be a featured story on the Petulant Poetess during January 2008 and was a featured story on Sycophant Hex Lumos in May 2007.

  #+begin_example
      Warning: This story is intended for an adult audience\. While the vast majority of this story is T\-rated \(PG\-13\), certain later chapters contain explicit sexual content depicting consenting adults\. If such content offends or disturbs you, do not read it\. There is a bowdlerised version available on FanFiction\.net, if you prefer to read the story with the mature content edited to make it more suitable for a broader audience\.

            Minerva complains to Poppy about Dumbledore's repeated slights\. She gets herself wound up as she tells Poppy about the latest incident, much to her immediate distress and regret\.

          First published 27 February 2007 through 29 May 2008\.\(Early chapters posted in draft form earlier in February 2007 to fanfiction\.net and elsewhere\.\)Resolving a Misunderstanding was voted first place in the HP Fanfic Fan Poll Awards Spring/Summer 2013 round for Best Minerva McGonagall Legacy Fic\.  This is the first fanfic I wrote, and it spawned many more fics set in the same fanfic\-universe\. Although I do think that my writing has gotten better with time and exercise, this story is still a sentimental favorite of mine, and the basis for most of the HP fanfiction that I have written since, including the stories in the "Death's Dominion" series, which are set much later than this one, beginning during the HP school years \(the years in which the books are set\)\.Please note that at the time I began this story \-\- February of 2007 \-\- Minerva's birth year was generally considered to be in the early 1920s and Dumbledore's in the 1840s\. I set Dumbledore's birthday as August 1, 1840, and Minerva's as October 4, 1924\. Poppy is a few years younger than Minerva in this fic\.I hope you enjoy the story\! For links to all my stories, including works\-in\-progress, and for information about the stories I have written and posted so far, you can check my blog at mmadfan\.com\.  There's also a Kindle \(mobi\) version available for download\. You can find the link to my Kindle\-ized fics on my mmadfan\.com blog\.Thanks for reading\!

** Oh! My favorite fic fits this bill!

Linkffn(one hundred sixty nine)

Hermione invents a super time Turner to go back and prevent Harry's parents from being killed, so its primarily a marauder fic + Hermione. Snappy dialogue, good plot, good (and clever) action and some of my favorite romance of any fic. (Remus / Earl grey is a pairing I had never seen before). My favorite fic, and while there's a tiny bit of Ron in chapter 1, I literally don't think harry doesn't make an on screen appearance except for as an infant.
