:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have read it before but for some reason, can't find it or remember the name. Does anybody remember a story like this or know what it is called?

· Harry/Daphne

· 4th year

· Lessons from a Slytherin or Gryffindor girl (dueling?), or both

· Florean Fortescue has a nephew? That are also one of the leaders in Slytherin house

· Slytherin has leaders

· The champions duel each other

· Second task is changed to dueling? Or has dueling as a fourth task?

· Daphne is groomed to takes one of the leaders place in Slytherin


** Probably this one linkffn(The Other Champion)?

  After the events down at the Chamber, Harry decides to become the master of his own destiny than to let others decide his fate. He learns of a different connection that he shares with Voldemort; and magic that will make him a more than equal to the Dark Lord.
