The good guys are all dead, now what? I want a story about what Voldemort does after winning against the canon good guys at some point. How to expand power beyond Britain? What would other countries do? How would society under Voldemort look like? The political and economic systems? Long term plans?


** Read Harry potter and the homecoming hero by Bolshevik Muppet. It's a 6 book series and Voldemort wins at end. Be warned its very gory so not for the light hearted
