** They promptly conclude that Voldemort is actually just a cuddly and grumpy little piece of fluffiness deep inside whose life goal is to get into Harry's pants (Harry is /deeply/ uncomfortable), that the dark arts are really just the greatest, most useful, nicest subject someone can learn (don't you know how useful /Crucio/ is to make hot chocolate? There is no better way of making chocolate than literally torturing it until it flees the coconut), that Dumbledore is secretly the villain behind everything that ever went wrong with anyone since Ancient Greece (including converting poor muggleborn Salazar Slytherin to blood purism just to then break Grifyndor out of blood purism and have them fight to death); that Ron is the most disgusting excuse of a human being that has ever walked in earth (“fuck that, I am sticking with him. You would have to be an extremely shallow and sad person to direct your friendships by the political advantage they can get you instead of simply enjoying their company. And really, where did they take the idea of Ron being bad at magic while me and Hermione are literal divinities of it from? He keeps up just fine”), that Hermione is a sexy goddess of awesomeness, understanding and general goodness... at freaking 11! (“Nope! I am out of here); that Daphne Greengrass is a political mastermind (“You see, the secret to politics is to not bother thinking ahead, if something doesn't go your way you can just wrestle your adversaries into submission and if they retaliate you only need to get to the higher instances faster than her to get your version of the events heard first, Mom and Daddy always fall for that!) that Goblins become immediately lifetime friends if you remember their names once (“Hey Griphok!” “Who the fuck are you Human!? Better yet, what is your vault so I may stop wasting my valuable time interacting with you?!”) and that Draco /also/ wants to get in Harry's pants (“... better than Voldemort, but then again a working drill is better than Voldemort so not much of a bar, would still prefer someone not racist lunatic though”)...

** "Happy Birthday, Harry! I baked you a snitch-shaped cake."

"Thanks Mrs. Weasley! That looks beautiful but... uhm... pure curiosity, you didn't... uhm... add any love potion to it, did you? Geez this is awkward."

"Of course not Harry. Merlin, that's a silly question."

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you Mrs. Weasley. I am very thankful for this beautiful cake."

"None taken dear, we'd all be paranoid a bit about love potions when I hear that you had several classmates try to trick you into taking one. Now enjoy the cake and happy birthday once more."

...

"Ginny, I think he's starting to suspect. We must inform Dumbledore at once."

** Voldemort comes across a fic where Harry is an Eldritch Abomination wearing the meat-suit of the deceased Harry Potter (from when the Killing Curse hit him as a baby, after Lily's death), and he's "playing the long game for shits and giggles".

After all, to a being with an orange and green mentality, people who "Harry" knew dying wouldn't bother "Harry" so much outside of acting the part.

Voldemort has a fearful, existential crisis when he realizes that something /worse/ than the death he fears is playing him and the world at large like a fiddle... for kicks.

His followers are baffled when he begins to try to rally forces against a "greater evil".

When he hears that there's a "cult" growing at Hogwarts, which includes several of his Death Eaters' daughters (in reality, a sarcastic comment about said daughters' crushes on Harry being "cult-like" from someone that Chinese Whispered its way to him), he begins to panic.

Meanwhile, Harry and Dumbledore and company are baffled by Voldemort's uncharacteristic change; his followers are becoming more and more unnerved by his behavior, and Harry himself is blushing like an innocent teen (which he is) when several Slytherin girls, such as Daphne and Pansy, keep eyeing him up and giggling.

After all, Slytherins or not, they're still teenage girls taking a fancy to the apparent "forbidden fruit"/bad boy.
