Hello there! As some of you may have seen from my recent self-promotion posts, I'm currently writing a fic about a female Harry growing up on the Continent and attending Durmstrang. As such there's going to be a lot more diving into the nature of Magical Europe and the Wizarding nations there. I've personally never been fond of the whole 'Wizarding nations share the exact same borders as Muggle ones' concept, doesn't really make sense to me why they would do that given how isolationist and separate they are. Borders and national identities have changed a lot since the Statute of Secrecy was created, and even before that there was isolation.

But at the same time, I concede that I'm not European, and my knowledge of culture and history is spotty. So I thought I'd come and ask y'all for ideas!

What I have so far

- Britain-More or less the same. Since it's an island I can accept the border similarities, and I'm not going to fiddle too much around with it since it's what canon most clearly defines.
- Ireland-Not a lot to say about it, beyond that Magical Northern Ireland is part of overall Magical Ireland, not Britain. Even more isolated from their Muggle counterparts than Britain though.
- The Alpine Union-Formerly the Alpine Empire, its territory covers, well, the Alps, as well as large chunks of land in Switzerland, Italy, Austria, and Slovenia. Lost their French (and Monaco) territory in the mid 1400's in a war with Magical France, gave up their German territory to Magical Germany in exchange for aid in said war. Constitutional monarchy, albeit one where the monarch has firm political power. More progressive than Britain, having formed alliances with the Goblins in the early days of the Empire to help secure power and better make use of the mountains themselves. The seat of Wizarding Banking, and the source of most of the copper, gold, iron, and crystals for the rest of Wizarding Europe.
- The Wizarding City of Venice-Due to the nature of magical trade and travel, Venice never had the same power in the Wizarding World that its Muggle counterpart had. Still, through stubbornness and pride they've managed to maintain independence, and are a great source of magical art and crafting.
- EDIT: The Mediterranean Confederation of Magic-A confederation of Genoa, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and Malta, connected more by alliances, trade agreements, and a desire to remain independent than culture or fondness for each other.
- The Wizarding Republic of Italy-Largely mirrors Britain in terms of government, covering the parts of the Italian Peninsula that aren't part of the Alpine Union. The main difference from Britain being that they have more exclusively magical towns and villages like Hogsmeade, largely due being so close to the seat of Papal power in the Dark Ages. Roughly 50% of all Italian Wizards and Witches live in an exclusively magical community.
- The Wizarding Republic of Bulgaria-Wouldn't have been my first choice for them, but we know from the Goblet of Fire that Bulgaria is a thing in the Wizarding World and has a Minister of Magic so...same basic political structure as Britain, but territory wise it's drawn from the Second Bulgarian Empire (EDIT: Minus Greece, should have noted that)
- EDIT: The Fisher Kingdom-Another Constitutional Monarchy, ruled by a vampire known as the Phoenix Queen, with a council of Wizards, Centaurs, Veela, Giants, and Goblins representing their races and issues in government (though Wizards make up the majority of said government). Does not get along well with Britain, Germany, or the Alpine Union. Territory includes Belgium and Monaco as well as France, /may/ include the Iberian Peninsula as well, undecided.
- EDIT: Nibelungenland-Drawn from the Nibelungenlied, and the Nibelungens. A monarchy, with the royal succession coming down through the line of Siegfried, Wizard King of Xanten. The King or Queen is advised by two councils. One composed of local lords and guild leaders, the other composed of the portraits of past monarchs. Not especially progressive, but allied with the Alpine Union regardless due to history.
- EDIT: The Anniad Empire-Consisting largely of mainland Greece, but also Cyprus, Crete, and Ravenna, is a direct continuation of the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire. Founded in the Mid 12th Century by the witch Anna Komnene when her father, the Squib Emperor Alexios 1 Komnenos bypassed her for succession in favor of his likewise magicless son John 2 Komnenos, both of whom began withdrawing official support for the magical citizens of the Empire to focus on the Muggles. Was named the Alexian Empire by Anna, but was renamed not long after her death in favor of recognizing the founder of the state.
- EDIT: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m6i3io/suggestionsideas_for_wizarding_nations_in_europe/gr6l5dv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][This]] Just...this comment. Couldn't say it better, this was an excellent comment. Blend it with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m6i3io/suggestionsideas_for_wizarding_nations_in_europe/gr6evk6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][this too]] and you have my magical Poland.

And yes, I know that the concept of unified Italy and Germany is very new and very recent, relatively speaking. More recent than the Statute of Secrecy. But in my mind, magic makes empire building and maintaining much easier and more practical, since transportation, communication, and infrastructure are all much faster and easier with magic. So I see no reason why a unified Magical Germany wouldn't be plausible before a unified Muggle Germany (hell, according to canon the Magical United States formed nearly 100 years before the Muggle United States so -shrugs-). And with Italy, it'd be the result of communities forming alliances and deals that grew over time until eventually it was just a nation.


** If we're diverging from strict canon compliance, where magical states seem to largely mirror Muggle ones with only minor differences, then my personal preference is for a rather more fluid situation - there are magical nations, but not states.

Land borders would be blurry, not even considered that important/relevant. Rather, the jurisdiction of magical governments would be over a /people/, not an area of land. The British Ministry of Magic is the ruling authority over /British wizards/, not Britain.

The basis for this is that magical peoples are self-governing, and have been self-governing since time immemorial. Magical government occurs whenever a group of wizards happens to consider themselves a single people and forms a unit of self-governance.

Under this view, the wizarding geopolitical "map" would basically be a map of ethnicities, and because people move around it wouldn't be particularly accurate.

*** That would make things really messy for jurisdiction, like if a british identifying wizard attacks a french one, who's laws are they charges under, cause under your system it would be really messy here. I think I makes more sense for it to ba a mix, after all places like Hogwarts/Hogsmeade/Diagon Alley are all 'British' places and thus the british government does govern over land.

I think your system would make more sense as a group of wizards deciding to be one people under a certain powerful entity. Like the Flamel group. And they serve under this as nobility, having secured their land from the muggles through magic.

but idk I sorta suck at politics.

- 4 Legends\\
- 4.1 Patrick uses shamrock in an illustrative parable
- 4.2 Patrick banishes all snakes from Ireland
- 4.3 Patrick's walking stick grows into a living tree
- 4.4 Patrick speaks with ancient Irish ancestors
- 4.5 Folk piety

Apart from the Shamrock Thing, and defeating the Slytherins... He's got a magic tree that would be great for wands! And it looks like he had the Resurection stone at some point. He's clearly Patrick Peverall!

I don't think it's really an argument. From what I remember from GoF, England also has its own team (Ron complained that they lost early during the World Cup), which imply that Scotland has its own team (and maybe Wales too), even though Scotland is clearly under the control of the Ministry. I mean, British' sport teams are also separated into several country in the real world.

But yeah, if Wiki says its possible, then it is possible.

** Transylvania is definitely its own thing even though modern day Transylvania is part of Romania since they are treated as their own community in History of Magic classes and they have their own Quidditch team. Also, probably due to its association with Dracula, Transylvania's folklore is one of the more famous ones from Central/Eastern Europe. Speaking of which, Romania should also be its own community due to the vast cultural differences from its neighbors (being mostly a latin country surrounded by slavic countries). Ukraine and Hungary I think are also their own territory considering they have a dragon species called after their country. Furthermore Gellert sounds very Hungarian to me while Grindelwald sounds German which is an indication that Grindelwald was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (given the timeline) so I think Austria is in league with Hungary too. You mentioned Bulgaria so there's not much to say on that.

Also Greece is quite unique in the Balkans due to its mythology and the influence it has on the HP universe so I would think they are also their own thing but its magical territory could expand all throughout the Balkans like its ancient counterpart incorporating Macedonia and parts of Albania.

** I think that the major issue with Germany is the fact that its border used to be more to the east but after wwii Prussia was essentially disolved and its territory given to Poland. For that matter Poland's border was more to the east too but soviets took that. Lvov, now in Ukraine used to be Polish city.

** If you want a definitive country for where Drumstrang would be located, I would suggest something similar to the Kalmar Union. The Kalmar Union, at its creation, was a union between Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. The reason the union would still be around is that the magical side that agreed with the king won compared to the regular history. The union would encompass Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. I think an elective monarchy would be an interesting way to go for the government. You could have a King that ruled the entire Union, but each country has its own monarchy. The candidates could be from the current monarchs and the dukes/duchesses. Side note, Finland did have its own monarch for all of about two months. You could have it that the Wizards decided to keep the King for Finland. This government type could be used for a lot of interesting political events because the Union can be an extremely strong force, but it is usually held up by internal disagreements.

** The Magical Confederation of the States and Territories of Poland and Lithuania (AKA Poland-Lithuania, the Polish-Lithuanian Confederation, etc.):

History & Geography: Based upon the borders of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (as seen in their peak in 1619) and the Kingdom of Prussia, Poland-Lithuania owns the majority of Eastern Europe. It has maintained its power and independence mainly through alliances with the British, Italians, and (formerly) the Byzantines and the UMGS (Union of Magical Germanic States, dissolved by Napoleon Bonaparte with the HRE). Poland-Lithuania gained Prussia after the fall of the UMGS, where Governor-General Markius Wilhelm III of Prussia decreed that Prussia would never be ruled by the French, instead opting to join the PLC as a semi-independent territory (and later a state fully integrated into the Confederation) in 1806.

Politics: The politics of Poland-Lithuania are rather complex, but it is famously one of the only Wizarding Democracies still in existence, and it is the oldest by far, having adopted democracy since 1672. The elected ruler of the PLC is known as the Gubernator Stanów, or the Governor of the States, whose job is to either approve or veto laws passed by the Senate.

Armed Forces: The Polish-Lithuanian Confederation is a mostly disarmed nation, with a volunteer Law Enforcement agency known as the Korpus Abidacji (Abidation Corps), but no official Armed Forces. The Korpus Abidacji's leader is known as the Generał-Porucznik (the Lieutenant-General). Each officer of the Korpus Abidacji, known as Oficerowie Specjalni (Translated: Special Officers; Singular: Oficer Specjalny; Translated Singular: Special Officer), carries both a wand and a muggle Colt M1911. The standard uniform for an Oficer Spechalny is very similar to the uniform of the muggle Polish Army as it was in 1939: a tan trench coat (charmed to protect against most spells), standard army fatigues, and thick black dragonhide boots, charmed to keep out water, mud, and other environmental unpleasantries.

Magical Schools: While Durmstrang is the most popular magical school in Eastern Europe, and indeed most school-aged children in the PLC go there, the PLC does have its own smaller, less traditional school of magic, based in Riga. The Riga School of Magic and Technology teaches children both magical and muggle subjects, and while this makes it more frowned upon by the pureblood traditionalists of the PLC, it is the main choice for Muggleborns and the Muggle-Raised to get their magical educations, especially if they wish to go into a muggle field of work after their school years.

Well, that's about all I have to offer. Enjoy!

**** Another nation I made:

/The United Tsardoms of Kazakhstan, Greater Georgia, and South Russia (UTKGR, United Tsardoms)/

Formed in 1919 after the Great Rus Revolution, in which the Grand Tzar of the Rus, Grigori Rasputin IIV, was killed by a splinter of the Russian Muggle government, the United Tsardoms formed from the splinter governments of the /Republic of Kazakhstan,/ the /Union of the Caucasian States,/ the /Confederated Republic of Eastern Ukraine and Belarus,/ and finally the /Republic of Southern Russia/.

The UTKGR is well known for it's opposition of the Soviet Union, and it's desperate attempts to return Tsar Nicholas II to the throne. When it was discovered that Nicholas's daughter, Anastasia, had survived being executed by accidentally apparating, she was found and brought back to Tbilisi, the new royal capital.

The newly-crowned Tsarina Anastasia I of the United Tsardoms would get a full magical education, and would proceed to rule the UTKGR until 1998, when she finally retired. In this time she saw her power be slowly removed from her until she was mostly a symbolic figurehead. She was proceeded by her son, Tsar Matthias I, in 1999, earning him the nickname of the 'Millennium Tsar'.

The United Tsardoms is now a democracy, lead by Prime Minister Sannakra Patix since 2014. It borders the /Polish-Lithuanian Confederation/, the /Kingdom of Siberia/, the /United Ottoman Duchies/, the /Persian Federation/, and the /Magical Republic of Romania/.

The United Tsardoms has no magical school, instead preferring to send it's school-aged children to Durmstrang or the Riga School of Magic and Technology.

It is not the only Russian Magical Government, however: the Magical Kingdom of Russia constantly fights for legitimacy with it's magical school of the /St. Petersburg Institute of Magic/, and it's control of the former Grand Rus capital of Saint Petersburg, and the new Russian capital of Moscow.

** Magical Russia - could be ruled by Koschei the Deathless (notorious for his well-hidden horcrux) or Rasputin. Since the magical world tends to be around a century behind the muggle world, there'd probably be some kind of social upheaval going on there.

There's a lot of mythical “lands to the west” in European mythology. Maybe some of them are exclusively magical island nations, made unplottable to keep muggle ships away. Hy Brasil was supposed to be off the coast of Ireland IIRC.

France has this old forest where King Arthur's knights were supposed to go on quests. I forget what it's called, but there might be a few unplottable sections holding magical communities. Beauxbatons supposedly has wood nymphs, so that could connect to some of the French folklore about the “dames vertes”.

*** Koschei isn't a bad figure to reference. Russia probably won't come up as much since it has its own school (part of wanting these ideas is to help flesh out where Harry's fellow students and her professors come from) but it's not bad to have some grasp of such things for overall worldbuilding!

Though actually, when it comes to governance the Wizards seem to be a good bit /ahead/ of the Muggles. At the very least magical Britain got a Minister of Magic a few decades before the office of Prime Minister was established for Muggles, and in the Americas the Wizards set up a Congress and called themselves 'the United States' almost 100 years before 1776. So while I don't know that they'd necessarily have upheaval (not getting involved in as many wars and being better able to protect and grow crops eliminates a lot of problems on that front) if they had gone through it the logic of canon dictates they'd have gone through it in the early to mid 1800s.

I do appreciate the folklore points though, thank you very much!

** What do you plan on having Grindlewald do in your fic, history wise, like did he originate from Germany like wizard hitler or what is going on there. Cause if he did then that could explain a lot.

You could have Germany reform itself as a republic after loosing the war, and have the militarily weaker Alpine Union declare neutrality in the war. And as the alps are a pain to attack Germany respects this. Have Magic Britan take too long to enter the war and attempt to apease Germany. You can have the magically seperate Italy not give a shit about Mussolini and not get involved. These conditions can help explain why the French Magic Empire has animosity for the mentioned nations as their leader is long lived and holds a massive grudge for having to bear the brunt of the war with Magic Germany.

If you are really feeling it you can have Magic Germany be in the preccess of reconstruction after Grindlewald and be controlled occupied by the MUSA and Magic Russia, but that may be mixing metaphors as [[/u/Mythopoeist][u/Mythopoeist]] mentioned Russia could be going through their revolution.

You could have Magic France be greatful to MUSA and try to emulate their system a bit but idk on that one .

One thing you should totally include if you are going to include Venice is Genoa. They had a historic rivalry as trade citys. Genoa was a city that was pretty involved in early book printing, so you could have it be a bit of acity of scolars, while Venice is a city of trade.

Another Magic France idea is to have the Pheonix Queen date back to Napoleon and have him be her thral, but idk on that one.

*** Hmm...that's not a terrible idea, in all honesty. Some parts of it probably wouldn't work (given Grindelwald's plan to bring magic out into the open and conquer all Muggles it's hard to imagine staying neutral in a war like that, and particularly remaining in good standing after doing so) but it's not a bad framework overall.

Truth be told I don't have a /ton/ of plans with Grindelwald, beyond his shadow still looming large over Durmstrang and having resulted in some changes to curriculum but it might be wise to hash some stuff out, since the fic will be centered in his old seat of power. Thank you for reminding me to do that.

Don't think I'm going to do a Cold War style split of Magical Germany though. MUSA's probably not got much of a presence in Europe, I think they're dealing with their own shit.

Genoa is a good point to raise though, thank you!

My current lore for the setting is that the Phoenix Queen is /probably/ Joan of Arc, rescued and turned at her execution. Nobody's entirely sure, cause she doesn't like to talk about who she was before she was turned, and of course she's always covered up when she's out in daylight (so back when there were people alive who definitely knew what Joan looked like), but the French and the Alpine Empires were at war over territory, and the French Wizard King told his advisors to find him and advantage. His chief vampire disappeared for a few months, and came back with the woman who'd become the Phoenix Queen, who innovated Wizarding warfare with some Muggle techniques and began to claim victory for France, necessitating the Alpine/Germany alliance as France began to expand into Switzerland.

Which doesn't necessarily preclude her from making Napoleon her thrall I concede, I'll have to think on that.

  Grindlewald do in your fic, history wise, like did he originate from Germany like wizard hitler
#+end_quote

Hitler wasn't from Germany. He was from Austria. He migrated to Germany at the age of 24.\\
Given that Nurmengard is in Austria too, I am pretty sure they will go the route that Grindelwald was also from Austria.

***** Yeah, many people don't know that. He grew up in Upperaustria and lived many years in Vienna. He hadn't much success in Vienna, so he fled to Germany because he had depts (he was a struggling artist) and didn't want to do the military service.

** Magical Poland is Vastly open place, There is no such place like one "Shopping District" for a country but in every city you have a magical marketplace. Contrary to Muggle Poland MRP (Magiczna Rzeczpospolita Polska/Republic of Magic Poland) is very progressive country, our people don't discriminate those of lesser blood. Our country is Homeland of House Elves, Boggarts (But they're rarely seen in magical households now.) Our People even discovered the race of Ignises in Ostrzyca (One of Dormant Vulcanos in our Country)

This is how i imagine my country in magical world : D

** Being a Czech, I have two comments:

1. Unfortunately you missed the oldest (although small) magical school of all, which has been at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeč]]) since forever (perhaps even in the Celtic times), but which was hidden in the first half of the tenth century (soon after 936, when its great patron Saint Wenceslaus died; IRL, according to the Muggle archaeologists this one of the most important seats of power in Bohemia was suddenly abandoned, in reality it was hidden by magic from Muggles). There is a community of Czech fanfiction writers at [[http://budec.net]] who wrote stories about the school (in Czech; I am now rewriting my own story to English).

2. It is possible that the situation among magical nations is hugely different from the Muggle ones. So, no Germans are not the biggest magical nation of Europe, because it was thoroughly decimated during [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War][the Thirty-year war]], which was (even on the Muggle side) by far the worst disaster which happened ever in the Central Europe, much worse than that funny skirmish called The Second World War. In some areas around 60 % of population was lost (not only directly killed in the war, but also due to epidemics, starvation, and emigration). So, yes, there is now German Magical school in the Harz Mountains, but it was re-established only in the eighteenth century with the assistance of all neighbouring magical nations. And yes, Nurmengard castle (forget the nonsense in the second FBWFT film) is at the closest mountains to Nürnberg, i.e., the German side of Böhmerwald.

*** For your first point, that is a very good thing to point out, thank you! That could be a fun bit of lore. If it's small, it might be best served as an academy for some sort of post graduation training, but a local school that only serves Czech Wizards isn't a bad idea either.

For the second one, by and large I think Wizards would probably be unaffected by Muggle wars. Not saying nobody died, particularly as Muggle weaponry got more dangerous, but I think Wizarding Germany would be largely unaffected by the Thirty-Year War. And for some coherence and loyalty to canon I will largely be sticking to the three schools of the Triwizard Tournament (I know Rowling's argued that there's a lot of homeschool and small, unregulated schools but that...doesn't make sense to me really, and its not in the books, so I'm ignoring it)

Don't worry though, I /will/ be ignoring literally all of the second Fantastic Beasts, lol.

**** Given how small the Czech nation is (just some two thousand magicals total), I think the school would collect students even from the neighbouring nations ... certainly Slovaks, perhaps also Hungarians, not sure about Poles; Austrians go to the German school.

Given the small size of the Czech magical nation, I think that for example the only magical hospital would be inside of the school. Also, I imagine that European magical hospital cooperate and each of them specializes in some part of medicine (each of them has also a general practice for smaller cases), the Czech hospital was focused on paediatric (including cases of Obscurials and tortured magical children from the countries of the third nations, see more [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m1he2g/the_statute_of_secrecy_is_still_valid_for_the/gqdv4rc/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][elsewhere]]).

** Your Alpine Union seems to be geographicaly similar to the Holy Roman Empire. You may just wanna go with that and give them an Emperor who claims an unbroken line of succession and the blood of Charlemagne and yeah, they lost the northern Germanic Principalities and some of the Italian City States. But they still are crowned by the Pope and send their kids to local Cyprian Monastery Wizarding Schools and Justinian Convent Schools for Young Witches. The Order of St. Bosco has tried to open schools with mixed genders and with both a magical and mundane experience but most view them with suspicion as they have roots in the Grindalwald movement. Then if a child is truly dedicated to further education they are sent to one of the collegio in the Vatican, Geneva, Münich, or Salzburg.

*** I get where you're coming from, but that's not quite right. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire#/media/File:HRR.gif][This]] here shows that the Holy Roman Empire, even at it's smallest, was a good deal bigger than the Alpine Union was back when it was the Alpine Empire. At it's biggest the Alpine Empire's borders only extended 70 Kilometers from the base of the Alps in any given direction.

Yes, at various points in time large portions and for a while even most of the Alpine Union's land fell under the control of the HRE on the Muggle side of things, but they were never the majority of the Empire. Maybe a third at most.

And while I /do/ appreciate the effort you put into my post, I'm afraid I'm definitely not going with a 'the Catholic Church was actually super supportive of a kingdom of witches and wizards during the Middle Ages' route.
