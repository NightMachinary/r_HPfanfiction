It's my first time, so be gentle...

Summary: "The Shrieking Shack, Makers of Fine Wands for 198,962 years. Whether the sign was lying meant very little. The Wandmaker was a master of his craft." Set millenia after the original series, an immortal Harry doesn't fancy conquering the world, or being a recluse. No, he's a wandmaker. Oneshot.

** The only criticism I have is that there were some instances of two people speaking in the same paragraph, so those should be broken up to prevent confusion.

Other than that it's a good one shot, and I really enjoyed the world building you added about the behemoth dragons.

** That was really interesting. Are the behemoths a reference to those alpha dragons from how to train your dragon 2? It's alli could picture.

** Holy shit, this is your first try?

This is awesome!

I'm a huge fan of the ancient and powerful character running a shop trope, and this checks all the boxes for me!

I really look forward to any additions to the story, or any other stories you put out! Fantastic job!

** Really nice, like just the right amount of exposition to get me interested about the world, but not so much it gets me bored. The character interactions were also really nice, keeps me wondering about what exactly happened to Harry

** I like the story, excited to see how this develops. Kinda rare to find a MoD Harry that isn't some sort of super warrior out conquering the galaxy or something. Very interested to see something along the lines of !Wandmaker Harry that is a little more relaxed.
