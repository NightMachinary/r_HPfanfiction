What are some tropes and cliches that seem to be everywhere, but nobody ever seems to complain about. I don't mean major pillars of the series, but things that it seems like a lot of authors add in.


** Luna's hidden value is discovered, but old habits die hard. "Loo--Luna," they say, catching themselves at the last moment, as though her given name and its diminutive did not lead with phonetically identical syllables.

An adult (one of Hermione's parents, perhaps, or a sympathetic professor) silently reflects that something about Harry makes him seem so much older than his age; it's probably the look in his eyes. His suffering is immeasurable! Their very heart breaks.

Daphne Greengrass has no relevance to plot or bit role better filled by someone with greater canon presence; is shoehorned in anyway.

Ron fucks up romantically; this contrasts Harry's instinctive relationship expertise and general chivalry.

Harry, plaintive, reflects on the loss of "Lupin, Tonks, Fred, Colin, and /so many others/"; is incapable of naming a single other casualty of the final battle.

Hermione's favorite novel is /Pride and Prejudice/; is also a repressed romantic waiting for some gallant to carry her off into the sunset.

A prescient house-elf implies romantic relationship between still-oblivious romantic leads whose only roadblock to true love is another ten chapters of angst.

**** I think that Hermione, if she /did/ have a "favorite novel", it would be /Jane Eyre/, if only because it requires the woman (Jane) to "rescue" the man (Rochester) at the end of the book. Jane also shares some traits that would resonate with Hermione, such as valuing education and learning; being brave and courageous; and having "plain" looks.

Hermione's favourite book, like [[/u/Obversa]] said, to be Jane Eyre for the reasons he/she said; post-War Harry's is probably something like Slaughterhouse-Five because of the similarities between himself and the protagonist of that book; and Ron probably doesn't understand muggle fiction, but if he did, he'd probably like some absurdist humour like Catch-22.

The problem is, some pairings are much more infamous than others, for various reasons. H/Hr is one of them, because many of these fics are accompanied by manipulative Dumbledore, Weasley bashing, OTP preaching ("Harry and Hermione were obviously meant to be, and anyone who denies this fact is delusional"), and so forth.

Some other pairings that are often condemned are slash fics, especially Harry/Snape and Harry/Malfoy. On top of my head, Harem, D/Hr, and SS/Hr have a bad rep for being generally of lesser quality. Finally, there are the fucked up pairings (I've read a Dumbledore/Harry one once) that either result in general disgust or general lulz.

******* Of course, there are a few well-written H/Hr stories. My point was that /Harmonians/ (the militant H/Hr shippers) don't produce those good H/Hr stories. Often, they've got too much resentment from previous fan-wars, that they seem to have a need to /prove/ why H/Hr is the best pairing. And when authors try to do that, they almost always take down the Weasleys, which I've never seen done well until now.

** 'Draco Lucius Malfoy'. I could be wrong, as my memory isn't as great as some, but I don't think Draco had a middle name in canon. Yet authors do this all the time (often accompanied by 'Lucius Abraxas Malfoy') and nobody seems to mind. I don't mind, per se, but a little creativity on that front would be nice to see occasionally.

Or he could just not have a middle name. Not everyone does, and they aren't sitting around mourning the lack.

Only other one I can think of offhand is using the film versions of appearances, costumes, etc. I don't recall seeing anyone complain about it when Lucius is mentioned to have a cane, or Hogwarts ties are mentioned. Of course, I might just not have noticed people complaining....

I vaguely recall an interview where he said he was disappointed with their sketches of the pinstripe suit costume and made all of those suggestions because, you know, he got to play a /wizard/ - why shouldn't he?

Maybe someone with access to the books can confirm this stuff for us. :) I'm only 70-ish% sure of the Draco thing, but since I can't check right now, you could totally be right and I just need to sit in my corner for a while. ;)
