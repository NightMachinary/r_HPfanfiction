I just saw a thread on [[/r/harrypotter]] and wondered why I never have seen any fanfic-author think of that.

It could be awesome.


** That would be so cute! He wouldn't fit in any of the desks! He's so tall that the kids would have a hard time keeping him from copying their papers. He's a student, so would he be eligible for the Quidditch team? Make him a Keeper--he could block the whole goal!

** I'm a little confused as to what would be so awesome about it?

I mean, I like Hagrid, but he's like sixty years old... him studying alongside thirteen-year-olds seems more awkward than anything else. Am i missing something here?

*** Hagrid is a character with loads of comedic potential there. He could add some surrealness to the students which can make for funny moments (for example, in potions class) but he can also be a "rational one" who can handle things that are too big for the students or at least help.

For example, imagine the whole "Sirius Black / Lupin / Snape"-Scene at the end of PoA with Hagrid interfering.

Or Lupin telling about all the dark creatures in Defence, and Hagrid pointing out how friendly they are when you feed them right.

There is potential, as long as you don't drag it out too much.

** I would love to read a fic like that, it has a lot of potential but it would have to be done by someone who could write Hagrid's speaking pattern.

And Hagrid could actually help Harry, Hermione and Ron capture Scabbers aka Peter. That could be interesting, having Sirius potentially be freed after Peter is captured could lead to a bunch of different things.

And then even afterwards Hagrid could help out with Harry with Umbridge and stuff like that if the author wanted to go even further with the plot. I could definitely see a lot of potential.

** Personally I would not find the situation funny or even remotely feasible. Besides the fact that I think it was Hagrids 5th year that he got expelled, I think that all his experience and his focussed knowledge would allow him a definite instant OWL graduation if not specialized NEWT graduation.

Possibly if someone wrote it well, I would find a crack fic funny but usually I find those just stupid instead of humorous.

*** I believe it was Tom Riddle's fifth year, Hagrid's third.
