** *Voldemort and the Toms*

.

From behind the bushes, Voldemort gave a high, cold laugh and rubbed his snaky, long-fingered hands together. "The Horcruxes have done their job well," he murmured. "They have sown the seeds of dissent among the Undesirables. Soon they will be too busy fighting amongst themselves to stand against me!"

Voldemort's laughter was interrupted by a dismissive snort.

"You mean /us,"/ said the man at his side. Barely even a man at that---he was young, with glinting dark eyes and wavy hair that fell over his elegantly arched brows in a boyish fashion. /"We're/ the ones doing all the work."

"No," said Voldemort, his slit-like nostrils flaring. "I meant what I said."

"I thought this was a collaboration," remarked the man sitting behind the both of them, twirling a silver chain between his fingers. "That's why we're all in this, isn't it?"

/"We/ are not anything!" hissed Voldemort. "You are me! I am you! There is no /us!"/

"Eurgh," said the first man, "get a load of this guy."

"I know," said the other. "I can't believe we're related."

"We are not related---" Voldemort sputtered.

"He thinks he's our dad or something."

"Cease this!"

"Albania did him no good, you'd think he'd have come out with a tan, at least..."

"Are you even listening to me? Get back to work!"

"To be fair, we never visited the seaside for the sunbathing, either..."

Voldemort scowled. His elaborate plan involved using his Horcruxes to create chaos in the enemy ranks, but now it seemed more and more like a terrible idea.

** Fanon Dumbledore: I must manipulate Harry to become a warrior for the Greater Good, my boy!

Canon Dumbledore: ... Albus, do you learn nothing from Gellert and Arianna?

Fanon Dumbledore: But, Tom Riddle...

Canon Dumbledore: If I may... It is clear that we are nothing alike. For instance, I like to think that I learn from my mistakes. While you are doomed to repeat the mistakes of my younger and misguided self.

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

** linkffn(Ho Mione Grunger & the TOTALLY Original Plotline); Satire of OC!Hermione

linkffn(Potter Ever After); That but with tropes.

linkffn(Dimension Hopping for Beginners); Pre-DH, a variety of tropes meandered through, Canon!Harry isn't the main character, but he is there.

A lot of dimension travel fics can also fit this general mold, as one of them has to exist as a default case for us to compare with.

  Between marriage contracts, soul bonds, angry fathers, wandering eyes, backstabbing women, and defiant house elves, Harry has a feeling that 'True Love' isn't in the cards for him in this story. Which is just fine by him, as it turns out. A depressing walkthrough of the current state of HP Fanfiction.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
