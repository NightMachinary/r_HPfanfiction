** English isn't my first language and I suck at writing. Furthermore this is just my oppinion.

I couldn't finish it.

You cram to many things into a sentence.

** Beginning in media res with completely OOC characters.. kind of jarring. My reaction to the first chapter: "what the fuck did I just read?"

*** OOC characters can be done well if you plan it out and highlight the differences between fanon and canon. This seems to be not like that. I actually was really confused reading this to be honest. Unfortunately this isn't the good sort of confused where I want to come back to read more, this was me being completely put off the fic.

** I'm not an expert writer, so I don't know how to give good constructive criticism. As a reader, I found your first chapter bewildering - the sentences are long, the paragraphs are immense, and there's just too much action going on and too much extra-canonical information assumed from the get-go.

I did like your use of unusual vocabulary.

** I actually like your writing style for the most part. There are a few instances of clauses /too/ disparate being stuck together, like at the beginning when Harry casts that Lumos, but otherwise it's well done. It almost reminds me of the late great Terry Pratchett.

One negative from me: Ron. I hate Ron bashing and I like stories that treat him well, but he's /too/ different. He's not just smart - which I was looking forward to - he's overly pretentious in his speech, like a well-read gentlemen of another century writing a letter. He's 13, and even if he's smarter than Hermione and it's being exaggerated for comedic effect, it's still too much for a preteen/teenager.
