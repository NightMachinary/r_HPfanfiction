So I saw a post about Molly Weasley somewhere that I can't find now but it got me thinking. The scene in book 5 where Sirius and Molly are arguing and Molly says Harry as good as a son and who else has he got.

That shit just so wrong to me and I don't think Harry would take it well. I mean Harry's very protective of his parents memory, she basically elected herself as his mum and just before that she talks about being overuled like she has a say in anything reguarding Harry

Then when Sirus says Harry got him to look out for him she throws his time Azkaban in his face.

What Molly says is just really fucked up. Is there any stories where Harry rips into Molly for that and what do you think about that scene?

I think Molly is the only Weasley I don't like.


** Insert generic Molly bashing fic here.

If you want a specific story, I typed "Molly Bashing fanfic Ootp" and got this as one of the first results

Quick glance through shows that it features the exact conversation you were talking about at the chapter I linked and people telling her off for it.
