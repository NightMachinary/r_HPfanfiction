** Very much so.

I think this happened for the fic (the venom peddler) where I was honestly enjoying it quite a bit. Though I dont remember it well now.

Basically the author just skipped all of fourth year because they didnt want to write it which was fair but the way they did it made me drop the entire fic.

** This happened to me. The fic was A Second Chance and, on paper and to start with, was primarily about Sirius getting freed early from Azkaban and rebuilding his life, which included reuniting with Remus, adopting Harry, and all that jazz. And Sirius is one of my favorite characters so this seemed right up my alley. He even gets engaged to an OC eventually. Good stuff, things are looking up for my man here.

But then stations of the canon happened and he /still/ fell through the damn veil.

To be clear, this was more a "last straw" kind of situation -- the rest of the fic is quite sexually explicit despite not being labeled as a smut fic, enough to be rather off-putting if you're not expecting it. (And I mean this in both a sexytimes way and a sexual violence way.) But that was the moment I dropped it for good.

*** I had to drop it for the explicit smut too, which was sad because I quite enjoyed it before it went off the deep end. Like, you want to have sex between two consenting adults? Cool! But two twelve year olds? Sure, it happens, but nah, fam. No thanks. Not about that. I felt icky even thinking about reading it.

*** One of the things most strongly guaranteed to get me to drop a fic is if it forces its way back to the stations of canon despite circumstances being so wildly different that those events should happen totally differently and/or not at all.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** HPMOR was one of the first fanfics I ever read, and I really loved it... at first. Then the tone and premise kept shifting further and further away from what I'd originally enjoyed, to the point that I felt bait-and-switched.

There was a Naruto fic ("People Lie") from Less Wrong's Favorites list on ffnet that I also initially liked, only for it to suddenly veer from "dark (and occasionally darkly comedic) story about a traumatized borderline-sociopath Naruto" to "Naruto is a master vampire powered by the fox that's actually an eldritch horror".

Bait-and-switch is definitely one of my biggest pet peeves, along with obnoxious forced visits to the stations of canon (getting well into a fic that's wildly AU only for Sirius to still fall through the Veil is disgustingly common), divergences that are complete /non sequiturs,/ and killing off certain characters (especially Neville or Luna).
