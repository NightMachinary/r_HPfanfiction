...the Flamels make a new one (it's not like an alchemist wouldn't keep notes of his creations, right? And if they go into hiding then Voldemort wouldn't be the wiser and wouldn't chase them!), but thank Harry for his efforts (Who would be a better teacher than someone who has lived for centuries and has seen so much?)

Note: No Slash - and only truly well writen Harry/Ginny or Harry/Hermione!

So, stage is yours!

Thanks in advance!

Greetings LAX


** linkffn(The Philosopher's Red Herring) has a fake Stone (by the way, I recommend you get to calling it Philosopher's Stone or you'll piss off some people on this sub); no pairings have solidifed yet, though going by White Squirrel's previous stories it probably will either be Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny or Harry/Luna.

The debatably good (the writing and worldbuilding are top-notch but the characterizations are terrible) linkffn(The Voyage of Starship Hedwig) has Flamel as a rather unlikable character; we also learn he put the Stone inside his body permanently instead of destroying it. I can't remember the pairings.

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Sympathy of Souls) shows that the Stone was a cover-up all along for another method to immortality. It unfortunately turns into Voldemort/Harry slash in the last chapter, but please, don't let that discourage you; it's nowhere in the earlier chapters and can easily be screened out, and the writing is otherwise pretty good. /Very/ interesting worldbuilding.

*** Why? A philosopher for me is some person debating stuff like the meaning of life and not an alchemist!

Still, thanks for the recommendations, I will give them a read!

Ahem. Crash course on alchemical history... in real life, the Philosopher's Stone was so named because alchemists were both mystics and scientists. They saw philosophical symbolism in the workings of matter, thinking God had created it that way on purpose. For them, the Philosopher's Stone could only be achieved by one who not only knew the recipe but had the required spiritual understanding of the workings of the universe. Hence philosopher.

Either way, the point of using it in a HP context is that "Philosopher's Stone" is an established legend, which it makes sense for Rowling to have used, whereas the replacement term "Sorcerer's Stone" cooked up by the American editor was pulled out of a hat and has no real-life connections behind it.

**** You could easly have avoided the "or..." and simply put "or the Flamels make another on" in the title itself. I don't think it's egregious, but some people would say click-bait in the sense that people might click on the link just to see the end of the sentence when they wouldn't have bothered otheriwse.

***** Ok, that wasn't my intention (kind of strange to see it that way, too!) - I just wanted to shorten the title!

I'll keep that in mind for the future however!
