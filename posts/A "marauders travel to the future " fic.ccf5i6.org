I would really appreciate if someone would link me some fics in which the marauders are traveling to the future, and not the other way around (Harry or co being cast into the past). Without any romance or very little if possible, as i am more interested to see the reaction of the young parents to their so famous son . I dont mind if the future is "Harry married and with kids", but i really would like the Hogwarts era to be the time they're thrown into. If any of you have read anything like this please let me know .


** There's misplaced moony by shayalonnie, bit it hasn't been updated in quite awhile and she is currently working on other things. She swears it's not abandoned, and I really hope she starts working on it again. Moony gets transported to the future.
