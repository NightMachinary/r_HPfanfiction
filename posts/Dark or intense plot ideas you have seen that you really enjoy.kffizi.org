I really like it when they go into a person's psyche, growing past hardships, realizing things were messed up/moving past them, etc.

Nothing like rape or anything like that.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc

NO Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion, etc.

Self promotion is fine as long as it fits.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26917306][Our Minds Work in Mysterious Ways (But We Like It Like That) by InsomniacAndBi]] by InsomniacAndBi is my favorite psychological thriller. It's painful, messed up, and beautiful.

Edit: There is no rape, but there are a lot of murders. I'm not sure if that counts as too much...

*** I just didn't want rape, that's fine (well not fine, but you hopefully know what I mean, lol). Thanks.
