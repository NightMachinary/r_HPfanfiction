I like reading fanfiction, set during any time period, chronicling the Slytherin dynamic during times of war or stressful times.

Can anyone point me to any of those? :)

** linkffn(A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles by Rannaro)

Ably describes Snape's school years, though it skims around the rivalry with the Marauders and of course glosses over his worse aspects. Much like canon, the bias is towards the viewpoint/primary character.

#+begin_quote
  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** linkffn(7936530;9042939)

The protagonists in As Black As Night are pretty much all in Slytherin. The first book is complete but the sequel: The Brightest Star, seems to be abandoned - which is a real shame because it was going to be a trilogy.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

  Sequel to 'As Black As Night'. One night can change a life. One night can change the world. One night can change everything. Forever. But as long as the stars are in the heavens, the House of Black can weather any hell. Rated M.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327575][Devilish Delights, Wicked Ends]]! It's a next gen fic, about a rivalry between Hogwarts powers. It's a little confusing and verbose at first, but very very worth it. Legit moral ambiguity and a complex ensemble. It's arguably much more about the effects of what the protagonists are doing rather than the protagonists themselves. The last chapters are going up soon.

** Hogwarts 1835 focuses on the students in Slytherin (you did say any time period). There is more Slytherin in Hogwarts 1940 than any of the other houses, although the village of Hogsmeade and war evacuees receive more attention than the school.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
