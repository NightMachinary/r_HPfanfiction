This has been on my mind lately. The word itself, "review," is a bit of a misnomer on FF.net. It's more like "comment" - that is, people use reviews for any number of things, only some of which are actual reviews (that is, critical commentary and analysis regarding the quality of a story).

So, FF.net readers, what do you use the "Review" feature for?

- To speculate on upcoming plot points?
- To point out mistakes, or things you disagree with?
- To encourage the writer of a story to keep going?
- To voice enthusiasm for certain plot points?

A sub-topic: Mobile devices have made reviewing a bit less easy to do. Does this affect how/when/why you leave reviews?

A second sub-topic: For those of you who leave reviews sometimes and not others, what are some factors that contribute to your decision?


** I always review fics I've completed for two reasons.

One - I like telling an author what I thought about their fic.

Two - And the primary reason why I review is that it's a visual reminder that I have read the story. If I ever wonder if I've read a fic or not, I always check the reviews for the last chapter. If I have a review there, I've read it. If not, I either haven't read the fic or didn't finish it.

** I regularly leave reviews and try to offer constructive criticism. For me, the review option is one of the best parts of writing fanfics. I try to cover points like characterisation, plot holes, maybe a grammar or spelling mistake if it stands out (though not often).

I always try to be respectful, and if I mention something negative I'll (most of the time) make sure to also mention a positive aspect. In my opinion fanfiction are a great way to try out and improve ones writing skills and many writers are very young - I don't want to discourage anyone from writing with an overly negative review. Of course if there's nothing positive to say.. well... then I either won't review or - if criticism is welcome - tell them how I think they could improve the story.

I hardly ever speculate on upcoming plot points.

If I disagree with a character's action or the plot I'll mention it and explain why.

I often mention that I'd like to read more, but it's never the full review.

I do voice enthusiasm for certain plot points or, if the author switches POV, tell them which one I enjoyed the most and would like to read more about.

I never review when I'm on my mobile phone. And I never get back to the stories I finished on there. So yes, definitely affects it.

I'll certainly leave a review if a story is very interesting, surprising, thrilling or when it pisses me off completely - so when strong emotions are involved.

I'm less likely to leave reviews when I don't like the author (because of annoying author notes or whatever) or when I left a detailed review for a story asking a question and don't get an answer. If the author ignores my reviews I don't really see a reason to write more.

Since I started reading fanfiction, leaving reviews and sometimes discussing stories with authors, I noticed that when I read a book and something - mostly character development - is handled badly and doesn't make sense to me, I automatically think about writing a review. Then I remember that I can't.

I have a question for authors: Do you answer reviews? Each one? The ones that asked questions? Why? Why not?

*** I answer my reviews. I make an authors note to thank everyone for their reviews before each chapter. Like I put "special thanks to x, y, z for the reviews!" I just think it's polite. If it's an amazing review I thank them through PM and I always answer if there was a question. I don't want to be rude to my readers and I like discussing my fic with them. When it's criticism I PM too, thanking them for letting me know and if it's something other than grammar asking what they would suggest. I don't get too much of that though. I do have one reader who PMs me his review and he's very detailed in what he likes. He also will ask me questions and every once in a while tell me something he doesn't like. Like he once PMed me that I was incorrect in historical accuracy with pagan celebrations. (He's a HS History teacher in France) Anyways, I always answer him. If someone PMs I always answer no matter what.

  I have a question for authors: Do you answer reviews? Each one? The ones that asked questions? Why? Why not?
#+end_quote

Generally, I'll answer reviews that are answerable. That means I'll answer reviews that:

- Ask for clarification of a plot point (that's supposed to be explicit and not ambiguous).
- Point out what they see as weaknesses or elements that could be improved.
- Suggest that a certain plot point happen in the future.

On the other hand, I don't usually have a response for reviews that:

- Ask questions that, if answered, would include spoilers to chapters I haven't written yet.
- Express general enthusiasm for the story and a desire for it to update soon.
- Speculate on future events.

It's not that I don't appreciate or read the second kind of reviews, I just don't have anything to say to them. Although I will occasionally respond to positive reviews that are very detailed or well-thought out with a "really appreciate you taking the time to write this, thanks," because as someone who's left a fair number of reviews, I know that it does take time/energy to marshal your random thoughts about a fic into something articulate and meaningful.

  To encourage the writer of a story to keep going?
#+end_quote

Basically this. Anyone can leave a scathing review that leaves the author feeling awful about having written anything at all, but that doesn't encourage the writer to do any better in the future. If there's clearly room for improvement I'll make sure to sandwich it between praise for two different things.

My favourite fics are character driven, not further explorations of the already established universe. If the characters are well done, I make sure to tell the author why I think so and to compliment them on a job well done.

Edit: There is an exception, though: if a story is inappropriately tagged (e.g. HG/SS but it's clearly a canon relationship story), then I'll raise hell.

** I hardly ever leave reviews. I've left maybe 4, 5 reviews for fics that aren't currently WIP's.

A large part of that is how I read fanfics, which come in basically two formats - either offline, on my kindle, or online on a smartphone. I even have a folder in my kindle called "To Review" for ones that I think deserve it, but I still haven't done it for anything on that list - even amazing one's like The Son of Sun's Trilogy - simply because once they're over and done, or abandoned for many years, I feel like there's little that will come of it, that it's unnecessary on some level. Besides, I don't really consider comments enough, really, and the effort of writing a proper review is something I normally lack motivation for.

It's a different case when they're a WIP, or the writers are around (as on DLP). Then, I make sure to leave a review of decent length, but it's different when they've been gone for years, or the story's complete. Especially because in many cases I read library threads alongside, and it feels like most of the salient points have already been covered.

That that sort dominates my reviewing is largely just because that's 90% of what I read - I'm relatively new to the fandom, and nowhere near exhausted all the good old fics in it.

Definitely, though, it's a combination of giving feedback for mistakes or issues I've found, whilst also saying what I particularly liked/found appealing (in what I hope is an encouraging way). Normally those are on the side of considerable issues, rather than line-by-line checking, though I have done that from time to time. I've never found the need to speculate on plot points both in or out of fanfiction, though.

** I leave reviews as actual reviews. I generally don't until I'm done reading the entire thing, that way I can judge the whole thing. How I felt about it, what I enjoyed, rarely some criticism (usually isn't necessary, and usually over something minor like a contradiction or plot hole), and encouragement. But without spoilers if at all possible.

The problem is, I can't go to the reviews on almost any story to see if it's worth reading. It can have hundreds of reviews, but all I want to see is if people think it's well written, or in the case of something 100k words and not updated in a year, whether it's just not marked as complete or if it was abandoned.

Nope, it's gonna be a full page of "oh my god [major character] was [killed/pregnant/in love]?!" Or it'll be a page of "when are you going to update its been twenty years already" on something recently updated.

I read solely on mobile, so when I leave a review I'm really going out of my way, so it will almost always be a very positive and glowing review. So it's gotta be great. That's why I love kudos on ao3.

** To concretize my opinions on someone else's work, thus making those opinions stick in my own head when I'm editing my stuff. I do this in the format of a semi-formal review. These are usually detailed, at least on the points I focus on, and provide suggestions and style standards.

All the possible "help" that might provide them is my distant secondary motivation, the vast majority of the time. I'm a semi-pro writer myself but most fanfic writers don't want to hear how not to use semicolons in their work, or how the term "paparazzi" is a acronym in 1956.

And sometimes I'll review when the author really cocks something up and I can't even, except to review it while laughing. I think I used the phrase "violently sexy and wrong, like a trainwreck full of catgirls" once.

** When I browse stories on FictionPress.com or FanFiction.net, I always browse by number of reviews. Before I look at the story title, before I look at the number of chapters, before I look at the summary, before I look at whether it's completed or not, I *always* go by the number of reviews. If a story has 30 or more reviews, I'll read the summary, and if the summary sounds interesting, then I'll check to see if the story has 4 or more chapters. If all of those requirements are met, then I read the story.

Having said that, other than feedback, the only real reason I review stories is because I know that there are possibly other people out there who base what they read off of number of reviews, and if a story's really good, I feel I owe it to the author to give them that extra bump in review numbers.
