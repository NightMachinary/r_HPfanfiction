I was recently reading a Harry in slytherin, best friends with girl blaise zabini. But forgot to save the post and can't find it now. It had Sirius and Remus in a relationship and was set after the end of triwizard. But also look forward to the Harry like one written by Big D on a Diet.

I believe this is what you are looking for. Really enjoyed it actually.

*** Yup. That's the one. I still don't get how I lost it. Thanks. Now I can finish it before I go to bed.

**** I assume you pressed “hide” by mistake. The post you're looking for is right below yours. See if [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2uym9f/sarcastic_harry/][this]] does the trick.

***** The link works. Still getting used to new app. Never used this hide function. Don't know where to access it from.

****** Dunno about no app, but “hide” is right next to “save” and things happen to happen. I'm glad that you found your sarcastic Harry.
