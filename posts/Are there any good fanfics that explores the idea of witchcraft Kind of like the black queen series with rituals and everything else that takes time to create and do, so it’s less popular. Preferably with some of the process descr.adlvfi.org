#+TITLE: Are there any good fanfics that explores the idea of witchcraft? Kind of like the black queen series with rituals and everything else that takes time to create and do, so it’s less popular. Preferably with some of the process described.

I'm looking for the non wand, non instantaneous magic because I like the idea of most people ignoring the slow stuff in favor for instant gratification.


** Not sure about witchcraft per se, but linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) is a bit of fun and pretty short.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** In my story "Patron", both sides work on rituals to win the war. Learning enough to be able to create a ritual, then gather the ingredients, plot and test the ritual itself - lots of steps to take.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** linkffn(Harry Potter - The Curse of Undeath) Has some rituals and potions. Minor crossover with warhammer fantasy.

linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) has loads of blood magic rituals .

linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) had rune based self enchancement rituals.

In For Love Of Magic rituals might be strongly inspired by With Strength Of Steel Wings, but it was mostly shitty smut involving at least one minor.

linkffn(A Second Chance at Life) should involve many esoteric magics. I haven't read it but I have seen it recommended a lot

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
