It's a pet peeve that will turn me off from otherwise decent fics, and I've never been able to determine why people do it. Sometimes it will be consistent but still non-sensical, such as capitalizing the word Wand whenever it's used, other times it seems completely random.

So, someone please enlighten me on this strange habit some people have.


** I generally assume that at least some of them have English as a second language, depending on consistency. These days, there's also the possibility that they are using a mobile device and spellchecker has given me oddly capitalized words from time to time; I figure I'm not an isolated case.

And some people managed to retain the knowledge that important nouns are capitalized but missed the full explanation as to how, when, and why to do so.

*** The second language explanation makes a lot of sense, and I applaud anyone who writes a story in a language they aren't a native speaker of. I know German capitalizes nouns, and I'm sure there are other languages that do too, and it's very understandable that would carry over into English. Thanks!

*** Autocorrect is pain in a ass. Really it's the one and only reason why i do mistakes in messages and etc. In Polish and English (English is my second language.)

** I took German at GCSE and we were constantly reminded to capitalise all proper nouns, to the point were I would occasionally do it in English. The problem being that no spelling/grammar checker that I know of picks up on this, after all there's no way to tell the difference between "the Book", grammatical mistake, and "the Book", a very specific and important book.

** This is a common mistake for me when writing, and it seems to be a glitch (for lack of a better word.) in my muscle memory, because I'll be typing, look back at what I just wrote and realize I capitalized a word that didn't need to be. So I can't really give an actual reason beyond that.

** English was the third language I learned and the others both have words that need to be capitalized because rules. I guess I'm just used to capitalizing them.
