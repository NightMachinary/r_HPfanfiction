Seriously. In any sane world, you /cannot/ just /kidnap someone/ for writing a few embellished news articles about you! That's just sick, and crazy. It's not even about wanting to see Hermione have some consequences for once, it's about the plain over the top illegality of it. And I can't stand to see it stand. JK Rowling /GLOSSED/ that shit. So: Is there any fanfiction where someone reports her over it, trials her and charges her?

It could even be Draco! There's a perfect segway into such a fic in canon! Here:

#+begin_quote
  Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag. The door of the compartment slid open. "Very clever. Granger," said Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had ever seen them. "So," said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. "You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter's Dumbledore's favorite boy again. Big deal." His smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.
#+end_quote

There's /three/ fucking witnesses to attest to Hermione's kidnapping, right there. Plus Ron and Harry can be called to the stand as accomplices, or at least for keeping quiet.

So what if Draco decided to be a bit smarter, and decided to report this shit to the Ministry to get Hermione expelled and arrested? Hell, you could even use this as a perfect jumping point into one of those /Harry/Hermione/whoever is in Azkaban/ fics!


** Counterpoint: In any sane world, you cannot libel a fifteen year old girl without consequence. Especially if the results of said libel bring about bodily harm.

Determination: JKR's Wizarding World is not a sane world.

** Sure, but she can just as well claim that she's making a citizen's arrest of an illegal Animagus who's spying on private citizens using her form. I'm betting that Skeeter probably has a bunch of dirt on all of the most prominent people in their society, coz that's the kind of skeevy person she is, and I doubt that she'd have a whole lot of people who'd back her if her illegal use of her illegal Animagus form comes out, especially since not registering as an Animagus appears to be a criminal offence.

*** But on the other hand, you can't make a citizen's arrest and then tie them up and throw them in your car and take them home. That's what Hermione did. She caught Rita in the hospital, but she kept her around in the jar for like, what, a few days, and then she took her onto the train. So...yeah. That invalidates the arrest and just turns it into kidnapping.

While her staying out of prison after the war was laughable, kidnapping is generally a very serious crime.

** I mean, I agree that Hermione's bad actions get glossed over (attacking Ron for kissing Lavender, imprisoning Rita, etc.)....but it's pretty minor to the rest of the stuff JK glosses over in the course of the story.

1) Hagrid is in prison, briefly, for allegedly accidentally killing a student (and people still think he might have been guilty!)---and yet he works at Hogwarts.

2) Snape was literally part of the magical neo nazis and people know--and he works at Hogwarts!

3) Draco nearly kills a girl and lets in a bunch of killers, and serves no prison time.

4) Narcissa lives with Voldemort and is at least an accessory, and serves no prison time because she lies for Harry.

*** I think it's mostly because Hermione was heavily liked while we read the series, but as adults, we look back at her actions in disdain.

Hagrid bred a fire crab and a manticore (A class xxxxx creature!) and exposed them to children, along with leaving class xxxxx monsters in a forest next to a school. Hagrid probably deserves heavy prison time.

**** True. When I was younger, I didn't like Ron. Older me thinks he's one of the more realistic characters. I always find Harry insanely selfish in some ways despite being so selfless in others---Naricssa lived with Voldmort, knew full well what her husband was doing, knew that there were prisoners under her house (and it's heavily implied that Fenir is a rapist)---but hey, she deserves to get off because she lied and said Harry was dead? She doesn't deserve live in prison or anything, but some punishment was needed. There's been a couple of good fanfics which tackle the issue---I think one was where muggleborns, including Dennis Creevey and Hermione, basically become vigilantes of sorts and confront Harry at one point about how he didn't think about how others actions (like Narcissa) affected people but himself. Wish I could remember the title...it was abandoned.

Every year she does something wrong;setting her teacher on fire,drugging her classmates,the whole Scabbers thing,holding Rita captive,disfiguring Marietta,siccing the birds on Ron etc. People use these as examples of her "ruthlessness" but they really make her an unlikable self righteous harpy IMO

Incidentally, McGonagall gets upset at fake-Moody for transfiguring a student as punishment. Possibly because ferret-Malfoy could have been harmed with impunity?

***** Well, if you reread the scene fake-Moody doesn't just transfigured him, he THROWS him down the corridor. It stated in plain text during the scene that Malfoy was actually injured, but it was glossed over.

I think she got upset less because he was using Transfiguration as a punishment, and more because he could have literally killed a student. Like, I'm not sure if you realize just how fragile small animals are, especially ferrets. Their backs are incredibly easy to break because of how long they are.
