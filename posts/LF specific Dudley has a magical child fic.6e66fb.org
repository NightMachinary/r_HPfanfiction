Looking for a fic where Dudley's children were magic, and he needed Harry's help. Harry is married to Daphne Greengrass.

Harry isn't married to Daphne, but the story is really great. It shows how much Dudley has grown as a person, that childhood affected them both.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
