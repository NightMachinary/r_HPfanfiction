** The Resurrection Stone seems like a more candidate to be an Infinity Stone-type artifact, I'd say. In fact it probably wouldn't take too much of a stretch to make it the Soul Stone.

But either way, the Wizarding World is in trouble. Thanos is a whole different threat from what they're used to dealing with. About the only possibility to defeat him would be to hit him with Avada Kedavra and hope its instant kill effect works on big purple aliens, but you'd probably have to hit him directly- physical objects can block AK up to a point, and Thanos's armor (and for that matter his skin) is tougher than a tank. You'd also best take him by surprise (say from under an invisibility cloak), because otherwise he could use the Reality Stone to conjure physical barriers to block the curse.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...
