Hi there,

Avid HP fan here. I haven't read much Fanfic but I did read HP and the Psychic Serpent and Lost Generation.

I've noticed a lot of the Fanfic is located at m.fanfiction.net.

Is there no easier way to download the Fanfic as PDF? It's much easier and I can actually bookmark them on my phone?

*** Thanks. This actually worked quite well especially since I'm reading on my phone.

** There's also an app for fanfiction.net that'll download fics, if you'd rather use that.

** There is a calibre plugin. I use it to get them in .epub but I'm pretty sure .pdf is also available.

** [[https://pypi.org/project/FanFicFare/]] works for me just fine, and it is also available as a Calibre plugin, or as a webservice [[http://fanficfare.appspot.com/]]
