I did look for it online, but only found a link to livejournal, which would have been great except it kept telling me to log in, which I did, which then redirected me so I had search again, which meant I had to log in again... And that basically in a loop. It's HP/LV.

Please, help?


** I think I have it. The author label is May Marlow but from what I gather that's the same person. PM me your email and I'll send.
