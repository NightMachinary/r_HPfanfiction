** Because people assume that Wizards must have crazy wizard noble names. Like Andromeda. While that may be the case for some families people for some unknown reason try to make the Potters one of these familes, ignoring his father James and grandfather Charles...

**** Harrison is another name that just gets on my nerves. Ginevra is from an Arthurian legend like most of the Weasley names though. As for Draco and Andromeda, they're Blacks whose names come from constellations so they're the exception rather than the rule imo.

**** I think after Ginny was revealed as 'Ginevra', people realised that ALL of the Weasley children's names that they're referred to could just be shortened forms of 'magical'-sounding names.

*** FYI:

It is never stated in canon that Charles Potter is the father of James Potter. All we know of Charles is that he married Dorea Black, any other link between him and James is fan-speculation.

**** True, it still stands to reason that those names are the exception rather than the rule. Most of the other names in canon that are a bit odd are other people though so it stands to reason their names would be a bit odd.

** This is one of the things that will immediately cause me to stop reading a fic. I've seen [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6926581/1/Thanks-to-a-Snake][Thanks to a Snake]] recommended a few times, and tried to read it twice. Both times were far enough apart that I forgot why I never finished reading it. Once he decides to go by Hadrian I'm out of there.

** You're right in many ways, that people just don't think 'Harry' is cool enough. Most of the time his name is changed for no good reason. Sometimes, though, it's used as a distinction between old and new. There are plenty of valid names that could be used to signify a change of time or personality, though. Hadrian, Harrison, Harold, Henry, (I think I even saw /Harper/, once, which was odd)... They all kind of work as a lengthened form of Harry.

**** u/Frix:
#+begin_quote
  Harry can be a nickname for Harrison, Harold, and Henry
#+end_quote

"can be" but it's not. Harry is his real name and that's not short for anything.

***** Is that ever directly stated in canon? I'm pretty sure that Bill Weasley is never called anything but Bill, but nevertheless, I strongly suspect his full legal name is William.

****** The Marauders map shows a person's full name instead of nicknames or shortened versions. So Harry's name is indeed "Harry".

**** Aye, I can see why it's confusing. Perhaps Hadrian is often chosen because it means 'black'? (Or perhaps it means 'dark', not 'black'--it does tend to be seen more in darker fics.) Personally, I get more annoyed when I see Potter-Black as his surname in a fic--/that's/ something that makes me stop reading straight away.

Hadrian I can live with, but only because in my head I assume that that means he's crossed some kind of wall that seperates him from being 'just Harry' forever. There should always be a reason and explanation though--like having to forge a new identity so people don't know it's him (in the case of time-travel, dimension-travel (where there may be /two/ Harry's), and fics where he's moonlighting under a fake persona). Otherwise, there's just no reason for a name change.

I quite like the name Harry, personally. It sounds sensible.

/Edit:/ bad spelling

** My biggest problem with it is that the only person I've met named Hadrian in real life is super /lame/. I mean like totally lame. Bald at thirty, never had a girlfriend bowls player lame. He plays /bowls/ and he's less then 65 years old. Bowls.
