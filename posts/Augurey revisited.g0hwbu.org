I have [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cj5w7b/what_are_you_least_favorite_cliches_in_the_fandom/evbm3bb?context=3][voiced my opinion]] (and [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][on my blog]]) about my distaste for linkffn(The Augurey by La-Matrona).

However, I still cannot get rid of the basic premise of this story, because I truly believe this is so good idea. It is just such pity that the execution was so horrible. So, let me suggest this as a prompt for somebody to write it better (in the same manner the author of "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14078862][The Accidental Animagus]]" [[https://potterficweekly.com/archives/1813][admitted]] that it was based on the idea from "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183350][The Natural Animagus by wsbenge]]").

The start of the story could be exactly the same: The Trio in the Grimmauld Place found on the Black Family tapestry, that Bellatrix has a daughter with Tom Riddle. Then switch to the moment immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts and you can switch to search for the lost baby, which could make a foundation for a good plot (although not very long one). I could happily envision it as something similar to "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1857084][Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian]]": first large case of young Trainee Auror Harry Potter. This one could be probably even better than that one because you don't have to play in rather unrealistic hidden werewolf village, but in the real world with realistically crushed but bitter and hateful former Death Eaters and pureblood supremacists. And it is even more fun because the whole investigation is done amongst them, but they cannot have even a shadow of suspicion of who that lost girl truly is.

Then you can have the next part of taking care of an abused orphan, and Harry with his past would be very interested in caring for orphans (an idea which seems to be very underdeveloped, the only exception I can think of is "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/601124][Inner Demons by serendipity_50]]" and also the brilliant "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629][Dudley\'s Memories]]" and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6329597][Snape's Memories]]" by paganaidd). I generally don't care about the shipping of Harry in all this, I don't think it matters that much for the story, just if you want to break up Harry and Ginny, PLEASE, do a better job than the crazy author of this story.

Of course, the premise of the story is based on the idea that Tom Riddle could father a baby in the first place. Yes, I don't believe this story (and the Cursed Child, one of many disasters of that fanfiction story), that he would be capable of falling in love with anybody, and I have deep suspicion even about his ability to commit the deed. After all, he truly doesn't have the human body, what he has is the alchemist construct, created by two sexually rather inept most likely still virgins; I wonder whether his body truly has all bits in the right places. Much more appealing (or much disgusting, that's the same thing) would be if Delphini was either just by-product of some dark magic ritual (which would nicely lead to her being neglected and abandoned), or even intended object (produced by artificial insemination or its dark magical equivalent) of some ritual. What about the ultimate Horcrux created by sacrificing your own child? It would be an opportunity to create truly disgusting dark magic, which would eliminate all those jabbers about grey magic and acceptability of the Dark Magic.


** It seems like half your issue with the Augurey is that Harry and Ginny aren't together and willing to tell each other everything after a brief relationship. Mind you, I have my own character pairing preferences, but that story's main issue was the actual kidnapping, the Ginny stuff had no reason to be other than it was (whatever the pairing decision eventually was, it didn't matter), given the actual length of the relationship. I would like to read stories that give the premise a different go, however, so I'll keep an eye out.

I don't think Voldemort's body being capable of reproduction stretches believability any further than the creation of the body itself though. ü§î

*** That is absolutely not true. I can easily imagine accepting the Harmony ship, and I have read many Harmony stories and I have enjoyed them. And yes, there are some problems which happen [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][too often there]], but usually, the problems are not that severe. I give to Harmonians that true love should begin with friendship, or at least there is no true love without friendship. However, most of Harmony stories I have read suffer from at least three problems:

1. Excessive bashing, which is just immature and usually follows a poor or missing plot

2. The horrible separation between Harry and Ginny. I am not saying they must be together, and I understand that most high-school loves fall apart, but most of them are just poorly written.

3. Completely crazily perfect and so perfect, and even more perfect, Harry and Hermione. Even in otherwise rather good Harmony stories (e.g., linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities)), they are both so flawless and so perfect, that I want to tear my eyes out of my head because it is so hard to survive their perfectness. Did I mention that they are perfect?

**** Literally all these examples you're giving are the usual problems in fanfiction. This is not remotely more common in HHr than any other pairing or type of story in general (well, any other with a substantial amount of stories anyway). Draco x Hermione? Harry and Ron will be bashed. Hinny? Ginny will be portrayed as Harry's perfect partner. These story flaws come with the territory.

And in the case of the Ginny example, I don't really see the point here. The way that relationship played out in canon (post HBP) was beyond silly, no less than a bog standard, true love from high school sillyness (and in this case, based on a relationship that was what, a month old?) It wasn't written well, so I don't see the need to defend poorly written HHr any more than I expect those who like Hinny to defend the canon version or other poorly written versions of that ship

Really, the point of my post is I don't really see what a pairing critique really adds here. It can and does go every which way.

***** 1. When I say that I like Hinny stories (and no, I am not 100% selective about them, there are many other stories worthy of reading with all other ships, including Harmony), it is not to say that I defend for a second what JKR wrote (or rather not wrote) in the books. Did you for a second believe that JKR is capable writing anything romantic? No, she is not, she is complete rubbish in romantic scenes, or better she doesn't write them. I wrote about it [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][here]]. There is only one romantic scene in whole heptalogy and that's the complete disaster of a date between Harry and Cho in Hogsmeade. There is just nothing else. Etc., I wrote it in that blogpost.
2. I have my constant struggle with the essay [[https://angua9.livejournal.com/204545.html][‚ÄúWhat's So Funny 'Bout Peace, Love, and Understanding?‚Äù by angua9]]. After the first reading I just rejected it as over-the-top partisan gibberish. It was written during the worst parts of the Shipping Wars and it shows, and the picture of Harmonians is just grotesque. However, if you tone it down (like, 90% down), I found to my shock that some of his conclusions actually held true even against the evidence. Take linkffn(3867175) and linkffn(11916243), and I specifically am not picking some teeange-written trash, both of these are good stories, well written, I would say they are the best what I found in Harmonian stories. However, take a look at the story about the romantic relationship between Harry and Hermione. Well, actually there is no story, because there is no development. There are no conflicts between them, because they are just perfect together, did I say how perfect they are, oh, they are so perfect ... [me falls down snoring] ... the romantic part, the part they cared about a lot, so it is not an omission, is just absolutely horribly written. And before you say that shipping stories are such, let me present two examples from the Hinny world: writings by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] specifically for example linkao3(1857084) and linkao3(601124). Can you pick some differences between Harry and Ginny relationship in these stories and those two mentioned above (or almost any other Harmony story)? I am just rereading the scene in the ‚ÄúHunters‚Äù where Auror Potter is arresting his love of life, Ginny, completely drunk and hexing fans of the other team. Do you think there is some story behind this scene? Did I mention that reading such stories is much more fun?
3. If you say that other shipping partisans write even bigger crap than somebody else, it doesn't make me much warm and fluffy inside. Of course, Drarry and Snarry stories are crap, they cannot be otherwise, because whole premise is very suspicious (yes, there is probably that one Drarry story somewhere, but I still have to find it).

****** I think you have missed the point I made explicit in my final sentence. I'm starting to think it's purposeful, reinforcing my initial statement: Half your issue or more seems to be the pairing itself, and absurd suggestions (to the extent of linking an acknowledged example of the fandom pairing wars at a bad time) and yourself showing a similar tendency of generalizing a pairing without an ounce of self awareness. Like, what does this have to do with anything. Matrona has one big issue and it's less the pairing execution and more how the main schtick was done.

If what you're interested in is a pairing discussion where one engages in opinion, be direct about that in the OP. I've little to no interest in it myself, especially when it regards characters who have little substance in canon for me to care about them. Ok, Harry arrested Ginny for hexing people at a Quidditch match. It's literally the distillation of the little we actually get about Ginny in the series. The scenario is mildly interesting, but half the characters involved don't interest me.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

*** Oh, right, so I have misunderstood your initial comment. You are not trying to defend Harmony, but that couple in the relationship who knew each other for six years, were officially dating for a year, saved each others lives couple of times, all that in the middle of war, where relationships tend to grow faster, so for that pair it should be OK to keep information from each other. Is that your point?

**** They weren't officially dating for a year, they began dating at, like, the end of April. And more than that, their first noteworthy interaction occurred in 5th year (she was virtually non-existent in 3rd and 4th years, and 2nd year she was fairly.generic). My point, really, is that I don't see what criticizing the pairing itself does. Everyone has such preferences, and any declaration that some pairing (that has more than a tiny amount of stories) between the standard group of HP characters, has some issue more than the others is both false and seems to detract from the otherwise correct point about La Matrona: that story's kidnapping scenario doesn't make that much sense.

One thing I am constantly reminded about is how little we have in the books. There are all those comments ‚Äúand then two months nothing serious happened‚Äù, JKR skipped crazily long time even in the Spring 1998 when they were on the run hunting Horcruxes. You can (and it did happen) fill in long romantic stories in those missing areas in books. They were, what two years, on one Quidditch team and you think they had no meaningful interaction? Interesting. And yes, JKR sucks in writing romantic stories, no question about that.

And no, you are right, in my original review, I haven't criticized Harmony per se (only that most Harmony stories I know about suck to some extent), but my points were that the secrecy was completely unnecessary (really, even if he knew Ginny two months, and I still hold he knew her longer, what would she could do? Trying to revive Tom Riddle using his daughter? Informing her friends among Death Eaters? Really? Exactly her who had very personal history with Tom Riddle?) and that the kidnapping was both unnecessary and criminal. And yes, I think the only purpose of both of these mistakes for the author was to set-up Harmony as soon as possible, but Harmony itself was not the biggest problem per se.
