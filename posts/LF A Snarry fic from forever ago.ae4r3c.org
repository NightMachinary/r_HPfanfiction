** I'm pretty sure the fic you're looking for is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13439][In Between Days]] by atrata, one of the best of the Snape/Harry fics written before the Lily reveal.

**** You're welcome! It's one of my favorite fics ever.

Regrettably, this comm tends to be anti-slash and anti-Snape; most of the time you'll only get downvoted when you ask for recs. So if you ever have questions about another slash pairing, you might try posting to [[/r/HPSlashFic/]] instead.

***** I'm reading through it now and I can completely understand why it's a favourite of yours. Both Snape and Harry are excellently written.

Being on here for less than a day, I've picked up on that quickly, haha. It's a shame, some of the best fics I've ever read are SS/HP. But I appreciate the advice, I'll keep it in mind for next time :))
