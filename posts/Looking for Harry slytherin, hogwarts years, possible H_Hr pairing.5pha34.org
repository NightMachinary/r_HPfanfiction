EDIT: Thank you people for taking your time for me! It's great and I'm positive it was a good move to register and ask for help here since lurking wasn't really getting me anywhere. Few hours and my folder is already full of fics! Such a nice community!

As title says I'm looking for a HP fanfic with harry as a slytherin, covering hogwarts years, H/Hr pairing and the story doesn't have to be completed as long as it's lenghty.

I'm flexible enough to not have the above mentioned set in stone If the fic is good enough.

As far as my experience with HP fanfics goes, I've read Dumbledore's army and the year of darkness (which was very good, I almost cried at some point!), Legacies (I liked it at first, but then dropped half way through), Magical relations (humor was good, loved snape tutoring) and Hogwarts battle school. I've enjoyed the latter the most.

Any recs? Thanks in advance.


** linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by Mira Mirth) - it definitely fails on the H/HR factor but for Harry in Slytherin it's a well-regarded story, even though incomplete.

**** I love it. The technical aspects are excellent and the content compelling.

The key to this story is /moderation/. Harry is ambitious, but realistically so. The Slytherin kids try to be sneaky and crafty, but they're still kids. Harry slowly amasses a not incosiderable amount of power - but there other players with a lot more. Harry gets wins but he also gets losses.

In fact my favorite part is how in the later stages, Harry slowly realizes just how precarious the balance he has to maintain is; his social obligations, his various relationships, his political presence, his forays into dark magic. Harry was oblivious of many such things in canon - in this one he has both eyes and ears open, but it's not immediately clear that he's actually better off.

*** OTWTG suffers from Delenda Est syndrome, where literally half of the fic is worthless. In DE it's the second half, in OTWTG it's the first. Should've started in 5th year.

Speaking of half the fic being worthless, have you started to give Harry some wins in Lesser Evils? Your constant whumping on the character was what drove me away from the fic in Chapter 21 and I sincerely hope for those still reading that there is some point where all the obnoxious amount of whump will let up.

** I don't think I can help on the H/Hr part, but here are some recs that otherwise fit:

"They Shook Hands" is a series by Dethryl that's currently updating and on the sixth book. Here's the first: linkffn(7659033)

DrizzleWizzle's series, beginning with "Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection", is on its sixth book. The first is linkffn(8666085).

linkao3(261823) is the first book of "Cunning and Ambition", which is abandoned by book 6. Warning for slash, but I think it's pretty easy to ignore (then again, I haven't read it in a long time).

linkao3(11762850), "Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux" has Gryffindor Hermione as one of Harry's best friends, but they're very young in the fic and still pretty young in the sequel, so there's no romance, really.

linkffn(4894268), "Sitra Ahra", has a Slytherin Harry. Features a lot of Flamel.

linkffn(7613196), "The Pureblood Pretense" & its sequels have a fem Slytherin Harry.

linkffn(5925524), "Twist of Fate", is time travel and possibly slash, but as far as I remember, romance really isn't too big of a factor in the story.

*** Many many thanks sir, I was looking for a list like that! I will store it and can get back at it whenever I finish reading one (oh my me, I can only say I burn through very fast). Not really sure about Fem. I will keep those at last if no one can convince me not to. Slash scares me even more than Fem, from what I've read it implies homosexuality, does it? Can't say it's my cup of tea, but again, if the fic is really good and I'm at a loss for one... I guess I could!

**** No problem. If you're not fond of femHarry, I think it's worth mentioning that while she is female, she's masquerading as her male cousin for most of the series (excluding parts of the holidays). Really, though, the Pureblood Pretense series is quite fantastic, especially for some potions-related stuff.

On slash, yes, that's what it is. If you plan on avoiding it, I think most/a good part of “Twist of Fate” has more of a...possessive faux-brotherly relationship, I guess. I'd comment on Cunning and Ambition, but I haven't read that in a while.

For other things I forgot to mention the first time around, there's Travel Secrets, linkffn(9622538), which is a timetravel & Slytherin Harry. IIRC, it was a bit cliché, but, well. "Hail Odysseus" is also Slytherin Harry. linkffn(10645463)

Past's Player is timetravel, and he gets resorted into Slytherin. linkffn(5736901). It's not slash.

** If a Slytherin Harry and a Gryffindor Hermoine got together, I'd imagine it would fall squarely into the Belligerent Sexual Tension trope. Lots of insults, squabbling, and angry sex. Yet, for all that, if someone tried to insult one of them(calling Harry a snake, calling Hermione a mudblood, etc), the instigator would be unpleasantly surprised when the other one turned on them.

Think about Firefly and the relationship between Mal and Inara. Mal will lay out anyone that even so much as implies that Inara is a whore... but he'll call her that to her face.

*** Er so what are you saying? That any fic along those lines would fall under the category that you described? Doesn't have to be, does it? Even if it does, if it's well portrayed as a whole and not just silly as it sounds I don't see me having a problem with it. Do you have any suggestions for me? As I said before, I'm open to anything really.

And no, I don't have any suggestions of fics of the type you want, or I would have linked them. I was just offering my thoughts on the subject.

******* Cool, I actually read the first chap of that one before opening this thread! Seemed nice, but I felt it rushed things. You know what I mean. I would have prefered to see it happen way more slowly, building up over time. But hey, that's just me! What else can you tell me about it? I liked the intro very much that's why I tried it.

******** It's not a high powered story in which the world is shaken by grand political plays and stuff. It only lasts for, I think, about one year in the story. One big part of it is the process of becoming an Animagus, and the other big part is the romance between Harry and Hermoine.

It's noteworthy that not many people diss it after they read it.

********* Well, I'm usually one of those people that gets hooked on stuff even if it's bad. Not that I'm saying this one's bad too. Guess the magic starts after the first chap or I simply missed it.

My all time low was when I binge-watched my vampires diaries. Sorry fans of that show!

I'm very intrigued by the becoming of animagi thing, seems unique. Haven't heard of other fics about that so far. Should I go back at it? Jeez, I need to just jump into one and go ahead. What can you tell me about harry in this one?

Thank you for the insight you already gave.

********** Vox Corporis is extremely fluffy, and the first few chapters are meant to show Harry is at his absolute lowest, emotionally. The rest of it is mostly about him opening up after the events at the graveyard and coming into his own.

Just jump in and read it.

*** What is even your point? You are describing tropes and acting all smart on a thread that is asking for recommendations. If you don't like a trope that's great. Bully for you. Why do you even bother commenting? Just skip the post, and if you are feeling particularly petty, downvote it. Don't stale a conversation because you're feeling like farming some karma by acting like the connoisseur of all HP fanfiction today.
