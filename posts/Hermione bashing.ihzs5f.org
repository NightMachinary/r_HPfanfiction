I want fics where Hermione gets called out about her unpleasantness, preferably by Harry or Ron, but any other characters would be okay


** I read one called /Hidden Red X/. I don't know why I kept reading it. It was trash, even without getting into the content(very disjointed, plot elements come out of nowhere, etc).

  Why, in the Harry Potter books, did no one comment on the fact that Hermione doesn't actually know how to write a paper correctly. This story addresses that. Slight Hermione bashing, nothing too mean.
