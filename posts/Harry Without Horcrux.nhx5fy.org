essentially what i'm looking for is any fic where harry loses the horcrux. like he gets hit by an AK, or a dementor sucks it out of him early. please include things like time travel or reincarnation. basically any fic where the horcrux is no longer in harry (preferably before goblet of fire but it doesn't really matter) and it changes him somehow. like he gets stronger or more serious. thanks!


** Linkffn(The Merging) and linkffn(The Second String) have the horcrux sucked out by dementors.

  When the dementor attack presents Harry with an opportunity to begin to fight back he gladly sets himself on the path to have a hand in his future. But as time goes on, it's clear that not all is the same as it once was. Why has his scar stopped hurting? What are these seemingly random objects he's drawn to? How deep does the connection between him and Voldemort truly run? Post GoF

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

** Well there's linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero). I only read a few chapters and apparently it gets reallllly weird later on but I'll just leave the rec out there.

In linkffn(On the Way to Greatness), Harry loses the Horcrux earlier than he does in canon. I read it a long time ago and I don't remember if/how changed him.

  Growing up is hard, and growing up in the midst of brewing revolution while trying to break an ancient curse is harder. Harry journeys alongside old friends and new as he strives to safeguard his family, keep himself secret, and navigate deep and wild magics.
