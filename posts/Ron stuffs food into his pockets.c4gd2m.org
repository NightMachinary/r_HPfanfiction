Looking for a fic where Harry casts a spell that makes all the food on Ron's plate disappear. He resorts to stuffing food into his pockets. Eventually that doesn't work either. I believe Ron betrayed Harry in someway prior to this event.

Thank you


** It's mentioned in Chapter 7 of /Harry Crow/.

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.
