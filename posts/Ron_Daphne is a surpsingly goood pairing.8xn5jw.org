** Daphne is not a character, she's a name and nothing more. We do not even have a description of her in canon. You might as well say "Ron and Jane Doe is a surprisingly good pairing".

So, which Daphne are you talking about? Ice Queen? Ditz? Ignorant Southern Belle? Pureblood bigot who's not as violent as the Death Eaters? Closet muggle fan?

*** Yes! Thabk you. It's like people are afraid to use an OC, so they throw the name Daphne at her

**** It works, though. Daphne has gained a life of her own in the fandom, and there are people who ship Daphne with Ron or Harry or whoever, whereas no one (or at least a very small minority) ships an OC with a canon character.

*** A fair point let me expand. We don't know lots about Daphne obviously but I like her and Ron because she's a Slytherin .

Ron hate of Slytherins is normally exaggerated stupidly high so its refreshing to find fics that show Ron either overcoming prejudice or simply learning that relationships and friendships can be formed with people in completely different classes and politics to you.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I am curious at what makes you say that? As in, genuinely curious! Do you have any fic recs as examples? As others said, there is not much known about her in canon so most of the Daphne I know, at least, is purely fanfiction.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU
