I would love to find some Hogwarts Era, smut-filled Dramione fics! It seems that there are many well-written fics are set during the War, like The Fallout (which is on my TBR), but less that are set at Hogwarts. I would prefer longer, complete fics. I've already read Isolation and am almost done Silencio, and enjoyed/am enjoying them both! Thanks in advance!


** My time to shine! i also loved isolation! One of my favorite fics of all time.

I also enjoy the bracelet linkffn(The Bracelet). check them out!

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.

  A worm AU - Taylor Hebert lost more than just some dignity when she was shoved in the locker. Infections hospitalised her and destroyed her vocal chords. In desperate need for people to pay attention, her powers developed rather differently. Mostly only T, but erring on the side of caution due to language and such.

  “This doesn't change anything, Granger. We're not friends.” Draco said. “I know.” Hermione sat unmoving, listening to his retreating footfalls. She felt pretty certain that, in fact, it changed everything.

** I'll be surprised if you've never read this, or never heard of it, but it is easily one of the best... and utterly incomplete. It hasn't been updated for 6 years but what's there is worth the read. [[http://hp.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=544171043][Pansy's Volcano, adult ff]].

I'll edit with more. I haven't read in a long time, I can probably dig up a few more old/obscure ones.
