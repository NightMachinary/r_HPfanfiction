What if doing/creating magic (animagus transformation, two way mirrors, etc.) weakens a witch/wizard for a period of time (depending on how much magic they used up) to the point where they age at the same rate as muggles? For example, becoming an animagus would maybe tire you out for a year so for a year you age like a muggle? The Marauders finished their transformations during their teens when they were already aging the same rate as muggles so it doesn't show as much on them, but it is a reason why so few adult witches and wizards become animagi and why they won't just enchant their own magical tents. That's why some magicals show their age more than others, and powerful witches and wizards tend to look older?


** "Powerful" in canon basically means "spent a lot of time learning and practicing". The more powerful wizards are older because that's how power works.

*** I was thinking more about the movies. Apparently a wizard (not Flamel) was 700 years old while Dumbledore (known as the powerhouse of Britain) looked ancient at only 120'ish years old.I thought that Dumbledore constantly casting impressive magic could be a reason why.

***** I mean I also have to add what did this 700-year-old wizard look like? We know wizards have longer life spans than muggles but Dumbledore was a spritely man at 120. He only died because he cursed himself and then had Snape /murder/ him. I'm pretty sure Dumbles would've lived a much, much longer lifespan had he not been playing around with cursed objects. I'd say at least another 50 odd years.

****** I guess. I like my theory kind of because it gives a reason for everyday wizards to not bother with powerful magic because most don't want to reduce their lifespan. I mean, what's the point of a house when you can live in a suitcase?

******* I mean go for it! It's your head canon!

I just don't like the idea that powerful magic somehow weakens the person. I think the point of powerful magic is that it is difficult to master and so not many get around to it. I mean the majority of magical people don't really live their lives in a way that magic is the focus of their day. They perform magic for everything, but they don't really focus on it. There's such a small subset of the population that actually has to focus on their use of magic everyday for their life: aurors (to a certain extent), magizoologists (very specific purposes), researchers/professors/theorists, and maybe a handful of other jobs.

The Minister doesn't need to exhibit and utilize magic beyond completing his everyday mundane tasks. Quidditch players don't really ever use their magic during matches. I could come up with more examples but I'm a bit tired.

So you see, powerful magic isn't really a necessity of life. Heck the whole point of Hogwarts is for a pretty basic level of understanding across all subjects, but it's only the nutters like Hermione who really delve in beyond what's expected - and she doesn't even credit herself as being a particularly powerful witch compared to Harry, but she knows magic inside out, so she performs it to a higher level because she's /taken the time/ to master it beyond words and wand movement.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that powerful magic is difficult to master and takes time/practice like any difficult life skill would. So it's only mastered by those who spend their lives practicing it: professors, dark lords, those who have the money to spend their free time doing what they fancy. This is clear by Hermione mastering spells quickly because she studies so ferociously. Not that Hermione isn't also a talented witch, but she's incredibly smart to boot - versus Harry/Ron who are powerful wizards, take longer to master things than Hermione, but are still capable in the end. I also have to add that it's pretty clear in the books that some witches/wizards are just innately more powerful than others (again some people are naturally better at things than others) and that people have subjects that they are particularly gifted at (Neville with Herbology, Snape with Potions). But I think a lot of this comes down to interest + practice = high level of skill. Not to get all philosophical on you, but Malcolm Gladwell has a great book (called Outliers) all about why the Steve Jobs/Bill Gates/Beatles/Serena Williams of the world become the greats - spoiler alert; its all about the amount of time they spent practicing!

******** Umm... the following is a rant.... your explanation makes sense, I just don't like it when authors introduce Marry Sue teenagers to support the plot.

​

I'm not actually planning a fic with this, I just hate when things don't make sense. It just bugs me that a bunch of teenagers (Harry, marauders, etc.) go around performing really powerful and useful magic that average adults apparently aren't capable of. I don't care how intelligent Hermione or Tom are, seven years of magical exposure (a lot of which is spent in classroom rather than individual study or at times when she's not allowed to practice magic) are not enough to make them outperform the average magical adult. Fred and George are believable - intelligent and driven, they don't have as much basic magic knowledge to catch up to, can actually do magic at home (and have even before Hogwarts), and what they do (while clever) is more about ingenuity than pure skill. Similarly with the marauders - most of their thing is cleverness and ingenuity, but the animagus is supposed to be dangerous and difficult for fully trained witches and wizards, yet we have teenagers being capable of it. Either wizards are lazy/incompetent/unimaginative and never bothered to do stuff, or they have reasons to avoid the more powerful magic.

My dad is a contractor - I have never gone with him on jobs or shown interest in following his footsteps, but just from living with him I picked up the basics of how to use construction tools and the type of licenses you need to do certain things and the bureaucracy behind building permits. Similarly, I have very little idea of how dairy farms work because I have no interest and no one around with experience. Muggleborns would be behind in terms of very basic magical knowledge, the way Harry is, but somehow Hermione and Tom are immediately the most talented student of their year. If by the OWLs they surpassed their peers that'd be one thing, but within weeks of getting a wand?

********* I'm going to respond to you once I get a free moment - but the short of it is that I agree with your “Mary Sue” dislike. If I look at it from your perspective, I can see where I'd fill in the idea that power depletes a person to make it less attractive to use powerful spells. Anyway: will edit later!
