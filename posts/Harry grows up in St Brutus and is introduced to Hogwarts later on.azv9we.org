I just finished "Incurable" :

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8184169?view_full_work=true]]

And while I am not a fan of the sex scenes I realy like the idea of the story and was hoping that somebody has some recommendations?


** And I'm not a fan of non magic AUs too...

*** Why even write a fic if it's non-magic? At that point it's just people with the same names as canon.

** I remember reading a fic of similar vibes, albeit, it's not a Drarry fic (thankfully) and it's only 3 chapters.

  What if people started Hogwarts when they were 17 instead 11? And how will Harry adapt to Hogwarts after living in St Brutus for years, more importantly, could Hogwarts adapt to a different Harry. Follow Harry in a different Hogwarts adventure. Mature content and grittier characters. Features Harry with a spine. On Hiatus.
