Whenever I look up Sirius time travel fanfics, I get annoyed at all the going back to marauders era fanfics. This time around, i want Sirius going back to Tom riddles time, not Harry, not hermione. Just sirius. Maybe they can join him, but it needs to be Sirius and Tom centric.

-needs to be completed

-at least 100k words
