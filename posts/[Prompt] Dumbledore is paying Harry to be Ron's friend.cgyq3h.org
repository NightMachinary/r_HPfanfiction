Subversion of the usual trope.


** Ron Weasley was met with quite the surprise when he entered his dorm room. Harry Potter, his roommate and eternal friend, was not in his bed, but rather sitting in the middle of the floor He appeared to be wrestling with the lid of a very large box. Inside were hundreds of small slips of paper, and they appeared to decidedly not wish to return to the box, given by how many were scattered haphazardly throughout the room.

"Harry mate...What's all this then?" Ron asked.

At this, Harry visibly jumped, scrambling to collect as many slips as he could. "Ron! Uh, well, you know, it's tax season after all,"

"Tax season? We're thirteen!"

"Well, you know, as a future Lord of an Ancient and Noble House, I must be prepared for my future with investments and all that, you know?"

This immediately made Ron suspicious. No one but the most uptight and pretentious families (for instance, Malfoy) cared about bollocks like that. He reached down and snagged a scrap of paper attempting to escape via the door.

"Mate, is this an invoice...from Dumbledore?"

"Uh, he was stealing my inheritance?"

"No, it says right here that he's /paying/ you!"

Harry visibly started to sweat. "It was a very dastardly scheme, which I saw through due to my--"

"Paying you to be /my friend/?"

"Damn Dumbledore and his exceptional bookkeeping skills," Harry muttered. "Uh, well Ron, it's not what it looks like."

"Alright then, what is it? Because things look pretty clear from where I'm standing," Ron waved the invoice accusingly.

Harry sagged in defeat. "Fine. He is paying me to be friends with you. But I promise it's not just the money! I like being your friend, and even if the money stopped we'd keep hanging out," He appeared to consider for a moment. "Well, maybe I'd give back the Chudley Cannon pyjamas, but that's it, I promise!"

"But...why?" was all Ron could offer in response.

Harry adjusted his glasses. "Well you see, it's quite the story. You see, when Hagrid showed me my vault back in first year, I wanted to make sure my money was alright, it was being managed properly, that sort of thing, y'know?"

"Bloody hell, Harry, you didn't," Ron said in horror, recognizing where this was going.

"I did. I hired a goblin to manage it, and he took the entire thing as payment," Harry smiled sadly. "I was completely broke, so when Dumbledore approached me with an offer to pay me handsomely if I was your friend, well, how could I say no?"

"Blimey, I'm so sorry that happened, Harry. But why me? If anything, Dumbledore should be paying me to be friends with you! You're the Boy-Who-Lived, after all!"

"Well that's the thing, I asked him the same question, and turns out he's you from the future!"

Ron had no response for this. Having one's worldview fundamentally shifted twice in the period of five or so minutes tends to do that to you. Harry continued, mostly oblivious. "Yeah, he said something about getting sent back in time in his fifth year and having to live his whole life out in the past. Apparently we weren't friends I'm his timeline so he manipulated things so you could grow up normally."

This didn't help Ron's mental state much, he sat down on his bed, shaking his head. "That's...blimey... I'm going to need a bit to process this."

"Oh yeah, take your time," said Harry. Then, his face darkened. "Hey, are we still able to be mates after this? I know it's a lot to take in."

"Yeah, yeah, like you said, if the money stops, you're still my friend. That's good enough for me."

Harry visibly brightened. "Brilliant! Well in that case, would you mind helping me with these last few invoices? I wasn't lying earlier about it being tax season, turns out the Ministry isn't a fan of thirteen year olds getting mysterious large incomes."

** "Harry, I'm sorry," said Dumbledore. "I've recently been called out as a manipulative old coot, and after reviewing my actions I can no longer justify paying you to be young Mr. Weasley's friend."

"Oh, is that all, Professor?" said Harry. "That's fine. I'll keep being his friend anyways."

"What?! But, Harry!" said Dumbledore, flabbergasted. "You can hardly stand Ron! You hate the Chudley Cannons, and you've always complained about how he chews with his mouth open, and you murdered his rat and blamed it on Sirius Black! I thought you would love an excuse to never talk to him again!"

Harry shrugged. "Yeah, but this is all part of my master plan to bang his sister. Also, if I marry into the family I can keep having Molly's cooking."

Surprisingly it's not a bad basis, not the Java bit, that sort of rigidity is bad, but the basics in algorithms.

You study algorithms, how to analyze and improve them.

You study software design and various development models.

You study systems. You generally learn how Operating Systems and Databases work.

It's kinda like a subset of math in its thinking though.
