Wrong boy who lived, right boy who lived but terrible parents, Snape's side of the story, whatever. Just James and Lily (Sirius and Remus too if you want) portrayed as bad as possible. Preferably without there being interference from Dumbledore that causes it (Like compulsions or something).

Slash, other bashings, dark!Harry, and crossovers are fine. Please no harems, romance/smut driven plot, genderbending, pottercest or mpreg. Thank you!


** Lily bashing (but not James) is rather rare, but chapters 7, 9, 10 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019373/7/Common-Sense][Common Sense]] by DisobedienceWriter are Lily bashing extraordinaire.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5785108/1/Too-Late][Too Late]] contains the worst James/Lily bashing I've found so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections][Strange Reflections]], linkffn(12307886), is also pretty bad.

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

Pretty bad in what way? It's decently written, but it doesn't really explain why those three are the way they are, and Lily doesn't really do anything at all. I liked it personally, and it's not terribly unrealistic.

**** The entertainment value of the horribly incompetent Potters alone is worth it in that fic. It's not really a story I can take seriously, but there's so many hilarious moments...

**** I think they meant it had pretty bad bashing in it. Or to phrase it another way, a lot of bashing.

The people of the Order in general are almost "villains" in this one.
