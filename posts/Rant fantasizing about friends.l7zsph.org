Smut talk time:

I have read so many fics where people are getting off to their friends or having wet dreams about them. Then the MC was like, thats weird but we're clearly just friends. (The dreams can be forgiven because your subconscious is weird).

This is odd right? Like, I feel like if you reach the point of fantasizing about your friends then you probably have realized you're into them. Every time I try to write one of these things I just can't make it seem believable that someone is in that of denial.

Tldr: it doesn't feel normal to fantasize about your 'platonic' friends. Feel free to correct me.


** Sexual attraction isnt always associated with romantic feelings. I've wanted to have sex with friends who I had no intrest in romantically, that sorta thing isnt really brought up much in stories though.

*** That's fine not to be into them romantically but you still want them sexually. I don't mind that. It's the "well I just got off thinking about this person I hate. Clearly that's not worth thinking about and is totally not something I need to address at all."

**** Oh, gotcha, naw that just sounds like the writer doesnt want to bother writing about it, or is trying to write an emotionally immature character

****** Right, and I think that's a good thing in small doses, but like you said, it can get ridiculous and frustrating extremely quickly when characters act like they are space aliens inhabiting human bodies

** ...It's pretty normal?

I have a lot of female friends, and although in the past I had no romantic intentions towards pretty much most of them, I still found a lot of them sexually attractive and, even in brief flights of fancy, thought about banging them like a bongo drum a few times.

I expect a few had the same idea about me (though that may just be my fragile ego at work, lol).

Humans are related to bonobos: they fuck each other as a way to say hello, hah.

Sexual attraction =/= romantic desires.

Hell, I find Amber Heard physically attractive, but on a romantic/personal level? I'd rather shove my cock in a plug-socket.

...Heh, Ron being attracted to Pansy's "nice arse", only to stop himself in horror at his fleetng thoughts. Hermione though was bewildered yet happy on why Ron suddenly decided to keep physically close to her.

** Wet dreams and/or wank fantasies serving as the only/one of early indicators for a character that they're interested in the subject of those dreams seems like lazy writing to me. Or plain misunderstanding of human nature.

When it comes to teenage hormones, for the boys in particular or so I hear, there's little rhyme and reason to what turns one on and it's got little to do with anything they want or think about when clear-headed. Obviously the experience is not the same for everyone, but I've heard of plenty boys/men fantasising about things or people they would never want outside of those fantasies, including coworkers and friends.

But disregarding that and assuming in MC's case it's truly only about people they fancy, you'd think they would not be a separate entity from their own brain and acting as if imperioused by it. The trope you're talking about I do find quite annoying, yes. Makes you despise the words /"for some reason"/. MC never knows why they react or do or think anything about/to this particular person!! Oh the mystery!

Meanwhile there's me asking myself "Am I crushing on them?" as soon as I catch myself paying more attention to somebody lol.

** internalized homophobia can make you justify a lot of feelings as platonic, tbh
