** inb4 "b-but Saint Ronald the Billius could never do anything wrong!!" /s

In all seriousness I'd check out these two fics,

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11720141/1/Courage-Rising]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033933/1/Time-is-the-Fire]]

Time is the Fire actually fulfills your request the best (even though it will not appear to at first). Courage Rising is more of a 7th Year Rewrite fic that I'm very partial to, despite it not being updated

One of the issues I've found with the "Ron leaves Harry and Hermione in the tent" trope is that it often leads to some seriously lazy writing, heavy amounts of fake unrequited feelings and unbelievable angst.

It always feels like these kinds of fics feature heavy amount of Weasley and Dumbledore Bashing, and although I'm not the biggest Ron fan, I've found character bashing to be quite exhausting and not fair to canon characterizations.

Not OP, but wat? This starts out at the Epilogue and it's got the canon pairings. OP asked for Year 7 fics....how is this a year 7 fic?
