While not nice I always thought the anti muggles mindset of the wizards made sense. They are a vastly more powerful race which shares an ecological niche with muggles. Despite being more powerful they are forced into hiding.


** There are enough muggleborns forced out of the wizarding world by pureblood favoritism to ally themselves with muggle governments, so while the Statute of Secrecy is maintained for the common people, governments know about wizards.

Given this, when a muggle genocide nears completion, the last muggles will nuke known wizard populations. If that doesn't kill them outright the fallout and nuclear winter would.

Even ignoring that, how much of magicals' food supply comes from muggle sources? If they've lost farming skills they'll eventually starve.

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.

*** i believe that the forced out muggleborns is fan canon not nowhere in the books. And from the books only the prime minister knows.

This argument that the muggles would nuke their own country i find always strange. in the US or Russia in can imagine that. bout in europe, afrika, asia and australia? there are not enugh nukes even there. and nuking their own capitals? i just cant believe a goverment would do that. I dont know about the protocols to launch a nuke but i doubt any silo can just decide to lauch them by themself.

**** I dunno about stasis charms but I was gonna mention the duplication spell lol. tbh the only way the muggles would win is if they have wizards on their side. A few imperios and suddenly those nukes are a few hundred miles off target.

** Wizards don't share a "niche" with anyone. They have their own spaces in the world --- castles, forests, huge government buildings, manors for the wealthier ones, etc. The British wizarding world has a population of less than 15,000. The areas they occupy are more than enough. Even if they conduct a genocide of the muggles (something which will come at great cost), what will they do with the whole island of Great Britain with less than 10,000 people living on it? I assume, as an absolute bare minimum, that a third of the wizarding populace will either die in the anti muggle war or will comprise of muggleborns and half bloods who fought for the muggles. I also assume that the population figures are similar for other countries.

There is nothing to gain from killing Muggles. That's the reason neither Grindelwald, who wanted to rule over muggles for the sake of "meritocracy" and the "greater good", nor Voldemort, who wanted the British Wizarding World to isolate itself, attempted this.

*** What did the human do when they were only 10 000? And who told you that the wizarding world had a population of less than 15 000? None of your argument is right, because Wizards don't share a niche with anyone because they have to hide. How would you feel if you had to hide only because you are superior?

#+end_quote

Lived in extremely primitive hunter gatherer societies. It took tens of thousands of years for population levels to rise. And if we look at the wizarding world, most purebloods seem to have only 1 or 2 children per family. In fact, the Weasleys and Bellatrix's parents are the only exception as far as I remember.

#+end_quote

Population of wizarding UK is less than 15,000. JK herself said in an interview that the population was around 3,000 but I wanted to take the maximum estimate that is usually given. Check on the internet for estimations.

Not particularly bad, considering that, as a wizard, I would have a high standard of life. Going to war with the muggles would put me great mortal danger. Many of my friends would surely die and I wouldn't gain anything from it.

Really, what do wizards have to /gain/ from killing all the muggles?

***** The difference between the hunter-gathers and the wizards is that its only really choice that stops wizards from having a population boom. Wizard society is post-scarcity and no one will ever starve if the government is smart.

I have to agree that wizards have no reason to genocide muggles other than being extremely racist. Literally make a skyscraper and fill it with trunks. Now you have housing for thousands of people. lmao

For the amount of wizards, we really can't know because JK is terrible with numbers and making sure they are consistent. For example, if we use the number she gave us for Hogwarts students (1000) divide by 7 to get about 142 per year, and the life expectancy (137 iirc) and multiply them by each other, we get just under twenty thousand. But JK has said its around 3k and idk how people got 15k but it probably has a logical way to it.
