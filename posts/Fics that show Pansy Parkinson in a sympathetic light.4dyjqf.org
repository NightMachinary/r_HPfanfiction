It's just me but I always found it irritating how Rowling always said she hated Pansy and that she was so bad that she was not even good enough for Draco. I mean, what did the girl do that was so bad? She said a couple of nasty things and tried to give Potter to the Death Eaters when her life was in danger and suddenly she's the devil?

So anyway, any fics that show Pansy in a sympathetic light?

#+end_quote

Not much at all, but she didn't do anything that was /not/ bad either. So while Draco did much worse stuff, he got to show character traits that went beyond 'petty bully' and was humanized, while Pansy remained a caricature of the schoolgirl bully with no positive traits at all. JKR doesn't hate Pansy because she's a schoolyard bully, she hates Pansy because that's /all/ she is.

Of course, you can always give her sympathetic traits in fanfiction. Most go the 'scared kid' route, which just makes her an inferior version of Draco. I remember enjoying linkffn(Monochromatic by Provocative Envy). Really good writing.

  ONE-SHOT: And there's music pulsing in bass-heavy shockwaves up the notches of her spine and there's salt on the insides of her thighs and the hollows of her hips and she isn't Pansy Parkinson anymore, no, she isn't a girl who hides or runs or escapes, no, she's someone else she's someone new she's someone who's breathing and fighting and alive.

  “Why are you here?” Parvati asked Pansy once. People asked her a lot, when they found her in Flourish and Blotts, or at work on the Prophet. Their eyes raked her, looking for green, for silver, for venom. Sometimes she'd smile back and let them see the danger. "Because I'm not fifteen anymore," said Pansy. "God, do you know what precious Potter Sr. got up to at school, the bully? But boys get to grow up to be men, you see, and us girls just grow up to be bitches."

** she was a blood supremacist and you can coherently characterise her as an anti-black racist because of her comment to angelina. and just a bully in general. i think the point from jkr's perspective is that while draco was uncomfortable with murder, stopped being a blood supremacist and mellowed out in his later years, pansy remains a bully and probably never had a problem with evil? she doesn't really deepen her characterisation like she does with +her male characters+ draco
