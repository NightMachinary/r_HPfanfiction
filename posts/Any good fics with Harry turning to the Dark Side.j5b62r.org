Basic, but it's a concept I love thinking about. Harry going against his own morals, that stuff,


** Please read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][Welcome to Hogwarts 1949]] . It is one of my favorite hidden gems. Perfect descent of Harry into darkness

  Harry is accidently transported fifty years back in time through a fluke with the mauraders map. Here he runs into and befriends Tom Riddle, hoping to find his only weakness. No Slash.

** For Lack of a Beozar. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar]]

Basically Ron dies due to the poisoned mead. Harry and Hermione kill Draco in retaliation and use the dark arts to fight Death Eaters. It is not really an evil harry fic but it certainly is a dark harry fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]]: Very popular fic on this sub. This Harry starts out with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who have escaped justice again after the War. But the Trio can be seen getting increasingly cruel and ruthless.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]]: Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore and joins forces with Harry. Hermione, Ron, and Ginny become very enthusiastic, and drag Harry along for the ride despite his reservations.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: He is never depicted as dark, but his methods speak for themselves. He's not above manipulating his own family for his goals.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
