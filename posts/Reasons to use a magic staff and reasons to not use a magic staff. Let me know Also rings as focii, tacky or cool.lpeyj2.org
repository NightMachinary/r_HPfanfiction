So I was wondering how come Harry potter doesn't mention magical staffs/staves? Idk. I don't get how come those don't feature as much.

Let me know what you guys think above wands v. Staffs/Staves v. Rings v. Any other focii you can think of!

Cheers! :)

*** "Every Wizard has a staff. They come standard-issue. Some are gnarled and rough, some are covered in glowing arcane runes, while some are plain and practical. Many staffs are magical, although a smart Wizard realizes that, by and large, magical staffs are overpriced and distinctly use-impaired. Nevertheless, as has already been stated, every Wizard has a staff. A staff, for a Wizard, is like his robe or pointy hat. A Wizard without one of these three things would be as lacking as a political career without scandal or a trip to the dentist without an unpleasant aftertaste. Everyone knows this. Hells, even Muggles know this. A staff is a symbol of a Wizard's power, of the triumph of knowledge and reason over chaos and insanity (note that Sorcerers, by the way, generally prefer spears, although this is certainly coincidence), and as a warning to others: Do Not Meddle, For I Am Subtle And Quick To Anger. Also, For Reality Is My Plaything.

What most people tend to forget is that, in addition to all of these things, a staff is also a large, heavy, wooden stick." ... "And what do wozards get? A heavy wooden stick, a rat, and phenomenal cosmic power beyond that with which mortal man was meant to tamper. And sometimes, that's enough."

** Staves and staffs would be much more cumbersome and harder to conceal than wands making their use impractical after the implementation of the statue of secrecy. Plus my headcannon is that they are much harder to master and are essentially magical hammers

*** I see staves as a precursor to wands, that was supplanted by them as more knowledge regarding the creation of magical foci came into being. This knowledge allowed for staves to become smaller and smaller without sacrificing spellcasting ability, until a critical point was reached where a wand's smaller size greatly enhanced the ability to cast spells, at which point the staff became obsolete.

** In my headcanon, a staff is like one of those person-sized tools, while a wand is a normal-sized tool, and can also be, with enough focus, become a smaller and more precise tool.

There are situations where a normal-sized hammer won't help you - for knocking down a brick wall for example, you need a sledgehammer; but you also can't assemble a watch using a wrench that's fit to screw in airplane landing gear. Tearing up asphalt needs a jackhammer, not a detail chisel. And so on.

Rings, in my mind, are necessary to bring wandless magic to par with wanded magic. They emulate the wand's ability to draw magic from the caster, but not its ability to focus this magic. It just pools in their hand until it starts leaking out. Wandless magic still has to be learned, but the most difficult part (drawing magic from oneself) is rendered easy.

Bracers can only do defensive magic. They're like an array of rings that points outwards, making their range abysmal but their strength amazing. Cast a shield charm through a raised bracer and nothing will get through.

Lockets are good for burst magic. They focus magic inside their shell, almost to the breaking point, and when opened, release a chosen spell with incredible power, away from the caster. A blasting curse cast with an amulet will annihilate a city block, but needs at least a week to charge inside the amulet.

Bamboo staves can store spells inside their individual segments, which are released by performing certain movements.

A necklace can only do passive, subtle magic, and only if its shape and function fits. For example, a religious idol can be used to inspire a gradual calming effect in people, or a slowly building zealous righteousness. Other shapes can do different things, and the effect is aided if the caster is charismatic enough.

** Moody uses a Staff in Order of the Phoenix during the battle in the Department of Mysteries. That scene was pretty bad ass, but it's likely a lot slower than a wand. I can see it being the primary "wand" back in the day, but it wouldn't be much reliable anymore. The rings don't make much sense because I imagine it would be hard to put a core in them.

** The way I see this issue is, staffs were meant for power, that is you need to do wide area magic or if you lack a direct effect magic you will be better with a staff.

On the other hand rings I feel will not be able to handle the power requirement of a battle. But it will not be noticeable directly and can only be used for small things like summoning your book from across the room etc.

What I think was that the invention of more direct attacks led to the rise of the wand.

The staff were used in situation where mass elemental attacks or massive shields were needed.

*** That sounds right to me!

Rings: good for aforementioned "small things" like household charms or tap-to-activate stuff like the Diagon Alley entrance. Maybe alright for very minor enchantments and stuff, but too weak for anything that takes a lot of power. Easy to use due to lack of wand movements, but very limited in abilities and utterly useless for combat. Handy for housework and office work.

Wands: small, fast, particularly good for precision work like crafting and enchanting. Can do anything a ring can, and more, but also a little harder to use. Good all-round tool for making or breaking. In combat, it has a good balance between speed and power, plus it's easy to hide. Good for crafting, duelling, moving heavy objects, magical surgery.

Staves: heavy, slow, hard to hide, takes a lot of power to use. Necessary for large-scale stuff like battle magic and the making or breaking of major wards, but too powerful for petty magics. Works as an equivalent to industrial machinery for construction, mining, etc. Excels as a weapon of war using massive elemental magic like tidal waves, earthquakes, storms.

You could maybe add in some form of sceptre as a midpoint between the roughly 1ft wands and 5ft staves.

If you want to heal a bruise, a ring will suffice. If you want to fix broken bones, you need a wand. If you want to turn a pile of corpses into a rabid pack of inferi, you need a staff.

For truly excellent results, send one person with a staff for power and a couple of wand-wielders for the detail work. They'll be able to weave that same pile of corpses into a 20ft diseased flesh golem that has laser eyes and a flaming bone-sword! :D

**** Maybe people could even put a series of magical cores into some sort of obelisk, use it as either a WMD or a citywide shield? Like a supersized wardstone.

Then you can go all-out balls-out with pyramid capstones crafted from a series of magical creature bones and petrified woods with the rune carvings filled in with blood, all coated in magically-infused electrum, or something equally awesome and ridiculous.

***** The problem is not the size of the wand/ staff as it is not producing the magic. It is used for focusing it. As such with a larger object like an obelisk, unless its charged by a ritual, it will basically be dissipating the magic rather than focusing it.

Its like trying to point a 5 ft wide water pipe but supplied by a small overhead tank. It wont be effective.

****** Yeah, I wasn't really thinking about energy sources for the obelisks etc. I agree you'd need a ritual, or even access to a ley line or something. It's far too much for any individual to power alone.

Do you reckon the Aztec human sacrifices would work? Life energy fuelling whatever magical storage is in a pyramid, so it can be used to project protections or something? Or a very far-reaching curse...

I've just got up to date with a fic that had Aztecs as bad guys, in a long war with their northern neighbours, and I can just imagine them being nearly wiped out and using a combination of the pyramids' pent-up magic and their own ritual suicides to cast a global bad luck curse as revenge.

** IIRC Durmstrang uses staves sometimes, largely for show.

IRL, ancient magic wands such at what Roman Augurs (state-sponsored wizards who focused on Divination) used were up to three feet long and bridged the gap between wands and staffs.

As for rings as magical focii, why not? Sounds good to me! I would suggest giving them strengths and weaknesses relative to wands though, just to give your story some flavor.

** I think that staves would use up more magic power. If you have to run your magic through the focus for it to work, then a small wand is easier to “fill” than a staff. In regards to rings, I think that people just wouldn't wanna be waving their hand in wand motions to cast spells
