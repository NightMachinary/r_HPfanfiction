So, I've seen tropes that are so commonly used, either by a large variety of fanfic authors, or among authors of a certain type of fanfic, that both readers and writers seem to not realize that it's not part of canon. That it was something fans built up themselves.

Building up new things is of course part of fanfiction, it's not a bad thing. Some of these are so common because they are world-building ideas that lend to very interesting stories. But I'm more talking about when people forget that it wasn't part of the books.

Examples I've observed include:

- *Dan & Emma:* This is very commonly used as the first names of Hermione's parents, but as far as I know this isn't actually their names. JKR never actually revealed their first names. These names were popularized by fans of the Harry/Hermione ship back when book 5 originally came out (which was before canon ships were confirmed with the Mugglenet interview after HBP came out) as a reference to the actors Daniel Radcliff and Emma Watson who played Harry and Hermione in the movies.
- *Which Platform Is It?:* A common reference made in fics which set out to make the Weasley's evil, especially ones involving time travel, is Molly's question to Ginny about which platform the express was on to show that her and Dumbledore were in league for this grand scheme. In fact, if you read the books instead of fanfiction, it is very obvious that Molly is trying to distract and engage her 10 year old daughter who is depressed about being the only one not going.
- *Harry's Veela Resistance:* Harry was incredibly strong willed, and was certainly more resistant to the Veela allure than most teenagers (similar to how he was uniquely capable of repelling the Imperius), but the vast majority of adult men are shown to be able to keep their wits about them when under the allure. In fact, the only adult we see truly lose it is the Egyptian referee who was having to deal with the effects of hundreds of Veela at once. And even then he was able to come out of it with some help, and was upset about it afterward.
- *House Elf Bonding:* While it was explicitly stated that "House Elves need to work", the exact nature of that need was never described. There is nothing in the books that talks about House Elves needing the magic of wizard families to sustain them.

What are some other fanfic tropes you've seen people confuse with canon?

Don't get me wrong, they clewrly neglected him with a heavy dose of emotional abuse and a light scattering of lhysical abuse for flavor (mostly dudly), but the boy giving cheek when instructed to get the mail isn't a boy who suffered concentration camp level starvation and abuse.

That's less than the average of postwar Germany immediately after the surrender. And Harry explicitly bemoans that he has way too little food in 92, and he is used to malnutrition.

I mean, the holidays shouldn't kill him, but that's low enough to do some permanent damage that would take a while to fix up (and the fact that there were no measures taken by the Hogwarts staff either implies gross incompetence or gross neglect on Pomfrey's side)

To be honest, I see this as JKR writing a children's fantasy trope (young tormented child turns out to be special and innately good despite it all) rather than treating her subject matter realistically. Harry (magically?) turning out to be a well adjusted kid is not proof that the Dursleys' abuse was minor.

I don't think you can make this argument, really. The narrative doesn't take /any/ of the abuse seriously.

The Dursleys literally locked him in his room and fed him through a cat-flap. They intended to keep him there for months. They also locked him in a spider-ridden cupboard that's small enough that an adult couldn't stand or lay in it. They starved him at points.

That's severely fucked up, but the books just look the other way.

I tend to assume Harry received full on hits, probably not actual beatings though.

You're assuming a cast-iron skillet-type frying pan, yes? That /is/ an implement of murder. And, fortunately, quite rare these days. I can assure you, however, a child can survive being hit quite hard with a - far more common - aluminium non-stick frying pan. I did.

I just wrote - and deleted - quite the rant based on personal experience about this sort of thing. One /hopes/ JKR was accurately describing the experience of being an abused child - it certainly rings very true - and not simply going for cheap hilarity about Harry having to live with cartoon monsters.

None of that says 'not a legitimate attempt to hit him'. Especially since the context is that Dudley has just run inside screaming that Harry is doing magic on him.

Barring that, the frying pan is wet and soapy. I'm too fond of my kitchen and my frying pan to try an experiment but I would hypothesise that swinging anything which is wet and soapy in a 'heavy blow' would lead to a higher than normal probability of accidentally letting go of the thing and having it hit someone /anyway/.

I don't think that the narative not treating it as a life-ending injury is a strong argument. Most, if not all abuse isn't treated as very serious in the series, wether that's just Rowling's style or because the series was primarily targeted towards younger children(in the beginning)

It's a popular theory, and one I personally believe, but as far as canon is concerned, the Ring didn't have a Compulsion Charm on it, and Dumbledore just cracked for a second at the idea that he could finally apologize to his dead sister and parents, and learn the truth about the former's death.

(It's not quite as OOC as it sounds; for one thing, one must consider that there were surely other magical protections on the Gaunt Shack that Dumbledore had fought his way through; he must have been pretty harrowed at that point.)

This is a fanon that launched a thousand bashes: that Dumbledore was conspiring to keep Harry traumatised, helpless, and pliable; that the Weasleys worship Dumbledore, and that Hermione worships Authority; that they are fair-weather friends.

However, he did no such thing. What he did was to ask Hermione and Ron not to put anything about the Order or current events into the letters. Ron and Hermione wrote to Harry regularly, and he wrote back.

Now, Harry was, in fact, very annoyed by their refusing to write anything about those topics. However, on balance, it was a very sensible precaution, since Owl Post can be intercepted (and likely Muggle post and telephone as well); the Ministry was actively looking for excuses to go after Harry and Dumbledore and would have /loved/ to get their hands on letters with something potentially incriminating; and, for that matter, Harry had a link of an unknown nature to the greatest legilimens alive.

***** "Pureblood aristocracy fics" are hardly a benchmark for what most likely would have happened. Inheritance was passed to the eldest /living/ son; it often went to a brother before a grandchild if there wasn't a suitable son. Anyhow, this is all conjecture, as I obviously noted by summing it all up with "maybe." And really, their father was most likely a wizard too, meaning that if he died of natural causes he would have lived to well over a hundred; almost certainly outliving his eldest sons who clearly died in their prime. That's a fair bit of "possibly", but it's hardly unlikely.

**** Or they lived in a part of Britain that practised tanistry inheritance, and the youngest brother was the one selected. Or they lived in some other part of Europe with another form of inheritance as standard. Primogeniture, from the Salic law of the Franks, was by no means universal - it wasn't the standard in England until Henry II's time, and the common law. In western Europe up to the 11th Century - when the surname Peverell is first recorded in England - you had the various Brehon codes of the old celts, the Frankish peoples and their Salic law, the moors of al-Andalus (Spain as we now know it wouldn't be a thing for a couple of centuries yet) used Sharia inheritance, mediaeval version. Christian Iberia was, IIRC, still on the Lex Visigothorum, and I've no idea off the cuff what non-Frankish Germany, Scandinavia, or the Italian and/or Papal states were doing.

Figuring out who the modern 'Heir Of' is when you're talking about a first millennium CE figure is a question of tracing several centuries of legal history across all the jurisdictions involved.

And that's /before/ you get things like Acts of Settlement by which the law is changed by the current legislature to exclude unwanted possible kings, Proscriptions that forbid entire families from leaving anything to their kids, including their surnames (see what happened to the Gregors, for instance), the list goes on.

*** Under male primogeniture the line would have passed to the youngest brother after his elder brothers died without producing male offspring. Since Harry is named Potter and not Peverell, and there is no mention of any contemporary wizard named Peverell, we can assume that the Peverells died out in the male line, so no living person has an absolute claim to the Peverell line. However the descendents of the youngest brother have the strongest claim and Harry having the Cloak indicates that he has the strongest claim overall (it was presumably handed down through the heirs).

So if a fanfiction author decides that the Peverell heir is somehow important despite the male line having died out, Harry probably does have the strongest claim.

However with absolute primogeniture, Voldemort would have the highest claim. Which one is used by wizarding culture (or magic itself) is unknown, so there isn't anything wrong about choosing whichever works best for your fanfic.

** Bonding/Familiars: Nope not a thing. Just some really smart pets.

Pagan/Occult Elements: Rowling has explicitly pointed out wizards/witches are religious in the way /we/ mean it, its just that many European countries including Britain have very little interplay with it in their daily lives.

Luna is not a seer/genius/savant: she is a conspiracy theorist raised by whack-a-doodle parents who suffered significant childhood trauma.

James was not a seeker: he was a chaser in canon, Rowling just dropped the ball by having him with a snitch in Snape's memory

Snape was teaching Harry Occlumency poorly: there is no indication whatsoever that Snape's method is somehow different from the way Occlumency is normally taught. People just want to say Harry only failed because Snape was terrible. Snape's an arse, but its far more likely Harry failed because he was not really trying/committed to learning it or never possessed the temperament in the first place.

The Cruciatus and Imperius Curses are also unblockable: wrong, its only the Killing Curse

Hermione is a genius: she just digs down and does the ground-work that all the other /teenagers/ blow off. She is the 1-in-20 students in high school who actually pushed themselves to reach their potential while the rest coasted through school. But she was not the next Dumbledore. Maybe the next McGonagall though.

As for occlumency, I conclude that they're both at fault. Snape is an asshole who's trying to teach something he's very good at to someone he hates; that by itself is a self sabotaging effort, because it's not hard for people who are good at something to forget how hard it is to be /not/ good at it, and Snape is inclined to think the worst of Harry. Harry, on the other hand, is having a very stressful year and is now forced to learn something he's very likely naturally bad at from someone he hates; ALSO a self sabotaging effort in the best of conditions.

**** This can only really be a semantic argument, given that we don't know what JKR considers to be genius. Would JKR call McGonagall a genius, for example? Because Hermione seems to be on more or less the same level as McGonagall (adjusted for age). But equally it seems clear that she's nowhere near the same level as Dumbledore or Voldemort, which is what I think most of the fandom means when they say "genius".

Hermione's greatest achievements all related to being able to cast already-existing magic:

- She copied Voldemort's Dark Mark using the NEWT-standard Protean Charm when in fifth year.

- She drew up a magical contract, a well-established form of magic.

- She brewed the Polyjuice Potion (a sixth year potion) in second year.

All of these are impressive to be sure, but I doubt most readers would call these "genius" or even "borderline genius". If JKR would do so, fine, but that's just a dispute over what to label something. Whatever you call it, the reality of her achievements is the same. That reality is that Dumbledore was publishing articles about magic in journals in his first few years at Hogwarts and Snape was inventing spells.

Hermione's reaction to Harry going "off-recipe" in HBP I think demonstrates the limits of her considerable intelligence: her skills revolve around being able to learn things quickly and understand advanced material. But she doesn't have that special, extra something that permits a person to bush the boundaries of magic, whether you call it intuition, natural talent, genius or whatever.

However, the way Slughorn described her talent at Potions makes it sound as though she just had a natural talent, like Queenie Goldstein had with legilimency. He described her as 'intuitive' and 'instinctive' which obviously means she did things without actually knowing why she was doing it. As to whether she experimented further with it is unknown to us. Potions might not have even been her hobby. But he also described her as 'one of the brightest I ever taught' so she obviously had /some/ intelligence, if only at Potions.

However, since the hat immediately put her in Gryffindor I don't think she had strong traits from the other houses and if she did have a secondary house, it would be Hufflepuff, not Ravenclaw or Slytherin. Her traits definitely line up with the traits of Hufflepuff. So she might have been particularly daring in that field of Potions based on her sorting.

Maybe if she weren't dead he'd have just told Harry 'oh your mother was natural at potions' and left it at that but the thing is Lily is now dead and a symbol of the war and a famous motherly figure to the Wizarding World. So naturally, Slughorn is going to try to make himself feel closer to her but he seemed genuinely sad about her death, and he obviously liked her personaity: charming, very funny, vivacious, brave, etc. Slughorn likes his status and connections, he's going to jump at every single opportunity to be connected to someone like her, a war hero and martyr.

But Slughorn picks people who would mount to higher places later on (Ginny became part of the Holyhead Harpies, Harry the Head of the Aurors, Hermione Minister for Magic, Gwenog Jones became a famous player, etc) so she might have potentially aimed to be a Hogwarts Professor, which isn't far out of the realm of possibility. So it'd be ridiculous to suggest that she wasn't talented to a degree. However, she was never stated to be a part of the Club. Maybe, just maybe, she was a part of it but only because Sluggy liked her that much. But that is highly unlikely. But she must have possessed some talent, even if she was aiming to become part of the Weird Sisters or work with Greta Catchlove.

Snape was unattractive and constantly described as ugly but he still pegged him down as the perfect student when he says 'not even you, Severus'.

Well.. in my head it's all sunshine and roses and everyone gets to be happy, prepare for diabetes: Dumbles travels back in time and makes sure his sister is not attacked. Okay, nice. His younger self is still at home during the summer and meets Gellert. Albus is not as frustrated as in canon and therefore critical about Gellert's ideas. Because he is more than a frustrated lovesick puppy, Gellert falls even more for Albus. They decide that they have to fight for their own right to love each other before anything else and become gay activists instead of power hungry war mongers. When their campaign is finally successful enough to allow gay people to have children, they put a spell on all orphanages in Britain to alert them, if there is any magical child without parents. Dingdingding! The alarm goes off on a certain 31. December and they adopt a boy named Tom Marvolo Riddle. They love and care for him in every possible way and because of that he grows up to be a super talented, but super nice top dude. Tom goes to Hogwarts, digs it, makes it head boy and decides to become a teacher. He becomes head of Slytherin house and takes good care of his little snakes. One day there is a certain Severus among them. Professor Riddle sees his problems, takes him under his wing and makes sure he is neither bullied nor mistreated. Severus is super proud that a teacher like Rom deems him worthy of recognition and develops some nice self esteem. He either stops liking Lily or wins her heart, idc. Same goes for James and the other marauders and just everyone. The population is super happy, there has not been a war in centuries and the old prejudices are slowly dying.

Everyone is nice and warm and loved.

The control thing is unusual, doesn't make it a sign of prodigious power. It's implied that /because/ Riddle was prodigious that he was able to do that. But the same can't be said about Lily.

Lily's and Riddle's levels were completey different. Lily's was solely all about movement (levitation and making the flower move) and Charms. Riddle, however, was moving things, inflicting pain on others, and could manipulate the minds of animals. I'd say they're pretty different levels.

James and Sirius were canonically the top of their year, though. And if you want to state that Lily was the most talented of her year, you don't have anyone to compare her to among her peer group so you have no proof she was more talented than either Sirius or James, even Lupin and Snape.

She states quite clearly in the books that the thrice defied incident was then escaping him three times. But if she didn't, but the fact is that she does, then it would be canon. However, the thrice defied comment is already in the books: escaping him three times.

And Molly would be described as talented. Every orphan would hear about how smart, talented, amazing, kind, blah blah blah, their dead mother is. You have no idea how much of a shock it was to my cousin when she researched her dead mother and found out she didn't even graduate high school when she was constantly described as smart. The thing is, it happens a lot and it's a sad reality we face.

#+begin_quote
  They weren't
#+end_quote

Except if it was just Lupin that said that, you'd have a point. However, Lupin's comments are supported by two Professors in their year: McGonagall and Slughorn. Slughorn calls Sirius a 'very talented boy' and it was a shame he couldn't have him. McGonagall calls them both 'exceptionally bright' and she taught transfiguration so both Sirius and James were equally talented at the subject. Sirius was talented enough for Dumbledore to easily accept that he was Voldemort's right hand man at just twenty one years of age. Dumbledore later calls Sirius clever. Their attitude by the lake later supports everything they say. So, when you have not one, or two, but three of their professors reinforcing what their friend says, I find it pretty hard to doubt what Lupin stated.

Sirius and James managed to become animagi by fifteen, starting only at twelve. Oh, and by the way, the three managed to brew three separate Animagus Potions, all by themselves. The Potion is regarded as very complex so Sirius and James were obviously skilled at the subject. Pettigrew needed all the help he could get. They created the Marauder's Map (most likely Sirius, since his Pottermore page says that he was skilled at Charms). You have no proof that Snape was better at them at Herbology, Transfiguration or Charms. Hell, you have no proof he was better at History of Magic. Or that Lily was, for that matter. You have no proof that Lily was better than Sirius at Charms as well.

Well do you have proof that they /didn't/ have control over their magic? Given how much we hear about them in the books, it wouldn't be unusual for them. We know that it's unusual but unusual doesn't correlate with prodigious power. Rowling made Riddle have it because he was supposed to be an all-around prodigy, no beating around the bush. She decided to give him every single unusual power to highlight it even at his youth. But I don't see how it could help once he has a wand and is seated around his classmates, he's their equal then and so is Lily. Besides, accidental magic is wandless magic, just not controlled. I'd like to see how Lily, Snape and the Marauders would fare between African Wizards. I'm not talking about Europe here, I'm talking about the average wizard worldwide. The average Native American wizard is as good as them. Europe isn't some kind of exclusive, high class minority. Besides, Fred Weasley is strongly hinted at to have control over his underage magic.

It seems to me you have a headcanon rating of Lily and Snape being the top of their year. You have some pretty solid arguments for Snape. Lily, however, you don't. So, it's your headcanon, but don't argue that it's canon. The only subject that Lily and Snape are confirmed to be at the top of that is Potions and Potions only. And Sirius and James were right behind them in that subject, might I add.

**************** Lily has raw power, but we don't know about talent and skill when it comes to the subjects. And the fact that they were only the best at Potions doesn't mean Sirius and James weren't among the best as well (see: Animagus Potion). So, it doesn't really contradict anything Lupin said. No teacher describes them as the best but when you have a) a teacher who is a Transfiguration mistress and was correcting Transfiguration articles as a young woman, winning awards for her own articles while still at school and b) a teacher that collects people for their exceptional talent, charm and connections claims he only wanted Sirius for his talent, regarding everything and not just a specific subject (unlike Lily, who he only talks about when it comes to Potions) and c) the most powerful wizard in the word calls him clever while he could've used any other flattering adjective all describe them as exceptional then I don't really think how Lupin could be lying (the in the entire school is hyperbolic but it could apply for the entire year, easily).

And what do we have about Lily during her school years? Talented at Potions and possibly, maybe Charms.

I know Snape is an accomplished wizard but I'm not comparing them in their adult years because, quite clearly, Snape is better as an adult. James died at only twenty one, Sirius imprisoned and then dead as well. I'm talking about their school years. You claimed Lily and Snape were the most talented of their year, with no real backing up or anything to compare it with while canon makes a stronger case towards Sirius and James then. After that it's unknown. You're listing Snape's accomplishments as an adult, comparing him to the Marauders when they were only fifteen. He altered potions as a student and made spells. The Marauders became animagi (without adult help, unlike Uagadou students) and created the Marauder's Map, which tracks out-of-time people and the Invisibility Cloak. Snape's historic achievements were later on in his life when the Marauders literally had no chance because, as I said, Lupin can barely afford food to eat, Sirius is on the run or imprisoned and James is rotting underground.

Stan Shunpike says that but no one else does. However, their behavior towards him supports it. Firstly, I don't really know how a twenty one year old would be in his Inner Circle and everyone pretty much accepted that Sirius was one of his most dangerous followers. It doesn't necessarily mean right hand, but among his most dangerous followers. If it were just a simple Death Eater on the run, I doubt all these security measures would've been taken. Say, someone like Jugson.

But it all really boils down to it you thinking Lily and Snape were the top for the reason Lily has raw power, but when it comes to Lily's talents and skills, you have no proof she was better than the Marauders (minus Pettigrew). Just because Riddle could do it, doesn't mean Lily was automatically more powerful than the Marauders. Riddle's diary closely mirrors the Marauder's Map on some aspects, does that make them as talented? No. And that Lupin isn't really reliable. But I guess we both just have different views of it and that's really it, and that's OK.

the only proof we have for them being the 'best' is a statement by lupin that they were the best at everything they did. his statement is wrong, because we know they're not the best at potions. slughorn, their teacher, never mentions them as the best. no one else mentions them as the best, just good. the only hard evidence of their skill by reputation is that they were good, not the best

the fact is this: we have hard evidence that snape is better than james and sirius at one subject: potions. we have zero evidence that they were better at him at any subject. if they can't beat him in the subject he's not best at it, why would i expect them to beat him in the subject he actually is best at? (DADA). that further degrades lupin's claim. herbology involves dealing with plants, something potions already involves. it's memorisation, manipulation and dealing with magical ingredients. i find it difficult to believe snape would be less than excellent at it. charms are just evil dark arts, which snape not only excelled at, but /invented/. the marauder act as a group, snape acted independently. inventing powerful magic (sectumsempra) seems a surer sign of talent than using pre-existing magic as a group. we can't say who contributed or how much they relied on the other. your best claim is transfig. the actual description of which is that it requires being exact and disciplined, all things snape is associated with

If you actually take their actions and achievements in the books seriously, then Hermione outsmarts Snape as a first year and solves the riddle of Slytherin's monster as a second year, beating Dumbledore who had fifty years and never managed it. More than enough "canon evidence" to place her as a genius.

By solving a riddle? Most readers of the book would have been able to solve the same riddle, given sufficient time. Are they all geniuses too now?

This is really stretching the meaning of genius to try to earn Hermione the description. Regardless, it doesn't really say anything about her ability with magic.

She had a key piece of information which Dumbledore lacked - most importantly, that Harry, a parselmouth, was hearing voices in the walls.

#+end_quote

No amount of intelligence will allow you to solve a mystery to which there is zero evidence. All Dumbledore had to go on was "there's a magical creature which can kill people and also cause petrification". That could be any number of creatures. The narrowing down to snakes is kinda vital.

And again, as I said above, it's a tangential point anyway, because it has no relevance to Hermione's magical abilities, which is presumably what people are referring to in the HP world when they call someone a genius.

(If you want to say that she's a genius at something other than magic, like golf, fine, but it's not really relevant to the discussion at hand).

#+end_quote

Why? Do we have any evidence that the "tasks" were intended to stop a person attempting to gain access to the stone? To me it seems quite clear that they are not. Flitwick provided a key to his locked door. McGonagall allowed anyone who could win at chess to pass. Quirrell provided a troll, which is far from the most dangerous magical creature you could acquire to guard something. Snape made a riddle which was entirely solvable. The purpose of all of these seems to be *delay*, not some kind of insurmountable barrier.

The only protection which seems to be genuinely intended to stop someone in their tracks is the Mirror of Erised. Which is quite enough all on its own to stump even Voldemort.

Aka "I'm going to repeat my position without engaging with the arguments made."

As I have already said, the "word of god" is meaningless without the context to know what JKR considers to constitute "genius". And the canon evidence clearly points to Hermione falling well short of the magical abilities of Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, etc.

There is evidence. The evidence is that there is a creature*, and it cases petrification. This lets you narrow the suspects down to magical creatures that cause petrification, as opposed to everything. You stated the evidence right after saying there was none.

Evidence has a definition in math. Evidence for H is any E such that P(E|H)>P(E), in other words evidence is something that is more likely to be seen if your hypothesis is true as opposed to randomly. The evidence here is everything that leads them to think it's an animal, and the petrification of students.

Ok, I don't care about the rest of this conversation so don't rope me into it, just wanted to clear that up. Personally I think the HP books are rather poorly written when it comes to story consistency, so as a rule I don't debate about them.

********** Seems to me you're describing yourself there.

You're latching on to a single thing JKR said -- the meaning of which is unclear -- and refusing to consider any attempt to identify the meaning of her statement. Instead you prefer to make a semantic argument which flies in the face of a pile of canon evidence that Hermione is nowhere near as magically skilled as Dumbledore/Voldemort/Snape.

I'll try to break it down one last time for you, since you seem to be struggling to understand.

JKR: "Hermione is a borderline genius."

Fandom: "Dumbledore is a genius."

You: "This means Hermione must be borderline Dumbledore-level!"

The logical error you are committing is assuming that what JKR means by "genius" is the same thing as what the fandom means by "genius". But just because they are using the same word it does not mean they are referring to the same set of skills. Relying entirely on the fact that the same word is being used is an empty, semantic argument.

If we want to actually discuss the substance of the matter, then what matters are Hermione's demonstrated skills, not the word you use to describe them. And Hermione's demonstrated skills are well short of Dumbledore, Voldemort (magical geniuses by the fandom definition) and Snape (a borderline magical genius by the fandom definition).

Now, you can continue to call Hermione a borderline genius if you like. That's fine -- we'll just all have to keep in mind that you're using the word in a different way to the rest of the fandom. But it doesn't magically upgrade her skills to a level above that shown in canon.

*********** If we go by what's shown in the books, Dumbledore and Voldemort are inept morons whose "master plans" would be laughed at by six-year olds. They are dropping the ball so often, an NBA pro would be hard-pressed to match their speed by bouncing the ball. And yet, you go with "they're supposed to be geniuses, so they are geniuses", despite canon evidence to the contrary (that Dumbledore didn't pass on the information hidden in the gifts for the trio directly a few months before his death is just one of the most obvious cases of plot-induced stupidity). But that's fine - JKR fucked up characterisation in favour of plot progression all over the place. But to turn around then, and go "Hermione's not a genius cause canon action and we can't know what JKR meant with genius" is hypocritical, and I'm really wondering why you're so stuck on bashing the muggleborn witch. It's not as if "genius" means everyone is equal. You could as well have said "she's borderline genus, but not on Dubmledore's level". Yet you go far below that, and even dismiss canon feats just to support your stance.

************ None of this has any impact on the magical abilities of the characters in question. If you want to say that certain characters made poor decisions, fine - I probably disagree, but that's a discussion for another time. But mastery of a subject matter (i.e. genius) and making good choices are two very different things.

And I don't see how anything I've said could be considered bashing. In this chain of comments I have referred to Hermione as "impressive" and as having "considerable intelligence". Being realistic and refusing to wank a character beyond their canonical demonstrated traits is not bashing.

Especially since you usually defend canon no matter how obviously stupid it is, instead of tearing it down or dismissing it. Especially since the chain of comments started in response to a comment that Hermione was just a hard worker in school. This is and was about her intelligence.

#+end_quote

While I agree he was strong-willed, in /Goblet of Fire/ wasn't he prepared to jump from the Minister's Box to impress them at the Quidditch World Cup?

#+begin_quote
  But a hundred Veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was answered for him. Veela were women...the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen...except that they weren't - they couldn't be - human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind...but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human - in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.

  The Veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the Veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen...

  As the Veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed like a good idea...but would it be good enough?

Later in Goblet, Fleur's allure is clearly strong enough to affect a significant number of the teenage boys in at least some way. Ron is directly affected a few times, and then during the ball Roger is described as being kind of vacant as Fleur's date.

During the school year though, Harry seems almost completely resistant to Fleur's allure, but so do all of the adults. There could be other reasons for that, we don't know the details of veela very much. Harry is pretty preoccupied the entire time Fleur is in the castle.
