Does a fic like that exist? Voldy would gain popularity by employing the werewolves and the centaurs and find some way to feed the dementors artificial depression or something, so he'd have them on his side. And then he'd get into politics and slowly weave anti-muggleborn laws into his agenda.

Or he'd found a centre that would employ Hogwarts drop-outs, help them figure out what they are actually talented at, and gain politic support that way.

I guess Riddle was poor since he's part Muggleborn though, so how he'd finance all that?

**** I haven't read that fic, but it was started around the time OotP was released. I don't think one can use it as an example of good Dementors that should be given rights. While the Dementors are shown to be horrible already by OotP, it isn't until HBP that we really understand the true evil of Dementors, when horcruxes are revealed and the importance of the soul is underscored. Notably, in the summer of 1996, or between OotP and HBP is when the Dementors change allegiance to Voldemort.

Sapience is, more or less, the ability to reason. Sentience is mostly just having a brain that allows you to feel/perceive things around you.

And, of course, these animals have rights. I'm pretty sure it's illegal to arbitrarily abuse most animals. However, you'll not often find someone who knows what they're talking about suggest that we allow them to vote.

It's a nice thought, but unfortunately it's mentioned that they /feed/ on souls. You could say they're similar, in that regard, to a vampire. Except for the fact that vampires could, potentially, feed on donated blood. You're not likely to find someone willing to donate their soul.

To be honest, as abhorrent as it is, other than straight up genocide, I'm not sure that there's a perfect compromise other than allowing dementors to feed on the worst dregs of society.

I think it's absolutely immoral, yes, but we're talking about a fictional, sapient creature, here, and genocide is, also, immoral.

So they could feel that there /were/ emotions in there, but couldn't really feed on them (hence why being a dog helped Sirius resist their forceful feeding).

A more secure solution would be that volunteer humans would get /paid/ for standing around letting Dementors take a little bit of happiness from them at a time (of course, provided the Dementors are careful and don't do any permanent damage, with severe legal penalties for the Dementors if they break that "code of conduct").

I would say, try to bargain with the brighter specimens, make them see that taking /fresh/ emotions from new people (in limited quantities) is still better than trying to squeeze a few last drops out of clinically depressed prisoner whom they've been feeding on for years.

Then, to make sure no Dementor gets any wise ideas about "going all out", make law strictly apply to Dementors and set a harsh penalty for breaking the "code of conduct" of feeding times. (Imprisonment for going too far and causing mental damage; a death penalty if they try for the Kiss.)

And in the long run, educate the new "generations" of Dementor on ethics.

**** Yes, but are dragons actively hunting down humans to murder and eat? Dementors actively prey on humans, and condemn them to a fate worse than death. Right now, it is normal for humans to kill animals that are shown to specifically be man-eaters. Dementors ought to be treated just the same, not granted some rights for just being a lesser magical creature.

***** Hm.

I wonder what muggles would think about all this. Since, I assume they have breeding programs for nearly extinct animals in JK's universe just like they do in this universe.

I'd say there must be some depression-inducing spell (maybe to ward off muggles and other wizards) that they could use to feed the human-preying creatures without any actual people involved

** It is a rather nice thought. Giving rights to Dementors. Too bad it doesn't even a sliver chance in hell of passing through voting. And not just because pureblood faction or something equally "bad". Dementors have the ability to feed on Humans. Dementors are predators of humans. And humans are sore losers. If they could somehow kill Dementors they could have hunted down them to the extinction. Humanity is not something inherently "Good" or "Bad". But it is "the survivor". Even in real life, we humanity hunted down our predators to extinction to not worry about them anymore. The reason we are able to have so much comfort of modern life is that we hunted down all of the immediate predators in our environment. If the wizards or humans of the HP world had the ability effect the dementors, they would have been killed to the last one they could find and not stop untill all of them were dead.
