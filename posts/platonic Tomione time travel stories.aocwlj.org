I recently came across LeighaGreene's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11151311/1/Fall-Back-1940][Fall Back - 1940]], and now I'm looking for any Hermione-travels-back-to-Riddle's-school-days fics which let Tom and Hermione become allies without romance or sex.

I like a good Tomione as much as the next person, but seriously, even in stories where they're raised together as siblings, it still somehow ends up with sex, and don't get me started on the one where Hermione is Tom's teacher.

Why are they never allowed to just be allies or whatever?


** I don't know that I've come across too many of these yet, BUT this is one of my favs that fits that description: linkao3(272360)

Also you may like Birds of a Feather, the author writes Tom as very asexual. linkao3(15996890)

*** Thank you very much! I've started reading both birds of a feather and red right hand, and I like them a lot. Also, I've read Century Maker before; I agree it was very good.

**** I will warn you, Birds does look to be leaning towards a ship, and I have to correct myself as Tom is not asexual, but actually aromantic. So it is possible they hook up haha but its WIP rn and slow burn.

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy in an orphanage who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms between them---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend".But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle.1930's-40's Childhood Friends AU.

  The war didn't end when Harry and Voldemort fell. Hermione refuses to feel helpless any longer, and goes back in time to remove the scar that an unloved Tom Riddle left on the wizarding world. Tangled in the pureblood sphere, will Hermione just become another cog in Tom Riddle's plans? Final pairing is a secret! But not a Tomione. Lestrange OC. Parent!Hermione Child!Tom. COMPLETE!

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
