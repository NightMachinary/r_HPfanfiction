Hey guys!

I'm looking for a Hermione/any male character who isn't Ron-- Draco or Snape preferred, but anyone will do-- where their relationship deals with the "Mudblood" scar on her arm. In some fics I've read, it's vaguely mentioned and then totally abandoned, and I'd like to read something where it's really addressed.


** Here's one!
