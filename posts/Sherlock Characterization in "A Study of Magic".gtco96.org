I'm still on Chapter 1, where Sherlock makes this deduction:

#+begin_quote
  You're the headmaster of a boarding school, and Professor McGonagall is your deputy. So far, obvious. *The school in which you work in uses an old building*. Medieval castle, probably, definitely made of stone and marble and has a large grass courtyard. You haven't just taught my generation. You also taught my parents' generation at the very least. Both of you wear robes and broad-brim hats regularly and *use quills instead of pens, parchment instead of paper*. But the key item that identifies who and what you are is in your jacket pocket; the instrument through which you are able to, for the lack of better word, perform spells such as '*stupify' and 'obliviate*'.

  Your school is specifically designed for training individuals who have the power to perform 'spells'. But that's not all. You don't just train children and send them back. No, *your school acts as a gateway, so that a child possessing this power can enter a hidden society entirely made up of people possessing this power*. Your job is to convince those not born in the society to join it---by offering a place in your school.

How exactly does Sherlock make this deduction? In the first chapter, there are no clues that give away what Hogwarts look like or what spells sound like, so Sherlock shouldn't have been able to figure that out. Is there a backstory to be explained, or is it just OOC sherlock? Just wanted to ask because characterization is important to me.


** He's had some knowledge due to Mycroft and high-end muggle government being aware of magical world, i think he specifically looked through databases for the part with people disappearing from muggle world but not being reported as disappearances, and he had some encounters with aurors before because he's had Harry. They obviously failed to obliviate him, but he knows those spells because they propably tried casting them.

The deduction from the first part you highlited i'm pretty sure he explains later on

** It's been a while since I read it, but IIRC this wasn't entirely down to deduction, but him previously being aware of the magical world. I think he was aware because of Mycroft.
