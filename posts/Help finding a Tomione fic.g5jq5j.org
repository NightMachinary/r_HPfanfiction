:END:
I read this Tomione fic a long time ago on ffn.net. It was pretty cracky. I remember they were in some kind of support group and at first Tom doesn't have a nose but then he gradually grows it back. Hermione and Tom bicker a lot but she can't help but find him attractive.

Help is much appreciated!
