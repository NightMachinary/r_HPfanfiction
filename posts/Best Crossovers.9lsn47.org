I'm seeing some posts asking about crossovers with specific fandoms, so let's see some crossovers you've always wanted to share but never had anyone asking.

linkao3(5030443)

Here's a good HPxBleach crossover, told from the Bleach perspective for the most part. Quite entertaining and funny.


** linkffn(7156582) That which holds the Image.

It's a Doctor Who crossover where an encounter with a Weeping Angel as a kid causes them to become Harry's greatest fear. So if you know your Weeping Angels, you'd that when Harry's boggart turns into one during their first DADA class in third year, no one is safe.

The whole fic is well written but there is one chapter towards the end that is perfectly tense and horrifyingly good. It does have a sequel that is almost as good although that's taking a lot longer for the author to finish.

** I will forever recommend Mischief's heir. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]]

â€‹

Summer after first year Harry is locked in his room and makes a prayer to Loki who decides to answer it. It's a series, it's completed, and it's a wonderful ride that involves families of choice, kids reaching their full potential and being little innovative geniuses, independent Harry, restored Tom Riddle, magic, science, space programs, and so much more. It's amazing and I adore it so much I have trouble putting it into words.

  When Arthas seized the Frozen Throne, he cast aside both his humanity and the remnants of Ner'zhul. The Guardian sealed away the spirit of the former Lich King in another world, entrusting them to Albus Dumbledore. Now, however, Ner'zhul has ensnared a new host: Lord Voldemort. With two worlds threatened, heroes are brought to Azeroth to cast down both Lich Kings once and for all.

  Ichigo's been ordered to go undercover at a magic school to bodyguard a kid named Harry Potter, and this would be fine, except that he's about as good at bodyguarding as he is at magic. And he considers it a good day, magic-wise, if he hasn't set anything on fire.

harry potter x sword art online

the harry potter timeline is shifted up accordingly, and the general world around it is transformed into some kind of weird mega crossover clusterfuck including, most weirdly, ALF. the sitcom about that puppet alien that eats cats

but i still like it. the mega crossover elements dont enter into it much until you get to the sequels
