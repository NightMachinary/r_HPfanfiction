I'm not looking for crossovers I'm looking for a fic where Harry looses his memory, and works to get it back. I've never seen it but I would think it would make an interesting premise.


** I can see some major issues here. The largest is that magic in canon typically requires intimate knowledge of how the spell works. And if you don't remember such things then how do preform them? From what i remember from the bourne series, jason has an innate knowledge of how things are done. And several intense memories. So Harry would know how to play quidditch for example but be un aware how it would be done.

*** Real amnesia can be pretty weird, so wiping out personal information and identity but leaving skills (and memories of them) intact isn't entirely implausible. It could possibly [[http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_retrograde.html][happen]] in that way because different memories are stored in different places.

The reality is more [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/forget-everything-you%E2%80%99ve-ever-known-about-amnesia/][complex]] than that, of course, but that's more rambling than I want to do.

Anyway, having use of a modified Memory Charm or one that didn't work as intended could easily inflict amnesia, including one with more "control" in what was deleted or locked away.

  It's been four years since Harry Potter woke up in a strange city, with no memory. Harry begins an unexpected journey to uncover who he is and what he's left behind. Turns out Harry has broken a lot of promises he doesn't remember making. Will he ever regain his memories? Will he ever be able to live up to any of his promises?

** This /is/ indeed an interesting premise, so I searched for fics that might fulfill your criteria. I didn't mind anything that seems to fit /exactly/, but I did find some interesting looking ones that look very close. One even seems to take inspiration from the Bourne series.

*A Note of Caution*: As I haven't read them very deeply beyond a few chapters atm, I make no assurances of quality and/or completeness.

Edit: Since I'm too tired/stupid to use the bot properly right now, I'll just link things directly below.

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8914586/28/Harry-Potter-Junior-Inquisitor]]). Memory modifications. Mightnot be what you want.

There is another one where Potter loses his memories (not sure if obliviate or amnesia), and then befriends Draco instead of just Ron/Hermione, but i cant remember what it is called. I think it was a 4th year fic, but i'm not sure.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11674317/1/When-Harry-met-Wednesday]]) has Dumbledore doing major personality rewrites, including memory modifications. Not quite what you are looking for, but...

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.
