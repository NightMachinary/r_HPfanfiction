I had big plans for today to hang out with a group of people but for the second time this week everybody canceled. Now I just want a story (preferably non-slash) that will make me feel warm and take some sadness away.

Edit: I forgot a word.

** I was gonna suggest a bunch of stories off my favs (roughly a third) but honestly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3215565/1/The-Colour-of-Autumn][this one is one]] of the sweetest stories I've read.

*** The color of autumn is really sweet. The lake I fish at has a similar space and this described it way better than I could.

****** I'm almost always glad to help and even if im not ill help anyway so no worries. Gold doesn't mean much to me anyway. If you want some more I was pretty much just going through my favorites page and picking the one shots (sort by number of chapters) that were positive. You most likely will be able to figure out which ones are upbeat just by the summary if you want to try looking on your own. My profile is the same as my reddit user, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Enedryos][NedryOS]].

** Here are a couple of stories that I love:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][This]] is a short story about how Harry and Ginny's children were named. It's pretty funny.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][This one]] is a wonderful 'what if' story about what could have happened if Petunia had taken Harry in as a son.

I'm also a big fan of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]. It's *very* long and a bit angsty but I love it so much. It's an alternate version of Harry's 5th year.

*** /The Wendell That Wasn't/ is one of my all-time favorites. Contains my favorite Snape line in the fandom:

"Your spawn is evil and must die. Drown it before it turns on us all with destructive, murderous rage."

** One of the best Lily & James fanfics I have read is called Priori Incantatem by fellytone. It has made me laugh, it has hit me right in the feels, and it has made me feel anger towards characters (Peter Pettigrew anyone?) You should go check it out! I highly recommend it. It is a completed story, 64 chapters. The link is right here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1541401/1/]]

Edit: I had provided the wrong link, sorry!
