Moody got away with his dustbins, and all his other illegal enchanted things, and Crouch!Moody got away with transfiguring Draco, practising Unforgivables on students, carrying out "searches" on Snapes office, and so on, and doesn't seem to get so much as a warning. I get that teachers are hard to come by, and it was a very busy time, but I'd like to see a fic done in the style of linkffn(petrification proliferation) where all this is dealt with properly, and Arthur and Dumbledore don't cover up because he's a good guy.


** It is hard to see how that wouldnt just become a 'Crouch got found out early' fic. I am pretty sure I read a few of those, although it is usually more along the lines of "smart student figured out he was drinking polyjuice from flask"

One possible way to go about this is to have a badass Moody who reacts poorly when he is told what his replacement did. "Let me get this straight, my replacement used unforgivable on students, transformed a student into a ferret .... What kind of school are you running Dumbledore?" Then he goes and gets a team of investigators and digs up all the shit the school has burried.....

*** While you have a point, he wouldn't necessarily be caught. He'd just have a much more frustrating time of it. I mean, no one found his behaviour odd, so it's not that I think disciplinary action would out him. I just think he got away with far too much, because he was a valued veteran, essentially. McGonagal let him drag Malfoy off with only a pitiful attempt at reprimanding Moody, after he admitted to blatantly ignoring the code of conduct the teachers apparently have. No wonder no one bothered going to her about Umbridge.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
