I've read a Cadmean victory (add Basilisk venom), but I'm looking for more interesting stories where Harry wields a wand other than the one he first gets.\\
It's fine if it's the elder wand, as long as it's well written.\\
An example would be Griffon Reborn, where Harry uses a Bloodwood wand with Thunderbird Core feather.

I'd really prefer if it were well written.

** Linkffn(harry potter and the riders of the apocalypse) has a different wand that Ollivander has to constantly change/update although I'm not even halfway so it's a tentative rec.

Linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) is one of my favourite fics with a dangerous wand that other people can't stand to touch. Lots of people don't like this fic because they apparently have too much going on in their lives to judge it on more than the first chapter or two. If you're going to complain to me about recommending this please give it a decent shot first.

Linkffn(Harry potter and the prince of slytherin) has the wand unidentified but I don't think it's what you're looking for.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway, yet miraculously he lives. Even so, the question of how remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

While we're on this topic there is a fic where Ollivander kicks Harry out of the shop with a visceral hatred after none of the wands match. He complains about picky or elitist customers wanting fancy or different wands and has a go at Harry when he asks for help with something else. I distinctly remember a nasty Ollivander. Can anyone help?

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

Rocking the Boat has probably the most interesting custom wand idea I've seen yet. Probably hella cliche by now since I started reading the sequel recently and I was rather disappointed by it.

My Darkness Ascendant has pencil focuses and will eventually have the gun and gauntlet focuses I mention in the precursor to DA(Darkness Within) in the Drabbles.
