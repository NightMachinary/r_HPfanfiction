A shower thought that occurred to me... Writing my first fanfic I realized that readers are increasingly demanding and with reason, I consume A LOT of fanfic and want to read quality stuff too, but being on the other side is a really big challenge. There are many unfurnished fics for several reasons, but I think the main one (mainly those covering 7 years) is the difficulty of finding ways to close the story in a cohesive with the construction of the author's arches, and in a new way.

It is a book that is very open to criticism but also difficult to be rewritten


** Horcruxes are the worst thing to happen to fanfiction in the entire series. Some authors feel like they have to include the canon ones, and almost inevitably write a boring predictable plot. Some authors try to mix them up a bit, which at best results in...pretty much the same thing as canon. The best stories tend to throw them out altogether, but that generally involves a lot more original world-building (if they never existed), or comes across as checking off a box (if they somehow mitigate them all at once).

Also, people tend to write endings in year seven, and endings are hard. But I still think Horcruxes are a major factor.

** In my opinion as someone who wrote fics NOT of HP, but reads HP fics more than other fandoms- I myself find that 7 (and the ending parts of book six) seem to be the hardest to find a good fic that isn't a full redo.

A majority of my favorite fics that seem to enter book 7, try and change where some of the objects are found, if they even keep the Horcrux plot in at all! One of the more commonly used changes I've seen is that the old orphanage does have a Horcrux when the Trio starts hunting. I've also seen a few where they keep the locations the same, but change how they are retrieved. (I've seen some where they don't Have to break into the bank, they have someone cast Impero and get Bella to do it herself, some where the Room just drops the Diadem in someone's lap, Ect.)

My opinion is just that- an opinion. But I myself feel like the whole ‘on the run while hunting' was done well enough by Rowling, that it all kinda feels the same when fics do it. Yes there was a LOT of filler in the tent in the book, but the hunt felt like it was done well enough to me.

Another big issue I've seen is when people try and figure out what to do with Umbridge and the whole MoM. Most fics just have Kreatcher kidnap her and move on, because not many writers seem to want to do the ministry scene.

TLDR I agree the whole of book 7 is hard to find good fics for, and it also has a lot of cliche fics- but it also has some of the most creative ‘away from cannon' fics I've seen.

** The best fics I know that manage to pull off 7 years (plus or minus) tend to do two things:

- Develop a way to slay Voldemort that makes horcruxes irrelevant.
- Make sure that their way is /at least/ as challenging to the protagonists as what happened in canon.

** Some of the events in book seven need the characters to hold onto the idiot ball, and some need them to be eerily prescient or very lucky. That doesn't help when reworking the plot.

I haven't written a single fixit yet where I managed to get the trio into the tent hunting horcruxes to rework that particular section of the plot, because there are always a thousand easier, more sensible things that any of the entire cast of characters could go and do, that take out Harry's 'years in the wilderness' at dozens of different points in the proceding story.
