There's "The many deaths of Harry Potter", but surprisingly that's all I can think of at the moment.


** :o This is actually a pretty good idea! :) It could be so interesting to see harry's thoughts and opinions differ because of this! :o Would this be before Hagrid told him about magic, or in the month after he met him in August but still before he actually started at hogwarts? :)

*** Thanks, I thought it would be good divergence point kind of thing.

I was thinking before Hagrid told him. Perhaps several years before. Just... no real idea that magic actually exists until a couple of evil masked wizards kill his cousins and nearly him as well. In come the Aurors or the Order or Dumbledore, there's a short but intense magical battle that gives little Harry a fair amount of PTSD, and he's apparated away.

** A Study In Magic: linkffn(7578572)

The Dursleys get killed in one of Moriarty's "challenges". Harry's first contact with the Wizarding World is Aurors trying to stun/obliviate his new adoptive parents (which happen to be Sherlock Holmes and female!John Watson).

It's not quite a good fit (he still gets a more normal introduction later on and isn't really affected by the attempts to obliviate his adoptive parents), but he's slightly more wary than in canon.

*** Thanks.

You're right, it's not a perfect fit but it is pretty good. Though I kinda had to drop it when it got to the Watson wank. Regularly beating Aurors, trouncing Snape in sparring, Snape trembling at the thought of how powerful Watson would be at peak health.

**** There's kind of a reason for it if I remember things right.

That's not to say the fic doesn't have problems - Watson and Sherlock do get wagged quite a bit - but overall I enjoyed it.

Summary: Harry Potter, tragic hero, and Hermione Granger, unpopular bookworm, may not know each other at first, but they have one big thing in common: they don't sleep out of fear. Will they learn to overcome their fears or stay awake?

** welp. I didn't need another plot bunny, but thanks anyway. Lmao. But for real I love this question and I don't think I've seen any like it.

I'll save this post so that if the story is publishable. I'll credit you with the prompt. (Though just a warning I'm super slow so it could be a year) Are you on ao3?
