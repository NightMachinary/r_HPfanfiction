Cn someone find me some good, well-written Harry Potter fanfics which are anti-Pureblood or for muggles, where they help out or have logic, unlike wizards. I would love a story where muggles use logic to help Harry or where the wizarding world is forced into the twenty-first century. Thanks!

**** I doubt it, DLP keeps reviewing his new fics and generally puts them in "Almost Recommended" section. People there seem to dislike his Hermione centric approach, they would rather see Harry at the center of actions.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]] may be the kind of story you are looking for. It features a Harry raised by muggles to help them drag the wizarding world kicking and screaming into the modern age after a fed up Margret Thatcher meets a squib soldier. It is however on going, though it seems to be updating with a fair amount of frequency.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11500936/1/Long-Live-The-Queen][Long Live the Queen]]

A recently finished truly excellent story where Harry and Sirius turn to HRH Elizabeth II for aide and get it and more. Doesn't go the full distance of muggle/wizarding integration, but it does show purebloods getting the massive beating they justly deserve. The legal stuff and portrayal of the queen seems to be spot on to me, and the writing is top notch.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]] has quite a bit of what you want, but I'm not entirely sure, so don't take my word for it.

Aside from that, there's linkao3(1149623), "Disillusion, by Hermione Granger", and linkffn(5492188), "Doubting Thomas", for oneshots that work with muggles/are anti-pureblood (respectively).

*** "Emperor" is definitely not anti purebloods because blood purity no longer mattered in this AU. [[/spoiler][Even Voldemort was busy recruiting Muggles or seeking Muggle allies. I believe Hermione was the vice minister of the independent Wizard nation, while Colin Creevey became a rapid anti Muggle zealot after his parents were killed. France was the most anti magical country in Europe, and Gabrielle led the magical resistance group Redemption.]]
