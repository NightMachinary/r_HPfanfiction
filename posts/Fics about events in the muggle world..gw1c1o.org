This was originally going to be a request but I decided that I wanted to hear some input from other people about this topic as well.

One of my favourite fics is one in which Harry goes back in time and ends up adopting Tom Riddle and fighting against Grindlewald, it being my favourite because it integrated Grindlewald's war effort with WW2 and both were very interconnected and how also expanded on the wizard geopolitics of the era with the different countries.

Now, aside from that fic, I haven't found any that have done this which is surprising, considering the changes that were happening in the Muggle world during the duration of the series. The Soviet Union was collapsing/collapsed, the apartheid regime in South Africa was falling apart, Reagan had redefined politics in the USA. Even when you go back to the First Wizarding War, the Vietnam War has just ended, different African nations were fighting in revolutions against their colonial overlords and social movements were at their peak.

So now, have you encountered any fics who explore simultaneous muggle events? Why do you think this doesn't seem to be covered? Would you like more of them or are they tedious/annoying?


** One of many great things of linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) is how it manages to incorporate events of the external world into the story (particularly the genocide of Rwanda and the Great Storm of 1987 are fully incorporated into the story, but the fall of the Soviet Union and other world events are mentioned as well).

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?
