I'm reading through Tom Riddle time travel fanfictions on AO3 + Fanfiction.net, and...while I enjoy a lot of them, something like 99% of them (based on me reading basically /all/ of them, particularly Tom Riddle/Hermione Granger ones) have “Tom Riddle and his gang / cronies” be “anti-Gryffindor”, or have “a rivalry with Gryffindor”, “being sworn enemies with Gryffindor”, or even have them publicly duelling in the halls with Gryffindors...sometimes in front of professors.

Did people forget that Tom Riddle was basically - easily - able to befriend a young Gryffindor (Hagrid) in the books during his school days, with no one questioning it at all? Not even any of the other Gryffindors?

Or that Tom Riddle was pretty much “well-beloved” by not only the staff and faculty, but probably by the rest of the student body? Enough that he was in the Slug Club, a Prefect, Head Boy, “well-liked”, “admired”, viewed as a sympathetic / pitiable “poor, but brilliant [and handsome] orphan” (as per teenage Tom himself in /Chamber of Secrets/), and awarded a trophy for “Special Services to the School”...

...and no one bloody well suspected him of [doing] /anything/ [wrong].

So why, then, do all of these fanfictions all have the Gryffindors “not trusting Tom” or “being against him”, or even “trying to bring him down”? Based on existing canon, this literally makes no sense.

The Gryffindors of Tom's time would have no reason to distrust Tom...no reason to think that he wasn't telling the truth. He was a Prefect; a “star student”; one of Slughorn's (along with other professors') favorite pupils; and “poor, but brilliant, charming, handsome, charismatic”...and yes, even friendly and likeable.

Tom said it himself in Chamber of Secrets: “I've always been good at charming others to get what I want.” (paraphrased)

Have people forgotten how easily Tom Riddle was able to befriend Ginny Weasley - a younger Gryffindor - via his Diary? How easily he was able to befriend a young Rubeus Hagrid - another Gryffindor?

How Harry Potter himself - yet another Gryffindor - thought that Tom was his “friend”, until Tom himself decided to reveal his true intentions?

So why, then, do so many fanfictions involving teenaged Tom Riddle have him as this “sullen, rude, blunt, unlikeable, antisocial, anti-Gryffindor” person...when we know, from the books, that this simply wasn't the case?

Doesn't anyone find it at /least/ bit unrealistic that Tom Riddle and any of his “friends” would have some sort of “anti-Gryffindor” bias, much less publicly fighting with them, in front of a professor, at times?

I've been thinking about bringing this up as a criticism on several of them, but I'm really not sure how well the authors will take it.

--------------

/(Not to mention barely, if any, of these fanfictions even bother to dip a toe into actually getting a historically accurate 1940's setting, but that's a whole other issue in itself.)/


** I don't recall Tom and Hagrid being friends in canon, they knew of each other though. But yeah, I agree.

If you want a pretty good timetravel to Riddle's Hogwarts years (from the perspective of Riddle), check out linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB).

EDIT: Also, look people. A /rant/ that would have been worthy of the name.

*** I really like (the idea of) Riddle fics. It's a shame that so many of them are unrepentant garbage with the same storyline and the [[insert love interest of choice]] just taking his shit because he's /really, really, ridiculously good-looking/.

And too many of those stories commit the cardinal sin of being boring. Tom Riddle has a lot of background that goes virtually untapped. I mean, he grows up in the Great Depression in an era where orphanages were notoriously nasty, lives through WWII and the Grindelwald era, then later does mysterious Dark Magic in Europe as he steadily gathers power and knowledge. And that's just what I can think of off the top of my head.

/Realignment/ seems pretty damn interesting, though.

It is still being written and there is the divergent element, but if that is not enough to make you reject it then I recommend taking a look. And for bonus points it does have Tom befriending a Gryffindor.

Fanon.

Some fic somewhere popularized this /obvious psycho/ Riddle characterization and others followed suit. The movies could play a part too -- a lot of those fics you talk about depict Riddle as having blue eyes, not dark, which is a movie thing. I suspect that some people see the films, then add Voldemort's traits to a younger Riddle, book characterization be damned.

*** I just posted a list of authors in another thread, but most of them are Volmione, not Tomione :

LadyMiya, Nerys, SerpentInRed, uchiha.s, Lunalelle, sharkdiver1980, ObsidianPen, Speechwriter, Winterblume, HarmonyB, larissalee, and Shan84.

Those are the ones I remember off the top of my head. LadyMiya is my personal favorite, especially Shared Flame (Volmione). For Tomione, Tied for Last has already been recommended, so I'd say Ultima Ratio by Winterblume : [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/420124/chapters/700131]]

Another poster is right, more often than not their relationship is full on abusive and some authors portray it as if it's normal. I personally prefer fics where Hermione is older, so it's often Volmione. I love when she fights back and they end up in a relationship that has defaults, but there's a common understanding of the way things are, and Voldemort ends up respecting her.

Another one I love is Blood and Gold, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10643571/chapters/23549517]] , it's new and the updates are relatively regular. It's the first time I find a good HG/TR fic where Hermione doesn't go back in time to go to school with Riddle, they're both a bit older and for now it looks very interesting.

EDIT : and how could I have forgotten The Scientist by uchiha.s ?! It's a no magic AU, Hermione is in law school and Tom is her teacher. It's seriously one of the best fics I have ever read of this pairing, but it's very AU and very different from some common characterization of Tom. But he's still a "bad"guy with dubious morals and such. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7499274/1/The-Scientist]]

** The best characterisation of Tom Riddle that I've read is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9081608/2/Fire-Born][Firebord]]. Sadly it's abandoned, but still worth the read.
