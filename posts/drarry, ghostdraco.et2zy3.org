:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
help! i lost this really good fic and i can't find it. i remember most of the plot, so i'll give you guys a summary:

harry works as an auror and lives with andromeda and teddy in 12th grimmauld place. unfortunately, the malfoy manor had been attacked after the war which led to narcissa and draco [presumably] dying. ALTHOUGH, draco didn't actually die but he assumed he did once he became a ghost. andromeda inherited the manor and harry went to check it out just because he was curious as to what happened. he found draco, blah blah blah. they became friends, and eventually caught feelings. i recall that harry left to head back to see teddy and draco got jealous because he thought teddy was harry's boyfriend.

then, at the climax of the story it was revealed that draco was actually alive because narcissa had cast an ancient spell on him before she died while fighting, and that draco's body or soul was trapped. so harry hired bill, a curse breaker, to break the spell and it ended up working. but draco almost died for real this time due to blood lost from his resurrection. everything turned out fine in the end though.

can anyone find this fic or does anyone know the name?
