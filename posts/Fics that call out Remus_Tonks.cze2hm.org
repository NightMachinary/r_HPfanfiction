I love both characters but I dislike this ship in canon. The way its written makes it seem like Remus was forced into a relationship and then had a kid within a year of getting guilted into a relationship. Not only that it looks like Tonks got both Molly and Arthur to pressure him into a relationship after dealing with the deaths of both Sirius and Dumbledore.

But most fics critical of their relationship call out Remus more for not accepting her and abandoning her and never put emphasis on the fact that this was a relationship he got pressured into. If he wanted to be with her he had the right to wait till he felt ready it wasnt on her or anyone to force him before he was. The age gap doesn't help either. And it seemed like a really weird addition on Tonks character to take rejection this bad if he was just a crush kinda ooc from everything you kmow about her up until that point especially considering shes already in her 20s

Remus should be important in the fic and fic should be sympathetic to him. He doesnt have to be major focus but its preferable.He doesnt have to be in a relationship but if he is

No OC ships with him and no ships with him and anyone in Harrys generation. Also no Remus/Tonks unless it starts with their break up . Apart from that everything else is fine. Het slash fem slash whatever. No genderbending.

Long fic preferred doesn't have to be complete


** I think there was probably more that we didn't see. It's more than likely that there was a thing happening between them, that he then tried to end. Her patronus was a wolf - and as far as Harry knew, they weren't together at that point. So I suspect that they had had a fling, at the least, and then, possibly triggered by Sirius's death, Remus realized it was far too serious and she deserved better than him.

It certainly makes zero sense that a crush would bring Tonks down to such misery, and change her patronus. But, I suppose there is always the trope of falling desperately, deeply, and truly in love with someone despite an actual relationship. Rowling isn't noted for her romances...

*edit Plus, I always liked the way it sort of all happened out of Harry's viewpoint. Because Harry was occupied by other important shit, things like two people he barely knew falling in love, breaking up, getting back together, all happened off screen without his knowledge.

*** I mean true there was very little we saw. Though we could have seen bits and pieces would have made sense in the end then without having this uncomfortable context and feeling like their hook up and having a kid was a cheap way to parallel Harry's parents. But Rowling has a thing for being sympathetic about onesided romances that seem uncomfortable.

Snape and Lilly, Merope and Riddle Sr, Hermione and Ron when she thought he wasn't into him and only Lavender.

These are all people who fell very hard for someone who they were never with. In Hermione's case this is more her and Rons inability to express their feelings for each other. And its the most tame, but Rowling is sympathetic about physically lashing out if you think you have your feelings be spurned.

Snapes obsession with Lilly did bring him over to the side of good but is uncomfortable considering he lashed out at her kid for looking like his father. And that he never got a reason to be good apart from his obsession with Lilly. So for all you know him never getting over a woman who was happily married and didnt want him was a redeeming quality for someone who never once indiicated he rejected the death eaters philosophy.

And Merope is a straight up rapist whose sympathetic because of her horrific backstory while her victim is a guy whose side is never explored and is depicted as being perfectly fine after being brainwashed and raped. Until Riddle jr kills him for being a muggle and/or not raising his kid.

And thats just in the HP series for the Fantastic beasts one she is sympathetic towards Queenie for brainwashing Jacob to marry her. Even if he loves her marriage is his decision not hers and she almost took it from him. And his rejection for her is all it took for her to join Grinderwald who is clearly depicted as evil at this point. And this character is still considered sympathetic

So if it was on its own I would have assumed ya there was more to the relationship we didn't see. But in the context of these relationships I am way more suspicious if it wasnt just one sided pining and her repeatedly confessing and him repeatedly saying no till hes pressured into saying yes.

And I see things critical about their relationship but never sympathetic towards Lupin when they are let alone critical about the one sided feelings being forced on someone. Maybe he did love her and just needed time. But he deserved that time not to have his friends pressure him so much he hooks up after a funeral.

So ya I wanna see more fics call out how unsettling this is and not hook them up since this is something I dont think I've seen and therefore want fics about it or featuring it.

**** That's fair enough. Another one that rubbed me the wrong way, more than Tonks and Lupin, is James and Lily. He harassed her all their teens, and she despised him, then suddenly she's in love and they marry.

I'd say the Hermione one is the least like the others, because she and Ron were already friends. They already liked each other as humans, so Hermione having a teenage girl level of spitefullness is pretty believable. Even the most rational, mature teenager can be proper cunts at times.

***** Was ist truly harassment?

Seriously, James may have been an asshole but I doubt he harassed Lily!

He harassed, bullied and attacked Snape (and Lily defended him, but I doubt he directly targeted her even once!)

Also: Not everything perceived as harassment (you can get charged with that today for looking at a woman in a way she doesn't like - "Your honor I felt so violated, it was like he was undressing me with his eyes!" (after that, she'd turn on the waterworks and if the man is unlucky he's now punished for sexual harassment!))

**** Of course men are the bad guys in HP:

Rowling is a (radical) feminist and she was/is also single-mother who had to raise her child in bad conditions!

Her writing shows that, most intelligent characters are either older men (and gay, too so not threatening toward women - hell, Flitwick is intelligent, but he's so tiny that most women wouldn't be challenged overcoming him physically) or women (Hermione, McGonagall, Vector, Sprout, Bellatrix even)

Look at how she writes men (at least the important ones, characters like Neville are ok - but they aren't super important either):

Harry isn't all that intelligent, he's not curious and his self-preservation instincts are bad, too - same goes for Ron (the other main character)

Then there's Snape, pining after long dead Lily Potter/Evans

Voldemort is basically A-Sexual (we don't know that he ever loved anybody except magic)

Dumbledore (and Grindelwald, too) is gay

etc. etc.

*** This is what many fans assume. But Rowling said in Remus's biography that they weren't involved before the end of HBP. That Tonks admited she liked him and Remus avoided her, so she got depressed. And even in the scenario where they do get together and then split up, girls who rite those fics make it seem like Remus is a terrible person for ending the relationship when it's obvious he has serious concerns. Then Tonks gets to scream at him at some point and everyone is on her side. So it doesn't even matter when the relationship starts, it ends up seeming like a complete disaster. People want to make them get together to make it make more sense, but it's even worse because issues are unnresolved. Besides, this scenario ignores the fact Remus felt from the start it wasn't a good idea to be in a relationship. There's no way I'd believe he for some reason agreed to start a relationship at once and then changed his mind. It took grief and persuasion to make him start a relationship with her. And like op said, it's always Remus's fault, no matter the circumstances.

***** Why should the coward (he wasn't there for Harry like ever! At first he didn't look for Harry before Hogwarts and at Hogwarts it took Dumbledore asking him to work there as a professor for him to crawl out of his hole and after Snape exposed him as a werewolf (note: He was dangerous, too he forgot his potion and nearly attacked the trio and this also let Pettigrew escape!) he vanished and wasn't seen again till the order was reformed!) get a break?

Seriously, Mr. Absent deserved the tongue-lashing Harry gave him (still, I agree that he wasn't the right guy for Tonks and I give him credit for admitting it and wanting to end the relationship or hell, not even start one!)!

*** I don't think Harry was made out to be the villain, I just think that Remus was obviously pissed that he was called out and Ron and Hermione genuinely don't understand what it means to grow up without either of your parents around (alive) so they reacted like they thought they should, and were just sort of confused as to why Harry would yell at Remus like that, because I think that they haven't actually stopped to think about what Harry lost that night, and what that would do to him losing both his parents.

***** No...not if he didn't want it, this is such a misconception IMHO - especially since men don't have reproductive rights (note: I am not saying that men should be able to force women to have an abortion, but I think they should be able to walk away within the same timeframe that a woman can get an abortion in (unless he didn't know, then the countdown will start from the time he was told!))

It is just unfair that women can do stuff like manipulate birthcontrol (poke holes in condoms, use the sperm from a thrown away condom (that's why sports-stars are told to flush theirs down the toilet, so that this can not happen!), stop taking the pill etc.) and still get money from men, while they can easily (note: I am not saying that abortions are super easy, but compared to paying for a child for 18 years or more they really are!) walk away (abortion or even giving the kid up for adoption (without the father being given the child if he wants it - no, if it is adoption then the father is not automaticall given custody!))
