Recently I read The Tinkerer, in which Harry was sorted to Hufflepuff and I loved how the little bits here and there about the House billiards tournament, officially announcing the newest couple, the mischief making society, things like that. Harry can still be sorted into Gryffindor, or any other house. Be it a main character or a little mentioned OC, as long as there is an example of House culture and/or traditions, I'm cool with it.


** Can you link The Tinkerer? That sounds awesome.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.

**** Normally that would work, but the bot isn't working properly at the moment, so you need to use the ID number. If you go onto the website for the fanfic, it will be in both the URL and at the end of the fic summary.

** There's a lot about house traditions in The Changeling linkffn(6919395) and it's overall pretty awesome. The main character is Ginny, though.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

** This was the first one that came to mind, linkffn(10360056). It is a Harry/SS story---but thats not the main focus of the story. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It is incomplete 153k words (54ch) and doesn't end on a life/death cliff hanger (hate those sorts of cliffys---this isn't one of those).

  A Potions accident leads to a de-aged Draco being taken into the Lion's Den and things go down the rabbit hole from there. What is The Pride of Gryffindor, and what is going on at Hogwarts? Surprises abound in a tale of the repercussions of greed and betrayal. This accident may lead to the Wizarding World's salvation...or downfall. **Very AU. Eventual Slash. Snarry pairing.**
