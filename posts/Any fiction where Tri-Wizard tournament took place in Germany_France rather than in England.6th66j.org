Basically what the title says. It would be most welcome if Harry is Hogwarts students and didn't go with the Hogwarts delegates where tournament took place.

*** Hogwarts would arrive in seemingly self flying carrages with most if not all the 7th years plus dumbledor in attendance.I imagine them staying in tents such as the world cup, or maybe an inflatable castle to mimic hogwarts. I honestly can not figure out why Harry would be dragged along to this which would make the rest of the questions moot. (I wouldn't mind reading an actual tri wizard fic without Harry or Voldy.) But in the case with Harry going obviously Dumbledore would of invited Ron and Harmione in order to bring Harry along. I can also see Crouch paying the Durmstand Headmaster a visit since the tourny is hosted there.

***** One flaw I see, though, is that Harry's name came out of the Cup well after Durmstrang and Beauxbatons were at Hogwarts. Therefore, if Hogwarts was traveling to the host school, Harry would not go at all because A) he is not of age and B) the Cup is only at the host school and the names are only put in after all of the schools have arrived.

So, unless Moody/Crouch is able to work a giant miracle, there is zero reason for Harry to be taken to the host school with the other 7th year Hogwarts students.

It would make for a fascinating read to see Harry's perspective of a different school. But there is zero logic behind bringing Harry when he is not of age and none of the other schools brought underage students with them in GoF.

******* Another problem, though, is how do they think his name got into the goblet if he isn't there? I can see Dumbledore, Crouch Senior, Bagman, and co putting a total halt to the tournament and bringing in Ministry officials to check out the goblet because it was obviously tampered with. Plus Moody/Crouch Jr would not even be there to put in Harry's name, because, from what I read and saw, only the Headmaster/Headmistress of the visiting schools went.

It just becomes this big plothole that only a fantastic expert writer could try to tackle. And even then, we've seen how well some "expert writers" are able to write fanfiction (i.e. Cursed Child).

I would love to read a fic like that, but someone would need to spend a lot of time developing a 100% proper reason for Harry being brought to the host school. Although, imho, this paints a perfect opportunity to write a fic where Cedric is the only champion for Hogwarts and how he deals with that and being in a foreign place. All the while, Harry has to spend a school year in a Dumbledore-less Hogwarts with Moody/Crouch trying to find a way to kidnap Harry. Would definitely make for an interesting rewrite of GoF through 2 different perspectives.

********* You're right on the aid and Crouch Jr raking whichever form he wants. It could definitely help close some plotholes if utilised properly.

Say Dumbledore does bring Moody to keep Crouch Jr as Moody for simplicity's sake. It is realistic and logical for him to bring his DADA professor It still brings up the issue of: Harry is clearly not there at all. It becomes a different situation than at Hogwarts. Say Dumbledore knows Moody is Crouch and wants to allow Harry to compete like in GoF. There is no way he'll be able to realistically convince the other staff members to allow a boy, who never even saw the goblet, compete in a competition that he is also too young to compete in. Especially since he's not at the host school. I highly doubt Madame Maxime and Karkaroff would be as willing to accept this as they were in GoF (and they were still very unwilling). There is pretty much no feasible logical argument Dumbledore could give and the others would immediately know that the goblet was tampered with.

It becomes a whole mess of plotholes. Why would Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, Bagman and co allow Harry to compete? They have zero reason to accept it and have a higher chance of either canceling the tournament or bringing in Ministry officials to check out the Cup. Plus, it would not even be the Ministry of Magic we know, but most likely the Ministry for the host country. So now Dumbledore has to convince the host school, host Ministry, and other visitor schools to allow this strange act of clear favouritism and allow for Hogwarts, a visitor school, to bring in a student that wasn't even there to put their name into the goblet. Even the best orator in the world will have a difficult time achieving this.

So then, how does Dumbledore properly convince them? Why even bother with using the tournament if Moody/Crouch can just stay at a Dumbledore-less Hogwarts and have easier access to manipulate Harry? It would actually be easier for Moody/Crouch to stay at Hogwarts because it was really only Dumbledore who discovered his identity at the end of GoF. Maybe, instead, we have Snape discerning his identity and teaming up with McGonagall to catch Crouch Jr. Which could provide some really fun paragraphs or Chapters. I would love to read a well-written fic that dealt with McGonagall and Snape teaming up to "play spy."

Btw, in case it doesn't show, I'm loving this discussion we're having. It's been a while since I've been able to have such a long and good discussion about Harry Potter.

************ I remember plenty about the canon. I am just pointing out some serious plotholes that would emerge. I understand the binding magical contract. I understand that Harry would not physically be there but would have to the BROUGHT there.

But I also understand that Dumbledore had to talk Karkaroff and Maxime into a) not leaving because they thought he was cheating (pg 244 GoF) and b) allowing Harry to compete. The process of convincing them becomes even more complex when the person isn't even physically there to put their name in. Also note that we're not 100% when exactly Crouch Sr was put under the Imperius Curse. So he may have been cursed here to make it easier for the others to accept Harry into the tournament. This would be easy seeing as Mood/Crouch Jr was in the room at the time and the book describes Crouch as older, skull like, and standing away from the group half hidden in shadows (pg 243). And when he steps into the light, Harry notes that he looks sickly (pg 246) Plus Moody is the one to convince the others that Harry's name was not out in for cheating, but rather to have him killed.

Even after convincing them, Maxime and Karkaroff are described as "glaring", and "livid". (Pg 246).

I get that this is a defining moment and GoF is one of my favourite books. I get that this process helps Harry grow, learn, and develop, and eventually culminates into the rise of Voldemort and Harry developing some form of PTSD after Cedric's death (which is shown via his words and actions in OotP). I am just pointing out some major issues that would arise and that someone would need to really explore and properly explain them in order to a) avoid being torn apart for creating major plotholes and b) to make the story flow with a certain logic and sense.

So please don't question my knowledge of what I remember of canon, when I am just bringing up a valid issue. I also just thought that I was having an interesting discussion with [[/u/UrTwiN]], but apparently not. They make a valid point about the Goblet contract and they are right. By the magical contract, Harry should be brought there. But, I feel that I also bring up a good point in that the Karkaroff and Maxime would be even more against having Harry brought to the school to compete. It's only logical, especially after their reactions in GoF (pgs 242-246 in the book).

I'll just leave it at that. Because apparently I'm just upsetting and angering people and making them question my knowledge of canon, rather than having an interesting discussion. Valid canon-based points were brought up by UrTwiN, which I agreed with.

Sorry for the walls of text. And sorry if I upset anyone

Just because there are German students doesn't mean the campus itself is in Germany, although it's a possibility. (Tbh, I feel like a lot of people are assuming Durmstrang is in Germany because it furthers the "Grindelwald=Hitler" allegory.)

Here's another question that I don't think has been raised in the thread yet: what would be the Hogwarts students' means of transportation if they were traveling to another country?
