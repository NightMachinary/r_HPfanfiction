I saw a Fantastic Beasts deleted scenes that I just discovered [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG8CGM5iH8E][here]]. I didn't know they could be so damn big. And way more beautiful than a Basilisk.

After reading how their 3 heads are more or less independent with different purposes I think that would be neat as a familiar moreso as Harry is a parselmouth.

And as with that Harry could complete Newt Scamander work as he can directly speak with the snakes.

Bonus crazy useless idea, crossbreed (which is impossible if I remember the was Basilisk reproduce) Runespoor and Basilisk. To all that like OP things, I'm surprised it's not been done yet.


** Not a pet, but iirc linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them) had one.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

Not as a familiar but he has a runespoor. I think he says that people who have a familiar bond with a runespoor go crazy. It's definitely not that huge though.

  Harry is still angry but this year he has a person to blame. A secret trunk, a kitten with a secret and an secret potion. Complete!

  The Founders found a way of putting powerful safeguards into their bloodlines. Now, as Harry faces off against the shade of Tom Riddle and the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, the Sorting Hat causes one of those safeguards to activate. The result means Harry Potter is now Salazar Slytherin and the most misunderstood Founder is the Boy-Who-Lived.
