  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** In my story "Patron", there are four tasks for the champions, all styled after one element, and tournament-style competitions (Duelling, Curse-Breaking, Quidditch) for the other students. The tasks are held in a vastly expanded magic arena, where, thanks to charms, the spectators can follow the action easily, and generally no more dangerous than a typical professional Quidditch match.

**** There are no sex scenes. That's handled with "fade to black", as in movies. It's rated "M" because of violence - I like to err on the side of caution. (None of my stories on FFNet have graphic sex scenes.)

The teenagers do talk a lot about sex, though. But as the story reveals, that's like teenagers talking about their plans for their first Spring Break. Reality is far more tame.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

** Thia has some different ones I think linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path by Temporal Knight) and there is one where Harry is a tournament expert. He goes to muggle uni but gets called in with Sirius to assess tasks. One of them was about cracking a puzzle box on a table that he knocked over. Another was a room filled with keys and locks but you only needed the key nearest the door. Can't recall the name of the fic.
