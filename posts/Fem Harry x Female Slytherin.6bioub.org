****** I'm not sure why everyone is getting all offended. Lol. I just find it a really random thing to add. I'm also not sure why her being black would change canon at all.

***** Wow, why would they be? I mean, I don't /mind/ her being black in the /Curse Child/ production at all, but why would someone be angry about the other way around? Nothing indicates either way in the text, and, due to her being from an English family, she'd be stasitically most likely to be white... so I really don't see what could have made people /expect/ her to be of color so much that they'd be offended when she was casted as white in the movies.

(Incidentally, my first reading of POC was /Pirates of the Carribeans/, which had me very confused. Has to do with not being a native English speaker, you see.)

****** There actually is some indication in the text that she is white.

From Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, chapter 21:

  Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.

  “Harry, hurry!” she mouthed.

***** interesting that you're snippy about a POC Hermione but not about Harry literally being female in this fic. If you're looking for canon character backgrounds, a genderswapped harry fic is generally not the place to look.

****** It's more that they actually made an acronym for that type of Hermione, like her having a different race would actually change the story much at all. All you get is a different description at the beginning. Seems a bit silly to me.
