As in, how do you create the skeleton of your story?

I'm looking into branching out from my usual stuff, but I want a bit of a challenge. I thought I'd pick the brains of this sub and share my own ideas as well.

- I'm a huge fan of random generators. One website in particular is [[http://www.seventhsanctum.com/][Seventh Sanctum]]. I don't do a complete copy pasta, but I do often draw inspiration from whatever comes up.

- [[https://www.randomizer.org/][Research Randomizer]] is also an excellent way to sift through the contrasting ideas I always have. If I have some choices to make and I don't have a preference, I'll use this. (Bonus, it's also an app). I used it to create random pairings for my "12 tropes of Christmas series."

- Mindly is an app for doing those "mind map" things. Suuuper useful and sometimes more convenient than writing it down on paper. Good for when an idea strikes when you're out and about.

- Prompts. I know Tumblr is a wellspring of ideas for fanfiction, but aside from writing fests, that's just about my only source as far as that goes.


** I usually start with an idea for one particular scene, either between characters or an event.

Then if I get a few more scenes I'll note them down too. At this point it's not really a story, more a collection of interactions that I like that don't make sense on their own.

Eventually, I can slot these ideas together, and a plot starts to appear. It also means I can pick out sections and try them with other bits I've noted down for different ideas.

It's not really an efficient way of writing or developing plots but it works for me.

** Ideas themselves come to me when I daydream. Most of it is rubbish, but sometimes I get some nice little idea.

Plot is something I create without emotion. I believe in the use of traditional story structures when it comes down to simply building a story from ground up. Time lines, arcs, character development,... All of it is planned and written down in short sentences, bulletpoints or tables.

** My methodology can best be summed up as:

#+begin_example
  I'm not a *writer* per-se. 

  I'm a DM who writes.
#+end_example

Most of my scenes start from an amusing premise, or what I think would be the natural result of how the previous scene ended. I then ask myself "What would X, Y, & Z do in this situation... and what happens because of that?" on loop until I look at the last line and say "Damn, that's a good stopping point." Like most DMs will tell you, if you plan on your players doing one of 4 things, they'll find a way to choose option 7. My characters do the same things to me a lot, but that's half the fun of writing without a pre-scripted plot.

It helps that I based most of my important characters on people I know. So when I got stuck on how to have Amy Madison handle something in my Buffy The Vampire Slayer fic, I literally called the girl I based her on (Amy in particular had a lot of gaps to fill in her characterization) and said "What would you do if...?"

... of course then I had to explain /why/ I wanted to know what she'd talk about if she were out clothes shopping with Faith Lehane. But that's how my story gained a Beta.

** Steal everything.

No, I'm not joking. All of my ideas come from either something I read or something I watched. Basically the only original character I've ever come up with is a telekinetic boxer, and I'm using him for my own IP.

Remember kids, the only difference between plagiarism and originality is how you mix it up.

** I've never thought, “I want to write a fanfic, what shall I write about?” The idea or subject has always come first. I tried a random plot generator once just to see what happened and all it generated was nonsense. I have always had some sort of ‘Eureka' moment near the beginning of the planning process though I can't particularly remember most of them.

I do remember the first story I wrote, which I started before I knew fanfiction was even a Thing. I knew I wanted to write a story that gave Sirius something to do in the weeks before the battle at the DoM but I didn't know what that story would be. One evening (and oddly I remember the moment quite clearly), I was out walking and for some reason the phrase ‘Black Death' came into my mind, rapidly followed by the idea that it might not have been called after the symptoms of the illness, but the dark wizard who created it. And then I had a story.

So I suppose at the plot-development stage it's really a stream-of-consciousness thing for me.

** It always starts as a random idea, usually in the form of some sort of divergence. Like, what if Harry took Luna as a date to Slughorn's Christmas party, and ignored the distraction caused by Draco? Then, I start making bullets points to what would change afterwards. Perhaps that's not the best example since it is basic, and nothing would really change in the end other than Harry's love interest. But, I have hundreds of snippets like these, and they never go anywhere, but if I write them down, there's always a chance I'll go back and revisit it.

For something not as random, I'll go into more depth with an outline. For example, I've been plotting and writing and scrapping, and rewriting a sequel to my H/FD story. It is difficult, because there are some ideas I have at the beginning that don't pan out, but the trick is to not get too attached to any of them and be able to scrap them as I go if it stops making sense within the context of where the story has gone.

It ends up being a long list of bullet points. I come up with a general break down of chapters, and I try to estimate how many words each idea will take up to try and control the pacing and chapter length of the story - I don't want one chapter to be 3k words, and the next to be 8k.

So, for bullet points, I'll just write down an idea. Like, my story will have auror!Fleur and prefect!Harry. So then for each, I will follow up with a little blurb about how I want those to interact with the story. So, for prefect Harry, that means there needs to be a scene with Harry getting his badge, Harry meeting the other prefects on the train, and Harry getting into a conflict with prefect!Draco, things like that.

For a larger plot point, I will go in depth with actual paragraphs. For example, I have to figure out a new plot for Voldemort when a lot of the puzzle pieces change. The only thing that doesn't change is that Voldemort still wants to prophecy. So, how would I go about that if the situation makes it so Harry can't be tricked into bring all his friends to the DoM to get ambushed.

Furthermore, I tend to have certain scenes that I really want to includes, scenes which are some of the prime reasons that I'm even writing a fic. Like, I'll write the basics to a Yule Ball scene weeks before I get to actually write it, because there's some clever dialogue I want to include or a certain way I want to describe a character interaction. There's a lot of little snippets like that.

** Well seeing as +most+ all of my short fics are romance/smut, my process is probably a bit different from people who actually tell a good long story, haha.

That said, most of my ideas come to me when I'm falling asleep or talking with HP-loving friends. One silly fic I wrote centered around Hermione discovering that after the war, a surviving Severus Snape had been providing his voice for audiobooks. The idea only came about because I had been discussing it with a coworker who's also a very huge HP fan. Otherwise, as I said, I think of them when I'm falling asleep. I imagine two characters, put them in a room together, figure out the tension or emotion of the situation, and work from there!

** It depends on the story. For my most recent fic, the climax appeared perfectly in my head without any context, completely out-of the blue. It was a case of creating a detailed plot around that image of Harry sitting at a table, urgently trying to get his godson away from a killer without raising suspicions. For this story, I had a whole notebook filled with details, mapping out the entire fic so I could slip in important things from the beginning - like a certain news article or casual mentions of Colin.

While other fics I'll freely admit I've made them up as I've gone along. My humour fic started because I wanted to write Harry coming into contact with Aunt Marge again, and of course she had to blow up. So I just started writing, and, well, the fart jokes just wrote themselves.

I would say most of the time I lie between these two extremes.

** A good number of my plots come from reading a badfic or thinking of a cliche and going, "Okay. What if I did it better?" Like the cliche wrong boy-who-lived fic except the brothers are stuck together like glue and don't end up becoming enemies. Or reading a fic where Lily and James actually are resurrected through the Mirror of Erised and going, "I wouldn't trust anything that came out of a mirror." and thus the evil mirror people are born.

Otherwise I think, "what would screw over canon as much as possible?" Or I ask my writing partner, "hey, what do you think would happen if X?"

On at least one occasion though it's just begun with a single line and me deciding that it would be a great opening to a fic.

** I'm a weird blend of "organic" (flows freely) and "organized".

Usually my plot bunnies come naturally. Sometimes at work, when daydreaming, falling asleep, and even while reading a book or watching a movie. The plots hit me and I go "I fucking wanna write this shit like right now!" I've never used prompts, but I have toyed with the idea a few times.

But then I construct the plot. Every fic I write, except for oneshots, has a file labeled "Fic Title Info" where it contains character info, timelines, major events, and even excerpts for future scenes that I suddenly become inspired to write but am not ready, structurally, to throw it in. The character outlines help a LOT, especially when I make minor changes or add things like certain scars on Harry aside from the obvious one.

So the plot idea itself comes organically, but I always try to structure my plot to ensure proper continuity.

** I get ideas from TV shows/movies I watch or from news stories I read or from stories friends tell that amused me. Not 100% original, but what is, these days? ;)

As for plotting, I write an outline, and then I clean it up by doing the same method JKR did (at least [[http://cdn8.openculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/JK-Rowlings-Phoenix-Plot-Outline.jpg][like in OotP]]). I'm not someone who can get an idea and run with it, see where it goes. I must plan the story out to the very end.

** I don't really like setting my writing based on code. Usually it's just me doing x and then thinking "well what would Harry do here?" i.e., I've been playing Minecraft.

Gotta survive while Hermione et al figure out what happened."

And I look up background information about JK Rowling's life and things in the books and what Jk Rowling said on Pottermore or on Twitter...For me it's most about extrapolating the information from canon, in a what I hope is a logical way, to fill in the gaps and come up with something new that clashes as little possible with what is written in the books (within the limitations that come with being a way different person from JK Rowling). Sometimes I think about whether I would like to read a computer-created fanfiction, just like there are "Rembrand" paintings created by a computer, and I think I would be excited to read one.
