Hello, I was wondering if anyone knew any good and long fics in which Harry is actually affected by the abuse he has suffered.

I dont mind anything as long as there is no gender bending because thats not my cup of tea.

Thanks!

I don't know whether you will like this - it's long and complete and there's a sequel, also long and complete. I haven't read it in a while but it definitely addresses the fact that Harry, after so much abuse, should not be as nice and trusting a kid as he seems to be at 11.

#+begin_quote
  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving. Sequel up.

*** Does it have a happy ending? I kind of want to start it and I'm ok with angst as long as there is some kind of hope. Would you still recommend it?

******* As long as its worth the investment. I feel like I started it a long time ago. I think that the house elves were cursed or something and Harry killed children with a heart attack but that might have been another fic and I might be making things up with my terrible memory. Its all very hazy.ðŸ˜…
