One of my favorite fic types is the time travel do over and I've seen a challenge reference several times but fornthe life of me I cant remember the name but it has to do with Harry's grim reaper being pissed that he keeps dying early and not getting with his soul mate (some Granger girl) I'm looking for more fics that tackle this. Thanks in advance


** I believe it's called the “Don't Fear the Reaper” challenge which was given by Reptilia28

** Definitely reptilia28's challenge: Don't Fear the Reaper.

LeQuin had one called "Last Chance" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922615/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Last-Chance]]

Sinyk combined it with another challenge that brought in Daphne Greengrass. He's a little wordy at times, though. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10766595/1/Harry-Potter-Three-to-Backstep]]

"Reboot" by Kallanit. Very loosely based on the challenge and involves Snape (non-romantically), as well. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/Reboot]]
