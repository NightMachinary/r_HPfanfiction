** I want more without Harry Potter in it.

I want more that has good characterization and good world-building.

One specific thing I want is a story in which Tom Riddle has the goal that would fit his backstory most: ensuring that no magical child could ever suffer at the hands of muggles ever again. That means running an orphanage, yes, but beyond that, he'd need to set up a system to monitor for child abuse and neglect. He'd have to create a system (if none exists) that could locate children capable of magic, and he would become a case worker ensuring they grow up healthy and happy.

And that's expensive, and the purebloods would be unhappy with spending so much on muggle families and mudbloods. The purebloods have money and prestige and political clout on their side, meaning Tom has to scramble for any advantage he can grasp...

All the while, in the back of his mind he knows that muggles are a threat -- not individually, but they outnumber mages six thousand to one. What can he do to address that part of the problem?

(In canon, he might have had those issues in mind, but he spent three decades trying to take over the equivalent of a small town, so we only had a little bit of time to see him working on his policy changes.)

*** Why would Diadem Harry be raised in the RoR exclusively? House Elves use it for storage and doesn't Trelawny use it to store cooking wine to drink (or is that Fanon)?

Either way there's no way the elves wouldn't notify someone about a baby in the room.

Also why would Malfoy's and Walburga raise their child at all? They'd have no idea who it was. Most likely they'd tell their house elves to drop it off somewhere.

** A fic where Ron is sorted into Slytherin. The story would be similar to On the Way to Greatness/The Changeling in its model, and hopefully in writing quality as well.

Ron-centric AU after he walks out on Harry and Hermione in DH. The story would be about Ron joining some scattered underground resistance movement, all that stuff we didn't see from Harry's PoV in DH.

A story about Ginny's days in the Holyhead Harpies. Should focus more on stuff like adjusting to being a professional quidditch player, travelling places, team politics, dealing with stardom etc more than the actual matches.

A Dumbledore centric fic where Ariana doesn't die, so he and Gellert go on their quest as planned, to obtain the Deathly Hallows, subjugate muggles and rule the fucking world. For the Greater Good!

** I want to read a heavy AU where medieval astrology plays an enormous role in how magic works, justifying the telescopes in canon, and Dumbledore's funky planet watch. Only the muggle-raised use the Hogwarts Express, and everyone else just floos to Hogwarts, while platform 9 3/4 is a pocket dimension that can be accessed from most train stations, not just King's Cross. Maybe have Harry and Hermione meet on the train, along with some of the other, less popular characters like Justin Finch-Fletchley.

I want a fic where wandcrafting is intensely personal, and takes up much of the first year, using astrologically important ingredients that the student is expected to gather from the school grounds using herbology, potions and care of magical creatures, in a sort of 'voyage of self-discovery'. In the meantime, they learn magical theory and meditation techniques to become better prepared for the responsibility of owning a wand. Spell power, and potion potency, is intrinsically linked to the motions of the planets, and one can get into real trouble if they don't know enough magic to be able to cast anything that works when Mars is particularly bright, etc. For example, if Lumos was affixed to the astrological chain of the moon, and fluctuated in power with the lunar cycle, you'd need to keep an eye out for the waning moon, and use a different methods of seeing at night during the time when Lumos was weak/unreliable. Maybe use the chain of Mercury to bind some of the sun's energy into an object? In short, I'd want more diverse magical concepts that interlink into a whole worldview, but the astology angle isn't one I've ever seen used, so it'd be interesting. I've been tempted to try myself, but I'm not much of a writer.

I would prefer Harry to be less famous, and the subject of conspiracy theories. There should be a lot of speculation around him, not celebrating in the streets, because people specifically note that Voldemort was prone to disappearing for months at a time. So there should be a lot more people worried that Voldemort isn't really dead, and Harry's role in it all should be poorly understood at best.

Also one where Voldemort enchants the chessboard to be more lethal and Ron dies in PS, and Hermione is killed by the basalisk and Dumbledore decides to go all Ender's Game on Harry.

** I once read a snippet, where Harry learns magic tricks and sleight of hand. So when he starts to entertain kids on the express they think he is the reincarnation of merlin, because he can do wandless magic.

So I want this. I really want it.

So Harry does these things, but always tries to explain what he had done was not magic but practical illusions or sleight of hands, but nobody believes him, because they think he is too modest to claim credit. Only Hermione understands what happens and that drives her crazy.

I also want a really good Cop!Hermione/Robber!Harry fic.

** This is going to sound weirdly specific, but a fic that takes place in Northwest England during the early 80s. Like if the Potters survived and schlepped it over to Liverpool or Manchester.

It would be a treat to see events from the Toxteth Riots and the Miner's Strike, to Heysel and Hillsborough, and even to less politically charged stuff like New Order, The Haçienda and the rise of Madchester, or football rivalries, etc.. If you could see all that through the eyes of character who has a foot in two worlds, both experiencing enormous upheaval, it would make for great juxtaposition and an interesting read, imo.

Its appeal is probably way too limited for anyone to actually put pen-to-paper, but this is a thread about what we, individually, want to read, so there it is.

An exploration of the hopelessness/grimness of Ds/DrkS during an expanded second war. Character death drama is obviously a given. Also the effects of the curse of the Undead spreading and looking into why it is spreading is also a plot point if going down the Dark Souls route. If the HP and Demon Souls route will be followed, a race between Potter to see who gets to do certain actions concerning the Old One.

Furthermore, a look into what is Dark and what is Light when discussing magic/the adapted sorceries/pyromancies/miracles when trying to meld the two series together.

Or Potter being inserted into DS/DrkS/Bloodborne worlds will be fine too.

Harry learns Transfiguration from both Dumbledore and McGonagall. Would feature competent fights between competent duelists. And I mean knowledgeable, /creative/ duelists, with at least one of them being good in Transfiguration, preferably both.

I want to read a story with really ancient magic. The latest chapter of linkffn(For Love of Magic) had Harry finding out that there were no magical schools in Mexico. Why? Because the Aztecs were doing regular human sacrifices while they were in power, and that kind of thing leaves a mark on the land when the people sacrificing, and sometimes the people sacrificed, were magical humans. I want something like that, but more central to the story. Real primordial shit.

I want a story with sorcerers and war mages. Read the big battle scene in linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) for an idea of what I'm talking about. I want stories about the kind of people that can rustle up freaking tornadoes and not give a fuck as they walk through them.

** Anything that goes into the culture of the magical world - maybe not just Britain though, because common there's gotta be more communities out there!

On the same vein I'd like something that explores the magical creatures a bit more, one of the reasons I love Luna fics is because of the things she can come up with ,and some fics show that the creatures are real in some way which makes it even better. but its often just mentioned as an aside.

Hmmm .. wizards going into space would be awesome - because if muggles can do it why should wizards find a way?

Also one I've still not found and I even asked about here before is any fic that deals with abortion in more modern and realistic terms. Teen pregnance does not (always) equal marriage and happily ever after - male or female pregnancy aside. Also, it just is the perfect premise for a body horror fic , i mean the mpreg pregnancy and this idea some fics have that they cant be aborted because they are MAGIC. what the actual fuck. CUT IT OUT OF MEEEE.. sorry, that seems very disturbing, but I find fics that go all, aww shucks on underaged mpreg more disturbing (which man wouldn't cry & hyperventilate finding out they could get preggers, actually oops already ARE preggers? i mean^{weredoesthebabycomeout} / shudder)
