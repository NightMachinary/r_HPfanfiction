Fleeing from Filtch and the screaming book in the forbidden section, Harry finds himself in the seventh floor corridor, trapped between Mrs. Norris on one side and the approaching footsteps of Filch on the other. When suddenly a door appears and through that door is a cozy room with a set of books sitting on a table.

A twist on the Harry travels back in time/Canon character reads the books trope. 11 year old Harry has all the future knowledge of the books "plot points" but none of the skills or magical knowledge required to curb stomp anything. What does he do and how does he change the future?

For the sake of the prompt the books are enchanted so that Harry can't tell anyone about them, or otherwise reveal their existence in any way.


** “Um, Harry, why are you glaring at Scabbers?”
