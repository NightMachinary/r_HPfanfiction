Let me explain, all evil Dumbledore fics I've seen so far put him as a complete moron that gets outmaneuvered or outgunned by Harry with little to no effort and his motivation is usually so bland you can taste the stale bread flavor. Dumbledore, as I see it, could be a magnificent villain if someone bothered to write it well and not just "For the greater good... Of Albus Dumbledore" or "He would have to be manipulated for the greater good!" ugh!


** I made a similar request awhile back. Sadly only got a single one-shot out of it. That said, it was an enjoyable one-shot so here you go: linkffn(11613187)

*** Wow, this was great! (and a little bit chilling) this is pretty much what I was asking for, is not even about Dumbledore winning, is just about him not being incompetent, I would like to read a novel-length fic with the theme but that may be asking for much

** I'm usually pretty disappointed by evil Dumbledore fics - they tend to go with him being manipulative, and not really giving him any actual competence /or/ motivations.

There's two routes I think would be fun - a morally grey one or a dark one. For the morally grey one, I'd like to see it as Dumbledore having (self-explanatory) convinced himself that he's the only one that can stop the dark wizards out there - famously Grindelwald, then the incompetent ministers and their failings to answer to Voldemort, etc. That builds up to him /actually/ taking power/most of the power - a few steps further than canon- where it seems he has all these titles and positions just because of prestige, but doesn't /do/ anything with them. Instead, this Dumbledore would really be the puppet master behind the ministry - using it like a game of chess against Voldemort and other presumptive dark lords. A twist on this one that could be fun is having Voldemort and the purebloods be a reaction to Dumbledore - namely, the way he's curtailing ancient rights and privileges as a way to both weaken his prospective enemies and strengthen his own position. But in the process, in the classic aristocratic reactionary mind, it actually /causes/ the very thing he was doing it to stop.

The second, the dark one, I'd like to see take another turn. Whereas the first one has Dumbledore doing what he genuinely thinks is the right thing - just with no moral qualms about squashing the Dark - this one would have him be dark from the start. His disagreement with Grindelwald would be both from the methods and the one in charge - this Dark!Dumbledore would want to have himself in charge of everything for personal power, and the way to do it would be through putting himself in the system and slowly taking full charge of it, instead of a revolution. If this Dark!Dumbledore is to be the real antagonist, an interesting aspect to explore here would be a Voldemort that was fully crafted by Dumbledore (either literally or figuratively). Having a dark lord out in the open, after all, works so well to unite people behind Dumbledore /and/ brings other opponents out in the limelight. In this, Voldemort could be a full charade, or just a nice little bogeyman to have around to help justify Dumbledore taking more and more control...

I think those characterizations would make a lot of sense, and be interesting to read about.

** If you don't mind Remus/Sirius then linkao3(Do Not Disturb by fluorescentgrey) and its sequel are both excellent portrayals of manipulative evil Dumbledore. It's an AU where Remus goes to Azkaban instead of Sirius and I really can't rec it enough; the things Dumbledore does in it are frankly kind of horrifying in their level of disturbing and underhandedness. It's very subtle but very powerful, really.

** See, the thing is that Voldemort in canon had a point when he said its not about good or evil, but about power. But it wasn't ironically the one he intended. Good and evil are like many things "in the eye of the beholder." Dumbledore got many of his positions in canon not only because of his magical power, skill and experience, but also because of the contributions he made to the Wizarding World. In other words, people /perceived/ him as good.

For Dumbledore to be "evil" in any real capacity, it would mean he would need to have either: 1) fooled the majority of the population (including other more "evil" people) into thinking he was good when he was not; 2) created a grand conspiracy involving magics and ridiculously complicated plots that make canon look like planning a day trip; or 3) the Wizarding World is generally cool with "evil" behavior, and thus doesn't describe it as such (meaning the protagonist holds what would be considered "evil" viewpoints in context).

All of these things are quite frankly hard to buy in a real sense for a number of reasons: the wizarding world generally has similar moral sensibilities as the muggle world with only slight variations due to magic, British history would likely have to be very different from what we see in canon, magical deception on such a scale is far too OP, etc.

Writers don't usually want Dumbledore to be evil, at least as we think of it. What they want is to either create a temporary antagonist for the main character (see: every Indy!Harry fic), show off how powerful the main character is (i.e. going up against the "Greatest Sorcerer in the World"), provide reader/author catharsis for outsmarting Dumbledore, or all of the above. This usually doesn't need him to be "evil," but rather depicts him as overtly manipulative and trying to decide everything for everyone, something very dissimilar to canon.

I guess what I am saying here is that Evil Dumbledore is usually not what authors/readers want for their fics, and usually just use him as a ridiculous stand-in for conflict where none exists. Bashing stems from people taking the worst (or perceived worst) characteristics in characters and magnifying them as if they are the only aspects of these people. And bashing, without indelibly redefining the characters history and nature, does not create enjoyable or believable characters to read (in my opinion).

** The Sacrifices Arc ( linkffn(2580283) and sequels) has a great evil Dumbledore. He's intelligent and powerful, and has plausibly 'good' reasons for the things he does, rather than just being evil for the sake of being evil.
