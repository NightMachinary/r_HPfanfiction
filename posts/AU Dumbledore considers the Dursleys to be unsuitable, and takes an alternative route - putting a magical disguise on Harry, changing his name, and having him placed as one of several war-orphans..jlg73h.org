See title. I'm fairly sure fics with this premise exist, so there have to be a couple of good ones.

My preferences for this request:

- No bashing.
- No abandoned fics.
- Whatever Harry's new home is, he's not abused in it. That just defeats the purpose of not placing him with the Dursleys.
- Sensible shipping - no student/teacher, Harry/Death-Eater, et cetera.


** I can imagine the introduction that would allow this to happen:

Dumbledore- preoccupied with the war, doesn't notice that Fawkes was due for a burning day. Deciding to take him down with him to the Great Hall for breakfast goes down the stairs. Fawkes initiates his burning day, startling Dumbledore into falling down the staircase to his office, hitting his head.

BOOM! He hits his head. Then he takes a more sensible approach to the Halloween problem.

*** I don't think that it was really that crazy to leave Harry with the Dursley's. Voldemort has already proven more than capable of bypassing conventional magical protection, and I'd rather have Harry be abused than have him and whoever adopted him murdered.

That isn't to say that there aren't plenty of other plot holes around why Dumbledore did or didn't do certain things, but I'm just not convinced that this is one of them.

**** What would have helped is if something was actually /shown/ of the protections on Privet Drive. Being unable to be found by Death Eaters is all well and good, but no-one's ever shown as looking particularly hard - at least not until Harry leaves for the last time (which is also, conveniently, the time when Voldemort just regained enough of a foothold to actually prioritize going after Harry).

That makes it seem like the protections weren't really worth it, and thus a lot of "Harry leaves the Dursleys and everything gets better" fics are born.

****** To be /entirely/ fair, I think you're supposed to take negative-evidence for that one - "if the protections hadn't worked, Voldemort would have offed Harry while he was holed up in Privet Drive. Harry's still alive, therefore the protections must have worked".

This would be fine, except that there are myriad other reasons for Death Eaters to not go to Privet Drive. Simple opportunism, wanting the killing to be public, waging a war against all of Wizarding Britain and simply biding one's time for that particular strike...

******* After all the crap Harry had to go through there? Negative evidence just makes him putting up with it for the majority of his life feel meaningless.

It's more for validation. For Harry's AND Dumbledore's sake. It would make Harry feel better. And Dumbledore look like less of a... an uncaring so and so.

There's a movie called /Would You Rather(2012)./ The protagonist goes through a torturous (literally tortured) gameshow to get enough money for her brother's medical treatment. I'll twist the plot here a bit for this example (so no spoilers): Imagine winning (with great suffering on your part), heading home and finding out your brother had a miraculous recovery? Yeah, that's how I would feel every time Dumbledore says Harry has to go back and there's no evidence to support Dumbledore's reasoning.

Fanon does have some things right. The magical world is kinda sheep-like. With nobody to point them around, they will just putter about until things boil over again. And everyone falls victim of the "But everyone says-" excuse.

Edit: Holy crap, I submitted by accident and got distracted... ANYWHO~ continuing.

It's just as valid for ALL of the bad guys (Death Eaters, Blood Purists, and even Voldemort himself) to go "Dumbledore has to have put countless protections on Potter. We'll have to strike somewhere else." When in reality, the "protections" are either not worth much (they are charged by him being there ~1-1.5 MONTHS a year), uber serious wards that ONLY work against Voldemort, or they aren't even working because of the Dursley's treatment of him. Then you have someone like Umbridge who sends in a third party: dementors. See? She tried, she got the information very easily.

Why? Dumbledore literally dumped Harry on the doorstep "Welp, sorry for the ten dark years ahead of you my boy!" and walked off. Not even checking on the savior of Magical Britain.

No. You wait until a reasonable hour and knock on the door. Explain what happened. Have someone regularly check up on him. COUGH Remus COUGH COUGH Interact with the kid. If all else fails, you potion/spell/threaten the adults. Not leave a kid to abuse.

No, Dumbledore draws the line at keeping abusive muggles in line to keep a boy from being abused.

While going to the Dursley's makes sense, nothing.... nothing justifies the treatment he received. Taking charge of where he placed Harry makes it his duty at least ensure his well being.

**** Or Dumbledore could have just thought the Dursley's would be normal people and not abuse their nephew. They were his closest living relatives, if Harry had been a muggle and his parents had in fact died a car crash, the British government also would have tried placing him with them and if they accepted never checked on him after unless someone reported something. Dropping him off without talking to them is sketchy, but it also happened that way to make the scene seem like a fairy tail and be mysterious. Not because Rowling was in depth thinking through what a realistic Dumbledore character would actually do, so I'm fine just give that scene a pass as the author not really considering the implications personally.

One of the boys in the orphanage had jet black hair and hazel eyes that reminded Neville strangely of a photograph from his father's collection the picture has been labeled on the back as James Frank and Remus , Finalists in the international charms crafting competition, Another has been a photograph of his mother and a woman with red hair that looked about 17 labeled on the back Alice and Lily winner of the international Charms competition, It also said my gorgeous girlfriend some thing that had made Neville blush slightly when he read it Not he understood the feeling. Just that he knew his father had loved his mum.... He had stolen his two photographs, From the collection along with a picture from his parents auoror Graduation both of them grinning at each other smiling and looking deeply in love.

It had made him wonder How different his life would've been if they could've raised him. But that wasn't the matter at hand when they had arrived one of the children in the receiving line of the orphanage the black haired boy with the hazel eyes had Grinned wickedly at him when Nevillehad noticed The chocolate frog hidden in his right hand the boy had nodded at him as he and his grandmother has passed.

Neville Had been told to amuse himself for the next hour by his grandmother to maybe go and speak to the children but most of the orphans had vacated the area retreating back to whatever rooms or hidden amusements that only the residence of the builder k new about. None of the boys and girls concern themselves with the strange possible squib, That had turned up with the snooty adults that would doubtlessly fund their future accommodations not that Neville blamed them. Fundraisers were never fun and he wasn't particularly interesting if you asked him his opinion.

He most likely as he was starting to think subconsciously would never manifest any form of magic so the odds of any of the meeting at Hogwarts were minimal. So Neville couldn't blame them for not giving him a second thought, Before going back to what they wanted to be doing. He Found himself after a few minutes of walking aimlessly at a playground behind Prescott House Neville noticed it was completely empty a ghost town, Most likely the children had heard him coming. He frowned and sighed mentally Before kicking the rock directly in front of him and he heard a shout.

Neville forced his eyes up Searching for the source of the shout. The black haired boy from earlier was walking toward him looking a little bit angry. The boy stomped toward him, Continuing to show as he grew closer nevilest finally understood him, “ Don't kick the rocks you'll agitate the gnomes,in The playground.”

Just as the boy reached garden gnomes began to pour from every possible location the angry creatures running toward them the black haired boy Seized Neville by his shirt sleeve and begin to drag him behind him as he broke out into a one. Half screaming over his shoulder, “ Run mate. if you want to preserve the current state of your buttocks.”

Neville half tripping, Half running Took a few moments to understand the situation before processing it enough to continue running at a faster pace making the boy with the black hair slightly surprised he could keep up. The two children ran through the door never had just walked through minutes before the black haired orphan slamming it behind them but catching one of the gnomes hats in the door jam making the creature screaming profanity at them in a high pitch squeaky tone. As The tiny bloodthirsty creature attempted to free it's bonnet from its doorway prison. The two boys collapsed gasping for breath a few feet into the hallway both of them dropping down heaving from the exertion they looked at each other the black haired orphan and the Longbottom Scion, While the angry gnomes attempted to be on the glass of the doorway.

The two boys did what any children would after surviving a near death experience by the skin of their teeth and with buttocks intact. They began to laugh.

The Two 10-year-olds descended into hysterical cackles. That lasted for a minute until they both were out of breath again but for an entirely different reason. The black haired boy with the Hazel eyes looked at his new companion and said, “ Bloody hell mate, you have a death wish or something, The signs are everywhere don't go into the playground or the gnomes will get you there every 10 feet how do you even get the door open. That was bloody madness.”

Neville just blink at the strange boy in front of him, Before saying ,” Rather morosely, “ The door just opened for me.”

Making the other boy laugh, The black haired boy finally said, “ Well then mate , I guess you've got a knack for magical lock picking then. Those doors are warded because of the infestation, That's what the fundraiser is about to get rid of the gnomeS so we can use the playground again. Do you ever do accidental magic strong enough to unlock wards cast by a curse breaker before,friend.”

Neville just looked at him, Before shaking his head not daring to believe he had somehow unlockEd the door Using magic he was starting to doubt he had.

The boy across from him just smiled wickedly and said,,” Doesn't matter anyway we both made it out all right. Don't think I caught your name. I'm James Potter , Though most call me Jaime most days.”

Neville, Still remotely lost and dazed at the prospect of having performed magic and his near death experience via Nome Legion, Just said on auto pilot, “ Neville Longbottom” And stuck out his hand for a polite introduction as his grandmother had trained him since he was seven.

The match went surprisingly well before his gran interrupted, He managed score a goal before she descended on them. The look of shock on his grandmothers face made Neville smile.

Before he was bundled off back to Longbottom manor, But with vehement and rather enthusiastic promise from both His grandmother and the head of the orphanage that James could visit the manor the following Sunday. The two boys had did each other farewell in the age old manner of any young man, the Bro hug That even existed among wizards.

However, I think that his last name being Potter is a bit obvious, if Dumbledore's goal was to disguise his identity (Potter is a common name, but wizards will probably put two and two together and realize that Jaime Potter is The Boy Who Lived).
