  ‘Our short-term aims,' said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn't heard a word, ‘are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand-use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they're shockingly under-represented.'
#+end_quote

So I stumbled across this quote today and noticed that nowhere in this speech does Hermione indicate wanting to 'free' elves. This was a bit of shock to me because, from years of HP fanfic immersion, I've somehow come to think that Hermione's goals were to free house-elves without proper consideration as to what those house-elves would do afterwards.

I'm interested to see if anyone also had that misconception/any other thoughts about this. Also related, whether people think Hermione is right or wrong on the issue of house-elves?

  that nowhere in this speech does Hermione indicate wanting to 'free' elves.
#+end_quote

By that point, she'd learned her lesson about speaking too much when she scared off Hagrid, known creature lover.

#+begin_quote
  "It's in their nature ter look after humans, that's what they like, see? Yeh'd be makin' ‘em unhappy ter take away their work, an' insultin' ‘em if yeh tried ter pay ‘em."

  "But Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!" said Hermione. "And we heard he's asking for wages now!"

  "Yeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I'm not sayin' there isn't the odd elf who'd take freedom, but yeh'll never persuade most of ‘em ter do it---no, nothin' doin', Hermione."

  Hermione looked very cross indeed, and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket.
#+end_quote

This results in Hermione keeping her ideas to herself and going behind everyone's back to try to "free" the elves of Gryffindor Tower with knitted beanie hats.

#+begin_quote
  She looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her what she had to be so happy about, she simply said, "The hats have gone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all."
#+end_quote

So she did want freedom for the elves all along. It wasn't completely fanon for Hermione to plan on freeing the elves, whom she calls "slaves" multiple times, and admonishes Harry and Ron for eating elf-made food and not getting political about it. Although the way fanfiction does it is sometimes at an extreme.

**** Sure. But her methods of freeing them pretty much got nothing done in canon. I agree with the outrage, disagree with how it was approached. Her going for the welfare is actually a commendable approach, although lacking in house-elf representation. Her attempting to free them by surprise with hidden hats... Well that's weird and causes them stress. Considering she doesn't own them, I'm surprised it was included. Of course, her character also promptly dropped the issue.

****** You did have Dobby. The Hogwarts elves weren't mistreated and could give opinions. When discussing welfare, their opinions are very valid. Presumption is a horrible thing.

Dumbledore did employ Dobby. According to J.K. Rowling's former website (jkrowling.com and the W.o.m.b.a.t.s), there was actually legislation on hand for their treatment. It just wasn't obviously enforced.

******* There's also the point that being born enslaved and being brought up in that position of servitude will warp anyone's thoughts. Eg, there's a fairly well known [[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/lolas-story/524490/][story in the atlantic]] that has an example of that sort of situation. There were constant myths in the US South that were spread about the 'Happy Slaves' singing in the fields as they happily went and picked the fields for their masters.

In the case of House Elves, there's a combination of powerful magic tying them to their masters, with compulsions to make them hurt when they disobey that we know of. They're raised for generations in that slavery, and then that gets reinforced by pain. Is it any wonder that 'none would want to have freedom'? Even if you asked them, it's not like most know another world - and would probably be afraid of reprisal in most situations.

You can't /ignore/ them and their opinions - but at the same time, you can't take the "Why yes, I /like/ being enslaved" opinions at face value in the type of system they're in. Particularly in something that's a work of fiction like this...

Personally I find it fairly appalling that the books both contained an entirely enslaved sentient and sapient species, and with the way it's written to conclude to the reader that it's natural/good that they're enslaved and that they like it - particularly in a book series written for children, at least at the start. And that only one character really notices that it's slavery and cares about it... while everyone else is just "oh, it's natural and they like it".

********* Ah, I see. Yeah, in the case of the house elves there's a need for something gradual to happen because of the way the magic seems to be setup. Perhaps immediately freeing them would go poorly - but the reaction in both canon (and the way the books seem to want the reader to look at it) is just pretty bad. I don't blame fanfiction writers for running with that per se - it's easy (IMO) to see that JKR wanted the reader to find Hermione's crusade overzealous/annoying, and to disagree with it.

In any case, given how little we know about house elves in canon, it's kind of impossible to really say anything firm. I'd tend towards it being some sort of magical spell that had been done centuries past enslaving or creating house elves in the deliberately subservient and enslaved position they are in the canon- so any solution would have to both deal with that and include a path to educate and support the elves during the transition period.

******** Slightly off-topic, but thanks for linking that Atlantic article. It was a fascinating read and really emphasizes your point that these things aren't as simple as “They could all be like Dobby and try to leave.”

I mean, imagine - the house elves don't even have what little bit of outside roots Lola had. They can't have even the faint idea of going back to the village cause there is no village.

If we're to assume that Kreacher's story is the norm, the elves are born, live and die with the families they serve and have no connections outside of it.

Dismantling that system would be an entire undertaking that would take at least a couple generations to fully implement.

#+end_quote

Isn't he a living argument that Starfox is right? His bond forced him to violently punish himself for speaking out against his condition. And if there were any kind of situation where elves could vote for anything, the Malfoys would have quite literally owned his vote - until he was freed, exactly as Starfox advocated must happen.

It is impossible to give elves what they really want and deserve so long as they are magically compelled to say whatever their owners tell them to say and request whatever treatment they are told to request. It rather reminds me of the Young Justice fanfic "With This Ring", where the protagonist is chewing out the Justice League for allowing Nabu/Doctor Fate to join the Justice League, after Nabu coerced Giovanni Zatara, an existing member, into letting Nabu take over his body.

#+begin_quote
  "Ah, but, Zatara still had a vote." William looks mildly pleased to have spotted a flaw in my argument. "And he said-."

  "Did he, William? Did he take the Helmet off and tell you that?"

  "Well... /No/-."

  "So what you're /saying/ is, Nabu said that his slave was cool with being a slave. And you took that at face value. Well done." William's face falls. "Oh, don't feel too bad, the 'world's greatest detective' did too."

******** I meant Hermione had access to Dobby. As in a free elf. To talk about elfish welfare. Or a Hogwarts elf. It's not like Dumbledore would make them punish themselves. Hogwarts elves are a perfect starting point for finding out how to improve elfish welfare. Or do you think Dumbledore would treat elves like the Malfoys? Dobby did not agree with the Malfoys and was vocal about it.

I think Hermione's goals for the elves are laudable in canon, but she went about it wrong and got nowhere. She coerced (a bit too strong a word) other people into joining SPEW. She attempted to free house-elves through trickery and pretty much lost their goodwill.

And I did mention the point about elves being stuck with owners unless clothes are given. That is also a problem, but we're just not given enough information in canon about it.

So pretty much finding more information, improving conditions and education as they figure out how to free elves is the final goal.

The short approach ends up with depressed alcoholic elves, except for Dobby. That's something to avoid.

I look at it as similar the frog in the boiling pot. You do it too quickly, it jumps out, but slowly and it doesn't, except the pot of boiling water is freedom.

Except that when he visited Harry, the result was, “Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this.”

And that was only even /possible/ because the Malfoys hadn't been careful enough with the exact words of his orders. /And/ he wasn't actually able to badmouth the Malfoys at all until freed. The point stands, no meaningful progress in elfish welfare is possible until the slavery bonds are removed.

The testimony of a bound elf on any subject is so tainted by possible orders that it is essentially useless as evidence of anything. Even a freed elf's testimony, while not worthless, may be heavily influenced by the lingering effects of psychological conditioning, as seen when Dobby felt the urge to punish himself for saying that the Malfoys were "bad dark wizards" - despite not having been bound to them for over a year. It may seem arrogant to try to free elves against their expressed wills, but the fact is, there is extremely good evidence that their wills are compromised.

********** Hence why I think starting slowly is good. No one says "don't do anything to improve your welfare". And like I said, Dumbledore would not punish elves, so it's a good starting point for welfare.

I disagree about the elfish welfare not improving, but that should be a short-term goal. You can have laws, punishments, or mandatory unbreakable vows (thanks [[/u/starfox5][u/starfox5]]) preventing things like Dobby's treatment. I agree with canon Hermione's goals, I disagree with her methods, especially since she nagged the other members into joining SPEW. SPEW is a huge failure, when Harry, who went out of his way to free Dobby, does not give a damn about it.

That being said, I still prefer what canon Hermione did with SPEW over this overly shrewish caricature made of her.

I also like your argument that it's conditioning. Personally I think it is a mixture of some sort of curse and conditioning.

************ I think you did that one for one of your fics, The Marriage Law Revolution.

It was done well in it, although the ignorance is bliss aspect of the elves was noted.

But to summarize, I think the attempts in the books to help house-elves were done poorly. Not because I think slavery is a good thing, but because it wasn't sustainable and helped no one in the long-term.

I also think /for the case of the books and the books only/ that a slower approach is better for the house-elves, mostly because of how Winky reacted. Hogwarts elves are generally well-treated and Dumbledore is sympathetic to the cause. I legitimately think education is the best initial approach there. Dobby seems to understand the perspective of the other elves in the books.

The books are weird, because elves literally have quite a few of the human desires left out. Which is either conditioning (which is /terrifying/), some sort of curse, or legitimately their natures. The nature of needing clothes makes me think it is some sort of curse, but we really don't know for sure. Each of these requires a different way of handling it.

Imposing human ideology on them isn't going to work. It's not that simple.

****** If you look at a race of people who:

A) are raised from birth to be slaves and happy to work.

B) are magically compelled to obey their master

C) are magically compelled to /hurt themselves/ if they disobey in any real way

D) have been like that for /centuries/ now

Is it any wonder that most have their entire identity wrapped up in their work and obedience? Yeah, we don't know everything about them - but we've got plenty of examples of human slavery having people who were enslaved their whole life and didn't know what to do if they were freed/left.

In this case there's aspects to disentangle - but I would not take a magically brainwashed/trained opinion to mean that house elves are just natural/happy slaves, that reeks too much of southern plantation owner propaganda to me ("Oh, no - the slaves are so happy! Look at them singing their hymns as they pick the cotton. Of course they're happy to be slaves - their breed is just not capable of living on their own in more than huts.")

We don't accept that type of thinking for humans - why should we accept it for another race of thinking beings, particularly with magical coercion involved?

******* I think the answer to that question lies in the origin of the species. I think we can safely assume they didn't wind up this way naturally. So the question is, were they something else /before/ being House Elves, or were they created from raw materials /as/ House Elves?

Because if the latter, can it be said to be brainwashing if that's how they are from the ground up? Obviously whoever would make such a creature would have been an evil motherfucker, but recognising that doesn't exactly help with what to do with the Elves now.

****** It is not even imposing an ideology on elves, it is about enforcing treatment standards on other humans. In what possible context would self-mutilation be something you want to accept as the status quo?

***** We honestly don't have enough information on House-Elves.

I agree with her outrage, not her methods to fix it, as they were ineffective and quite arrogant. We see in canon that they cannot be freed without handing them clothing. So either they're conditioning is horrible to the point they reject clothes, they're bound by some sort of curse, or Rowling wrote a race of naturally subservient beings. I hope it isn't the last one, but the first two seem like they could be interesting.

Of course, she also ok'd the half-elf in fantastic beasts, which is disturbing for a ton of reasons.

Oh. So it's within the grasp of canon that Dobby used to satisfy Narcissa because Lucius had ED?

***** Just because they don't get paid the way human workers do doesn't make them slaves. We don't know enough about what is going. Beyond that, most of the elves (with only Dobby as the exception) don't want to be freed. Sapient beings have a right to make their own choices without a wannabe 'freedom fighter' undermining their autonomy.

******* Canon books say it is their nature to serve - individuals like Dumbledore, Hagrid and Lupin (I think?) would not have been so sanguine about their situation if there was a way to 'free' them without harming them in other ways. Matter of fact, everyone pretty much pats Hermione on the head and goes 'kindhearted idea but they don't want that so leave them be'.
