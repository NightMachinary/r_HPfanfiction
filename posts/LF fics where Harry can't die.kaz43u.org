He doesn't age, or he is immune to the killing curse, or he goes to Purgatory/The In-between/Kings Cross each time he dies then gets brought back. A personification of Death is always interesting, too. I like long fics, but I'm fine with short ones if they are complete.

A young Harry meets Death of the Endless whenever he dies. This does not help his self-preservation instincts.... And I honestly can't blame him XD

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] can be weird to read. I don't want to spoil anything but please give the first 5 chapters a chance and see if the story grows on you.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/15873207][Ink]] is disturbing but somehow fits the bill. It tells of how Harry gets to the point where he won't die anymore.

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][Dead Things]] is another dark story.

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315][Tell me whether he is dead]], Harry's life status is a mystery.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

** 1)October by The Carnivorous Muffin The story starts like this:

‚ÄúTom Riddle first met Death on the train to Hogwarts, although he did not know it at the time.‚Äù Harry is Death the main pairing is Tom/Lily but in the beginning Tom has a small crush on Harry but it is unrequited. Unique story Personification of death [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October]]

2) The Wastes of August Lomonaaeren Summary: Harry came back from death with the ability to look into the future. And he can see the general decay and decline of the wizarding world, exposure and war with the Muggles, and the extinction of magic in a few decades. He takes action to prevent it.

Gen (MoD)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20074810]]

3) you belong to me (i belong to you) Child_OTKW Summary: After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. Basically Harry has necromantic powers is body swapped and is avenging the original person who used to inhabit the body. The whole story is about Harry shitting on Tom and being a badass the original pairing is Ginny/Harry but Tom has a one sided attraction to Tom but Harry hates him so not slash. Can't die

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11270490/chapters/25203408]]

4) When Harry Met Tom The_Carnivorous_Muffin

Summary: When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

FEM Harry/Tom Master of death Time travel fic can't die basically

5) Petrichor BlameMyMuses Summary: In attempting to stop Sirius from falling through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry goes half through it himself before being dragged back into the living world. After the battle, things should have gone back to normal...but they don't. Something about Harry is changing, and he doesn't know why, what to do about it, or just what it means for his future confrontations with Voldemort. Gen MOD fic
