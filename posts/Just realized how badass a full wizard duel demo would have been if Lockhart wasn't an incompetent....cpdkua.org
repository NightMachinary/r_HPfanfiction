I was rewatching the epic duel scene of Snape vs Lockhart, and if you need to see Snapey epicness again with some music: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqlxhz4v3Wc]]

And I just realized how badass it would have been for the 2nd years to see a full-on adult wizard battle.... if Lockhart wasn't such a poser. It should have been Snape vs Mcgonagall for the demonstration lol. /(I'm curious. Do we think Lockhart is so incompetent he would even lose against a kid duelist? Ron/Harry were able to hold him at wandpoint, and I'm not even sure those kids had a spell in mind if he had defied them. A second year aiming his wand at me? I would have sneered them into submission Snape-style lol)/

Any fanfics with great wizard duel descriptions, techniques, trainings? /(I prefer Snape/Hermione or Snape & Harry above all.)/

Any fanfics with a competent Lockhart? lol I bet there isn't much of this, if any. Wasn't Lockhart the most hated character until Umbridge arrived?


** Linkffn(When in doubt, Obliviate) has a Lockhart who's still a lying obliviating bastard, but he's competent at hiding it and he's even pretty good against Voldemort.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

** Linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has a competent Lockhart, but he's not really a main character with just a few scenes from his perspective. He did help defeat the Basilisk, successfully monetized the adventure, and survived a Death Eater raid before helping with the defense of Hogwarts.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

*** yeah I have. I like it. Just wish they'd actually make prequel movies and not this fantastic beasts nonsense. I enjoy FB, but it's not what I really care about. I'd rather see more Snape of course! ;) Or maybe Snape didn't die at the end! And we get a sequel! haha
