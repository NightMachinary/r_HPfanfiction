Harry walked towards the stack of comics and his eyes fell on another pile of used parchment, hidden almost out of view. He peeked in, and his eyes widened at what he saw. ‘You write?Comics?'

Basically, it's Cartoonist!Ron and Writer!Ron and how he would make a difference.

I've read a couple of fics with Cartoonist!Ron, but well, I actually like to see major Bromance between Harry and Ron, so here I am.


** Any fic that gives Ron some talent is welcome in my book.

*** Brrrrr Ron can't be a cartoonist with all that food falling out of his mouth and ruining the parchment.

*** I'm sorry, I can't for the life of me remember the name of the fic I've read. But it was really good featuring a Ron publishing his first comic.
