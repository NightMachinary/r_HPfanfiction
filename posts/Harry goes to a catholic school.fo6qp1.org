Random idea that came to me in a dream. What if Harry went to a catholic school and truely didn't beleive in magic. They all think he possesed or something when he does accidental magic, and when he gets his letter they all think it's a big joke and he declines (or accepts and everyone wonderes where he went)


** Slightly tangentially related: linkao3(7460772) ... brother Thomas (later to be the Fat Friar ghost) struggles with being a wizard whole life he spends at Hogwarts. One of the best mediaeval fanfics (arguably, there are not that many of them).

#+begin_quote
  Long before the Statute of Secrecy, when Kings still sought counsel from wizards and scholars debated magic at the great centres of learning, England seethed as her nobles struggled to check the power of the King -- and one young friar found his new path taking an unexpected turn.
