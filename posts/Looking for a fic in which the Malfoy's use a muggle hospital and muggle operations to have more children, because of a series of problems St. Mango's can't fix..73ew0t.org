  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.

** I have definitely read something where the Malfoys used Muggle doctors to get pregnant because Narcissa had fertility problems or trouble carrying the child to term... Can't for the life of me remember which fic though. I have a feeling it may have been a Harry in Slytherin deal because I think Harry was good friends with Draco and put them into the idea maybe...
