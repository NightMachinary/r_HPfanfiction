My idea is basically what if harry had a twin. this ain't a new angle, i know. But what i think maybe different is. When tom cast the killing curse, it didn't just bounce back and hit him. It also hit this other boy. ( Who I am naming Daniel ( in the story it would be Lily's unnamed Dads name). Daniel died as one would expect.

But instead of Voldermort Bouncing away off to the rest of canon. He goes into Daniel and is reborn. Tom Being Tom and how Harry lived would still grow back Up Into Voldermort.

The world thinks of them as the Boys who lived. they grow up close, tom bringing out different aspect of Harry from years. and they arrive to the school. sorting happens.

​

and over the years Voldermort grows back into himself. even as Harry grows with him. i envision it as a sort of buffed harry from his brothers love, then a break and betrayal of said brother. a odd new twist.

​

no full details yet, but Daniel actually helping and loving Harry till year 4 or 5 when something makes all his memories come back fully.


** I've only seen like one fic with this idea, of anyone finds more plz let me know

*** thank you, interesting ill give it a read. I may be writing my idea out soon myself.

My one concern has been balancing Daniel into the books, as he would almost be like adding a second Hermione lol but sorta more gifted.
