In a fic of mine, I want to bash Ron. I'd probably bash Hermione for a bit before getting her forgiven by Harry, but I mostly want to make Ron irredeemable. Or, at the very least, a Dumbledore sycophant (not that he doesn't come off as one already).

How would you, as readers and writers, prefer it? How do I believably bash Ron Weasley?


** I mean, the whole premise of bashing is that it isn't believable. That's why it's so relative - for some people, it's totally believable that Ron would abandon Harry when he didn't get Hermione or Harry refused to share his incredible amounts of wealth or befriended too many Slytherins, or whatever else. For others, it's basically unbelievable that Ron wouldn't be the loyal-est of loyal friends and a total tactical genius.

If you want to bash him, think about what you dislike most about him, what his most negative traits are, then work out ways for them to become more prominent in his character. If you want him to descend to that point (as some of your other comments seem to indicate), then work out your end goal and work backwards.

For example, you seem to want Ron to be hyper-against Slytherins. So, you start there and work backwards. What would get him to that point? Did he give a Slytherin a chance and have them betray him? Did one of them drive a wedge between him and Harry in a way that he picked up on? If you want to do anything believably, you need to have reasons for that thing to happen, and it needs to have verisimilitude (internal logic). You need to set up rules that the thing then obeys, so you have Ron disliking traitors and dishonesty, then Slytherins being that in a way that hurts Ron directly, thus pushing him in a direction that leads to him being hyper-against Slytherins.

If you want him to be irredeemable to your readers, give him something irredeemable to do. Though even that's no guarantee - this is a fandom that sees Snape, Voldemort, and Draco redeemed quite regularly, after all. But yeah, have him kill Hedwig or verbally abuse Harry for being abused or get angry and suspicious of someone then have him Imperio them to reveal their secrets or something.

Basically, think about what you'd hate someone for doing and get Ron to a place where he thinks doing that is perfectly justified. That's how you turn someone into a villain believably. Chart their Fall.

** Imagine an asshole in real life. Now remove his pleasant traits, stick on over exaggerated poor eating habits, add some plot points about stealing or jealousy and then slap the name Ron on the character. Make sure the character has no complexity and is only a caricature.

Or take cues from the hundreds of Ron bashing fics out there. I hear fics styled after Robst gets tons of views from well-read fanfiction readers. It's usually harder to /not/ bash a character than to bash one.

*** I'm writing a dark harry fic with the dark side being the good guys and dark magic not being evil. Though the dark still needs to realise that killing muggleborns isn't a good idea. With that plot in mind, I doubt Ron can accept Harry. And I don't want him to. At least one of Harry's friends need to betray him with this new plot in mind. I'm not deleting all of Ron's good traits, but it is clear that he is very stubborn and set in his beliefs, so he likely won't change. And considering Harry will not hesitate to torture people when they deserve it in my fic (though that would take some character development), Ron really, really won't agree with Harry's new ideals.

It was quite a shock for Harry Potter to learn who he was. And it was even more of a shock for him to learn that the Malfoys could be civil, even downright kind to him, and, somehow, he doesn't hate it. Now if only he could get rid of these pesky feelings for a certain dark lord...

Now, I get you might hate it. But I don't give a fuck. I'm writing a slow burn Tomarry fic where Harry finds out he is the son of Regulus Black. And if you don't like that. So fucking what. I don't care. There are plenty of people that do.

***** The story I'm planning is set in fifth year when, as far as Ron knows, all Slytherins are rotten. And considering that Harry spent the summer with try Malfoys (Harry finds out his bio dad is Regulus in this one), Ron really doesn't agree with Harry's new choice in friends. So I doubt he'll come crawling back to Harry. And even if he does, Harry wouldn't forgive him. Ron already betrayed Harry during the tournament, and he's proved that he's a fair-weather friend. Harry wouldn't want Ron to be his friend again, whether Ron is "evil" or not.

*********** No. I don't even have pets. But Ron's character just rubs me the wrong way. He always insults Hermione, and he has no appreciation for books or knowledge. And considering how he treats Hermione, he'd hate me as well. My younger self was a mini-Hermione Granger before I knew who she was. I was condescending, bossy, a know-it-all---the works. And finally, FINALLY, when someone told me what I was doing wrong (It was only a few months ago, actually), I started fixing it. But it's been a long road. And I don't really like Ron much because of this. Hermione deserves better than being with someone who she can't even talk about her interests with. Ron wouldn't understand. He doesn't understand. And considering Harry is changing a lot, Ron won't understand him anymore. They'll grow apart, and Ron will change for the worse. He'd let his jealousy cloud his judgement, and Dumbledore manipulating him won't help. So I'll probably use Ron as a metaphor for what jealousy can do to a friendship.

Gaaaah. I'm thinking too much into a fanfiction. But I don't give a fuck.

********** First of all - english isn't my mother tongue so: Sorry if anything sounds akward or has grammar issues.

To your Question: Hermione (at least wonderfully flawed book Hermione) is much more stubborn about her opinion than Ron ever was! She is socially akward and isn't very good with feelings - or empathy. She literally used the death of Lavanders bunny for analysing why Divination is bullshit, she doesn't get why Ron is hurt by losing his pet and that's only book three. Don't begin with how she treats Luna or other people who don't fit in her worldview, or Harry and Ron when she's jealous in Book 6. I love Hermione - she IS a great friend for Harry, she does anything for the boys and her other friends - but she often doesn't get social norms when she is proven wrong. That's part of her characters charm.

Rons greatest flaw is his jealousy and his feeling that he isn't good enough - but most of the time that makes him timid or nervous (see book 5&6 - him as a keeper) and not agressive.\\
If you really want to write a believable fanfic, in which Ron grews appart from Hermione and Harry and not only the usual bad tropes, you should make it about small things. People grew appart all the time. But in fanfictions (especially when Ron is concerned) people tend to make a big drama out of it. Like - suddenly Ron is a really shitty friend, which is bullshit.

There are only two times in the books were Ron is a bad friend - and one of them is influenced by a Horcrux and partially Harrys fault who mocks Ron for being concerned for his family which is the tipping point for Rons leaving. The other time is in book 4 - and we all know that. But it's part of them growing up. Hermione is a bad friend in book 3 when she disregards Ron for missing his pet. Ron is a bad friend in book 4 when he is jealous about Harry being in the tournament and later for Hermione dating Krum. Harry is a bad friend in book 5 when he constantly takes his anger out on Ron and Hermione. They all have their growing moments in three different books.

If you want to make it believable - don't bash Ron. Don't make him the bad guy. Let them grew appart silently. Give them different interests - give Ron actually interests and character motivations that make sense and don't make him a bully or a shallow asshole.

You critisise that Ron is a Dumbledore sycophant, but Hermione gets it? Thats also not In-Character. It is actually Hermione who is much more a believer of Dumbledore than Ron. Ron at least has doubts about him during the Horcrux-Hunt while Hermione never has that moment. Ron also critisises Dumbledore a lot because of Snape while Hermione has fate in Snape only because of Dumbledore - even after everything he did. She is also the one who remembers Harry about his Horcruxmission from Dumbledore while Harry is all for hunting the DH. Not that she is false in believing in Dumbledore concerning this points - but my point ist: she is much more a believer than Ron. So if you want Hermione to break from Dumbledore, you need really a good reason - and a reason, why Ron doesn't believe Harry before her other than "he is a sycophant". Because In-Character Ron is much less a believer of Dumbledore than Hermione. Ron actually goes to his parents if he isn't sure about something. And even then he asks questions.

Sure - you can also take the easy way - Dumbledore is a manipulative asshole, Ron is dumb, Hermione is Harrys only true friend. But honestly: There are tons of that kind of fanfiction out there. And most people who have actually taste click away the moment they read "manipulative-dumbledore" or "Weasley-Bashing". Because 99% of this fanfictions are over the top, have nothing to do with the characters we all fell in love with and most of the time bad writing in general.\\
If you want to write a good story: Give your characters - the good and the bad ones - believable reasons for their actions. Think about the original characters - those of the books, not the tropes we know from various fanfictions or the short-cuts from the movies. Think about why they do things. And then use this knowledge to develope them from there. As fanfiction writers we are allowed to write characters who are "Out of character" - but there must be a journey to reach that point. You can't just say: that is it now, no debate. You must give your readers the opportunity to develope with your characters. And it must stay believeable. Ron won't suddenly start to be an asshole to the friends he was ready to die for multiple times. (Book 1: Chess Game; Book 2: trying to save Hermione and find the heir; following Harry into the woods; Book 3: Standing on a broken leg between Harry and Sirius; Book 5: Following Harry to the Ministry; Book 6: Defending Hogwarts with the DA; Book 7: 7 Potters, joining Harry for the Horcrux-Hunt; jumping in a lake in the middle of winter to save Harry; taking on Bella when Hermione is tortured etc.) Don't fall for tropes. Think for yourself!

I don't really like Ron's character much. Also, here are some of my replies from other comments:

Harry is changing a lot, Ron won't understand him anymore. They'll grow apart, and Ron will change for the worse. He'd let his jealousy cloud his judgement, and Dumbledore manipulating him won't help. So I'll probably use Ron as a metaphor for what jealousy can do to a friendship.

And:

I figured I'd more or less use Ron's bad traits, and have Harry not forgive him for betraying him twice now. And considering Harry is going to change a lot in this fic, Ron and he won't have any more similarities. I'm fairly certain you've grown out of friendships, and it's like that in my fic. Ron and Harry don't mesh anymore, and considering Ron doesn't agree with Harry acting and consorting with Slytherins, their friendship is going to fall apart very quickly, and Harry is going to have to accept that. Actually, I'm going to use that as a part of Harry's character arc. He needs to accept that he can't go back to who he used to be and that he has changed.

We don't see every interaction they have. Remember, they are constantly interacting over an entire school year; the amount of time we are collectively with them in each book is probably less than a day. What are there interactions like in that remaining time? We don't really know, so it's up to the imagination, but it isn't certain that it's bad. It could also be that we only ever see them at their absolute worst moments, and most of the time their interactions make their romance more understandable. That's just one downside of storytelling.

As to how they're still together... well, there was a 19 /year/ gap between Voldie kicking it and the epilogue. People tend to change quite significantly over two decades. Teenagers grow up (oh, and remember that we really see Ron almost exclusive as a teenager, and then remember how shit teenagers are... I wouldn't judge a person entirely based on how they acted as a teen), people mature, and personalities change.

It really isn't hard to understand how two people could stay together when we really know /so very little/ about how they interact and have a two decade blank space.

******* Table manners are important to me when it concerns food potentially falling on my face. Normally, I don't give a fuck, but I don't eat like a slob.

My fic is set in fifth year, and Ron is very immature currently. He's also very jealous of Harry right now. During the summer, Harry got a lot more powerful and now acts more Slytherin-like and is really starting to grow up. Ron is jealous of Harry's newfound intelligence, and he hates being second to homework and studying. Ron's bad traits are very likely to come out during this time. And Harry is, quite frankly, tired of Ron's bullshit. Harry's still angry that Ron and Hermione didn't send him owls, he thinks more and more about how Ron betrayed him during the tournament, and Ron's manners and utter disregard and hatred of wizarding traditions is the icing on the cake. Harry won't take it anymore.

So you'll have Hermione eating messily too? It's canon after all.

(pg 198 of GoF, emphasis mine)

#+begin_quote
  They sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes. */Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her./*

  “Er --- is this the new stand on elf rights?” said Ron. “You're going to make yourself puke instead?”

  “No,” */said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts/*. “I just want to get to the library.”

  “What?” said Ron in disbelief. “Hermione --- it's the first day back! We haven't even got homework yet!”

  Hermione shrugged and */continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days./* Then she leapt to her feet, said, “See you at dinner!” and departed at high speed.

And before you go batshit, I'm trying my damned hardest to make sure the relationship doesn't come off as abusive or one-sided. But, the fact is, Tom Riddle is very misguided. He never really had an adult mentor in his life. And the Horcruxes affected him quite a bit. I want him to reform, so to speak, but he won't really be perfect. Though I'll make sure that the isn't a megalomaniac or a serial killer. It will take some time, so I'll probably tag the fic as slow burn while Tom and Harry become friends. And they will be friends at first. Harry would be a good influence on Tom, and Tom will teach Harry.

** So I don't necessarily mind bashing, but try not to make it annoying. If Ron is prejudiced against Slytherins that's fine, but don't have him constantly repeat "slimy Slytherins" or "baby death eaters."

Additionally, I would prefer that he has a more flushed out, personal, reason for disliking Slytherins or finding them unreadable. Perhaps his uncle's were friends with a Slytherin that turned traitor resulting in the ambush that killed them.

If he is supposed to be your 'Draco Malfoy' make sure he has some amount of substance even if it's not immediately clear. Maybe contrast him with a happy to be bashed Gryffindor like McLaggen.

**** I honestly don't even need him to be super well developed, I just want him to be able to actually string a few sentences, even insults together, and have more comebacks then "but they're slimy Slytherins." If it's a rivalry, he has to occasionally one up Harry. In canon Draco is cleverer than Harry with the fake duel and iirc he broke Harry's nose at the beginning of HBP. Even in Quidditch they are typically neck and neck. I think one of the things that a lot of Slytherin Harry with Ron bashing fics do wrong is have Ron lose every single encounter, even verbal sparring matches. There's no tension in those encounters because we already know that whatever happens Ron will come out looking like a clown.
