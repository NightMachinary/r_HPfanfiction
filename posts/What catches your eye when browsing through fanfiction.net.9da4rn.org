What makes you give a fic a chance? Does the word count matter? What makes you nope out a fic? What does it take for you to leave a review on a fic?

Basically, what draws you in?


** Status: Completed

I like closure.

Adventure and Humor Genres will usually get a chance from me as long as it's not paired with angst. I'll usually avoid fics labeled with bashing

**** I respect your opinion, but some of the best fics I've read have been incomplete. No way I would want to unread them because of the minor annoyance that they are unfinished.

Endings are overrated. Most fanfics end poorly anyway. In fact I've read plenty of stories that I would have rather remained unfinished than read their poor excuse for an ending.

** For the most part I find my ff.net stories through pinboard. But when I do go to the site it's usually to look for new stories about my favourite at the moment characters.

Word count and genre does count a little, but a great summary will have me read most things.

Things that will make me nope out is long ANs before, after, or in the middle of the chapter. What makes me nope out faster is entire chapters that are ANs. That and non summary summaries.

If I'm reading on computer and read a few chapters in, I'll usually leave a review.

**** linkffn(12732265)

The first good example I could find (and I'm sorry, it's not HP, but I was to lazy to go to the HP category). It tells you the main characters gives you a set-up to the story, and tells you a little about what you can expect without going into to much detail.

But honestly, if the story sounds interesting have my characters in it and is in the genres I read (so not romance/sci-fi/poetry) and there's no ramblings about how this is the authors first story and how english isn't their first language and how they are bad at summaries, I'll give it a chance.

***** I agree with the AN thing, but the summary you used as an example is one that does not make me interested at all. For some reason, the asking of (obvious?) questions in the summary makes me skip the fic. The two questions in the example just make me cringe and feel like there's a lot of contrived angst.

Interesting how we interpret things so differently! And this is a good thing, obviously. :)

** Its much easier to skip a fic that to pick one. Lets start with some of the things that make me skip. Snape or Hermione listed as major characters. Chances are we disagree about them and I don't want to go into it or read about them. Other people might nope right out for other characters.

Spelling and grammar mistakes in the title or summary are often a good reason to not pick up a fic. Unlike a lot of others I can overlook mistakes in the writing for a good story but it better be a good story.

Word count can vary. Something like linkffn(12631584) is short so might be overlooked but its good. Often longer fics are fics that people don't know how to end. There are some fics out there that should have ended 100k words ago but are just dragged out.

Certain themes don't interest me or might be mood dependant. Increasingly it takes something special for me to even look at a fic that starts in first year. Something like Taure's Victoria Potter is worth it but you're often settling in for eleven year olds who speak like adults, act like toddlers and the story is abandoned after 3 years of zero plot progression 200k words in. Post hogwarts catches my interest. Its new, its different. Chances are I haven't seen a thousand copies of it.

I will avoid fics where the author seems to try and cater their story to reviewers. Reviews can help make you a better writer but equally if the reviews can alter the plot I'd worry the fic hasn't been planned well and will start to wander. Lots of fic start strong and quickly run out of steam. There is a difference between a plot and an idea.

I very rarely review. For the most part because a lot of fics were written years ago and I don't think it would ever be read. Sometimes I finish stories I don't enjoy just to finish them. I wouldn't leave a negative review. This is fanfiction, if you write shitty wish fulfilment canon rehashes that started interestingly and it took me a while to realise that it was just a shitty rehash with fancy packaging then you don't need me to say why that's so disappointing to me. If someone asked me to critique their story I would but equally as a random stranger on the internet you have the right to write shit without me calling you out on it. Its your internet too.

** Bashing has become an instant no for me, especially Weasley bashing. I have no interest in one dimensional characters. Any sort of romance including Snape or Malfoy will also get a pass, because I find the vast majority will explain away all their negative behaviour in favour of making them the sexy bad boy love interest. Ditto for Voldemort/anyone.

However, I will always take a look at Ron-centric fics, or ones including minor characters like Moody and Scrimgeour, and the Hogwarts Founders. Complete fics are a plus, but I'm happy to read ongoing ones if the premise looks interesting enough. Good spelling and grammar in the summary helps too.

- Includes Malfoy, Snape, Voldemort/Riddle, the Lestranges, other Death Eaters

- Includes Neville

- Harem

- Includes any Weasley with the exception Ginny

- Next Gen

- Slytherin wank

- Description mentions bashing

- Question in the description

- Creatures (werewolves, Veela mating bs)

- Overused plotlines (IndyHarry, Lord Potter, life debts, working for the Ministry)

- Children seriously considering marriage

- Marriage Laws/Contracts

- Less than 1000 words/chapter

- Incomplete with less than 20k words and no update within the last 6 months

If the fic is still in the running, I'll give it a try.

** It's a bit shallow, but a good piece of cover art helps to catch the eye. Especially one which quickly conveys an important element or theme of the story. So just yesterday I uploaded the first chapter of a post-DH story (literally immediately after Voldemort's defeat) where Harry's having an odd reaction to coming so close to the afterlife and he feels ungrounded. So I used some fan art of him hugging onto Hermione for strength since she plays a critical role later on.

** I have a very specific system for how I browse FFN. I start with fics longer than 100k words updated in the past 24 hours. That gives me a manageable number to look over each day.

From there, the first thing I look for is >200 favorites. Not something you can control, of course, but I've found that it's a good rule of thumb for "minimum standard of quality worth looking at." (For an idea of how many I'm talking about, there are 21 fics in the search that meet that standard right now.) The next thing I look for is /not/ having one of my turnoffs. On the current list: slash, Draco/Harry's Twin, smut, WBWL, Lily/Snape (unless it's pre-Death Eater), Hermione/any Death Eater, and Pureblood!Hermione.

I described all that to narrow it down to the ones that actually interest me to try to say what separates a good summary from a bad summary, but by that point, there are only 5 left, and often, that alone will be enough for me to click through and skim the first chapter.

So, what makes me nope out? Other people have listed a lot of common things, but the one that I usually bring up is too much weirdness. It's hard to quantify what that means; often, it's a weird non-sequitur. I've previously cited a soul-bond popping up out of nowhere with no setup halfway through the fic (/Foundations/).

Leaving a review? it tends to be the extremes. Not just above and beyond in terms of quality of writing, but more often for originality that I really like. And on the other end, it's when I disagree with something--not bad writing, but a plot twist that I think doesn't serve the story well, or a moral dilemma that I have a strong opinion on. It's not unrelated, but it's less of a function of whether I'm generally drawn in or not.

** im gonna go through ff.net. the only parameter is that it's in english. here's a list of things, in order, that usually make me opt out of a fic.

a) the pairing(s). canon ships i'm great with, and some non canon (usually slash ngl, but only like, 2), gen fics are okay too.

b) the era it's set in. i love marauder's era stories but i really dont care about 2nd gen fics. golden-trio era hogwarts stories are fun to read if they're an AU or if they explore a what-if question. post-hogwarts stories are good too, just as long as they're before all the shit that happens in the epilogue.

c) chapter length. if its a one shot, it doesn't matter how long it is. otherwise, i look for something that at least has 1000 words per chapter, then i know that there is actual effort being put into the fanfiction. unless it has 500,000 words and is the second in a 7 series fanfiction, which means that there is probably too much filler and i won't read it.

d) whether or not it's complete. if its incomplete, i look at when it was first posted and how recently it had been updated. usually you can gauge how much and how frequent the author writes via the posting date vs the updating date. this is the one thing i dont like about ao3- it doesn't tell you the upload date.

c) spelling mistakes, bad grammar, self-insert fanfiction, an original character as the MC, snape as the MC,

basically it will peak my interest if it explores a new and interesting concept that i hadn't read before.

i dont usually leave that many reviews on a fic unless i really, really enjoyed its content and it left an impression on me to the point where i had to tell the author how much i enjoyed it.

For me to leave a review. I don't want to read a basic canon rehash. I want to see more details in the history, government, spells/potions. If the other can create a well thought out cohesive universe with history, the present, all the characters and how they mesh together.

** I personally dislike short fics, and won't read many of them even if I like the premise. I can read like 800 wpm, so I read quite fast. (Trying to push to pure visual 1000+ at this point lol)

I just hate when a story seems amazing and I finish it in 20 or 30 minutes instead of a few hours. I've been this way since I was very young so I doubt it'll change, I dislike short stories, for example.

If it's like 20k words but ongoing, then I give it a chance, as obviously the writer will add more. (Hopefully lol). 20k and complete though? Nope. This is probably a very unpopular opinion but I don't think you can fully explore ideas with a low word count. (Outside of non-fiction.)

If a fic subverts my expectation in an intriguing way I'm more likely to review. Really like this. (Obviously not subverting expectations just for the purpose of doing so. Like The Last Jedi if you've seen that, terribly written.) I also like fics in which the author has no plan, I just find it an organic way to write something and I tend to enjoy it. (So a good fic with no plan, beats a good fic with a plan imo. Obviously a mediocre fic with no plan isn't as good as a good fic with one. No plan just impresses me more.)

If the author keeps begging for reviews I almost never do them. (Unless they have like 80 reviews on a massive series that's actually extremely well written, or something.)

The summary makes me give a book a chance, it's your chance to sell what you're writing, if your book is amazing and your summary is crap not many people are going to read it, or it'll take longer to gain popularity. If you suck at summaries, learn how to do them.

** For me to give a fic a chance, it must meet several criteria. 1. Must either have been recently updated (within the last few months) or be completed. I hate getting invested only to find out it's been abandoned. 2. Must be >40k words if it's still a work in progress. If it's completed, I prefer >80k words, but if reviews are great or it's an author I know and love, I'll give it a shot regardless of word count. 3. Must be rated M. I prefer adult themes to be addressed. It's hard to read something that's childish, and I've found most T and under rated fics fall into the childish language I try to avoid. (Exception: the fic is rated T but was written by a favorite author) 4. Must be written in third person. I can't stand books that say “I did __/” because no, I didn't. The character did _/. Use he/she/they or names please! 5. Must be AU. I don't like when people try to continue the story as is mainly because they aren't JKR. Just accept and own that you're an artist of your own making and your work is valid. It's cool to borrow characters and details- that's what fanfic is all about!

Of course, there are some exceptions to the rules. Especially if the top 5 reviews completely rave about the fic, I'll give it a 5-chapter shot.

I write reviews for stories that affect me emotionally. I haven't written many, but the ones that really change my outlook on life are the best. If I cry- fantastic! I'm not an emotional person in general, so if you make me cry, you've done something right.

** I pretty much almost exclusively read Remus Lupin fics. If im looking for AU or time travel that don't have RL as a main character, ill usually Google "best au fics" and find them on fic recs.

Generally I look at word count. I try to only read stuff above 60k or 20k if the author has updayed recently. I usually avoid OC romance. I rarely read maurauder era because it is all terrible and unfinished. I actually really like fics about what Remus gets up to before Harrys 1st year. carnival of dark and dangerous creatures is basically my favorite fic of all time. Link ffn(4412736)

Although I loved Moons of Deceit. I only read the 1st and like half the sequel because its long as shit. Linkffn(2311872)

If theres spelling errors in the summary I avoid it.

** Draws me in: the Black family (I find them fascinating, okay?). A good summary, an interesting title (doesn't have to be outrageous, something simple like /The Fall of Man/ would catch my attention, but I would skip over /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - Slytherin Style/)

Makes me nope out: Snape as a major character. Also poor grammar, spelling, erroneous facts explicitly stated in canon (like despite it being mentioned several times that Harry has black hair, for some reason people will state it's brown)

I also enjoy pre/post Harry's time in Hogwarts. There's less of a chance of it being a rehash.

Pairings are secondary to me. I don't avoid romance but it's not what I look for, either.

** Word count does matter, but completeness is much more important imo. One-shots can be interesting, but 100K abandoned stories are usually just frustrating.

I'll usually nope out for Weasley or Dumbledore bashing. I did read The Champion's Champion and was vaguely amused, but only because it was /so/ overdone that it wasn't really Ron at all - and it was still passable rather than great. Coarse language is a turn off; if a story is good enough I'll let some slide, but enough of it and I'll move on.

The canon-compliant fics I've read haven't generally been my /favorites/, but they tend to stick in my memory, because they add something to canon that an AU doesn't. I'd probably give more of them a chance as I find them.

And I'm a sucker for well done time travel. Or maybe well done fix fic in general - if it introduces its own plausible opposition and has a solid plot, I enjoy seeing canon's challenges overcome in a different way. After all, isn't the fact that canon was missing something the reason for fan fiction?

** I only read completed romance fics with hermione as one part of the pairing. And to pick between the thousands of pics I look for a good summary (one that isn't too vague, short, or one where the author rights something like "I'm not good at summaries so just read it"). Then if the summary is interesting, I'll read the first chapter and if its compelling and the formatting doesn't bother me (I hate it when its all one big block text et.), I read it.

Cauterize has a great summary which immediately caught my eye, same as Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run which had to be extra impressive for me to overcome the fact it was Draco/Harry.

Good summary, basic competence in writing English is big. Too many homophones or misused words, wall-of-text, or stories where adults act like 14-yr-olds make me nope in a hurry.

If it's interesting enough I want to keep reading, I'll follow. If it's really amazing, I'll fav. If it's incredible and complete, I'll usually leave a 'thank you' review at the end. Otherwise, I don't usually review - unless if has serious issues but a good core, then I'm more likely to leave a critical review to point out specific things that could be improved.
