The old story of, "Read cool story, but was stupid and didn't bookmark it." Here's what I remember about it:

- It was on fanfiction.net
- Harry meets the prince of England
- Meets the queen
- Becomes a Royal Magician/Knight of the Round table
- Sets up base on Privet Drive and starts buying out the neighbors
- Takes advantage of modern tools and weapons, like cameras and laser guided missiles
- Harry x Hermione
- Ron x Luna

That's what I can recall off the top of my head. If you need me to clarify anything else just let me know.

**** I'm not sure how to feel about canoncansodoff. Too many good, abandoned fics. And yet I'm following A Boon for Bill.

  A seventh-year saga that begins one hour after Dumbledore's funeral. Harry gets some unexpected and unexpectedly useful help from the Muggle World...so much that wonders whether the power he knows not is actually the British monarchy! HHr, RWLL
