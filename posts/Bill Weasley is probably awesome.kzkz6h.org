I mean the guy is literally a walking romance plot stereotype. He's also a curse breaker, now I don't know what exactly that career entails, but I assume something along the lines of Indiana Jones.

** I love Bill in linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider) I think it does a great job diving into the job of curse breaking. It also does amazing world building, especially in the sequel.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** I found one fic where he ends up teaching DADA and it was such a compelling idea because who better to take a cursed job than a curse breaker. Sadly that fic didn't go into him having to deal with Ginny and Hermione as students but that would be amazing.

** curse breaking is probably about 99% doing magic math homework and 1% going into old tombs. he was a swot in school. fleur definitely wears the strap on in that relationship.

** Walking romance plot stereotype is the perfect way to describe bill and is pretty much canon.

I've always imagined curse breaking to be more like the O'Connells from the mummy series.

A little historical research, a little tomb raiding and fighting the occasional undead monstrousity.
