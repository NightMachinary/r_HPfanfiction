Hi this is my first post ( on reddit and on hpfanfiction) and I've tried searching for some advice on publishing etiquette/tips for fanfiction but I couldn't find anything, I apologise if its all on a wiki somewhere or in another thread. I've got a couple of specific questions but any other advice would be serious appreciated.

For context: I've recently written the first two chapters of my story, I've proof read them but nobody else has read them.

1) Where is it best to look for someone to proof read my work? I kind of need advice on both the content of my story and the grammar/ english, which is a definite weakpoint of mine.

2)What are people looking for in a description? Most i've read seem to either be a kind of checklist for whats in the story which just seems a bit boring, the others tend to have some kind of cryptic bit of text that don't tell you anything about the story. If anyone could link to a good example that would be much appreciated.

3) Is it okay to publish your story with just a couple of chapters written or should I write a few more before I start uploading them.

4) Author's Notes, simply what is the point? Is there such thing as a good authors note?

5) Word Count per chapter, i'm aiming for around 4000, while still encompassing a complete event in the story. is this fairly accurate.

I'm aware I need to read more fanfiction to get a better hold over the conventions/etiquette but if someone could give me the lowdown on the do's and don'ts that would be very helpful.

Thanks!


** 2) What I look for in a description is 20 word summary of the story, it needs to convey what you(the author) think is the essence of your story. A good summery should also IMO hook a reader inn and want them to read the story. A few short words to set up the story like AU, SI, cannon compliant etc. can be added to the start/end of the summary. Like this from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][Taure]] or a shorter one from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185533/1/Uncle-Harry][R-dude]].

3) Yes. Some will not read unfinished stories, but many posts stories one chapter at a time. I think this is more of a preference from the author, you should do what feels most comfortable for you.

4) To me author notes are a way for the writer to interact with the reader a bit outside the story without destroying the submersion in the story. They should however be used sparsely and with great care, and never ever, *ever* be used to reply to reviews. A few lines at the start/end of a chapter is fine by me, some do not like them at all. That said I think they add something relevant to stories like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][The Shadow of Angmar]] in which Steelbadger's notes at the end of a chapter, add some context for the reader with limited knowledge of The Lord of The Rings and The Silmarillion.

5) I think in the range of 2k -15k a chapter is ok. I prefer them to be in the 5k-15k range, but I think the most important thing is for the chapter to end in an natural way. Be it a cliffhanger or a change of scenes.

** 1. Round here is sometimes good, but most will want a description of the story and a sample of your work before committing.
2. Agree with Murven.
3. Yes, that's fine, as long as you're committing to actually finishing the story. It can be easy to run out of steam and abandon it early. Make sure you have a solid plan and enough time to provide regular updates. A brief hiatus is fine, but months between updates leaves people confused and annoyed. For example, I have a couple of chapters of my next WIP written, but I won't start posting until I know I've got more time to write as life is hectic atm.
4. I don't like authors notes and only include them when I think it's absolutely necessary - such as to clarify something that keeps coming up in reviews, or as a final "thanks for reading" on the final chapter of a big work. But everyone's different and you may prefer more regular interaction, teasing about the next chapter, asking discussion questions to prompt reviews, etc. The point is they're not required or even expected, so it's up to you.
5. I tend to aim for at least 5k, but I think as long as you're over 3k you're fine. I don't think I would ever go over 10k in a chapter or one-shot, but that's just me. As long as it feels natural and you're not just trying to pad it out for the sake of the word count.

Also, on your last point - you don't have to read more fanfic if you don't want to. I don't read much at all because I'm so picky and intolerant of nonsense. I actually think coming into it with little fanfic experience is probably better - you won't have picked up bad habits. Don't worry too much about etiquette; the fact that you care and you've made such a thoughtful post shows you'll be fine.

** Thanks! You've been very helpful.

As for whether I should upload as I go along. I've given it a bit of thought and I've decided to only upload when I've finished. ( a long way off yet) That way I can avoid reviewers having an effect on the story which I'm not a fan of, it's also means I don't have to worry about disappointing people if I do have to take a break for whatever reason.

*** One of the benefits to writing the whole story before posting is that you can edit it as a whole piece of fiction. If halfway through writing your storyline changes (which is common, if you have a good grasp on your characters they can start 'running' the story and you may find that what you planned would not be what your characters would actually do), you can go back and add foreshadowing to make the story more coherent.

** 2) summary should include at least 2 'unique selling points' of a fanfic. If the hook is too vague, that's when folks add tags to the end to let readers know what the story's about (ex. Slytherin!Harry or Casefic or Weasley!Family). If your hook doesn't include the identity of the main character or hints about the plot/genre, add some tags.

4) authors notes are for disclaimers/copyright. I know FFNet asks for an 'I don't own the original property' disclaimer. Make sure to explicitly claim the original aspects of your story (like original characters or AU situations); believe it or not, there are sites that steal and repost fanfiction on their sites for profit. Also if your update is way darker or smuttier than the previous chapters, your AN should mention that the new chapter will have some darker or more difficult themes so readers know that there's a change in theme/rating. (If you change the rating to Mature in the middle of a story, readers/subscribers won't be notified of the change.) also if your update schedule will be changing, mention that in the AN so readers know you're not abandoning the story.

** *Re.1:* fanfiction.net has an area dedicated to beta-reading, so if you are using that site you might want to check it out. Outside of things like that, it's pretty much just finding someone somewhere. I do know some literary forums do have their own beta-reader areas and stuff but the ones I am at all aware of do not dabble in beta-reading stuff that's copyrighted (though DLP might or might not have that, I haven't checked; keep in mind though that they can be quite ... brutal, so don't go to them if you aren't sufficiently sturdy).

*Re.2:* It depends on what your description is. Is it a fanfiction.net-style summary, a book-style synopsis (half to three quarters of the back page of a book, so a few times longer than what fanfiction.net offers), or maybe an actual excerpt from the story? With each of those people are looking for something else, though obviously it's always about pulling the reader in, making them interested in what you have. Just please do not use the words “what if” if it is not a part of an excerpt, as to many those words are incredibly off-putting (and they are also lazy, as you can ask the question you'd attach to that more creatively).

*Re.3:* Both are fine; if you are fine with posting it all at once then do so, and if you prefer to post as you write then do that instead. Just please, if you end up posting it chapter-by-chapter and happen to not be able to get to the end, be honest with your readers; you don't really /owe/ it to them as it is since you are writing for yourself, but there is a certain integrity in actually admitting to the people waiting for your creations that you can't or otherwise won't continue making them if it happens instead of lying to them about how it's being written (ETA: Never) and getting angry when someone suggests it to be abandoned.

*Re.4:* Yes, actually. Assuming you use them properly, “author's notes” are the fanfiction equivalent of a foreword. So many ... authors use them as a ... mentally incapacitated version of a chat channel, or even worse as something to put inside the actual chapters, so people forgot what author's notes are supposed to be about. The thing is, though, that with any story that is being published chapter-by-chapter an author's note that has its own chapter like a proper foreword will stick out and probably not in a good way (not to mention the hassle of updating something that's already uploaded), and anything longer you are trying to communicate will automatically be treated as bad by many. So while there's nothing /inherently/ wrong with author's notes, they are quite easy to mishandle if you do not know what you are doing; also, a small tip: if you are publishing chapter-by-chapter and need to include a longer author's note, instead upload it externally (as a text document, or as its own “story”, or maybe as the perpetually last chapter of the story it is a part of) and simply link to that. And another tip: never, ever, defend something you wrote in your author's note; if it's bad enough that you need to defend it then it's bad enough that it shouldn't be in the story, it's as simple as that; and if instead it is controversial then rather than /defend/ it you should /warn/ people and let them decide for themselves. And obviously, if it's not story-related then it does not belong in an author's note; if people want general-purpose words and recommendations from you they will go to your profile so things that are not needed by the story go there instead. That said, things like updating the story's rating do very much go in author's notes; whether you disclose the reason for the change or simply give a warning and let them find out is up to you, though.

A small addendum: The same problem as above (mishandling) applies to disclaimers. Though often enough used as a poor man's attempt at a joke, they should be clear and concise and serious because they do actually have a use. Namely, they are used to disavow your rights to any copyrighted stuff so that you'd be able to claim your rights to anything that is not copyrighted (which you do right after the disclaimer, optimally; never in the actual disclaimer). Obviously they also have the purpose of showing that no, you are not doing it for money and stuff, but that one is pretty much a technicality as the existence of fanfiction from the legal standpoint is weird and it all relies on a tacit agreement from the original author so if you pissed someone off enough (by openly making a profit off of copyrighted stuff, for example) that they'd send you a C&D it would not matter anyway.

*Re.5:* The rule of the thumb is to count one thousand words as 2--3 pages and aim for the desired page length when splitting chapters. As such, a few thousand words is a fine length. Page count of a few dozen pages isn't all that bad too if you /have/ to go there, but with many fanfics that have chapters of such length it is fairly clear that those chapters could have been split and only aren't because of the weird preconception that longer is always better.

*Addition:* A major “do” is “research your stuff”. Regardless of what people often put in their own fanfiction, if you want to write a story that is not a caricature for the sake of comedy then you should not do certain things with the characters which means you should research them properly instead of relying on whatever you find in the majority of fictions (a fine example is “Greater Good Dumbledore”: in fanfiction he often enough is like that, in canon he is anything /but/ that). Likewise, make sure you do your research as far as the spelling is concerned; typos and wrong capitalisation can spoil enjoyment of an otherwise good story, and with many of stories riddled with those it's clear that the issue lies not in a lack of a beta reader (though the presence of one /might have/ helped) but rather in the author blatantly not giving a single damn.

** 2. To add more on the advices, I think a passage or a section in the story should also suffice, whether that be a description or dialogue. Choose your best judgement I guess; try to choose one that can easily hook readers in and provide an essence of what the story is about. Try to make it short if you can.

Ex:

The Keys to Your Kingdom by thistle_verse

#+begin_quote
  /It was nothing so elegant as fucking, the first time they came together. It was teeth just a little too sharp--- against a collarbone, on the right-side curve of a jaw, drawing blood from the plushest part of a bottom lip. It was the doorframe digging into the curve his spine was making of its own volition: closer, harder, more. Two hundred pain receptors per square inch in the human body and it was nothing but background noise in the explosion, the revelation, that was Harry Potter's body against his./
#+end_quote

3. Do whatever is best for you, honestly. For me, I prefer stories that I know are completed or about to be. I think you should have an idea of what direction your story will go and how to sufficiently get there, first and foremost.

** 1) You can ask here, you can post on sites like the DLP Forum, or you can look for a beta reader in the FFN community.

2) Tell me, in short words, whats going to happen without spoiling anything. Add Pairing if its a romance, give me a hint to the plot if its an adventure,...

3) Thats cool. If you want to uphold a regular publishing schedule, you may want to have a backlog before you post.

4) You can explain some reasoning. I sometimes use them to establish some changes. For example "Bellatrix is 5 years younger". Tidbits like that. Also a "Thanks for reading" never goes amiss. But anything over 4 lines is too much IMO. Keep it short.

5) My preferred length is somewhere around 6k. But honestly, it doesn't matter. Whatever feels good to you.

Finding a good beta can be difficult. When you find one treat them like the precious, delicate flower they are. Until then you can mention on your profile and author's note that you are looking for one, and use an online editing tool (I use prowritingaid but there are others) to proof your chapters. In fact, do that before you send work to your beta anyway.

Lots of people do that. I have always had a story finished before starting to post, but that does seem to be a minority approach in fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  4) Author's Notes, simply what is the point? Is there such thing as a good authors note?
#+end_quote

Personally I'm not a fan; I tend to skip them when I'm reading and I keep my own to a minimum. Judging by how often I get asked a question that is already answered in my own author's notes, most readers ignore them,

#+begin_quote
  5) Word Count per chapter, i'm aiming for around 4000, while still encompassing a complete event in the story. is this fairly accurate.

Sounds fine to me.

#+end_quote

Useful to know. Don't read fanfiction for quality - some is good but some is terrible and most is mediocre at best. Reviews/favourites are not a reliable indication of quality. It's useful to know the conventions. You will find that most of it falls into a specific set of themes and doesn't deviate much. If you're writing outside those conventions, good for you - that's where most of the good stuff is - but be aware it wll be harder to find readers. Do read and review though. When you start posting, you'll understand how precious those things are. I can't get into the mindset of fanfic writers who seem to think reviews are their own god-given right when they don't leave any themselves. Entitlement or something I suppose. Learn to give critique if you don't already do that. Learn to take it too.

(edit spelling)
