Everyone mentions Harry's incredibly poor treatment by his relatives(which was extremely bad), but Neville went through horrible things too. His uncle nearly drowned him by shoving him off the Blackpool Pier, and he was literally dropped off a roof, which probably would have killed or paralyzed him, all to get him to show magic. When Neville reveals this in a rather disturbing, completely calm way like he's used to it, no one reacts at all in canon. Honestly, if one of my classmates had told me that, I would have been like, "WTF?" and told a teacher or something. And I've only ever seen a few fanfictions show reprecussions for his uncle and grandmother. In fact, most fanfictions I've seen praise the grandmother a lot, after she knew what happened and did nothing. I don't really understand it.


** The simplest I can think of is that the Wizarding world does not consider what happened to Neville as abuse in the Muggle sense.

In a world where a school medi-witch can regrow banished bones in an arm on a 12 year old boy overnight (Madam Pomfrey) and a group of wizards can repair and restore damage done to buildings in a few minutes, I believe that the people living in that world would have a lighter view of damage done to something or someone.

In addition to the books, with the release of the Fantastic Beasts movies, it also shows another factor in this explanation: to the Wizarding world, the lack or loss of magic is more terrifying than bodily harm.

For example, in Chamber of Secrets, Filch wanted to do magic so bad that he relied on some pamphlet about "Quikspel."

In the Fantastic Beasts movies, there's a new "entity" called the Obscurus, which is formed when a wizard represses his magic by his own will or by force through physical or psychological abuse.

Neville's abuse is to force him to /show/ magic while Harry's abuse is to hide it or, in Vernon Dursley's words in Philosopher's Stone, “to stamp it out of him!" Both are horrible, yes, but, to the Wizarding world, there is more cause for concern for Harry's abuse (as both the Boy-Who-Lived and as a potential Obscurus) than Neville's.

*** Thanks for answering my question! It is definitely true that the Wizarding World does seem to have less fear of bodily harm due to magic easily fixing things(though if Neville had cracked his skull open after being dropped off the roof, he could have died instantly).

I haven't seen that movie, but fear of a young wizard becoming an obscurus due to lack of magic does make sense considering what you told me. Honestly I feel either boy could have been in danger of becoming an obscurus. Neville was treated like he was worthless, and it really messed with his confidence, which also likely messed with his magic and made him weaker through the power of suggestion.

** In canon, it's easy - because the events were early on, while the books were still written for children. The Roald Dahl influence is quite strong - so something like what happened to Neville is written as a joke, similar to stuff like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, rather than being played straight. It's similar to how the defenses around the Stone are so bad in the first book - because the kids have to be able to get through them.

Later on, the way it comes across is less comical, over the top abuse and more of a strict, super high expectations grandmother. Which is also when Neville starts to play a more prominent role, and where he starts to become more confident.

I suspect that for people writing a more Neville centric story, it's usually more based off of that part of Neville - so they don't really feel the need to draw too much from the joke-y start.

** What is super disturbing to me about how they treated Neville is the fact that they were convinced he was a squib. So no, he wouldn't have necessarily survived all these horrible life or death situations they literally threw him into. They basically showed Neville by actions, and possibly words, that they would rather have a dead child than a non magical child. That's pretty effed up and it's no wonder he was so messed up when he got to Hogwarts.

No, but 'this candy will burn holes through my little brothers tongue' might just be. If this candy was known for burning holes through peoples' tongues it would probably not be sold to kids. Assuming that wizards see burning holes through tongues as a bad thing.

I'm only asking this because I don't think you realize how horrible that wound is. To put it into perspective, third degree burns only /extend/ into fatty tissue; they don't go /through/ it. For a burn to go through it, while killing off nerves, would be one of the most painful experiences /ever/, child or not. It would also be incredibly traumatizing for an adult too, even in a world full of magic, so I can only imagine how traumatizing for a child it would be.

Seriously, if you're going to argue that acid pops aren't that bad because the Polyjuice potion doesn't kill somebody, remember that the potion was painful enough to cause Harry to be brought “gasping to all fours,” because guess what, your body changing into someone else's is a painful experience, just like your /tongue being burned/ would be. Nerves are still nerves, so unless that acid pop has some sort of instant painkiller potion in it, your body is going to react. I doubt that it does, though, considering that Molly thought it worthy of spanking Fred for.

Also, keep in mind, this is the same society that allows love potions to be sold for pranks. I really doubt that any regulation goes into the shit that they do when it comes to food safety, considering that. And if you can fix it, again, according to your logic, why care?

***** I think the biggest difference would be everything done to Neville was by people who framed it as love and care. He was supposed to love them back, and appreciate it. His duty was too make them proud, and he was the one failing (in his mind). Harry, meanwhile, always knew he was disliked and that they had no expectations from him.

I aint no psychologist, and I doubt JK is, but I think those would definitely cause a big difference. It rings true Harry would be much more defiant than Neville with Snape, etc. To Harry, Snape's an unfair dick, but to Neville, he's scary and Neville can't perform to his expectations because /he's/ bad at potions.

****** All of that, plus they just have fundamentally different temperaments.

Harry just has a more confident personality. Maybe he had teachers in primary school that built him up when he was learning to read and do maths. He's very much aware that intellectually he's much smarter than Dudley, and to an extent his uncle and I think this helps him hold on to his self worth through the abuse. He revels in outsmarting them or thinking up insults that Dudley won't get right away. When something doesn't come easily, like casting a patronus or doing occlumency, he doesn't spiral into negative self talk the way Neville does. He just keeps doing his best to push through.

Neville's abuse was basically his family showing him through action, if not word, that they would rather have a dead child than a non magical child. That's pretty dang heavy, and it's totally understandable why he would have performance anxiety when trying to do magic and small setbacks would set him back a LOT. I think this is also why Snape was his boggart. Not because Snape was his biggest fear, but because Neville's biggest fear was that he wasn't magical enough to fit in with his community or be loved by his own family and Snape activated a lot of that preexisting trauma in potions class.

****** Agreed. Harry has a general insouciance, even defiance, about him that Neville lacks (see also: all his sarcasm towards Dudley even while being bullied). He likes to defy authority, and he spent the first ten years of his life being told his parents died in a car accident (random chance). He /resented/ the Dursleys for diminishing him and abusing him.

Neville is pretty naturally timid until DH. He would never have dared to talk back to his uncle or grandmother because he was probably raised to respect his elders. In addition, I'll bet it was always drilled into him that his parents died ‘for the greater good' and he should respect and live up to their memory. And say what you will about his relatives' abuse, Neville was at least given properly fitting clothes and a bedroom, rather than being made to sleep in a cupboard. I am not saying one had it worse than the other, but certainly Neville's physical needs were met better than Harry's throughout his childhood. He didn't resent his relatives so much as always having to live under their shadow.

** I always love a good fanfic that reveals the problems of this exact issue. I can think on two of my fanfics that, at least, mention this very issue. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7385986/chapters/17940586][Leyendo la vida del chico de la cicatriz del rayo by Bookworms75 Chapter 11: El Sombrero Seleccionador]] y [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/7/A-Dramatic-Reading][A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel Chapter 7: Vector, the Sorting Hat]]

** To be frank what constitutes abuse will be higher given that magic can cure nearly any physical harm incurred to a child making the relative allowable risk for attempting to treat or identify conditions much higher

** To be frank the inability to do magic for a wizard would be like losing the ability to do an intrinsic part of who you are . Like a normal person losing the with no hands

** Pick one: (1) Your idea of what is acceptable (or "disturbing") is not shared by the inhabitants of Canon, (2) You are operating under an invalid premise, namely, that it makes sense to evaluate comic relief in a children's book in terms of a clinical study of abuse and its consequences.

Personally, I like both.

** On a more meta note, it's a children's book mate.
