  James raised his wand, and Sirius had one shocked moment to register the stark black ink on the inside of his best friend's forearm before the world went sickly green and then faded away. Oneshot - Complete.

** edit2: Not as good as I remember it and with some grammatical errors, but still the best one in that category I've ever found.

edit: I believe this is it, [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10792840/1][Mirror by theresnomeaning]]. It was removed from ffnet, scrolled through first chapter and I'm 90% sure that's it.

Uh, you made me remember this pretty good fic (at least story-wise) where both Lily and James were Death Eaters, some Unbreakable Vow with Voldemort was involved. Some stuff I remember: BWL Neville, James and Lily in Azkaban, Lily breaking out when Harry went to Hogwarts, Harry raised in orphanage. Seems bad on paper, but it was well thought-out and put together and made for pretty interesting (though unfinished) read.

Now I really, really want to reread it, pretty sure it was linked on this sub at least once in the past. Off searching I go.

**** Found it, edited my comment with link. Remembered it as great work that served as pillar for niche that is Death Eater James/Lily fanfiction, but turns out it was merely okay. I'm a bit sad about finding it now, I liked it better the way I remembered it.

*** Finished the first chapter. I'm terrified that I'll finish all ten way too quickly.

I hope somebody has continued it...(wishful thinking).

Edit - Finished it. Definitely among my top 10 favorite fics. I've never felt so devastated that a fic will likely never be finished.

Not exactly death eaters but lily is part of a new world order that is evil. Its pretty good but is quite angsty and spends a little more time on the romance aspect than I would have liked. But its pretty well written so it has that going for it.
