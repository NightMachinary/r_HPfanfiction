I kinda wanna ask what everyone thinks about this but my opinion is pretty simple.

James CHANGED. No he may not of liked Snape at all, even to the end. And let's be honest there was some definitive evidence why Snape was a target.(Racist kids get treated badly in most schools, although I don't know if Snape gave off any of those comments before him and lily fought.)

And the fact that it's ridiculous to judge someone based on how they are as a teenager, I look back on how I was when I was younger and cringe (despite never being a bully) and Snape was not a weak little boy that made James feel powerful like many bullies, I find it hard to believe that Snape didn't stir the confrontations and gave as good as he got.

I just want to confirm for certain that bullying is wrong and James' actions were wrong. (As we lack the evidence to say it was 'justified')

** Honestly, this sub (and the majority of the fandom) is completely bonkers when it comes to James - they actually think Snape is a better person than James.

Apparently, Snape being a two-faced murderous little bastard who knew more Dark magic at 11 than most Slytherins at 17 and joining the Death Eaters (and committing all the crimes that come with being a Death Eater) is somehow redeemable, but James being a "bully" is not.

For fuck's sake, Snape is responsible for the murder of Emmeline Vance in 1996 - someone who he was on the same side with! Not to mention the fact that the Cruciatus Curse became an acceptable form of punishment in the school with Snape as headmaster.

I swear, every single thing about James has to revolve around bully. Bully, bully, bully..it's like a fucking broken record. I'm not sure if the majority of the fanbase comprises of teenagers who get bullied on a constant basis, but really, a bully is NOT worse than a murderer. Get your head straight!

[[https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-246d19b6b3f314d44d21e6e01eb237f7][This]] sums up James seen through the eyes of the fandom.

James loathed Snape, but he risked his life to save Snape's worthless hide. I don't know anyone who would do this - I certainly wouldn't risk my life to save that of someone I despised. This speaks volumes about James as a character.

The vilification of James is insane. If James had somehow managed to kill Voldemort, these Snape apologists would start screaming about him being a murderer too.

It's insane - the author thinks that they're redeeming Snape, but it's even worse. In the author's mind, Snape has to have a magical noose around his neck to stop him from being a completely despicable piece of shit. This is how pathetic Snape apologists are.

**** Unfortunately, a good many people are able to identify with having an abusive childhood and making some bad choices growing up due to that.

James is basically seen as a Brock Turner or the Afluenza drunk driving kid, or the yuppie bully in a bad 80's movie. People resent spoiled preps who have a happy home and rich parents who adore them and yet look down on everyone else who isn't as lucky. He has no real reason to be a dick, he just /chooses/ to be.

That scene also triggers a lot of sexual abuse survivors. And, depending on what James did afterwards, could also be a rape scene by US standards (anything inserted).

***** The only thing I feel towards the "poor abused kid", who joined a death cult and brought about the death of so many, is disgust and hate.

Seriously, Snape isn't some innocent darling who made "a few bad mistakes" - he disliked muggles right from childhood, entered school knowing a lot of Dark curses, created spells to maim and kill as a youth, joined the Death Eaters and did everything that Death Eaters did, and only got cold feet when he finds out he inadvertently placed a target on the woman he lusted after.

After his "redemption", he goes around being a lowlife to orphans who lost their parents to the organisation he was part of, tries getting two innocent men killed and Pettigrew (who is incidentally also responsible for James and Lily's deaths) escapes. He then passes information that causes the death of Emmeline Vance. His information also gets Alastor Moody killed and George maimed.

All this pales in comparison to the fact that school children as young as 11 were punished with the Cruciatus curse when he was headmaster of the school. And no, don't give me the "but that was the Carrows!" BS. Snape is headmaster and Voldemort's Right Hand - the Carrows answer to him, not the other way around.

But of course, James is a "spoiled rich bully", and must therefore be the Antichrist reincarnate. That makes total sense. Of course.

If this was Snape vs Sirius or Remus or Peter, I would say they are on an even keel in terms of how difficult their childhood and teen years were.

But James was a spoiled rich prick with loving parents and everything he could want. How am I supposed to feel sorry for that?

There are a lot of people who've had less than stellar childhoods. Few of them decide to go on and join murderous cults. Being poor or abused does not give you a free pass to be a piece of shit - laughing off Dark magic used on a classmate definitely classifies as being a piece of shit.

This isn't stated. It's said that he knew more curses as a first year than most seventh years - it could be an exaggeration, but it clearly means he knew more curses than any of his peers.

Maybe he read when his father was not in the house - this is up to the reader's imagination to figure out how he knew.

#+begin_quote

He's a Death Eater. Albus mentions that it is a death eater that overheard the prophecy, and it turned out to be Snape. He's got the mark to prove it as well.

As for doing what Death Eaters do, what do you think they were doing that made them so feared? Hosting tea parties?

Kidnapping, murder, torture, arson - these are part and parcel of being a Death Eater. Snape shows in school that he isn't averse to using dark or lethal curses (laughing off a dark magic attack on a classmate/peer, developing Sectumsempra before or during the age of 16). He doesn't have an exalted position among the Death Eaters that he can shy away from the dirty work either.

I'm talking about the "evoking sympathy" that you said. Snape's actions do not evoke any sympathy from me, and never will.

You said it yourself, it depends on context. And since the only context we know of Snape's and Lily's (who is also biased towards Snape) until that point, all we have is an incredibly biased point of view.

Hermione punches Draco. To someone watching from a distance, it looks like she's totally out of order. Take a closer look, and you see that Draco is a sadistic little shit. James and Sirius suffer the same thing - you only get one PoV, which is biased as hell.

Not sure what place you live in, but most normal people in the world don't take too kindly to someone who does the things Draco (and in a similar vein, Snape and his buddies) does. If you go around spouting the same stuff Draco does, you'd get the living daylights thrashed out of you /at the very least/.

But when SNAPE set anyone punishment, it was a covert pat on the back in the form of sending the silver trio to Hagrid, thus basically setting up a meeting of the Harry Potter fan club. You appear to be under the impression that Voldemort would have let Snape get away with continuing to run the school like Dumbledore did.

In the 6 years prior to that, Snape gives students lines and makes them scrub cauldrons; it is Minerva who sends 1st years to help Hagrid find a unicorn killing horror and locks Neville out of the common room when a mass murderer is on the loose.

2) Even if that were true, you realise that would only be a sign that Snape grew up in an abusive environment?

3) How was Snape two-faced, when the excuse for James bullying him seems to be that he publicly supported anti-Muggle rhetoric? You know who /was/ two-faced and murderous, in varying degrees? The Marauders - James bullied people behind Lily's back, Lupin disagreed with his friends' actions but did nothing to stop them, while pretending to be a rule-abiding student (as per his own admission in PoA), Peter was... Peter, and Sirius actually attempted murder.

As per his discussion with Dumbledore, Snape hadn't murdered anybody before the end of HBP; the fact that Voldemort sent him to get a job as a professor, right under Dumbledore's nose, and that Karkaroff had exactly zero information on Snape and his deeds, while he had plenty on other Death Eaters, suggests Snape's record was relatively clean.

If he wanted to keep his cover, as per Dumbledore's instructions, Snape still had to respect Voldemort's orders, and act like he agreed with the curriculum and with punishing blood traitors.

James being nice to his friends and protecting his own son means... nothing. The Dursleys and the Malfoys would have died for their children, and Dudley and Draco were nice to their friends.

And the fact that James agreed to use Peter as Secret Keeper because he considered him worthless, while suspecting Lupin of being a traitor... means he was only truly a good friend to Sirius.

#+begin_quote
  This speaks volumes about James as a character.
#+end_quote

He saved Snape in order to prevent his friends from suffering the consequences of becoming murderers. And instead of that being a wake-up call for him, he continued to bully Snape *and others*, culminating with sexually assaulting Snape, while ignoring the fact that the constant bullying could make Snape break and tell the truth about Lupin. Which brings us back to the fact that James only really seemed to care about Sirius.

As a boy, Snape calls literally every other muggleborn other than Lily mudblood - all the while pretending to be a muggleborn's friend. That's the very definition of two-faced.

Snape is a Death Eater. He's got the mark to prove it. He's the one that overheard the prophecy and planted a target on two families.

Fun fact: If Lily wasn't involved in the picture, he wouldn't have his "redemption". If it was some other random woman, Snape would continue being a trigger happy Death Eater.

Death Eaters didn't get feared in the first war by hosting tea parties or picketing shops. Kidnapping, arson, torture, murder - these are part and parcel of being a Death Eater. Snape did not have an exalted position the first time around that he could shy away from doing the dirty work.

Not that he wanted to shy away. As a boy, dear Snape laughed off Dark magic attacks against fellow classmates, invented Sectumsempra, and was pals with those who would become future death eaters.

Of course, those who defend him will call this headcanon or whatever (and turn around and do the same thing themselves when they're criticising another character...hmmm, they're a lot like Snape that way, who would have guessed?)

Believe it or not, if I run a school as principal/headmaster and a student gets hurt, it falls on my head. Not anyone else's.

Voldemort has been known to give Snape a large amount of leeway in several things - begging to spare Lily's life, appearing later than the rest of the Death Eaters, Malfoy's little plot, Harry's retrieval. Voldemort listens to Snape - his right hand man - not the Carrows. Voldemort also buys Snape's bullshit enough times - If Snape tells the Carrows to back off, they will and Voldemort will more or less respect Snape's decision.

No, please, point me to the evidence that Snape "knew more Dark magic at 11 than most Slytherins at 17". It should be easy enough, if it's in the books.

And you'll be shocked to hear that almost all countries have a minimum age of criminal responsibility, so an 11 y.o. "criminal" would " criminal would get off scot-free" almost anywhere in the world, with the exception of some totalitarian countries. You'll also be shocked to hear that mitigating circumstances are an ubiquitous concept, and being abused as a child (which actually affects brain development) would certainly qualify as such when judging said child for the crime of knowing Dark Magic, or a teenager for joining a cult/gang he was groomed for, for years.

But all of that is irrelevant - knowing Dark Magic is not, in itself, a crime in the Wizarding World. There's an entire street full of it, operating legally, and plenty of "Good Guys" use Dark Magic liberally.

You know who did use *illegal* Dark Magic?

No, that's not the definition of two-faced. Snape is publicly friends with Lily, and he is also publicly using the word Mudblood.

Are you arguing that Voldemort sent someone guilty of such crimes to get a job from Dumbledore? Dumbledore, who can use Legilimency on people?

Are you also arguing that Snape managed to somehow do all of that, without anybody knowing about it, not even other Death Eaters? Karkaroff didn't know, and other Death Eaters didn't even mention Snape, as per Sirius, who spent decades in Azkaban with them, heard their ramblings, but never once heard Snape's name mentioned.

In that same conversation, Lily dismissed the Marauders bullying people, despite the fact that they also used Dark Magic. So is using Dark Magic ok or not?

Snape invented Sectumsempra, "for enemies", after he'd almost been killed by a werewolf, the school authorities had covered the whole thing up, and the perps were continuing to target him. Someone who starts carrying a knife because he's constantly being attacked does not automatically =/= that person randomly attacking people and enjoying violence.

If anything, I challenge you to find evidence, in the books, of Snape being deliberately violent with people. I can provide you with evidence of McGonagall, Sirius, Lupin, Hagrid, Arthur Weasley, and even Trelawney being physically violent with children/students.

#+begin_quote

Voldemort trusts Snape because he thinks Snape is a true believer. If Snape suddenly starts protecting blood traitors and telling the Carrows to act nicely... Voldemort won't trust Snape anymore. It's not rocket science [2].

What headcanon did I use?

- Snape having to keep his cover, on Dumbledore's orders, is canon. Dumbledore literally (and, unlike you, I employ the word appropriately) tells him that.

- Voldemort torturing and even killing his loyal followers is canon. This is seen in GoF, OotP, and DH.

- Snape sending Neville, Luna, and Ginny to detention with Hagrid, for a very serious crime (breaking into the Headmaster's office and trying to steal Gryffindor's sword) is canon. If anything, Snape seriously risked his cover by giving them such a light punishment.

#+begin_quote
  In this post, I've seen James get compared to rapists and incels.
#+end_quote

Probably because his behaviour is reminiscent of exactly that. He starts harassing a girl's male friend out of jealousy and in order to get her attention, then, when she rejects him, he removes said male friend's underwear as revenge and humiliation. There's a reason Harry thought it possible that his own father had /forced/ his mother into marriage.

In any case, pulling the "I won't deign to answer your arguments" card seems to be your /modus operandi/, which suggests that you're perfectly aware you don't have any counter-arguments. So why don't you just admit you're wrong? You can wank to James fics even if he was a bully and a sexual assaulter, you know, it's not like the fandom police will descend on your house.

** I'm pretty sure the books at some point confirmed that Snape gave as good as he got. But as others have pointed out, James changed. Let's compare the two's /Post-Hogwarts/ actions:

*James Potter*

Joined the Order of the Phoenix to fight against a madman intent on bringing down the rightful government and placing himself as supreme overlord of Magical Britain.

More than likely provided funding for the Order as he came from a wealthy pureblood family since wars are not cheap and the Order of the Phoenix was essentially a group of vigilantes.

With his wife, Lily, defied the Dark Lord three times (presumably by going toe-to-toe with the bastard or scuppering one of his plots).

Died defending his wife and son from the Dark Lord.

*Severus Snape*

Joined the Death Eaters and the cause of pureblood supremacy which would have seen the woman he claims to love either murdered or used to provide 'entertainment' for the bored elite.

Overheard part of a prophecy which he then joyously reported to his Master.

Tried to arrange for protection for Lily, and ONLY Lily, from both Voldemort and Dumbledore, not caring what happened to the family of the woman he claimed to love.

Proceeded, over the course of the next 14-15 years, to sabotage the number of viable applicants for positions such as Healers and Aurors, leaving the wizarding world both defenseless and vulnerable.

While he may have covertly protected Harry Potter, he also did his level best to get a sick kind of revenge on James Potter by tormenting his son for the six years that he taught the boy.

Sidenote: no, putting on a show for the junior Death Eaters in Slytherin is /not/ a viable excuse as competent teaching and fair treatment of /all/ students could have been explained away as Dumbledore forcing him to be fair. Instead, Dumbledore allowed him these excesses, so the fault lies as much with Dumbledore as it does with Snape in this instance.

He certainly set the stage to help drive an emotionally-damaged and mentally-compromised man, namely Sirius Black, to recklessly go to the Ministry and later provided the intelligence necessary for the Death Eaters to kill a member of the Order of the Phoenix.

As others have pointed out, he allowed the Cruciatus Curse to be used as punishment on the students. He did not, as some have tried to claim, keep the students safe at any level from the depravities of the Carrows.

Finally, his only desire at the end was to look into the eyes of the boy he tormented because they were the same eyes as Lily, the woman who he was /obsessed/ with, not in love with.

*Conclusion*

James Potter was a bully in school, but he grew up to be a hero who stood against a tyrant and paid the ultimate price for those he loved.

Severus Snape, on the other hand, was not only a member of a group of bullies who targeted Muggle-borns at Hogwarts but eventually joined the Death Eaters, knowingly sent the Dark Lord after innocent families by telling him the prophecy, sabotaged the wizarding world's ability to defend itself and heal those injured over the course of a war, took out his vendetta against a dead man by proxy through Harry Potter and every student not in the House of Slytherin, and finally allowed children that were meant to be under his protection to be tortured by a sadistic pair of Death Eaters.

It's pretty easy to see which one was the better man in the end.

That is literally how the world functions. The likelyhood to get a grade exists. Let's say, for posterity, that 40% of people get an O on their potions owl, while 60% get an EE. Therefore, with snape's restrictions, 40% of people get a potions newt. Of those 40%, let's say 20% want to become healers or aurors, while the other 20% did it because of academic interest or because they want to become potions masters.

Conversely, if 60% are accepted, because an EE is more likely than an O, that means more people do the potions newt and can therefore become aurors and healers.

Of those who got an EE and not an O, there are people who wanted to become aurors and healers, this is literally stated in the books with Harry, who didn't get an O. He managed to get in, but that is obviously a rare case. Therefore, less people became aurors or healers.

He had a surveilance device that let him corner Severus when he was vulnerable and a stealthing device that let him walk around unseen. He had three other boys to back him up. Creating an environment wherein Severus could never let his guard down.

There is also a one shot JKR wrote for charity about James and Sirius on a mission for the Order. In it, they bait some Muggles and act as arrogantly as ever.

I'm not sure where the fandom gets the idea that James changed his behaviour. And I'm not sure why the fandom is so hellbent on demonizing Severus. Yes, he was targeted and groomed by a cult, and then decided that the cult was the best place for him. And yes, he did some awful things that can never be undone.

But to imply that Severus is just an irredeemable monster is to just ignore canon. Read the third book if you need a refresher: Severus runs into a werewolf den in order to save three children, a place where he was almost murdered, a place that contains the man who tried to murder him and who favours explosively killing large groups (he thinks).

When Severus is knocked unconscious, Sirius continues to bash him about even though he's suffering a concussion, but when Severus comes upon an unconscious Sirius Black a short while later, Severus does not do the same. He attaches him to a stretcher and is not remotely violent towards him, the man who attempted to murder him and felt no remorse.

If we're going to judge them entirely on decisions they made as teenagers, then we cannot ignore that James commited sexual assault and then threatened to continue that sexual assault if Lily did not date him. He also said, 'Evans, don't make me hit you.'

Sorry, 'hex' you.

Also, please read this; it's a very thorough debunking of a lot of misconceptions.

James bullied people, and used Dark Magic (hexes are DM, as per JKR) on them, for fun. He targeted Snape specifically because he wanted to get Lily's attention, because Sirius was bored, and, according to JKR, because he was jealous of Snape's friendship with Lily. Not even James's best friends and co-bullies try to excuse their actions. JKR has also explicitly said the Marauders "relentlessly bullied" Snape.

#+end_quote

How so? In the UK, the age of criminal responsibility is 10. In almost all other countries, it's somewhere under 16. Because teenagers are fully capable of understanding that it's wrong to beat up and sexually assault others.

Would you be comfortable being friends with someone who held a girl down, shoved soap down her throat, and forcibly removed her underwear, while the entire school was watching? Harry clearly wouldn't, and was appropriately disgusted upon seeing his father do that. He was still disgusted years later:

#+begin_quote
  Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; *he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again*...

**** But your entire OP focuses on excusing James's actions. The fact that someone did something worse does not mean James being a bully and a sexual assaulter is suddenly not a big deal, and not reason enough for people to loathe him. Especially since it's never suggested that he regretted his actions, or did anything to atone for them. He also had no reason to act like that, since he came from a loving family, was very rich, had loyal friends, and so on. All he had to do was... act like a normal human being, and he couldn't even do that.

Snape joining the Death Eaters was partially the consequence of his abusive childhood, and of James bullying him. Saying that James was better than his victim, that /he/ pushed to desperate measures, is... not good.

#+begin_quote
  J.K. Rowling: Well, that is Snape's tragedy. Given his time over again he would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people (like Wormtail) he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive.

  Being a death eater and murdering and pillaging
#+end_quote

He joined the Death Eaters around the same age that James was bullying and assaulting people. You said "it's ridiculous to judge someone based on how they are as a teenager". The difference being that Snape joining the DEs was fueled by many social, psychological and economical factors, while James assaulted people...for fun.

Besides, that's false. As per his discussion with Dumbledore, Snape hadn't murdered anybody before the end of HBP; the fact that Voldemort sent him to get a job as a professor, right under Dumbledore's nose, and that Karkaroff had exactly zero information on Snape and his deeds, while he had plenty on other Death Eaters, suggests Snape's record was relatively clean.

#+begin_quote
  before he turned to support lily (just lily)
#+end_quote

And then he spent his entire adult life working to atone for having joined the Death Eaters at an age when he was too young to vote, or drink, depending on the country. He willingly submitted himself to torture and possible death every time he went to Voldemort, and he risked his life to save as many people as possible, including former bully Lupin.

So yes, of course someone who actually made sacrifices, with nothing to personally gain from them, will receive more sympathy than someone who assaulted people for fun, harassed girls, treated others with superiority (which was what definitively ruined Lily's and Petunia's relationship), decided to dismiss Dumbledore's advice, and trusted his boot-licking friend more than the friend who was the clear moral compass of the group, which led to his and his wife's death.

IIRC James starts the feud with Snape over Snape wanting to be sorted into Slytherin, in a post-Voldemort world. I don't think it's a stretch to say that James' targeting of Snape is modern-day Nazi punching: kind of crass, but morally defensible. Singling him out is kind of shitty when the band could have been a kind of Freedom Fighters throughout the school, but they were standing up to somebody who stood for the terrorizing of their Muggleborn classmates. Also, exposing his underwear is way too far, definitely!!! But, having been in high school in the early 2010's, guys pantsing guys was a common thing. Reprehensible and possibly traumatic, but also not indicative of the mind of a sexual assaulter so much as a young teenager without a developed empathy. The Brock Turner comparison is patently insane.

  James CHANGED.
#+end_quote

Unfortunately, as with evey bully, by the time he changed, he had already done a lot of damage. It is easier to grow up and stop being a bully than deal with the effects of it as a victim. It is a shame that victims are not left in peace to "grow up" instead of being emotionally stunted and traumatised.

#+begin_quote
  And let's be honest there was some definitive evidence why Snape was a target.(Racist kids get treated badly in most schools, although I don't know if Snape gave off any of those comments before him and lily fought.)
#+end_quote

You are referring to now in a society where racism is challenegd more openly...or it should be. They were at school in 70's UK where attitudes were very different. That doesn't make it right, but society was not as progressive back then as it is now... and even now we still have issues with it. We are also told that during the first war with Voldenort the order were outnumbered 20-1 and there were a lot of people who agreed with Voldemort.

Further, James was asked why he would not leave Snape alone and he said "it is more the fact he exists". JKR has also confirmed that his bullying of Snape was relentless and that bullying has consequences. It was also borne out of the fact that Snape was friends with Lily, which I think SWM highlights clearly. James and Sirius also picked on others just because they could. It wasn't just Snape.

#+begin_quote

I imagine most people do.

People should be given room to change, absolutely. What I find difficult to swallow is the attitude to victims I.e. "get over it" which is on display on this sub constantly. It is infuriating, insulting and ignorant. Victims who struggle to overcome are effectively dismissed and treated worse than their aggressors, who are allowed to "change" and "grow up".

#+begin_quote
  and Snape was not a weak little boy that made James feel powerful like many bullies, I find it hard to believe that Snape didn't stir the confrontations and gave as good as he got.
#+end_quote

Despite Lily saying "why won't you leave him alone? What's he ever done to you?" And James responding with that line about him existing.

Even Lupin and Sirius don't try and tell Harry they picked on him because he started it or he was a racist. Lupin strongly implies that Snape only started fighting back, starting it, however you want to frame it, after 5th year. Considering what happened in 5th year with it being made very clear to Snape by Dumbledore that he would not protect him, I can't say I am surprised...

#+begin_quote
  just want to confirm for certain that bullying is wrong and James' actions were wrong. (As we lack the evidence to say it was 'justified')
#+end_quote

Bullying should not be justified. If there is a child displaying unacceptable behaviour then adults should deal with it. For example, Sirius' half heartedly tries to use Snape's "love" of the dark arts as an excuse, but firstly, that could be an exaggeration by Sirius, and secondly we do not know enough about the dark arts to form an opinion ourselves. For example, Harry is not the only one of the "good guys" to use recognisable dark arts.

James hating them as much as Sirius says he did is most likely the result of what his parents taught him (despite the marauders map being full of dark magic). Just as Snape apparently knowing dark arts at a young age must have come from his mother. What you have there is parents with two different views on a certain type of magic. It is not up to James or any child to dish out perceived "justice" (but James was not doing that. He was in Sirius' own words an arrogant berk). If there were concerns over Snape and the dark arts, a teacher should have been dealing with it and taking it up with his mother...perhaps if they had bothered Snape might have had a chance. There is a reason JKR highlighted the clear neglect Snape has in his life in comparison to pampered James...but again, James was asked why he was bullying Snape and he responded because he exists.

‚Äã

that is the description of James at 15 before he changed and grew up. And the description of Snape at the very end of his life and 'redemption arc'.

People don't seem to like that James was objectively the better person.

But the thing is we see James at his very worst in action and it is a mundane kind of nastiness and 'evil' one people can understand and relate to. And that makes people emotionally connect to that 'badness'. People you didn't experience it can only rudimentary understand the terror of genocide. So we see and understand James at his worst, but only hear about his best.

With Snape it is the other way. We didn't see him at his worst when he was a devoted death eater, we only hear glims of it, how he is willing to sell out innocent children for prestige for example. But we only hear about it, we don't see it. But we are shown Snape at his best, when he fought for the good side.

** The difficulty I have with people's reactions to Snape is that the same people who are quite happy to justify Harry doing virtually anything as a result of his upbringing, will nonetheless condemn Snape in spite of his, which was obviously much worse. Whereas Harry left his abusive home and found welcome and friendship and praise at Hogwarts, Snape came there and continued to be bullied and ostracised. He was at best ignored by non-Slytherins because they all distrusted Slytherins, and there's no way the Slytherin purebloods would welcome someone whose dad was a Muggle. We know that his only friend was Lily - he was ostracised.

The same people seem to think Snape and the Marauders only met in their 5th year - which was when Snape became friends with the junior Death Eaters - and there was no history before then. Snape was an easy target, and like all bullies, the Marauders love to go for the easy targets. Someone socially awkward with no friends to defend him.

Yes, of course he joined the DEs and called Lily a mudblood, but as I said, it wasn't until his 5th year. The fact that she was willing to be his close friend until then is another indication he wasn't particularly bad previously, just ugly/greasy and socially awkward. Presumably the DEs noticed by then that he was intelligent and useful, and also primed for radicalisation. He'd been made powerless and alone by the constant bullying and ostracisation, and was offered a golden opportunity to become powerful himself and to belong to a group of people. Of course he took it.

I don't think James is unredeemable or should be vilified as much as he is, but I also think you make far too little attempt to understand Snape or why he acted the way he did. I also don't see him as unredeemable in the right fic

Not in canon, but it's a very common theme in fics and in requests on this sub. Everyone wants their power and revenge fantasies, without too much constraint from pesky things like morals.

I didn't talk about what Snape did during the war, just how he got to that point, because that's where James is relevant. I agree he does some very bad things and that he remains responsible for them no matter what. But he still changed sides, and for the sake of someone other than himself. And then he stays with that choice, despite that Lily is dead and he has everything to gain by going back to the Death Eaters. He's not naturally predisposed to evil and selfishness, like Voldemort, he's a realistic person with both good and bad qualities. His childhood and teenage years greatly encouraged him towards the bad qualities. A few small changes in that period, though, would not only make him redeemable, but he wouldn't need to be redeemed at all.

Imagine if they'd gone to school when there hadn't been a war brewing. Snape would still have been awkward and greasy, James would still have been a bully. But Snape wouldn't have been radicalised, while James wouldn't have had any opportunities to be a hero. Opinions of the two might be completely reversed and I might be here talking about how James is a complex and redeemable character.

Ultimately, I think a big part of the problem is that both James and Snape can be bad, and both of them can be good. You can write it however you want. But the culture of fanfiction has a lot of bashing - if you want to show one person as good, you justify that by showing their enemy as awful, and vice versa. Fic authors need to treat each character on their own merits, as written, not link that to other characters.

Ofc, Sirius and Lupin have good things to say, but saying and showing are different. A whole scene of James being a bully gives a more lasting impression on a reader then a few words said in passing.

And honestly, we /don't know/ how much he changed and if he did at all. We can only assume that if Lily started dating him, he must have became a more decent guy. Still though, it's entirely possible to love your family and be loyal to your friends and be an arsehole all around otherwise.

** Honestly, there's not really a single person in the Harry Potter universe (that's more than a name and a single character-trait buzzword, anyway) that isn't an utter twat in one respect or another. Dumbledore is enigmatic, McG is hands-off to the point of invisibility, Snape is a bitter wanker, James was a bully, Moony was a coward who abandoned his family, Sirius was mad, Ron was... Ron, Hermione was a nightmare, the Death Eaters are obvious, etc etc etc. They've all got good sides and bad sides and seeing any of them as 'canonically good' is inaccurate. About the only people who don't are Luna and Neville.

But really, it's just... you can appreciate a character having decent qualities while also acknowledging their faults. It's kind of a thing in this fandom - Rowling wrote a series that has some really good bits, some really bad bits, and some middling bits. The bad doesn't outweigh or eliminate the good and the good doesn't outweigh or eliminate the bad. Same with the characters. You can look at the whole picture and like a character even while acknowledging that they did bad things.

At the end of the day, Rowling just told us what people did and said and how Harry saw them and left us to make up our own minds otherwise. There's enough room in canon for any fanon headcanon interpretation you feel passionately enough about to find evidence for. James is a twat and a hero, Snape is a misunderstood kid who never grew up and a bitter old wanker who bullied children for a decade.

** I'll be honest. I don't like Snape or James.

I don't like James because most of what we saw of him was someone who wasn't very likable. It makes sense, but we never actually got to see him change. On the other hand, we don't know what type of person he really was during Hogwarts. We know about him and the maruarders, I think it's canon that in 7th year he wised up? But other than that, all we've really seen of him is him being a bully. Take the whole pensive scene in the deathly hallows, where we see some of James. We see in first year that he pushes past people without care and shit (yes i know it was first year but i'm making a point about how little we know) We see him and Lilly in love, dancing around (presumably after Hogwarts) In the order of the phoenix however, we see him specifically going after Snape. No provocation at all as far as we know. We all know what happens next. It's horrible, James was horrible. But then there's the werewolf incident. I believe it was only Sirius who told Snape, and true it wasn't Sanpe's business, but Sirius was still way outta line. Here comes the tricky part, if I remember correctly, James saved Snape. That means everything and nothing. You can be a terrible person but still save someones life, it depends on the reasoning. It was believed by Snape that James only saved him because Remus would've been killed otherwise But, Snape wasn't exactly innocent either.

I think more people treat Snape like he's a better person because he's more sympathetic. He had the person he loved love the person who bullied him. I think it's pretty easy to imagine that Snape was susceptible to dark magic in Hogwarts. He was in Slytherin in the midst of a war, not to mention that he would've had to protect himself. It's logical I guess. I think the closest we got to Snape being worthy of the bullying, or torment was when he called Lilly a mudblood. Also, as a sidenote. It was subtly, but heavily emphasised that Snape was poor. James, being from a rich family (I think his family was rich??) and Sirius (the same situation) could've used that as ammunition. Also as another side note, that would explain the greasy hair. If you don't shower with shampoo, your hair looks greasy and shampoo might not of been a necessity for Snapes family, already being poor. And that shit becomes a habit, which is why it could've progressed into adulthood. That's not to say that they were like that in the end though.

Also, although Snape was a cunt to Harry and blinded by his hatred, he did also spy for Dumbledore. Doesn't make up for the fact, but he constantly risked his life to gain information for the order. Snape betrayed the Dark Lord because of the woman who rejected him. You can say what you want about either, but the truth is that we SAW Snape progression as a character and what he did, what he was like. We don't know what James would've been like. We don't really know enough about either character to say which was a better person or anything.

** Because James started the bullying the first day they met.

Also, I don't feel sorry for rich bullies. James had everything. With Sirius, Remus and Peter I can understand them being bullies. With James, how am I supposed to feel sorry for some spoiled rich kid that had everything he could ever want?

** This topic is so dangerous in a way.Many people argue about Snape being recruited from an early age and so on. As I'm no expert here, I can't analyse this. What annoys me is that Rowling tels but not shows. If had something about James that proves his friends are telling the truth, it would be easier to discuss this.Snape also has a tragic backstory and nothing about what he did as a death eater so it can turn into him actually doing nothing particularly bad. At some point it begins to seem like Snape is meant to be a victim and his own choices don't matter. No matter what he does, it is either fine or look how stressed he is so it's all fine. Then Dumbledore is brought up and this turns into a vicious argument. I actually was surprised how rude and vicious his fans are.

** ok James is a known bully in canon there are literal records of his "pranks" we only ever hear lily say snape was potentially involved in some blood purist stuff no he did not know a heap of dark magic at 11, you idiots he is a half-blood I can't remember if it was confirmed whether his father was abusive or not but a lot of fanfiction suggests he does have an abusive father looking at it snape was a bit of a loner whereas James had three friends to back him up do you actually think that snape went after James for gods sakes James' pranks were not pranks they were bullying his "pranks" often focused on humiliating one or a small group of people rather than doing something that wouldn't upset anyone like Fred and George if I were Snape id be more than a little bitter about the situation and no I wouldn't verbally abuse a kid but have you seen snape teach I sincerely doubt he wants to be a teacher it's not like he ever physically abused a kid

  Remus functioned as the conscience of this group, but it was an occasionally faulty conscience. He did not approve of their relentless bullying of Severus Snape, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.

******* Death of the Author. Anything that is not within the text is irrelevant. From what we see in the text, Snape was a cruel ex-terrorist bully in adulthood, who hung around cruel proto-terrorist bullies when he was at school. He demonstrates a disdain and cruelty towards others who are not Lily before he even set foot in Hogwarts. There is plenty of evidence to support that Snape was just as much of a shithead, if not more, than the Marauders.

***** These people sound like they're in a cult, with the way they all parrot the "gave as good as he got" line, which appears nowhere in the text.

Dismissing the text itself, which presents a very clear image, and Word of God on top of it, while conjuring excuses for why James was a good person out of thin air and then ask us to justify the violence they made up.

This on top of the usual way they use adult Snape's demeanor as a justification for how teen James treated teen Snape as though James was a fucking Seer and not part of the reason Snape turned out the way that he did. This is putting a lot of faith in the moral judgement of someone who was not only a total piece of shit, but who also trusted Sirius, an attemped murderer and elf-abuser, and PETER, an actual mass murderer.

Then Snape fans are accused of being unpleasant or whatever the fuck that was.
