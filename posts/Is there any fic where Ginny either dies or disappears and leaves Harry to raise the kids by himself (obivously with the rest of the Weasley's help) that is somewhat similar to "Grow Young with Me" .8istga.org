#+TITLE: Is there any fic where Ginny either dies or disappears and leaves Harry to raise the kids by himself (obivously with the rest of the Weasley's help) that is somewhat similar to "Grow Young with Me" ?

Preferably without Hermione or slash Pairing.


** Just read that one the other day. It is such an amazing story, I was hooked after a couple chapters. The way the author writes about grief, and how it affects different people is incredible. I also love the way Harry is with his kids, and the whole issue with her being a muggle is so well done. Apparently the author is almost finished the next chapter, I can't wait till its released.

** I recall reading a story where Ginny was died protecting Lily L. The story was basically a murder mystery where Harry is trying to solve who murdered his wife and it honestly one of the best fanfic murder mystery/detective sort of story I have every read. But I cannot for the life of me remember the fic's name!

** I just spent the entire morning reading Grow Young with Me, it was great! I'm not usually a big fan of OCs but I liked her and I felt like all the characters remained true to their personalities.
