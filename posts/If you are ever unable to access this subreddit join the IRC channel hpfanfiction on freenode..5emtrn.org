** Please, reddit won't shut down over it. No one should even be surprised to see this being possible.

Writing rights over the database basically means that. He can change your password if he wanted. Beside, it's not like only bad things came out of it, by reminding people admins can modify comments, maybe reddit won't take itself as seriously and won't be usable as testament and proof in court anymore.

It's something that can be done anywhere, Facebook, 4chan,twitter, Tumblr, forums, ff.net, etc.

We will all pretend to be offended for a while, and then forget about it in two weeks

*** IRC suits the regulars who use it. We don't care for voice and the IRC is much easier to use including the bot stuff and security. We've had this discussions several times and have yet to change off it. If you want to operate a discord server by all means do so but at least a dozen of us probably won't ever use it.

**** What about Slack? A long standing IRC group i've been part of recently migrated to it, and it's top. And bots can be used via a Slack <-> IRC gateway.

Is it? I've never made a IRC, but I know making a discord is stupidly easy.

Well, can't argue with bot's, but security is one of discords most advertised features.
