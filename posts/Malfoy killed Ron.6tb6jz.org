I am looking for fanfic where Ron die after drinking poisoned alcohol in Slughorn's office. I mean scene after Ron ate chocolate with love potion on his birthday in HBP. Or at least Malfoy is punished for poisoning Ron that could kill him.


** ...Sorry, I haven't read something like that, but I just have to say:

I'd send Malfoy flowers (in my mind at least!)...finally Harry can live up to his potential without Ron dragging him down!

ps: Just got to add: I don't even like Malfoy, but here he is at least good for something!

**** Loyalty potions, the plot to steal his money, going behind his back to plot with Dumbledore, trying to separate him from his destined soul mate Hermione through pureblood laws and more potions, that kind of thing. It's all in the books.

*** I see you subscribe to the school of thought that in order to show Harry having independence and free will he has to blame others for his previous failings.

*** I feel like ron was a decent bloke in the books, or atleast good enough to not have people wishing death on him. Maybe you've come across some pretty bad portrayals of him recently?
