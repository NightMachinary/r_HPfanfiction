**** But more seriously, you may like [[/u/starfox5]] 's linkffn(Uncle Quentin's Spy). I haven't read it, but it seems similar. Hermione's great-uncle secret society spy trains her (or something like that). I think I ran across one where the Squib relative of the Weasleys was a spy. Or one where a Squib spy Black raises Harry.

I'll have to look when I get home!

** Regarding your edit, it's a fairly specific request so it's not surprising there's not much to recommend. There are thirteen [[https://www.fanfiction.net/James-Bond-and-Harry-Potter-Crossovers/124/224/][fics]] in the Bond x HP category on FFN and five [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/James%20Bond*s*Harry%20Potter/works][fics]] on AO3. I'm sure there are some untagged ones, but the chances someone has come across it are low.

** This doesn't fit your request, but I've only ever read one fic with a Harry Potter/James Bond crossover. linkffn(8895954) He doesn't raise Harry and it doesn't play a huge part in the plot, but he ends up a device for rescuing Harry from the Dursley's.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

** The only one I enjoy is linkffn(Agent Double O Hex)

Only about 8 chapters but is a fun romp especially since the implications of Magic in a world with MI-6 and other organizations basically makes the world silly puddy. The later chapters play around with puberty in a funny way. It's more of a Harry Potter Crack Fic with James Bond but I still recommend it as the James Bond flavour effects EVERYTHING.
