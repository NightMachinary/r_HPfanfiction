They were head boy and girl in their 7th year and could speak to each other with their minds. Thanks


** That describes....MANY H/Hr fics. I would know, I feel like I have read them all.

*** Ginny is with Draco and I'm pretty sure she's pregnant. When H and Hr's emotions get heightened (you know...) they blow out all the glass around the hb and hg area so dumbledore knows something's up. Ron gives hermione a plant that will grow with love or something, and hermione's like oh crap but I don't love you. At some point they were at Privet Drive and Petunia is nice and approves of hermione for Harry.

** I don't remember whether they're head boy/girl or not but I believe telepathy is a big part of linkffn(Hary Potter and the Isle of Mists) by lorien829 (who's better known for Resistance and Shadow Walks).
