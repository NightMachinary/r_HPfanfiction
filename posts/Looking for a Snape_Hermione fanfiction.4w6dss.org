I have been searching everywhere for a snamione fanfic I had read a while back. I can't remember the title but the plot basically involves Hermione and Snape married but I think it was forced and Hermione gets given a brooch by an elderly witch during an outing to diagon alley. The brooch is haunted and ends up giving Hermione powers I.e she gets angry with Ginny and takes away her magic. Voldemort learns of this and seeks to use Hermione's new found powers for his own personal gain. Can any one help? ðŸ™‚

** Oh, I remember this too! I believe it was an older fic on FFN or Ashwinder. I'll look through my liked fics on both those sites.
