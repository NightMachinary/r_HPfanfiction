Looking for fics where Harry joins Voldemort. Can later become love interest. Join due to being manipulated by the light/ betrayals Can be as a result of having powers blocked


** I've read a few romance fics between them that fit the bill...

!linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding)

Probably the /best/ fem!Harry/Voldemort fic out there.

!linkffn(Devil Take the Hindmost)

Voldemort is in constant contact with Harry due to the horcrux between them. This obviously affects her development and her views on the world

!linkffn(Power is Control)

Harry "joining" Voldemort in this one is dubious. There is a romance between them, but while Emily is more than willing to simply seize power, Harry is trying to satisfy her lust for power through less violent paths.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.

  Then Harry's mouth went completely dry.  His captor struck a tall, imposing figure, black locks neatly framing his aristocratic cheekbones. The relaxed line of his mouth did nothing to soften the furious, slightly maniacal glint in his cool gray eyes, fixed unwaveringly upon him. “Finally awake... Death Eater?” the man spat spitefully. Harry never would have imagined meeting like this. The words “I can explain” were stuck on the tip of his tongue. But all that came out was a soft, strangled, “Sirius.” *Harry and Teddy accidentally time travel to 1979, where they are immediately captured by Voldemort at his prime. After months of posing as a loyal Death Eater to protect Teddy, Harry is then captured by the Order. Misunderstandings ensue.

  Harry was always reminded of how similar he was with Voldemort's former self and when he didn't, others somehow made sure to remind him. What he can't understand though is why? At least he's about to find out.

  The rendezvous at The Department of Mysteries spirals into a series of events which change the future of the wizarding world. As always, Harry is right at the middle of it all, yet in a situation he couldn't have ever fathomed and alongside the very person whom he was supposed to hate. It changes them both.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
