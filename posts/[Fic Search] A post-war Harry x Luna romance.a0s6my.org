I can recall a few specific scenes from the fic, but can't seem to remember the name. I think I read it on AO3.

One scene involved Harry accidentally spying on Luna dancing around her house naked. I seem to remember that she was living in her father's old house.

I think another part of the story is that Harry and Luna hike to a pond and go skinny dipping/float in the pond looking up at the sky.

Unfortunately, that's all I can remember from the story but I'd love it if someone could help me find it again. Thanks.


** Its on FFN too, its called linkffn(Unspeakable Beauty) and I just recommended it in another post.

  A/U after DH, EWE. Luna Lovegood is the Ministry's newest Unspeakable, and Harry's work as an Auror brings them into close quarters. What will happen when The Boy Who Lived Twice can't stop thinking about The Girl Who Lives In Her Own Universe? HP/LL

**** NP, I quite liked this fic too, this and the one from TE7 are definitely my favourite H/L fics. Too bad that there aren't more of them.

***** Luna's hard to write well, I think.

I like TE7's romances in general.

****** I actually have the opposite reaction. Rather, I love them, but the endings are so so so bad that I can't help but hate them. The only one I didn't read was the one where Voldemort is a chick. So I don't know about that, but the rest? Every ending could've been way way better, its like his brain freezes 3 chapters before the end. The only one that I haven't felt like that is the one with Luna.
