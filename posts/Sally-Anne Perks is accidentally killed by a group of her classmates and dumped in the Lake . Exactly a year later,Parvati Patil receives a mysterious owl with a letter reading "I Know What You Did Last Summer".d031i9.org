** I Know What You Did Last Summer was ruined for me by a spoof, and I think it was an MTV Movie Awards skit, and someone playing Jennifer Love Hewitt's character took the "What are you waiting for?" scene and spun it into "What are you waiting for? My boobs to pop out of my shirt?" For whatever reason, that spoof just killed any future suspense of that movie or series.

Serious fanfic, I'd struggle to read it. Make a crack fic, and I'd probably love it.

** "I know what you did last summer."

Fuck. I thought we had gotten rid of the evidence when Sally-Anne Perks died after we were pushing her and she fell off the moving staircase. We'd dumped her in the Black Lake and make an unbreakable vow not to tell anyone.

*** I don't think she was sorted in canon, but the only fics I've read where she was even mentioned (namely linkffn(The Arithmancer) and linkffn(The Accidental Animagus)) had her as a Gryffindor, but an article that postulated a lot about Harry's year suggested she's a Hufflepuff.
