Most of the H/R/Hr stories I find are almost completely all about the more physical aspects of the relationship, but I want to read some that have an actual plot. Crazy, right?

Some physical stuff or allusions to it are fine, but I don't want to read 1,000+ words of nothing but ridiculous scenarios and different names for everyone's bits and pieces.

Thanks!

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ballerinaroy/works?fandom_id=136512][ballerinaroy]] has some great poly Golden Trio fics!

I really liked together or not at all and for as long as you need us, and the whole world was watching (but no one really saw) is on my to-read list.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.

  Five years have passed since the end of the war and against all odds, the trio have found their own bliss. Everything changes, however, when Hermione arrives home one Friday evening to find Ron with his bags packed, telling her that their three-year marriage is over. With rumors circulating about the true nature of their relationship, Harry and Hermione find themselves alone in their quest to understand the strange turn of events and with more questions than answers about where exactly Ron has gone.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]] has them fighting the zombie battleship BismarckMort with the help of HMS Hood. It's a rare crossover too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] never depicted their relationship as romantic, mere stating that they live and sleep together.
