So in trying to read linkffn(13209883) I ran across this thing "Hermione learned of her magic almost a year ago" aka for whatever reason people seem to think people learn of magic on the last birthday before they start at Hogwarts. This is terrible on so many levels, at least for people born say: 31st of August.

â€‹

Why is this such a common belief?


** Because "Hogwarts letter delivered to wizards and witches the year they turn eleven" is misconstrued by fanon to mean "Hogwarts letter delivered exactly when you turn eleven", on the day of the birthday. In the books, Hagrid delivers Harry's letter on his birthday, but most people tend to forget that Harry only got his letter then because the Dursleys had been taking them from him before he could read them.

There is also this quote from Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  Minerva never forgot how much her mother cried, when the letter of admittance into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry *arrived on Minerva's eleventh birthday;* she knew that Isobel was sobbing, not only out of pride, but also out of envy.

It's an article written by JKR herself, but I believe some things have been edited within the last year or so to remove any references to her age, decade of birth, and era of her childhood upbringing, in order not to contradict McG's appearance in the latest Fantastic Beasts film.

Take it as you wish.

*** There's also a tendency for people to claim that she isn't actually that smart (to be fair plenty of people also write as some kind of super genus). Ironically, a lot of authors end up writing a Hermione style character anyway.

*** It's not a Hermione or bashing specific thing though - a lot of Tom Riddle stories have Dumbledore visiting him on his birthday not to mention all the canon rehashes that have owls deliver Harry his letter on July 31st rather than a week earlier.

** Well it does make sense. Hermione has had almost a year to learn magic while everyone else...doesn't.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger and Harry Potter are sorted into Slytherin at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Follow the two as they figure out how to navigate the dungeons of the school and their place within Slytherin House. Follow them as they attempt to figure out their place within the Wizarding world. Canon divergence. Mostly AU.
