Am I the only person who has a real problem with how house elves, and house elf slavery, is typically depicted in fanfiction? Because it seems like every other fic I read goes out of its way, sometimes in direct contradiction of canon, to come up with reasons for why house elf slavery is okay, justified, beneficial.

And don't give me that "they're happier as slaves" line- that is literally what apologists for the Confederacy then and now say about black slavery in the real world. They're happier. They're better off. Its always been just an excuse, to justify exploitation, and if that was the analogy Rowling was trying to make she's a genuinely vile person. But I think it may be more complicated than that.

We only see three house elves in any great detail in canon. One (Dobby) wants freedom, and actively disobeys and undermines his masters. Another (Kreacher) is loyal to the family that owns him in theory, but despises his current master (Sirius) and actively works against and undermines him. Only one (Winkie) seems genuinely loyal to her master- but not so much to her new master (Hogwarts), and its clearly not an emotionally healthy emotional state.

We have Dobby's word that the Hogwarts elves are offended by Hermione's efforts to trick them into freedom, but we don't know the details as to why. Maybe the elves don't agree with Hermione's methods. Maybe they're insulted by the shear lack of thought and planning that went into this half-assed attempt to "help" them. Its likely Hermione doesn't even have the authority to free them. And if she did, where would they go? We know Dumbledore will agree to pay a free elf if they want, or let them leave, and its unlikely that he subjects them to any kind of physical abuse. He may or may not have the authority to free them all and hire them all outright (there's the board of governors, which has some authority over him), but if the elves were given freedom from Hogwarts, and Hogwarts were unable or unwilling to keep them on a salary, they'd have precious few other options. Where else, in that society, would hire that many free elves? Nowhere. That is not, of course, a justification for their slavery. Its an indictment of a society that gives them no other options.

And if some elves do really identify with their masters and choose to remain slaves... well, Stockholm Syndrome is a thing. It doesn't make the abuse okay.

So can this fandom just stop with the slavery fan fic? These rationalizations may be being applied to a fictional race, but they are the same damn arguments that have been used to defend the enslavement of real people for centuries.


** I think we should distinguish the kind of abuse Dobby suffered, which is obviously terrible, from whether house elves get paid or not, which is more ambiguous.

#+begin_quote
  “And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!”

  “That's not very much!” Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky's continued screaming and fist-beating.

  “Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,” said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, “but Dobby beat him down, miss. . . . Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn't wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.”
#+end_quote

Even the single house elf that we see wanting wages only wants the equivalent of 5 pounds a week, a tenth of what he was offered. And the only things he actually buys are eccentric outfits, which most house elves wouldn't want.

I think ideally, house elves wouldn't be magically bound to their masters, so that elves like Dobby could leave whenever they wanted, but in practice the vast majority would continue working for free, since they like work and don't really need or want money.

*** I imagine house elfs as a species just have an intense drive to help people and an intense loyality to the people they serve

even free house elves still gain intense loyality to those they respect with dobby willing to do what ever to please harry

I imagine most wizarding/house elf relationships are quite respectful the wizard has chores he wants done and the house elf gladly does them but then bad wizards abuse that relationship and abuse and demean them

its kinda like someone abusing a dog a being with undying devotion and loyality to you and then hurting it.

I would imagine allot of house elfs if you did pay them would then spend the money back on the family they serve for example buying gifts for the young kids in the family

Think about it like being brainwashed, every day, by society, since you were born. You ask what would an elf do with money - what would a human wizard do with money? If you can just live at someone elses house, obey their commands, and transfigure yourself food? ...but you don't want that, as a human, do you?

Look how they treat this poor vulnerable creature and look how good he is. And then later, even though the Blacks seemed to treat their house elves well, ‘that's only because he's a horrible mean creature just like them'.

*** The troubling difference between brownies of folklore and house-elves is the freedom of choice. It was touched on in the thread, but I don't think given the focus it needed.

Traditionally (so far as I am aware; I am familiar with the folklore but did not grow up with it) brownies could *not* be forced to continue to work for a family they did not wish to work for. This is clearly not the case for Dobby, who /cannot be free/ from the Malfoys unless he is given clothes by one of them (or possibly only Mr. Malfoy)

I saw the mention that brownies could be commanded, but there is a huge difference between "Quick, go fetch the midwife," and "Go iron your hands!" And I agree that brownies could be depicted malicious to those who had offended them, but I cannot recall any fable where they continued to work for the ones who had done so unless it was a case of malicious compliance. That does not seem to be the case for Dobby. Yes, he dobbed on Mr. Malfory, but at the same time seemed to work for the family despite the fact that he didn't want to because he had no choice.

The thing I find the most aggravating about the way Dobby and the other house-elves were depicted in the books was that with only minor tweaks it could have been much closer to the traditional depiction of brownies. Imagine this, if you will:

/Dobby, a happy and loyal house-elf, discovers that the head of the family he has been helping and caring for plans to endanger and possibly kill Harry Potter. Potter is adored by elves because of the destruction of Voldermort, who wanted to either enslave or exterminate house-elves. Dobby is enraged and horrified by this, and takes steps to keep Harry from attending Hogwarts so he will be safe. He continues to work for the Malfoys (and he may still care for Narcissa and Draco) so he can spy on Lucius and possibly learn more about the plot, while at the same time trying to get Harry out of Hogwarts, and at the end of the book makes it clear to Harry that Lucius is the one responsible for the cursed diary./

What do you lose with these changes? The ragged dirty pillowcase, the abuse, and the confrontation at the end of the book where Harry tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby. So why on earth did Rowling chose to depict Dobby as abused and unable to leave?

  I think this is an incredibly americanized view of house elves.
#+end_quote

No, it is not. Real-live slavery was not an American-only concept. It existed in Britain too (and in fact, across the globe), if not to the same extent. And so did the justifications for it. Little of the points in the OP are only relevant in America.

#+begin_quote
  For what it's worth, I think the opposite is true: it's frustrating seeing so many people with little understanding of where house elves originate from as an idea.
#+end_quote

In folklore, the brownies are not enslaved. They don't follow orders, and are not magically bound to do so. To quote the page you yourself linked,

#+begin_quote
  Brownies are described as easily offended and will leave their homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of.
#+end_quote

Enslaving brownies is no less abominable than enslaving people. It is canon that house elves are slaves. Their situation fits all definitions to a t. The fact that they like chores doesn't make slavery, especially magically enforced one, OK.

From here:

#+begin_quote
  The issue was interesting in the books because there wasn't an obvious right answer, but a number of stories I've read seem to have put their foot down and said 'no, it's wrong'
#+end_quote

The alternative to 'no, it's wrong' is that it's morally justified.

I agree that resolving the issue in canon would be difficult, and can see how "just give them all clothes" could backfire. But there's little question that their situation, as is, is wrong.

But to get back to the beginning, arguing about

  The Americanized view referred to the concept of their existence as analogous to an issue of slavery/race slavery where I do not believe this is what they were intended as, as I explained later on.

Only makes sense if you think that the alternative theory - that they are inspired from brownies from English folklore - changes the moral dimension.

Hmm. Chattel slavery was disbanded in England in the 12th century. Slavery did rear its head again on English soil in the form of "indentured servitude," but that had also completely disappeared by round about 1800.

The thing about slavery and the English is that our very strict cultural distaste for /keeping/ slaves allowed many of our merchants to /trade in/ slaves overseas whilst maintaining the polite fiction that our hands were clean. Spoiler - they were not.

/However,/ as the OP to this comment thread has said, JKR is British and was writing for a predominantly British audience. It's probably most culturally appropriate to read house elves as indentured servants - ie contracted, unpaid, labour who, upon the completion of their contract, are "freed," (rather than the life sentence of chattel slavery), coupled with a bit of a twist on the traditional Scottish myth of the helpful Brownie.

All that said, I think JKR is definitely using Hermione as an author avatar when she says it's not right to keep them in this way, but she's also very careful to display a cautionary tale via Hermione's actions - at no point does Hermione speak to an elf other than Dobby or Winky. She doesn't know what they want or what they would need upon freedom and /doesn't bother to find out./ She makes her own decision that others are absolutely morally in the wrong, having done minimal research and made no attempt to speak with or understand the group she claims to fight for.

If house elves are slaves, Hermione is a "white saviour" type. And therein lies the point - just because it's wrong to keep elves as slaves, it doesn't make it right to free them without planning where they would go, how they would live and eat, who would care for them, and what rights they as free beings would have under the law. Hermione behaves like a complete idiot over this - not because she's "disrespectful to wizard culture" as most fics seem to want to say, but because she doesn't actually seem to care about what happens to the elves once they are free. She attempts to free them for /her own moral comfort,/ not in any genuine attempt to respond to their needs. Because she doesn't know, nor seem to be remotely inclined to discover, what their needs truly are.

I would actually give a much more charitable interpretation of this: Hermione behaves like a complete idiot over this, because she doesn't know better. She cares about house elves, she certainly did research about them, but some things can only be understood with experience and maturity she didn't have at the time.

******** Perhaps. I'm not actually sure we see her doing research - she mentions that elves aren't talked about in Hogwarts A History(other books are available, Hermione. Ffs!) But the thing is, at no point did she go down to the Hogwarts kitchens and /ask the elves what they want or need./ For her, it's about the moral absolute that its wrong to enslave elves (which it totally is and anyone who thinks the book is making the opposite point is either wilfully blind or hasn't read it properly) but not about the realities of what elves would need to properly organise their freedom. She's doing it for her own reasons, not for their reasons.

Hermione in GoF is the equivalent of a straight person who goes to a pride parade, gets some pics of them "supporting equality" for the insta, then thinks "cool that's my good deed for the day done" and goes and shops at a company like Chik-fill-a that has terrible employment practices when it comes to LGBT rights. In other words, she's morally correct, but her actual understanding of the issue is so surface level that her "support" borders on harmful.

As to your other point, she's socially stunted bookworm. Of course she read books, and didn't go to ask them in person. And she did read books other than Hogwarts: a History. It may not be explicitly stated, but once again: she's a bookworm!

What does my head in are fics where Hermione is portrayed as "disrespectful to wizarding culture" for giving a shit about house elves and everyone laughs and says "stupid mudblood doesn't understand how much they love being enslaved." No, that's not why she's wrong. She's wrong because she's young, idealistic, and hasn't wised up to the realisation that if you "gift" someone freedom with no structure to help them adapt, you're still oppressing them because you're condemning them to a life of uncertainty, poverty and discrimination. You have to change /structures/ to bring meaningful change to individuals. That's why Hermione is wrong, but as you say, of course she is. She's fifteen.

But it isn't voluntary. The key difference between brownies and house elves is their ability to choose to live, and that's a key difference.

In fact, when I see house elves as allegory of brownies, this makes the situation even sadder and more abominable. It establishes a contrast. Between the fairytale, where creatures sneak in your house to clean and do some chores, and all they want in return is a bowl of milk and not to be abused. And the dark reality, where they're actually bound with such a strong bond, that you can make them iron their hand, and they'll be forced to obey and stay.

While not on the page, I can't help but see some point in history where wizards got fed up with the brownies' whimsy and "unreasonable demands", and bound them into house elves.

** The House Elf debate suffers from the old problems of fanfiction.

First, the 'Actually, this slavery is good/okay' camp is a knee-jerk reaction to the earlier 'Wizarding Society is evil and backwards' trope that was championed in early Harry/Hermione works. Here, the treatment of House Elves is used as an indication that wizarding society does that and so much more, and that therefore all contemporary witches and wizards are evil people who would condone or support modern slavery.

The problem with all this is a lack of appreciation for the complexity of the situation (something that fanfiction often has difficulties with). Here's the thing, it is possible for people to do bad things, for bad reasons, not out of ill-will, but because they are as 'institutionalised' as the people they are oppressing. When everything they have grown up with has normalised a world where a group of people is subservient to another, it takes a remarkably strong set of ethical values, and a lot of introspection and uncomfortable self-examination to realise the problem.

Imagine if, in future, we found that actually, all creatures, from the lowliest bacterium all the way to the smartest ape, had a full and complete form of sapience. That our problem now was simply that we looked at the wrong factors for trying to determine that capability in others who do not share the same cultural/biological backgrounds. We would then have to come to the realisation that all these years where we have exploited other living creatures for our own comfort or enjoyment were unjust, and possible even cruel. But it would not make us evil, or even necessarily bad. We all must try to do the best with the knowledge we have, as that's all we can ever do. But we also must be careful to avoid imparting to people in other times and cultures our own knowledge or set of beliefs. What is obvious to us here and now, was not necessarily obvious to people a thousand years ago, and to judge their morality based on what we know now is fairly unhelpful.

Of course, the reactionary stance of 'stop trampling on my childhood whimsy! Slavery can be totally justified' is also very, very wrong. Using modern day ethics, it's simply not the case. What we know of witches and wizards, and what we know of House Elves (that both parties are conscious, sapient, feeling beings), means that slavery of the kind seen cannot be judged moral. There's a separation of culture here that has to be addressed. It's possible for the witches/wizards, based on their cultural/historical context to argue that that specific form of slavery is okay, but we, the writers and readers, are not within their context, we are outside it, and from the outside the slavery we see is wrong, there are no ifs or buts.

The answer, then, is to not make it an argument of black and white, right and wrong, good and evil. Instead, the answer is to frame it as a failure of education. Witches and wizards who treat their House Elves well and with kindness are not evil, but they are ignorant. The trick is not to do as Hermione tried in the beginning, to simply emancipate all the House Elves blindly (which is, even in the absence of 'slave bonds' a recipe for a nasty humanitarian... elvanitarian? crisis), but to instead create a support system for the House Elves that in the first place protects them from cruel treatment, and creates the expectation that House Elves are beings worthy of that kind of respect. Once the society at large has grown used to the idea that House Elves are beings due the same kind of legal protections as people (rather than possessions), then the time it right to make the argument for their full emancipation. Hopefully at that point Elves will be at a point where they can accept the idea of freedom, and the consensus among witches and wizards in favourable to the idea so that society can provide the kind of support the new free elves may need.

Or maybe I'm wrong, but that's fine. I'm always willing to try and learn to be better.

*** The British Wizarding world /is/ backwards and evil. Even apparent progressives like the Weasleys are quietly intollerant of Squibs (Molly has a second cousin who's an accountant, but "we never talk about him"), and Dumbledore, another apparent progressive, indulges in some light Muggle-baiting the first time we see him interact with Harry's (admittedly awful) Muggle relatives. They discriminate against Werewolves so badly Lupin can't keep a job, an attitude which doutless causes an awful lot of the "bad" werewolves to feel like they have no choice but to seek support and protection from true monsters like Greyback. They class Centaurs - a clearly sapient species - as Beasts, a move so understandably insulting that the department the Ministry of Magic has for them has never had a Centaur reprisentative in attendance. The Goblins have rebelled against British Magical occupation so often it's one of the few consistent threads we ever hear about in History of Magic.

Sure, the situation with House Elves is clearly more complex and neuanced than any of the others, but the tone of your post seems to imply - to me, at least - that all the magicals who condon and benefit from the enslavement of House Elves shouldn't bother trying any harder or learning more because it's not worth the effort. As though " a remarkably strong set of ethical values, and a lot of introspection and uncomfortable self-examination to realise the problem" is just too much to ask of normal people. As if a strong moral core and the conviction to act on it is something reserved only for the exceptional, not something that can be achieved by anybody with a desire to improve themselves.

The solution is not to sequester all the House Elves into secret camps so that British magicals have time to get used to the idea of them being free, it's to educate the House Elves on why freedom is better than slavery, and indeed demanded by a moral system that abhors slavery. The opinions of the British magicals who own House Elves - the slave owners - is irrelavent.

Canon werewolves are nothing but a bunch of war criminals who willingly sided with Greyback and Voldemort for the promise of attacking civilians, with Lupin as sole exception. Dumbledore sent Lupin to negotiate their neutrality, they refused in favour of Voldemort/Greyback. Rather than simply leaving or going Muggle (plenty of jobs for people with no qualifications, adult learning options or even resorting to petty theft aided by magic), they chose violence and murder.

Even if magical Britain treated them like shit, that does not give you the right to attack random people. In the context of a (civil) war, that's called a war crime.

I mean, if you look at their mythological origin, they were infamous for slaughtering entire villages, the "personification" of mankind's basic fears and plundering graves (for food). So why anyone would want to turn a potentially cool antagonist into a mopey mess which needs the MCs to fight for them in a legal arena is beyond me. Fight them in the fields and on the beaches, fight over villages and to stop the wholesale slaughter, they are basically a living biological weapon.

There is noone in the wizarding world that even comes close to having that view, to dismiss Hermiones views like you've done is short-sighted given the fact that noone in the wizarding world has even begun to conceptualise why elf slavery might be bad. Hermione's activism, warts and all is the only action in the Harry Potter universe that even accepted the presupposition that Elf Slavery was bad. Even then I don't even know that Hermione actually wants to "simply emancipate all the House Elves blindly". Like, correct me if im wrong, but most of her actions in the books consisted of incrementally improving the elves lives, by improving their working conditions and giving them material support - its in the name "...Promotion of elfish welfare".

You're wrong.

Her activism consisted of knitting clothes for them and finding the kitchens. Their lives didn't improve even slightly. They didn't take the clothes nor did they want them. In fact, they stop cleaning Gryffindor tower and Dobby is the only thing that saves her from being a true pariah in the house.

I'm firmly in the camp that this is slavery. They shouldn't be bound nor should they be told to beat themselves/be beaten. I'm also in the camp that says Hermione went about this in a bad way.

**** I honestly don't understand what you're disagreeing with here? Your arguments don't seem to actually challenge the things I posted... you're just saying that what Hermione is doing is better than nothing, an assertion I do not disagree with. The House Elf mode of slavery is, by our current ethical standards, obviously immoral and needs to be changed. Hermione's actions, if nothing else, draw attention to that fact, and for that reason they are better than nothing.

I think what has happened is that you've seen me explain the moral and social problems in the arguments and actions of both sides, and equated that to me saying 'both sides are equally bad', but that is simply not the case. The Hermione style activism is short-sighted and likely doomed to failure due to its failure to consider that fact that, as you say, most people don't even consider that elvish slavery is a problem to solve. That's the first step, right there, that you need to work on. With big messy issues like this, you can't just jump from step A to step Z, it's a process, and you need to bring all sides along with you as you go, or you end up with reactionary holdouts. It would be really lovely if you could make an impassioned argument on evening TV, explaining the equality of all living beings, and that everyone who saw it would accept the flawless reasoning. But that is not the world we live in.

Hermione's heart is most assuredly in the right place, but her failing is in not recognising the human element. Freeing Elves against their will is only another kind of 'wizard superiority'. It not anywhere near as bad as systematic slavery, but it still places Elves in the 'can't be trusted to make their own decisions, so we'll do it for them' box that is ultimately one of the basic beliefs that enables slavery in the first place.

Hence why I suggested education of both Elves and Wizards, and protection of Elves from wizards mistreatment (so that they may learn without fear). Rather than taking the choice away from them and forcing them into a new life they do not want and are not prepared for, you first need to make them see what that life could be, and that they really do deserve it as thinking, feeling beings. Then you can ask them, and then they can /choose/ freedom, and be ready to face the world that that choice brings.

The ideal world, in this case, is one where Elves can choose to work (or not work) for whatever remuneration they wish. Perhaps that remuneration is money, perhaps it is money and free food and lodging, perhaps it is just food and lodging. Perhaps they require no payment at all, and simply tidy up whatever messes they happen to find on their travels. The wizards similarly, can then choose to employ them on those terms or not (and this is where education of wizards is important, as they must accept that Elf work is /worth/ paying for, every bit as much as human work). The end result may be a world where Elves truly do love working so much that they work only for food and lodging, but if they make that choice (and, importantly, have the free option to decide something different at a later date) then so be it.

**** I think your assumption that 'education' means replacing Elvish culture and history with that of humans says more about you than it does me. Education is not inherently the same as indoctrination, even if indoctrination is often disguised as education.

Education is, at its social basics, about providing people the tools with which to make decisions. They may choose to make different decisions than I might, due to different cultural references, but at least I can be sure they have considered the options. Perhaps you might argue that there is no evidence that Elves do not have an understanding of the philosophy of ethics, but I feel given what we do know of them and their situation, that that would be grasping at straws.

Ultimately, if Elves, after being given the right logical tools and ethical theories to actually analyse their own situation, decide to remain an enslaved underclass, I guess we'd have to accept it. I'd hope, however, that they'd at least choose a relationship with humans that means they do not have to suffer cruel punishments based on the whims of their 'masters'.

When Doby broke his loyalty meant he lost a great deal of his magic. Since he was only loyal to Harry and didn't want to drain Harry's magic, but still wanted some meaningful work, he wound up being paid in money at Hogwarts.

** They are magical creatures that have immense magical power and are based off of Scandinavian folklore creatures, lesser elves that coincidentally do household chores and get offended and dissolve the bond when you hand them an article of clothing.

For all we know, every single action they perform, could be giving one hell of a dopamine rush as a reward, it could even be comparable to how any addicted person goes from fix to fix doing whatever they need to for the next dose.

We have seen that Dobby is an exception and thrives as a free elf. Wheras other free elves gravitate toward magical structures, Hogwarts and the Ministry and the like, to work completely unseen so to me it seems as if they have a biological component, a biocompatible addiction to Witches and Wizards hearth and home.

Back to Dobby, it is possible that being the exception might mean that he is neurodivergent and has gotten all of the indoctrination the others have, but no hit of dopamine disproportionate enough to get him addicted beyond the joy of just being a help to his friends.

To me Hogwarts seems almost like a safe place for free elves to get their 'fix' without the risk of abuse, another free elf we've seen ended up drinking herself to almost to death on butterbeer after being freed, she turned to the nearest available substance to get her through until she could score again. Winky I believe and then she went on to Hogwarts to get better. Maybe Hogwarts being a safer alternative is analogous to it being like a clean needle centre (Like in some Northern European countries) that way the elves can get what they need safely and without the risk of bonding with a PSYCHO to get it.

Kreacher is an interesting case because he seemed to resent working for specific people, but overall he needed his access first off even if his non influenced loyalties were to his Bella and Cissy even though he saw elves decapitated when they got too old and all kinds of weird stuff but a lot of people understand what it's like to give into the pleasure of bingewatching or porn or any other wonderful feeling thing you get caught up in and it can skew your morals to a considerable degree, you find yourself surrendering to it regardless of the consequences.

Yeah if you'd like to make the allegory entirely one for one and compare non magical systematically oppressed beings that were force bred, abused, and raped by oppressors of another shade to produce more aesthetically acceptable indoor house slaves, you'd do better to compare that to the examples of what Kneazles go through every day in canon.

Kneazles are intelligent (though non human) and some could argue sentient beings that are forced to assault or be assaulted by non sentient domesticated cats simply because the government makes it illegal to 'own' a purebred Kneazle. So the licensed few enslave these 'dangerous' free thinking creatures because they have made it illegal for sympathetic Witches and Wizards to shelter them. They have made it punishable by a legal punishment to interfere in the targeted non consensual dilution of aware creatures to make them a more profitable commodity. The Ministry says that these creatures are dangerous enough to be classified alongside mountain Trolls as a XXX level creature, despite being the size of cats and supposedly only having the knack to sort out dishonesty.

Adding another layer to the horror, in the case of chattel slaves throughout history being forced to produce more slaves it was human to human at the very least and of comparable intelligence. Kneazles are without that luxury.

()()() Imagine being nudged into a room with someone and you twitch your whiskers to go on about how annoying your captor is, with her "Oohs" and "Ahhs" and chin scratches.

You expect the other being to answer back with a tail flick...with revulsion you see that the tail flicking in front of you is...fully furred. This being in front of you is an innocent. She has no sixth sense. She has no object permanence. She will never understand anything in the way you understand it, she has no real concept of time and you see her making the same mistakes over again and it will unhinge your sanity that she will never be a Kneazle no matter how much you wish she could be, no matter how you try to teach her the complexities and mysteries of your ilk, alas she was not cursed as you were, for an affinity for outing corruption among those with a voice. You hiss when you realize that this stupid, simple, thing, with her gingery coat and pretty blue eyes is in heat.

You hiss again when you finally understand that you won't ever be leaving the care of this horrid twoleg Mrs. Figg.

This torture is to be the same for the rest of your days. Ginger, Tortoishell, Tabby, a demure snowy white that reminds you of a Kneazle you loved moons ago. It was too painful to think of her now, damned for the rest of her days to birth and raise stunted kits, and love them just as you have...maybe she got out and hid among the snow drifts and got to safety or maybe the Ministry had run out of licenses for the year and sent her across the sun dappled bridge to the foot of Bast.

The Ministry only approves licenses for those that cannot comprehend the intelligence of your kind, and so they never attempt to empathize or question the status quo...

The Kneazle yowls for he cannot speak.

Elves however are powerful magical HUMANOID creatures that really seem to feed off of ,or otherwise benefit on a primal level otherwise why wouldn't we see evidence of free elf communes and self contained governments? Why would unbound elves go to Hogwarts en masse when they could just as easily fully disillusion and live freely wherever?

PLUS these creatures are the only ones qualified to speak for themselves, in canon or fanfiction. They are fully capable in canon of expression of thought and free will and can in fact speak to Wizards in order to arrange for their pacts to be dissolved as in the case with Dobby and Harry's collusion.

Unlike the Kneazles, the House elves face no danger from the government if they are freed. They can just go forth to find their happily ever after where and however unfortunately if they were born addicted to one specific action who are we to compare that to human on human regular old non magic slavery?

I know humans TODAY that experience a wonderful sense of belonging and safety and yes dopamine to the surrender of a BDSM relationship as a submissive. Cleaning can definitely be a part of such a relationship, sometimes domestic service is the whole dang relationship.

If humans can't help how they are wired, how can powerful laundry folding folk tale elves not fall prey to the same thing?

Hermione tries time and again to make the house elves of Hogwarts feel ashamed and degraded by their safe haven that they have bonded to. She even tries to trick them into freeing themselves and upon realizing her true motive refuse to touch one of the towers entirely.

To me S.P.E.W is a misguided puritanical attempt to Wizardwash the very unique house elf experience.

J.K. Rowling and many others directly comparing the House elves to enslaved human beings is in poor taste given their mythological source material. I seldom read House Elf Mammy's being wise and having all sorts of philosophical conversations about being happy to serve in the big house in works of fanfiction but I can see people going that way. I have read a number of very annoying pseudo "White savior" tropes using house elves as a stand in for the suffering of real life human beings that suffered in non magical bondage. That feels REAL GROSS I have to say especially when it's heavy handed and embellished with extra slurs and abuse to drive it home.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cz2w4r/characterisation_theory_houseelves_view/][A while back I speculated on one possibility for why house-elves enjoy slavery;]] basically, material wealth is insignificant to house-elves because their magic is powerful enough to get anything they want, therefore, their 'prestige' and 'success' are tied to their commitment to moral virtues. Willingly embracing slavery makes house-elves 'upper class', by showing their dedication to being humble and generous.

Right now, I did just consider the possibility that house-elves simply have a values system that places some ideal (glory to a deity or nation, harmony with the world, etc) above individual rights...buuut, if that were the case they'd probably be in conflict with other races whom don't share their hard-working, spartan lifestyle, not serving witches & wizards.\\
 \\
I do note that in Goblet of Fire ch.28, the house-elves literally cover up Winky when she's falling down drunk and beg not to be judged based on her, and claim that they don't have the right to be unhappy. When Hermione claims that they have the right to wages (among other things), they look at her like she's 'mad and dangerous'.\\
And while they're apparently supposed to be based on real-mythical brownies, they don't match up in one important aspect; brownies are free and will leave when offended, house-elves are slaves and can't escape abuse. Actually, with their powerful magic and being bound to servitude, house-elves are more like the genie-in-a-bottle than anything, though they're a lot happier about servitude than usual for that trope.

** I like Noodlehammers take on this issue.

House elves are not a naturally evolved species, but homonculus created for servitude that gradually gained sentience from steady exposure to magic. And as such, their instincts revolve around the purpose they were made for.

The only magic they're capable of (that we know of) is teleportation and telekinesis, which is instinctive to them. No evidence exists that they're capable of wielding wands, unlike other humanoid species like werewolves, goblins, veela, etc.

Keeping them around as servants is just as bad as keeping any other semi-sentient species as pets. Phoenixes, kneazles and owls(let's not even go into the concept of a free basilisk) come to mind. The major difference being capability of speech. And mistreating house elves is just as bad as mistreating any other animal.

** I take issue with your Confederacy parallel, not only because the contexts are entirely different but because one is an objective real life event while the HP universe is malleable and fictitious: no one worth listening to can argue against the notion that American slavery was a terrible thing and that those affected saw an objective improvement in their quality of life as a result of being freed because it's history; it's set in stone. You can't say the same for elves in the wizarding world because that's up to each fanfiction author to decide. If an author tells you (sometimes through the elves themselves) that slavery is beneficial or necessary, then, barring a rebuttal from a character within that very story, it *is*. It's their story.

*** The point is not that a fictional atrocity carries the same weight as a real one. Of course it doesn't. But the arguments used to defend them sometimes are uncomfortably similar, and I think people should be aware of that.

You could use other examples as well: "white man's burden" and "civilizing" the "savage" as a justification for imperialism and genocide, "at least they have jobs" as an excuse for sweat shops in the modern era... they're all different, but they all have something in common: the powerful and privileged claiming that subjugation is for the good of the subjugated, when it is really only for their own benefit.

And sure, you can say "its just fiction" or "you don't have to read it"- but ideas matter. They reveal what people think, and they shape how people think. Harry Potter is probably the most read literature in the world, outside of religious texts at least. It has immense influence. And the idea of happy slaves who are better off slaves is one that should be viewed very, very critically, even in a work of fantasy.

**** "When it is really only for their own benefit" not if the author tells you that it's mutually beneficial and both sides, wizard and elf, agree within the story: that's my point. You can assume whatever you want about the author and their character (not that I think you should but do as you will), what I'm saying is that the racist justifications we hear from real life bigots cannot be wholly extrapolated to fiction because in real life those justifications (white man's burden, they're happier that way, and so forth) are easily debunked, but not so in fictional stories where the author can come up with reasons that objectively justify the relationship between elves and wizards within the logic of the story they've set up.

For instance, if Dobby and Harry both tell you that the former needs to serve the latter, otherwise he'll perish, that's not racism; that's a symbiotic relationship. You can go ahead and psychoanalyze the author but from the logic of the story there's no parallel to white-on-black American racism, but pure magical biology, thus the Confederacy logic falls flat.

Dobby is cunning as hell and even if he is an exceptional example of a house elf, it would be nothing for them to trick the often idiotic wizards into releasing them. With that being the case, clearly they are getting something out of the deal that they see as valuable.

Rowling never satisfactorily defines what that is. The whole plotline is just kind of dropped.

** I haven't really seen the argument about the magical reliance yet. Maybe I just havent scrolled far enough. In canon from what I understand, house elves are bound to magical humans for their magic. It is a symbiotic relationship. House elves provide labour and servitude while magical humans provide magic to feed on. This argument has flaws as all arguments do. I am only human after all. Kreacher lived for a long time with no master present (though one could argue that he was feeding off the house magic or from Sirius' magic). Dobby and Winky both survived without a "master" for a long time (though again they were bonded to Hogwarts). It is thoroughly explained in canon and accepted as truth that house elves need magic to survive, and they must draw this magic from a being or body that they serve. We do not know the origins of house elves. They belong to a culture that we can only guess at. I have read many fics that explore the history of house elves and their relations with wizards and witches. Some claim they bound themselves to magical mankind in return for protection. Some claim that they have always existed as a subservient species. Some even claim that they are the creation of mage-kind. There are also mysteries about what giving of clothes mean and the like (a particularly brutal one was that humans would give flea infested clothing to elves and force them to wear it. Human blood was poisonous to elves, and the act of giving clothes symbolised that the "master" wished the elf dead, thereby severing the bond). There is so much that we can only assume, and so we are looking at this argument as one that we can rationalise through human experiences. I propose that mage-kind and house elf kind exist in a symbiotic relationship. It is not a perfect one, and some would argue that the mages gain more, yet arguably the elves gain the most. Mages can do chores themselves. They can enchant things etc. They do not need house elves, while elves seem to completely rely on mage-kind. This is not ideal, but it works. We have to accept that. Maybe in the future of the wizarding world, house elves will have human rights, and will be allowed to choose who they serve, how they serve, and negotiate terms. However, at the moment in time that we see the wizarding world, elves perform tasks for mage-kind in return for the right to life. I in no way condone slavery or subjugation in any way, shape or form. This argument is fiction and should stay fictional. I think a lot of analogies that have been made have a point, but we should remember that Rowling made this universe for us to play in. We can squabble about the toys she has given us, but I'm the end, they are but toys. There is no need to be aggressive, insulted or offended by these discussions. Thanks for asking the question OP, but dont let it get blown out of proportion.

**** You do see that an author could just AU them to be a magical species that require the bond and that those that mistreat them are few(and seen badly and as fools) because they can be mischievous and use malicious compliance if you rile them up.

They can also be written to be an engineered species that needs work and magic from wizards to function properly. Basically magical automatons like the Hat or to a lesser extent the mirrors that comment on how you look.

These arguments always tire me out because 1. The Author can create any excuse he wants to make it reasonable and 2. JKR didn't think too much on this, so we have little stuff to go on canon, we know most elves got mad at Hermione, that they are non-human(and so probably think differently) and like to work, IIRC in Pottermore, it's said Hogwart's elves were bought by Helga who freed them and they chose to stay and work for Hogwarts.

We don't know why they chose to stay, we know they have too, but we don't even know how one goes about acquiring a house-elf or bonding with them.

Hermione just wanted to solve the problem with almost no understanding of what was happening or how these people lived, similar to Daenerys who despite doing the right thing and freeing them, didn't think on how they would live without their livelihoods and society.

What do you want people to do? Write a harrowing tale about Hermione freeing them and then realizing they are now her responsibility or that in a rather hilarious turn of events they (perhaps mischievously) chose to bond with her? What about Hogwarts? Who's going to prepare food for hundreds of students or clean the school, what about when dozens of elves start going into depression? What's a single 14-year-old girl to do?

While Rowling isn't always very clear in her messaging, itss clearly not meant to be okay or necessary in the books: Dobby is very much in it against his will (and he's fine once freed, disproving the idea of House Elves magically requiring such a bond), and even the elves who are loyal, like Kreacher and Winky, are psychologically damaged and frequently mistreated.

Of course, there's no denying Hermione's approach was amateurish and ill-thought-out. She should have actually talked to some elves about what they wanted and needed before trying to act, and she should have realized that any action would be something that would likely take years or decades to accomplish, not just knitting a few hats and leaving them hidden in the common room. Her heart's in the right place, of course, but its an effort from someone with very little experience or understanding of what she's undertaking.

I would have liked to see Dobby organize other elves into seeking their freedom, as an ongoing subplot in the series, perhaps with Hermione's help. And maybe a mention at the end of ending House Elf slavery in honor of the bravery of the elves at the Battle of Hogwarts (in the real world, what won many people over on the issue of abolishing slavery in the US was the heroism of black soldiers during the Civil War).

That's a very generalized statement from an issue that is still alive today, but it's mostly agreed that slavery was abolished because the North won and /they/ were already unwilling to let slavery continue for various reasons before the war, the South was very much willing even years after they rightly got their asses kicked(heck some crazy people defend it to this day).

Of course, those battalions helped, heck even in WW1 and WW2 when they still felt the need of creating specific battalions for POC for some reason, those groups regularly proved themselves, I will always like the Red Tails among them.

However, for many being against slavery doesn't mean they stop being racists, just see the Civil Rights moment, or the shameful display by US troops in the UK during WW2, who treated their black soldiers so badly many of them chose to stay there(there were pubs who forbid the entry of white US soldiers when given the 'us or them' ultimatum, gotta love the British).

I like when this trope is explored more openly with blood purity, it shows how good we are at categorizing ourselves or using group mentality for the stupidest reasons.

I don't think you can responsibly include slavery in your setting and not at least try to address the implications of that.

And, yeah, there's Hermione bashing, which also sucks.

As to the subject of black soldiers and slavery, I never claimed that the role of black soldiers was the only factor in helping to end slavery, and I certainly never claimed that racism ended with slavery. And I expect you'd see racism continue in the Wizarding World against elves even if they were free, with House Elves struggling to find good jobs or acquire the same legal rights as witches and wizards, even if they desired them. I could even see the loyalty of some elves to their former masters (like Winky) being an excuse for such discrimination, ie:

"We can't give elves the vote! They'd just vote how their masters told them to vote, so we'd basically be giving anyone who employed an elf two votes."

Or,

"We can't let elves testify against their masters in court! Their testimony would obviously be biased."

  So can this fandom just stop with the slavery fan fic?
#+end_quote

No. Because as usual, you lack two important definitions: What "slavery" is, and (depending on that) what a "human-like being" is. To address the latter first: You can't enslave a dog. You can enslave a human. Your job, then, is to show that a "House Elf" is positioned on that scale enough towards the human side of it, so that "enslaving" even works as a concept. Only using Canon, this is flatly impossible; we have no inside account on House Elves, and in a world where /paintings/ at first glace show sentience, you can't rely on first impressions. Just because House-Elves /appear/ human-like, doesn't mean they necessarily /are/.

That this is a relevant topic in fictional Wizarding Britain you see when Fantastic Beasts (the book) offers a short historical overview over the highly problematic attempts to define what is a beast and what is a being. It's easy if there is only one sentient race. It's not if there are many different ones.

The implications of this regarding the House Elf problem, of course, are that while you absolutely can apply general standards on one and the same race (just because people are black, they are still human), you can't on different races, not a priori. Your strongest argument against slavery -- the "imagine yourself in their position" -- therefore falls flat. I /can't/ imagine myself in their position, because I don't know what being a House Elf is like. I do know what being a human is like.

What "slavery" is is a bit more straight-forward. I'm very much in favour of wording it such that de-facto slavery is included, meaning, having a choice between starving and slave-like working conditions is not a choice at all, see e.g. domestic help in Britain until WWII. But even so, it will always be worded in a way that you literally can't enslave the willing, and the "Stockholm-Syndrome"-lines of arguing have never been anything more than very tenuous, because no one can prove that either way. You can always go full True Scotsman on it, in both directions ("Dobby is not representative of /true/ House Elves", "Winky is not representative ...").

To summarise: In order to talk about slavery, you need to have a group that (1) factually can be enslaved, (2) factually is enslaved. Both is hard -- I would say, impossible -- to show only based on Canon facts, which makes FF explorations a fair game.

.

Of course, all this is likely unconvincing to you, because your implicit premise is that House Elves /are/ enslaved; you start with your mind made up. But if you are asking /why/ this is such a topic in FF, then the above is the answer.

As an aside, my personal view is that the situation would be much improved if instead of "freeing" House Elves, we talked about ways to protect them and improve their living conditions. Which, funnily enough, is the name of Hermione's SPEW -- Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare. She ought to consider her own group name and work towards that, because /whatever/ House Elves are, treating them like Malfoy treats Dobby is not acceptable, and as opposed to notions about slavery, this is universal.

*** See, this is exactly what I mean: people going to great contortions to justify how House Elf slavery is okay, or not even really slavery, even when its in direct contradiction of canon.

House elves in the books are clearly sentient. They are clearly capable, at least potentially/in theory, of desiring freedom, and of acting in various ways and to various degrees in opposition to their masters. They are capable of expressing that wish. They are nonetheless treated as property. That is slavery in any meaningful sense, regardless of what you call it. And to borrow a line from Asimov (which he used in the context of artificial intelligence): "There is no right to deny freedom to any object with a mind advanced enough to grasp the concept and desire the state."

House elves are clearly meant to be intelligent, self-aware beings in canon, with human-like capacities for thought and self-expression. That is not me being biased, that's just how they're written- notwithstanding your attempt to poison the well by preemptively declaring that any disagreement on my part is because I am just narrow-minded and biased.

Winky I already addressed, but as to whether she or Dobby represents a "typical" house elf, I don't think either of them do. What I do think is that we see three house elf characters who receive any substantial characterization, and that they express a range of feelings on the issue- which goes against the idea that House Elves are innately or overwhelmingly happy or better off as slaves. That very diversity of views among elves is strong evidence that they are thinking, self-aware beings with a capacity for complex thought, and not slaves by nature or some universal magical compulsion.

Now, you could write an alternate universe fic in which elves are non-sapient and/or must be owned by a witch or wizard for some magical reason. The question is, why would you want to do that? I don't generally sit down and start writing thinking "How can I justify my protagonists owning other beings?"

**** I know this is what you meant. Why do you think I wrote it? You aren't the first, nor will you be the last, to humanise House Elves and come to the conclusion that they are enslaved. What I /did/ hope was to present the argument in a way that makes it possible for you see the problems your line of thought creates, seeing that you expressed a desire to understand why it is such an issue in FF. Apparently, that didn't work out -- at the latest when your last point (regarding FF) /still/ is about (human-like) "beings" when that was the very bone of contention.

I don't have much to add what I didn't already write; especially as you didn't address the formal points. You /can't/ just handwave that. If "slavery" is to have any meaning at all, there has to be a clearly defined idea of what it is and what it isn't. "I know it when I see it" most definitely isn't enough, not for something as consequential as this, and especially not when what you "see" is unclear and incomplete.

What you are calling "great contortions" is nothing but the most simple approach regarding this issue: Start with a definition, see whether what we see fits that definition, and come to a conclusion (or not, seeing as we see too little of House Elves). I didn't even say House Elves /weren't/ slaves -- just that it's impossible to say! I honestly cannot see how, if you take a critical look at the issue, the result can be anything else than that. What *you* (and a lot of other people) are doing, on the other hand, appears to me as starting with the idea that House Elves are slaves, and then either ignoring or retrofitting evidence and/or definitions such that the result fits the premise you started with.

Which, I mean, fair enough, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but the really funny thing here is that this is precisely what Hermione did, and the point the books made that maybe this /wasn't/ the best approach, and sentiment no substitute for thinking and empirical research.

** Ok so you might think this is horrible of me, but I've always sort of imagined elves to have instincts similar to dogs. I mean, they're not human, so it totally makes sense if they have different brain wiring. I'm not saying they're less intelligent than humans. It's just that their brains are wired differently.

In the way dogs are hardwired to find a leader of the pack and live to please them and love them by default, perhaps that's how elves developed in relation to wizards? Humans have lived alongside dogs for millennia, and they're not just companions. They're sheep herds and sleigh pullers and hunting aids etc etc, so I imagine elves to be the same way.

Of course, the whole self punishing is messed up, but dogs also know when they've done something wrong, and I've seen them feel badly about it. The self punishment in elves takes this to another level of course, but you must remember that they don't stay for fear of punishment.

Anyway, this is one element in the story I wish Rowling just cut out or found a different way to portray, but you can't have everything.

and frankly of the three houseelves we know Dobby is unhinged even by house elf standards and kreacher is clearly meant to depict a tainted brownie which would be a "boggart" except rowling gave that to another creature which in turn should have been a boogeyman.

It is already established Fanon trope, similar to Ancient and Most Noble Houses X10 of House Potter, so it is quite hard to distance yourself from the trope if your story is focusing around certain things, like Hogwarts, Magical creatures, war, interspecies magic, etc... Plus, you can always press the "back" button and not read the fic...

** You know, I really enjoyed reading all these responses in this discussion. This brought up a bunch of interesting points I never thought of. Every time I read a "Hermione, dont free the elves its bad for them ect." Fic and then proceed to explain why its bad over and over again and Hermione never learns bc she doesnt listen, I just get annoyed. Oh no, not again, mediocrely explaining an entire race without even having dissected their brains to see it was actually the same size as humans all along.

We can see, actively, that Wizards are racist against all creatures besides themselves by the xenophobic fountain and underlying desires of regular people, so whats to say since, they are wrong about centaurs and goblins, they couldnt be wrong about house elves? I think you are right that house elves are exactly like slaves, but maybe there was actually horrible history between elves and wizards.

Like for example: an evil wizard realizes a brownie is cleaning his home, so instead of letting it, he is selfish and wants to keep the brownie forever.

The wizard using his magical skills and prowress from his many studies binds the brownie and forces it to sign away its life to servitude. But the wizard thinks, it must also be dependent upon me lest it betray me. The brownie still enjoys cleaning and cooking because thats inherent to its nature, but the loyalty was created because without a master it felt its mind slipping, and madness rising, uncontrollable magic, and deep unquenchable dispair.

The wizard ordered the brownie to enslave all its brownie friends, family, and so on, until the entire race, not that many at all, were under the contract of an odious wizard. Eventually, the wizard died without heirs, and the brownies became disfigured and mad without their master, losing their intelligent speech first, than their capabilities of thought more than a third grader, cunning, and so on.

When brownies came in contact with witches and wizards again after years of fruitless reproduction, the society no longer recognized brownies as brownies and saw instead a new creature offering servitude with a childish name. The confused wizards accepted this, and gave them a name "house elves" and never wondered where the brownies went.

As house elves continued to reproduce, history was lost. Home to the brownies was abandoned. Everything a brownie once was had been turned to madness. Perhaps the reason they are freed by clothes is because when a brownie realizes that a human no longer needs their services is when they go to bed at night, instead of piling their clothes neatly in a washing bin, they threw it on the ground expecting the unusual magical force to clean it up.

Like a "you are now just taking advantage of my kindness". And clothes are a signifier to cut ties. Or maybe a fail safe by the wizard? Who knows? Their history is long gone.

Edit: and to add to that, a whole culture of overworking themselves was probably created within the elvish community. So they are probably like Japanese people, always looking up to pushing themselves to exhaustion and praising it.

** In fiction, the most common idea used is that house elves need a wizards or magical entity's (i.e. Hogwarts) bond to survive as they basically 'feed off their magic'. If wizards are their only choice of that then I would call this a fair trade. House elves get the magic they need to not only survive but do well and wizards get help from them. Of course, ppl like the Malfoys are excepted from this. P.S. I don't want to write wizards and witches every time so I used it unisexually this time..

** The question is not so much why house elves are the way they are, but why JK Rowling would choose to write such a species. I think it's an example of of her politics seeping into her work: not that she likes slavery, but that she views different races as different, some as greater and some as less, and so, with that worldview, she writes a world with several species where some are greater and some are less.

I'd like more fanfic where they properly free all the house elves; perhaps one where the other wizards claim the elves need the magic to survive, but that ends up being a lie. It'd be a nice twist of the trope.
