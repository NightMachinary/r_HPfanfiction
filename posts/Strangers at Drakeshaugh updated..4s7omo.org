Just a heads up.


** Chapter felt /really/ short. Uncomfortably so, even.

*** I think that comes with that fic. It is one of those were you really need to read everything at once as it does not really have a plot. The chapters can't show much because there is no story arc to drive.

***** Don't understand me wrong. I mean it has no plot that is your typical big and consuming plot. It is a personal story, just this family that comes into a village and tells this story in a beautiful way.

*** Really? I didn't get that feeling-of course I'd love it if it were longer though! It looks to be about the same length as previous chapters
