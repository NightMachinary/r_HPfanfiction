Every time I open a new Harry Potter Fanfiction lately it seems it always starts before or on Halloween night with James and Lily protecting Harry in their last moments. But as the story goes on or as this action is happening there is a clear that the entire time only one thing is happening. We as the audience is required to BASK IN THE GLORY OF LILY POTTER! FOR SHE IS LIMITLESS PERFECTION!

Either she always wants to leave England, but is also the bravest most selfless person who wants to stay and defend all the helpless people left behind. She is smarter and more skilled than all the Marauders, the entire Order and both Dumbledore and Voldemort combined... But she always dies because she's A FUCKING SAINT WHO FORESAW HER OWN DEATH AND SACRIFICED HERSELF FOR ALL MANKIND!

Oh and James is either the dumbest, most spoiled, rapist asshole, who may or may not be Harry's birth father and could possibly either be getting his family fortune stolen from him or giving it to the symbol of his wife's infidelity. But one thing is clear EVERYTHING, is James's fault, he wanted to stay a listen to Dumbledore, he's a Coward for wanting to leave England and leave the poor muggleborn's behind, he forced them to switch to Peter, he took no for a answer when they asked Dumbledore to be their secret keeper, he asked Dumbledore to be their secret keeper (doesn't he know he's a weak and old white man? They're inherently evil and manipulative).

But Lily poor perfect Lily is so perfect and beautiful she can see through Dumbledore's lies and weakness but James! That brute and idiot forces them to work with Dumbledore! And poor perfect Lily just can't ever ever EVER Make him see the light is just as bad as the Dark and the only was is her way the way of the Mary Sue- I mean the Grey!-

Doesn't anyone see Anything wrong with this? Why is this blindly "So Awesome Write More" 'd by people WHO I HAVE SEEN BITCH ABOUT A LOT LESS??? If Lily is so smart and great why would she marry a FUCKING IDIOT!!? I get it Alan Rickman was a great actor with a great voice (Had a fucking doorknob for a nose) that people loved but why choose James over "amazing Severus"? Do you not think about it or was it "Love Potions"? Was it love potions that had Lily checking James out 2 years before hand while he sat by the lake? Was it his looks that made him a Animagus as a 15 year old? Was it his family name that made him a great Transfiguration student?

BUT SNAPE SAID! FUCK SEVERUS SNAPE WITH A SPIKED MACE! THE FUCKING CHARACTER IS A RACIST FUCK WHO DOESN'T REPENT HIS BELIEFS OR HIS ACTIONS HE JUST FEELS GUILTY BECAUSE HIS DESIRED TOY GOT RUN OVER BY HIS DEATH MACHINE! HE DOESN'T CHANGE! He still shits on muggleborns, he hates children for their parents rolls in the previous war, he is a Bully, bullying which he was so effect by as a child he happily does so as a Adult and assist children under his care in undertaking!

So James is unworthy of Lily.. But then Harry won't be "Harry Potter" so James has to be there to be a idiot and ruin everything and be used. Because that makes sense that PERFECT LILY ALLOWS HER HUSBAND TO KEEP ON!

I swear to God if I have to read another FUCKING Spot of Lily complaining that she wanted to leave England or that James would be leaving everyone to die of he did I WILL FIND YOU AND SMACK THE EVER LOVING PISS OUT OF YOU! BE FUCKING CONSISTENT WITH YOUR CHARACTERIZATION! FUCK!!

** It's because James gets character development- he gets his share of virtues and flaws, and is fleshed out enough as a character that even in death he can stand alone as James Potter.

Now contrast Lily Potter- she gets virtues but no flaws, and is defined by her relationships with Harry, James, and Snape. James is a character, Lily is a plot device.

So she gets used like one- flawless, two dimensional, and only exists to move the plot along

*** That doesn't happen until they get older that he starts associating with, you know, the kids he inevitably spends the most time with due to them sleeping in the same rooms and sharing the same den with.

I get what you're trying to do, but this isn't like a punch-a-Nazi scenario. They are all /kids/ and James and the Marauders were /cruel/ kids. You're not supposed to be siding with them just because of how their adult selves ended up. Also, what political climate did y'all care about at 15? Most 15 year olds I know have a very limited scope of politics if they care at all, and most...don't. Plus, they've bullied Snape since they met when they were 11, it wasn't just that instance.

I hope you wouldn't blame my headscarfed friend who got taunted in the playground after 9/11 because of "the political climate."

It's like siding with the bully because he eventually became a cop and the bullied became criminals (one of which is reformed and working with the FBI to take down a drug ring), which a lot of bullies in my hometown actually did.

*** I like how James outright admits he bullies Snape "because he exists", Lupin and Sirius admit they were specifically targeting him and bullying him because they just didn't like him, and yet their fans bend over backwards to explain how the Marauders were /actually/ acting for righteous reasons, and there are situations where forcibly removing someone's underwear is acceptable (something James clearly does out of anger at being rejected by Lily).

And yes, /they/ were attacking him, as seen in SWM, and as admitted by Lupin and Sirius themselves:

#+begin_quote
  But Lupin shook his head. “Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?”

  “Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes... that was something...”
#+end_quote

If you're going to equate race to blood, here's your context: James and Sirius are two blindingly white, filthy rich kids, who are backed by the administration, and who specifically target and beat up a severely impoverished half-black kid, while the black girl they /claim/ to defend is calling them out on their behaviour and telling them to stop. At which point whitey James uses the opportunity to guilt her into dating him, showing exactly how much he cares about her feelings and opinions. Interestingly enough, James doesn't attack the white, rich bigots Snape associates with, which is supposedly the reason for his hatred of Snape.

#+begin_quote
  I don't advocate bullying but given the ongoing war, political climate and Snape's shitty beliefs, can you really blame the Marauders?
#+end_quote

It definitely sounds like you think bullying is understandable in certain situations. You're /supposed/ to feel the same visceral disgust Harry feels, when reading that scene. Not to identify with the bullies and justify their actions. Lily, the person who has the biggest reason to loathe Snape's friends, still calls James out on his terrible behaviour.

The fact that the victim fights back doesn't stop it from being a case of bullying.

#+end_quote

Yeah, James's reaction was nonchalant because he wasn't badly hurt. Are you seriously trying to claim Snape was trying to kill James in front of the whole school?Having your underwear removed in front an entire audience is sexual assault. If Snape were a woman, I bet you wouldn't be trying to downplay this point. Or maybe you would, since you excuse bullying, I don't know.

#+begin_quote
  And /they/ were attacking him? Please. The moment the word "Snivellus" got out of James' mouth, Snape already has his wand out.
#+end_quote

Yes, which shows Snape was used to being attacked. Something that Lupin, Sirius, and James all admit to doing.

#+begin_quote
  “This'll liven you up, Padfoot,” said James quietly. “Look who it is...”

  Sirius's head turned. He became very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit.

  “Excellent,” he said softly. “Snivellus.”
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  James didn't dangle him off the ground because he was rejected by Lily, he dangled him off the ground because Snape almost lopped his head off.
#+end_quote

No, he dangled him *again* and removed his underwear ("pants" in British English) because he was rejected:

#+begin_quote
  “What is it with her?” said James, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him.

  “Reading between the lines, I'd say she thinks you're a bit conceited, mate,” said Sirius.

  “Right,” said James, who looked furious now, “right---”

  There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside-down in the air.

  “Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants?”
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  James went out of his way to improve as a person and fight a war for her. Few people can claim the same.
#+end_quote

It's interesting you call it "her war". So you don't think James joined the Order because he believed in the cause, he did it because he wanted to get laid?

You know who did fight for Lily's ideals, long after she was gone, without the promise of sex?

And how did James go out of his way to improve as a person? The only information we have of him, post-Hogwarts, is of him antagonising Vernon and further ruining Lily's relationship with Petunia.

#+begin_quote
  He did. He even went out of his way to join a group to fight the said bigots. Why do you think he's dead lol?
#+end_quote

And yet, at school, why was he repeatedly targeting one of the least powerful, least important Slytherins?

#+begin_quote
  And let's not go with the "James didn't like Snape because he's poor, unloved, abused and unwanted." narrative because that's total BS. Have you seen the guy's friends?
#+end_quote

Oh no, I don't think James disliked him because of that. He chose him as an easy target because of that. And yes, there's definitely a discussion to be had about James surrounding himself with people who are dependent on him and idolise him. Lupin is the only one who shows his displeasure at James's behaviour and, in turn... James suspects him of being a traitor.

#+begin_quote
  The only reason James fuck with Snape is because Snape's a piece of shit. End of story.
#+end_quote

That's... completely contradicting canon. Saying "end of story" doesn't suddenly make you right. The fact that James says he'll stop bullying Snape if Lily goes out with him makes it clear he's partially motivated by jealousy.

  /One essential prerequisite is the perception (by the bully or by others) of an/ */imbalance/* /of physical or/ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political][/social/]]) /power/.
#+end_quote

Yes. Exactly. Which is why I pointed out that a) the Marauders attacked Snape 2-on-1 or even 4-on-1, and b) Snape is an extremely poor, half-blood Slytherin. He's at the bottom of the social totem pole both in his own house, and outside of it, since other students hate Slytherins. Meanwhile, his bullies are filthy rich, pure-blood, popular Gryffindors, who have the support of the Headmaster and whose best friend is the Prefect. James and Sirius are perfectly aware that they can get away with anything, since the werewolf "prank" takes place before SWM. Also, James has the Marauder's Map - the perfect tool to follow and ambush someone.

Lupin says that after Harry basically catches them lying about James stopping his bullying ways, and he's trying to convince Harry that James wasn't a bad person. Context matters. But nobody ever mentions Snape attacking James, or attacking anyone else - not Sirius, not Hagrid, and not any of the teachers who also taught Snape. The most telling is that Sirius, who doesn't miss an opportunity to shit on Snape, never says Snape was the one attacking them, and never says that Snape actually did anything wrong, to anyone. Same with Lily - according to her, the worst he does is use the word "mudblood".

#+begin_quote
  His blood /splattered/ on the grass and you think /that/ doesn't hurt? lmao get a load of this guy.

  [...] Well, yeah obviously. Why do you think he used a very lethal curse aimed right at James' face? Tickle him? lmao
#+end_quote

Sure, it hurts. It's clearly not a serious wound, though, since James can carry on bullying Snape just fine, instead of feeling the need to take a break or visit the infirmary, and nobody seems worried about his well-being.

And clearly, the curse wasn't lethal, and Snape had control over it. Saying that Snape was trying /to murder someone in front of the whole school/ is seriously embarrassing and a desperate reach.

I will say, though, between you assuming I'm a guy, and that other user assuming I've pantsed people, because "everyone does it", I'm getting a pretty clear image of the average James stan.

#+begin_quote
  Not once did Snape's underwear got pulled down in that scene lmao. What are you on about? The memory ends there so you saying they assaulted him sexually holds as much weight as me saying James let Snape run away with his tails between his legs.
#+end_quote

Setting aside the fact that the way JKR forcibly ends the scene is the literary equivalent of a "fade to black for PG purposes", there is nothing to suggest that James suddenly stopped. There's a reason JKR mentions "he looked furious now". At most, you can argue a teacher magically popped up, but James's intention remains, and it's still sexual assault - he immobilised and exposed someone in front of an entire audience to humiliate the victim, out of anger at being rejected by a girl.

#+begin_quote
  No, it doesn't. That is literally a nod to the fact that Sirius is a /dog/ animagus. Rowling is literally doing the cheeky *nudge, nudge* *wink, wink* thing and all you got from that is "Snape's a prey" lol. It's no different from fanfic authors writing "Sirius' barking laughter" or "Dogfather". Let's be real.
#+end_quote

Except JKR can actually write, and her story has themes and underlying messages. So while it's an allusion to Sirius being an animagus, it's also clear she's intentionally framing the whole scene a certain way, with Snape being the victim. Because even bullies might have been victims, which led to them becoming bullies in the first place, and even unpleasant people don't deserve to be bullied etc. etc. It's such a painfully obvious message, since it's a children's book. Why are adults missing the point so hard?

#+begin_quote
  Noticed who escalated the whole thing?

Again, it's obvious that Snape's reaction is that of someone used to being attacked. It's in the text!

#+begin_quote
  Snape reacted so fast it was *as though he had been expecting an attack*: dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes and *his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, “Expelliarmus!*”
#+end_quote

James's wand was already out. I guess Sirius and James were so pleased to see Snape because they wanted to have a nice cuppa with him, not because they were planning on doing a little bullying.

#+begin_quote
  Bruh, I did not say "her war". Don't put your words in me mouth.
#+end_quote

Let's see, quote from you:

#+begin_quote
  James went out of his way to improve as a person and *fight a war for her*.
#+end_quote

You literally said the reason he fought in the war was for her, not because he believed in the cause. Which I don't actually agree with, it's clear James grew up in a family that strongly favoured the Order.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Snape gave shit all to Lily's ideals. It's all about getting back at Voldemort and atoning for getting her killed. You can tell by the fact that he doesn't give a shit about Harry when all's said and done unless Dumbledore tells him otherwise.
#+end_quote

You missed the point. No, Snape's initial goal is to protect Harry; over time he starts believing in the "Greater Good", saves as many lives as he can (including Lupin's), and accepts Harry's death because he think it's necessary for said "Greater Good". The fact that he accepts the failure of his initial goal, which drove him for a large part of his life, because it's needed to defeat ~Evil, is the completion of his character arc. The Cursed Child further expands on this.

#+begin_quote
  Lily marrying him not clue enough for ya? Or that anyone has nothing but good things to say about James?
#+end_quote

Actually, the premise of this post is that Lily was trash, something a lot of James stans seem to believe.

I do think JKR meant to have James become a better person than he was, but that does't mean he was a Good person. And the problem is, in canon there are only scenes of him being a terrible person, while there are scenes of Lily being a very moral person, up to and including her trying to stop James from bullying Snape, because it's the right thing to do, regardless of Snape's associations.

Which answers OPs post: most fics portray Lily as a great person, and James as a shitty one, because that's how canon portrays them. JKR did a lot of "tell, don't show" with James's redemption. Literally - she has James's best friends tell Harry "but he got better, ok?".

#+begin_quote
  Sirius might've distrusted Remus, but not James.
#+end_quote

Except James agreed with the plan, so clearly he didn't completely trust Lupin, either. Lupin says that to Harry to get him to act a certain way; he's already chastised him earlier for not killing Stan Shunpike, then he tries to make him less trusting by pointing out that James was betrayed by Pettigrew, a close friend.

#+begin_quote
  Envy, you mean.
#+end_quote

No, I don't. It is interesting that you chose that word, though - you're inadvertently confirming that James viewed Lily as a prize or possession that Snape already "had".

#+begin_quote
  James can still hate Snape for being an annoying, racist piece of shit and still wonder why Lily hangs around him.
#+end_quote

Oh sure, but that doesn't make it OK that he bullies Snape. He could have just gone to Dumbledore, who *should* be preventing the grooming of students for the Death Eaters. And again, James actually says why he targets Snape: "Snape exists". Why wouldn't he just say it's because he's ~eviiil? Also, you keep ignoring that it's canon he bullied other kids too. What's the excuse there?

Harry, who actually has a reason to hate Snape, and Lily, who actually has reason to fear Snape's associates, are both thoroughly disgusted with the scene in SWM, to the point that Lily says James is "just as bad" as Snape (/after/ Snape has called her a mudblood), and Harry thinks his own father had to force his mother into marriage.

That should tell you the normal reaction to what happens in SWM. So why are you identifying with the clear bully, and trying to whitewash his actions??? I haven't seen this sort of fanatical reaching done in Draco's name, for example, and he rarely initiated something physical with the Trio.

****** Snape deserves it. And I'm a person that got bullied for 4+ years and tried to commit suicide multiple times die to the fact I couldnt handle it.

Snape does not act like a victim, and if you look more closely the first time James meets Lily and Snape James says he wants to be in Gryffindor. Snape scoffs and said only idiots go there, he would rather gi Slytherin.

This is the first time they met. On the train, Snape is shown as an antagonist from the get go.

And jealousy??? James wasnt jelous of Snape, Snaoe and Lily never went out. He felt sorry each time Lily felt the need to explain being friends with Snape which led to James being sad. He LOVED Lily, and when you love someone, watching them make excuses for something wrong hurts. So I wouldnt say jealousy as a reason.

James suspected Remus being a traitor during the war as he was gone for long extended periods of time and came back unexpectedly, raising suspicion. Also he was a minority as a werewolf it wouldnt be a reach to think he might have switched sides considering Ministry's laws against them. James trusted all the Maurarders with his life.

Snape wasnt the least powerful Slyhterin, of he was then he wouldnt have made the Half-Blood Prince book thingy with all the dark spells, and spell crafting requires power does it not??? You have to be smart and powerful enough to cast that spell, and also Snape is an amazing duelist so he isnt weak at all.

James didnt ruin shit between Petunia and Lily. Petunia treated Harry like shit not beciase of James but beciase Lily was the special one and died for it, and she got dumped with Harry? You are deluded if you think otherwise when its cannon that Snape deteriorated Liky and Petunias relationship by sneaking into her room and getting the letter Dumbledore sent. Also Petunia blames Snape for getting her involved with Magic, not James.

Your telling me you never pantsed someone?? I mean you sound like your from Britain like I, so if you are then you should know that panting is when you pull someones trousers down to show their underwear. So james doing it isnt that deep, when there is much worse. And when did James get rejected IN THAT SCENE???

James gave his life for that war, he fought Voldemort thrice. So my question is who in the right mind would risk there lives multiple times for a shag? If he is a rich white boy why doesn't he run, beciase he wants a "ShAg" Do you know how deluded you sound right now?? James Potter disliked Snape beciase Snape used mudblood a lot, and then he said it to his best friend Lily who James liked a lot. And as they were in puberty well... he got angry and did shit, but that doesn't mean Snape was innocent.

All In all you are a deluded Snape stan, you think he is innocent and that James Potter is an antagonist when in reality what happened between them wasnt that deep compared to real bullying, something you clearly have little to no experience in. James isnt the bad guy, not the good guy. But his hands are certainly cleaner than Snapes who becomes a terrorist as he was bullied.

You might as well use the same excuse for a school shooter, which I'm afraid is what Snapes character boils down too. His words being the bullets, Snape is the person to blame. Most of the time he went out of the way to antagonize James.

And then James saved Snapes life, if he bullied him like you say then why would a bully save the person they bully? And dint say "To BuLlY HiM SoMe MoRE" or "Loyalty OvER ReMuS" beciase then you are contradicting yourself as you said earlier James doesn't care for Remus as he believed he was a traitor.

Snape deserves it. End of.

  She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled.

  “You'd better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little.

  “Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?” *[these are the exact words Draco uses in PS regarding Hufflepuff]* James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.

  “My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said.

You understand this is pure fanon, right? He promises to leave Snape alone, if Lily goes out with him. Apparently he wouldn't care anymore about Lily having to ~make excuses for Snape, or about him being ~evil, as long as James got to have Lily.

Nobody said anything about his ~power. He was an extremely impoverished half-blood. His social influence and relevance were minimal, and he had no relatives among the DEs. If James was so bothered by Voldemort's followers, he could have attacked any of the scions of pure-blood families, whose parents were in Voldemort's inner circle. And yet he doesn't, he's obsessed with Snape.

#+begin_quote
  James didnt ruin shit between Petunia and Lily.

Yes, he did. When James and Lily first met Vernon, James thought Vernon was ridiculous and didn't hide it. He also bragged about his inherited wealth. This lead to Petunia cutting contact with Lily.

No, because I'm not a bully. I understand you are one, though? And James didn't pull down Snape's trousers. Snape wasn't wearing trousers underneath his robes, so his pants (which you'd know means underwear, if you were actually British, as you claim) were exposed throughout that scene. At the end, James says he'll take them off. The idea that James could have done "much worse" (like what, rape him?) doesn't excuse his behaviour.

#+begin_quote
  “Leave him alone,” Lily repeated. She was looking at James with every sign of great dislike. “What's he done to you?”

  “Well,” said James, appearing to deliberate the point, “*it's more the fact that he exists*, if you know what I mean...”
#+end_quote

Regarding your tirade on Snape's innocence - it's irrelevant to the discussion at hand. James was a nasty bully, who attacked Snape and *anyone else who annoyed him*, "because he could" and "for the fun of it". This is said by both Lily and Lupin.

#+begin_quote
  And then James saved Snapes life, if he bullied him like you say then why would a bully save the person they bully?
#+end_quote

Because, if he hadn't, Sirius would have probably gone to Azkaban and Lupin would have been put down. And no, I didn't say he thought Lupin was the traitor *4 years before the whole traitor thing happened*. In fact, it's clear that the werewolf "prank" marks the moment when Lupin started drifting apart from James and Sirius - see his reactions during SWM (which takes place *after the prank*), and the fact that he believes Sirius to be a murderer.

James is Draco's counterpart - a spoiled bully. Then he supposedly changes, becomes a better person etc. But canonically, he was a bully, and a nasty one at that. And the only scenes actually shown in the books are from when he was clearly a bully. So why are you bending over backwards to minimise his actions?

Lmao calling me a bully, I got stabbed by one, and I have a scar and I'm the bully??? But you dont know that so let me break it down to you.

I got bullied for all of my secondary school life it got so bad I filmed myself jumping down from my window and breaking my arm, on purpose. I got so angry at my school I did terrible shit, a bit like Snape who IS my favourite character in all of HP. Becias either understand the pain he comes from, but that doesn't make him an innocent victim.

Eventually I realised what the fuck I was doing and stopped all together, leading to another failed suicide attempt. I never had anyone to speak to, eventually it became so bad in school that a bully of mine brought a ficking knife in and stabbed me right one my side. I didnt return to normal life for months, and this happened this JUNE.

And there is no indication that James ever raped him, and James saying something doesn't mean he will do it. I could say many things and not follow through on it.

And Remus not believing Sirius because of the prank Mae's no sense, why would they still be friends later on?? And there is no correlation between them, as there were no WITNESSES to back Sirius up, seeing as Pettigrew wasnt going to reveal the truth. What would you do?

A person can be both a victim of bullying, and a bully themselves. Usually one is the consequence of the other. That's the whole point of SWM, to show that Snape, whom Harry had always seen only as a bully, had been a victim too.

#+end_quote

Who said James raped him? You said James *could* have done worse than just removing his underwear, which does not excuse his behaviour. Unless you think thieves should not be punished, because at least they didn't kill someone!

The fact that JKR mentions James "looked furious now", right before saying he'll take Snape's underwear off, and the fact that she cuts the scene off, is the children's book equivalent of a fade-to-black. The implication is clear.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, they continued being friends, but Lupin's discomfort is clear throughout SWM, including at the fact that Sirius treats Lupin's transformation as a source of fun. The fact that Sirius almost had werewolf!Lupin kill Snape likely sowed the seeds of doubt regarding Sirius's capacity to betray his friends.

And Lupin could have doubted the whole story, and tried to get more information. But until he saw Pettigrew on the Map, he was convinced that Sirius had betrayed the Potters to Voldemort and had killed several people, including Pettigrew.

But how is that relevant to James being a bully who shows no character growth? My point was that James saved Snape solely because he didn't want Sirius and Lupin to get into trouble.

#+begin_quote

James was a bully to an extreme extent, much worse than anything we see from Draco prior to HBP (where his actions are part of something much larger and darker, and not bullying). He also bullied other people than Snape - "anyone who annoyed him", "because he could".

And yes, immobilising someone in front of an entire audience, exposing their underwear and then, at the very least, /trying/ to remove that too, is sexual assault. Right there on the page.

As for it being a children's book... the whole backstory of the main villain is that he's the product of rape.

In any case, why are you using the fact that you were bullied to... defend a bully and minimise his actions?

Exactly, the people who were also Snape's professors are genuinely shocked, which goes to show what his behaviour was like during his years at Hogwarts. Unless this user (and others likeit) is arguing that McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout, Slughorn &co completely missed the fact that Snape was running around attacking muggleborn students. In which case, they're terrible teachers, and guilty of the fact that students were being groomed for a cult right inside the school.

The worst thing Lily complains about is that he calls other muggleborns "mudblood", although it's not clear if he actually goes around insulting them, or she knows that's what he calls them in discussions with other Slytherins (when it would be expected of him to talk like that).

  “You think you're funny,” she said coldly. “But you're just an arrogant, *bullying* toerag, Potter. Leave him alone.”

  “I will if you go out with me, Evans,” said James quickly. “Go on... go out with me and *I'll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again*.”

  [...]

  “Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down corridors and *hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can*---I'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.”
#+end_quote

James promises not to hex Snape again, which he couldn't do if Snape was the one initiating.

  And then bullying Harry after James doed makes it ok???
#+end_quote

Snape bullying Harry does not retroactively justify James bullying Snape and "anyone else who annoys him". Do you understand how time works?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

How so? Nobody denies Snape bullied Harry. On the other hand, I see there are a lot of desperate James stans who try to erase the fact that James was, canonically, according to his own friends and future wife, a bully. And they do so by justifying bullying in general and downplaying sexual assault as "pantsing". Gross.

In fact, according to canon, the only "proof" of James becoming a better person is that Lily married him. And now I discover a lot of James stans hate Lily and think he was too good for her.

And that, instead of just allowing Harry to see that memory, the way he saw the memory of Snape's dad abusing his mom, he somehow set up Montague's reappearance, and had Draco come get him?

That Pensieve clearly contained memories that Harry was never supposed to see, like those of Snape spying on Voldemort. If Harry had seen those, Voldemort would have seen them too, and Snape would have been dead. SWM was also put in there for obvious reasons.

Seriously, people don't talk about this enough.

Book 6 CLEARLY shows that memories can be doctored, and while Slughorn is no master of the mind arts, Snape is SO GOOD at them that even Voldemort can't tell whose side he is truly on.

It was pretty convenient for one of Snape's worst memories to be left out for Harry to see, who he knew full well was coming to his office at that time.

I'm not saying James is completely innocent, but it is implied that Snape harassed them just as much as they harassed him. I think it became worse when Snape starting hanging out with Death Eaters, and Lily definitely implied that he did NOT always do so.

** No matter the era, setting or PoV, Lily is very rarely portrayed in a negative light. Marauder-era Jily, Snily, WBWL, indy!Harry, something else, Lily is hardly ever in the wrong. The most common Lily-bash I've seen is SS/!LE where she was obviously in the wrong for hooking up with the jock and left poor SS in the dust. And even then, I've seen it maybe twice at most? The one premise where I imagined it'd be most common (WBWL) usually leaves her completely unmentioned or gives her a role similar to canon Eileen (passive wife in an abusive family dynamic).

The fact that she seems to be sacrosanct when basically nobody else is has always puzzled me. Not enough to result in me wanting to rant though. :P

EDIT: I always found the "love potion" argument rather amusing for James in particular at the expense of (almost always) Severus. While I admit to having a far more sympathetic view of Severus than OP has, here we have an Auror, which means at least decent at Potions, but probably not extraordinary, against the /youngest Potions Master in the century/. Don't you think Snape would've been able to detect said potion and get rid of it in case James actually pulled a stunt like that? If anything I'd expect the reverse to happen, although I can't see either of them do it (no matter how low Snape ended up, even when he was a fully fledged Death Eater, I have a very hard time seeing him intentionally hurt Lily in any way).

Don't dare going overboard about how Lily nearly saw through Albus's plan but relented because of James or Albus's persuation. HARRY IS HER CHILD!!! (regardless of the father). How the fuck is she relenting on any other safety measures. That justifies that she doesn't have that 'reading between the lines' chiché.

Then her friend called her a Mudblood, and she can't abide by that and now free of Snape she slowly drifts before she finds James, James who teaches her to be crafty and question things, she isn't always great at it but James is proud of her.

**** Interesting. I see Lily as:

- A hardworking studious woman, also extroverted, fun loving, with social skills. Not the sharpest tool but she was hardworking overall, especially due to being a mudblood.

- She was also a generic girly girl and liked fashion, idols, make up, all this kind of stuff and was a bit too worried about of her appareance and anxious about what others thought of her.

- She couldbbe a bit of airheahed and realized too late the real political situation of the upcoming war, and that what Snape was doing was consequential. She understood that after getting closer with James and his friends. Before that she rubbed what Snape and his friends did as stupid pranks, some people would frown to her but she didn't realize she was being apologist of racist behaviour that she was also a victim. The letter she wrote that could give her position also show how airheaded she could be.

- Extremely loyal to her friends and loved ones to a fault. Defendes Petunia even her being a jealous grumpy harpy. Defended Snape. Later defended James and closed her eyes to his bully behaviour thinking he changed. Died for her son. Would die for her husband and friends too.

- She felt attracted to James but played hard to get. She liked the attention and he like the chase. She was also aware of Snape feelings, she liked men attention overall and could play with their feelings.

- She was a talented witch but far from the stronger. Sirius liked her very much but some members of the Phoenix Order rolled their eyes to her. No one would expect that she would become a war hero.

So, not a malicious person but a bit annoying, yet good hearted overall despite her flaws.

I think that, because Harry saw his parents as perfect, until he could reach memories of the past and he so realized they were very flawed, probably the kind of people he couldn't relate in a personal level because Harry was mostly the outsider during his teens, while James and Lily were the generic jock and cheerleader popular pairing.

** Well, I understand where you're coming from but there are a few stories that are a bit different. For example linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince oF Slytherin), this has lily wanting to send Harry to the Dursley's while James rejected it at first. But then it twists everything and you're like “OH, Shit, idk what to think anymore”. Personally, it's my top fanfic rn. Still updating.

*** Oh I'm reading it but again James gets the brunt of the Bashing, James is the bad guy because he is terrified that he could be causing the end of the world and every attempt at reconnecting is hacked to bits by Jim, Lily, Albus and everyone else

**** Oh. I kinda felt different going through it. Like yea I understand what James is doing is wrong but I completely understand him. On the other hand, when Snape asks Lily if she had to choose who to save and she said Jim cuz he's more important, I was like DAAAAAM.

tl;dr: James was kinda annoying but justified, lily was meh tho (all my opinion)

***** Oh he is but in the story he is treated as the insane wrong one, let's say it was completely reversed that Lily wanted to reconcile with Harry and James was like "No James Jr is more important" Lily would of gotten a big "I'm leaving you because your a asshole" scene and turned Face (to borrow a wrestling term) but James is still treated like the Villain, even in the flash forward James is the Anti Harry one. James is the bad one for still trusting Peter in spite of getting Peter's full brain blast and Lily only getting a part of it (so obviously settling up Lily leaving James to join Harry's side when she discovers her memory has been tampered with)

****** I trust Prince of Slytherin to keep things interesting, and I think he has a very good, realistic take on Lily. It doesn't seem to me as though James is portrayed as a bad person, I think it's more like he's a kind of dumb person who is desperately fighting against something he thinks is inevitable, and he thinks---possibly rightly---that staving off the prophecy is more important than being a good person. Lily is trying like crazy to be a good person because she feels guilty as hell, and she still keeps fucking up some way or another. It's a good time.
