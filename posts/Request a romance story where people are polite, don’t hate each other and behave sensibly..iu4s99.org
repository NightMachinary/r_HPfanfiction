I've read my fair share of angsty, hate sex filled fanfics, but lately I feel like the world has enough drama already.

I would love to have any recommendations of fanfics (AU, OC's, etc., just throw them at me please!) where people aren't possessive and don't curse each other for fun, don't torture/maim for each other, don't scream verbal abuse to each other and don't automatically assume the worst of each other and don't just spend all of their time together having increasingly improbable sex. Drama is good if it's an outside force, but I would love it if the main characters are compassionate, know what consent is and behave like somewhat well adjusted adults...

I mean, the classic Drarry fanfic has Harry trying to make Draco angry or ‚Äúget a rise out of him‚Äù, the classic Dramione has Draco ‚Äústruggling‚Äù at first (or in the past) with considering Hermione human, almost all ships with Snape are of him being verbally abusive (with good intentions, or due to ‚Äúbad habits‚Äù from being a spy), and we all know that most fanfics with Tom Riddle, Bellatrix or Lucius are really unhealthy lol.

P.S. sorry if the formatting is off, I'm on my phone.


** There is crazily few of them. I have tried to write as a protest one such possible scenario in a one-shot linkao3(20141410), but I don't know about many which would made the similar sentiment into long story.

** I'm quite fond of linkffn(The Peace Not Promised), which is... well, I wouldn't call Severus well adjusted, but he's not precisely abusive, either. He is in a sense possessive of Lily, especially when he's interacting with James Potter, and yet, at the same time, if she wanted to walk away from him, he would never hold her back. Perhaps most importantly, he gradually changes and softens under her influence.

  When Draco Malfoy returns to the public eye by purchasing a run-down little antiques shop on Knockturn, Harry is convinced that he is up to something. It turns out that Harry is both very right and very wrong about that.
