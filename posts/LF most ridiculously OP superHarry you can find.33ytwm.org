** While not the focus, it gets to the point in nonjon's series [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter]["Where in the World is Harry Potter"]], it gets to the point that they joke that while Jesus is the Son of God, Harry is God's favorite son

** Core threads. It starts as 'only' OP but he steadily gets more and more powerful through the story to the point that his own dimension does not appear to provide enough of a challenge anymore. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads]] Also DOOM day. Sort of. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6966314/1/DOOM-Day]]

**** I like it too, but it would have been nice to take more time to develop the dimension hopping, and to perhaps wrap up his home dimensions problems and conflicts more. If its a matter of waiting for events to unfold in at home, then that time can be said to mastering and working on his powers; he is already stated as being godlike eventually, so why not work towards that at home, before he starts being the god of two worlds.

***** Not a clue but it is unfinished, so I'm just hoping it'll get resolved along the way and it definitely does fit the request, without being a chore to read.

*** I'm not quite sure about that, because as much as Dumbledore gets portrayed as a senile, bumbling idiot he's just as powerful as Harry, if not more. e.g. his ability to subdue Voldemort effortlessly and having like 7 billion horcruxes

**** I was mostly just referring to how insane the things Harry gets away with are in comparison to his canon counterpart; and to be fair, he wrecks most of Dumbledore's everything in the later chapters.

** Harry is secretly Salazar Slitherin in disguise:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10487644/1/Courage-and-Cunning]]

Harry is a vague Eragon crossoverish dragon riderish thing with way more power than canon and penchant for having sex with every named female vaguely near his age:

Dunno. If he's in the middle of a Dark ritual, it could be anybody's.

** Over-powered Potter was the biggest guilty pleasure when I used to read fanfics. IIRC [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4081016/1/The-Poker-Game][The Poker Game]] had a more subtle overpowered Harry, starting with mostly "just" political/monetary/destiny-bullshit/chick-magnet power.
