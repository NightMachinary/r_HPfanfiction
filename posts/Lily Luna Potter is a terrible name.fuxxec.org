You are literally the only person I have ever ever ever seen say this, and it is such a relief I cannot tell you. I'm saving your comment so that I never forget that someone other than myself feels that Dumbledore does not inherently show total faith in prophecies! What a wonderful day today turned out to be.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Having said that, I do disagree with this. I would not say it is explicit, but it is fairly strongly implicit that Dumbledore suspected that Voldemort made /a/ Horcrux and also probably realized Harry was a Horcrux /even before/ he realized that Voldemort made several Horcruxes. What was surprising to Dumbledore about the diary was not that it was a Horcrux, but that it was so poorly guarded and clearly wanted to be found, which suggested multiple Horcruxes. It seems very likely to me that Dumbledore suspected Voldemort of making /a/ Horcrux since at least the mid 60s when he interviewed him for the DADA post, but possibly suspected it even sooner than that.

But this does not necessarily damn Dumbledore, and it's my life's work to get this point out into the world; if Dumbledore knew/suspected that Harry had to die or might have to die for Voldemort to die, that does not mean that he was emotionally okay with sacrificing another human being just because he knows this. In fact, this makes the argument stronger that he wanted to prevent Voldemort from coming back at all, because then he would not need to do anything at all with Harry, Harry really could live a normal life. But of course, Voldemort came back anyway. I think some readers are so angry that Dumbledore isn't perfect, that they see him as so much worse than the books actually show him to be.

Thank you! It's both fun and depressing. Mostly fun though. Suggesting that Dumbledore is even a little skeptical about prophecies is an uphill battle, which really confuses me, because Dumbledore is not only repeatedly skeptical about them in several books across the series, but so is Firenze, a character who has dedicated his life to interpreting the stars. Firenze's opinion doesn't necessary tell us what Dumbledore's opinion is, but Firenze nevertheless adds another voice to the "don't trust prophecies" viewpoint, and I feel like literally nobody reads those scenes or something.

And I should correct myself, you are the third person I've come across. The other one is Jeremy Pierce, who wrote the essay "Destiny in the Wizarding World" in the book /The Ultimate Harry Potter and Philosphy/. So I guess that makes three of us. It's a good essay book, if you're into that sort of thing.

#+end_quote

I believe you are thinking of this quote from HBP,

#+begin_quote
  “...although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed [...] something much more sinister had lived inside that book. . . . a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered [...] there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again. [...] The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made---or been planning to make---more Horcruxes [...] I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense.
#+end_quote

From this dialogue alone, there are two possibilities: that Dumbledore, before seeing the diary, suspected that Voldemort had made a Horcrux and the diary made him realize he must have made more than one, or else that the diary was the first clue that Voldemort had made any Horcruxes at all. But I think it is much more likely that it is the former. Firstly, Dumbledore is the biggest advocate of censuring Horcrux information at Hogwarts, he removes them from the shelves when he becomes headmaster, so it's reasonable to assume he has read the books and possibly knows what they do to the physical body. Secondly, Dumbledore interviews Tom Riddle almost thirty years prior to seeing the diary and Riddle already looks physically altered, yet Dumbledore looks completely unsurprised by Voldemort's appearance and Dumbledore hints throughout the interview that he knows a lot more about Voldemort's life than Voldemort's realized.

But even this doesn't prove that Dumbledore suspected he made a Horcrux, because only one person is known to have made one, and he only made one. We also know Tom Riddle was still handsome after making his first Horcrux, it was only after making several that his appearance started to change, soo for this reason it is definitely possible that the Horcrux books don't mention how they change one's appearance, because of course the authors would not have known. Or maybe they did know, somehow. But long story short, Dumbledore is an expert on Horcruxes before Harry is born, before Harry's parents are born, and probably even before Tom Riddle is born. I think it would just be on his mind. I don't think Dumbledore had any proof or dreamed he could ever get it, but I think Riddle showed more than enough signs for Dumbledore to draw this conclusion anyway.

But the main reason I think Dumbledore suspects Voldemort made a Horcrux is because Dumbledore knows Voldemort didn't die when his body was destroyed. The only explanation we're given for how to survive bodily destruction is a Horcrux. How else would Dumbledore know Voldemort was alive if he did not suspect him of making a Horcrux?

************* That's a valid interpretation, and there's nothing to say it's wrong. The only reason I would consider it less likely is because no other method of achieving immortality is mentioned in the books, suggesting none of them are worth mentioning to the reader. I tend to interpret books as if they provide us with all the information we need to understand the story, that they are one unit and all necessary information is provided within it. So if something is not mentioned or even implied to exist, then I am not likely to consider it important to the story. So in my mind, if Voldemort destroys his soul and becomes emotionally and soulfully less human, and if he also /looks/ less human, and we are given no other reason for his appearance to change, then I think it is reasonable to interpret these two things as connected. But that's just my own way of interpreting things, there is definitely room to think differently than this.

But that did, upon further reflection go against his death being the next adventure thing.

I was foolish to forget the Sorcerer's Stone (I am a little hesitant to call it immortality, but not strongly enough to argue over it), but since it cannot account for Voldemort's changing appearance anyway, my primary point is unchanged. It's perfectly valid to interpret that Voldemort's appearance comes from something else besides Horcruxes, I have no issue with it, my explanation was not to say my way /must/ be right, but just to explain my criteria for interpreting. I'm sorry for being a little confused.

**** Ginny is certainly friendlier with Luna early on. She immediately describes Luna as "alright," in spite of the "Loony" reputation. She's perfectly happy to sit with Luna on the train, while Neville was reluctant and Harry privately dislikes being in her company when Cho shows up.

We also see that Ginny and Luna are in each other's company when they don't necessarily have to be. Luna is in Ravenclaw but she's with Ginny when Harry has his vision of Sirius being captured by Voldemort.

Luna tends to Ginny's injury in the Department of Mysteries, with no trace of her dreamy persona.

It's not till Harry connects with Luna after Sirius dies that he can actually call himself her friend.

** Definitely hate the canon names, those kids are forever going to live in the shadow of who that name belonged to. Also naming your kids after your parents is fucking weird.

I read a next gen story once that called them Robin, Emily and Martin, just random normal names. No stupid names nobody would ever call their kids, or weird spellings nobody would ever use. Second names, fine, but even then have the second name be in honor of someone who is A) not alive and B) was very close. So Sirius and Remus are alright, so would Cedric and anyone else who died in the battle of Hogwarts.

Because those people were Heroes. Dumbledore was, too, in his own way, and so was Snape, but they were very much working for an end to the conflict, not Harry's best interest.

** I have head canons about those names and I stick with them.

1. Albus Severus was a political name. Things were heating up again before he was born. People were calling for drastic measures after everything, reparation fees to be paid by the death eaters families and maybe even something game changing as calling for the shut down of house Slytherin all together and the old families thought their predjudices were right to begin with. Things were heading for another civil war. And Harry does something big and symbolic, like naming his new born son after an old hero and respected person in Dumbledor and put with Snape the only other Slytherin he could think, of that did something huge to active help him in the whole mess, on the some step. But that sounds terrible to tell a small scared child so you tell the same story you told the whole world, something about brave men.
2. Now my head canon to Lily Luna is much cuter. Everybody notice the pattern that all those kids were named after dead people other than Luna. And Luna was often traveling for her work and when she came back and head about the babies name, she was shocked and sorry and thought: 'Did I really keep in contact with my friends so little that they think I'm dead?'\\
   From that time on she completely unironic always sends them letters when she is away and always ends with 'P.S. I'm not dead yet'
