That's it. It would be nice if it was the main focus of the story. No pairings, please.


** There's a Cthulhu horror fic where he can see the old ones or whatever they're called. It takes place as Cthulhu is rising.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
