Hi!! Im wondering if anyone has good recommendations for Harry time travelling to the marauders era where he stays there as a student. Not a teacher. I dont really care what house he gets sorted into or if he ends up becoming a marauder/ befriending the marauders. I dont care if it is slash or not slash, or if harry is dark/grey/light. Just as long as he doesnt end up with lily or james. I know that if you type up this prompt online loads of results come up, but I'm wondering if there are any REALLY good ones that are carefully thought out, and the plot is amazing. Sometimes with these fics they just dont make sense. Thank you!!!!


** I'd recommend Stepping Back by the Black's Resurgence. Harry gets sent back to fix things & spends a lot of time with the Marauders.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** How do you feel about Fem!Harry? If you are ok with it, then The Last Peverell by animerocker646 on FF is really good. I think you can also find it on ao3.

*** The whole thing so far is only on FFnet, there is only a part of it on AO3.

Having said, it is a great story (and don't worry about fem!Harry, it is not overly smutty or anything).

  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.Warnings in author's notes.
