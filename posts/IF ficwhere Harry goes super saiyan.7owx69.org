I don't remember much of it, but Harry and nevill e are training and end up going super saiyan, and further on in the story Neville ends up joining voldemort. Any help appreciated


** I have half an outline in the back of my head where Goku in the Room of Space and time and Harry in the Room of Requirement get to meet and train together, but I haven't written a word of it down. Until now, kinda.

** linkffn(11634921) I'm not familiar at all with the crossover Harry is raised in before he get's his letter. Sounds like some kind of anime.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
