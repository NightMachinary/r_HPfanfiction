I'm re-reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2507697/1/Destiny-Reversed][Destiny Reversed]] and wonder if there's something like that, but with Harry just arriving to another dimension with a Harry living already there with lily and james alive and all. instead of Harry pretending to be Other Harry.

** I'll try to find it but in case someone else can find it before me I remember there was one fic with Harry in therapy about all the weird shit he dreams about courtesy of fanfic tropes.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the elemental's power) has a few chapters like this.

The good news is that he eventually travels to not just one, but even several dimensions. The bad news is that you'll have to read for quite a while for the plot to reach that point, and the dimension travel scene sequences aren't that long.
