**** It only really upsets me when it makes no sense. Like, I was reading a fic where Sirius raises Hermione undercover as his pureblood daughter and she becomes a Slytherin, and while we're supposed to be following her and there is some initial sop to her secretly helping Harry, after a while it just settles into Harry managing exactly the same Stations with basically the same outcomes without her. Which implies that Hermione achieved nothing in solving those issues in canon, and had no impact on Harry's life.

******* I prefer canon compliant fics because the original series is what I fell in love with and want to read more of what happens with those characters, whether it is through stories with different POVs, like Not From Others ;) or stories that pick up after the battle of Hogwarts. We know only certain things about Harry and the others post-battle, like their occupations, families, and whether they all went back to school. That leaves a lot of potential plots that can be created by the author without going against canon. For example, we have no idea what exactly happened right after the battle with the romantic pairings. Did both Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione start dating immediately after? Did they break up at any point? How did the trauma of the previous 7 years affect their abilities to maintain healthy relationships.

I've started to read and enjoy fics where things don't go very smoothly for Harry and Ginny right away and they have to find their way back together while still pursuing their careers. I find this very intriguing, and it doesn't go against canon at all.

But I do get a bit frustrated when writers generally stick to canon except change one seemingly inconsequential thing. Not sure why, but I guess it takes me out of the story a little bit.

*** Actually, you can throw out canon stations completely if the adults were NOT dumbed down that much or were slightly more competent.

Case 1: Dumbledore took the aftermath of CoS incident more seriously.

Results: *Petrification Proliferation*, linkffn(11265467)

Case 2: Remus Lupin didn't forget to drink his wolfbane potion.

Results: Wormtail would be handed over to the Ministry, Sirius would be exonerated, Voldemort would be stuck in Albania for a very long time, Barty Jr would remain under his dad's control, TWT would proceed normally, Moody would finish his one year term unscathed, Umbridge would not appear at Hogwarts, DA would not get formed, and Death Eaters in Azkaban would be permanently incapacitated.

Case 3: Dumbledore asked Barty Jr a few security questions.

Results: Barty Jr would be captured and interrogated, Voldemort's stupid plan would get unraveled, he and Wormtail would be captured at Riddle House, Sirius would be exonerated, Dumbledore and the Ministry would start horcrux hunt, TWT would proceed normally, Umbridge would not appear at Hogwarts, DA would not get formed, and Death Eaters in Azkaban would be permanently incapacitated.

I'm a bit of a sucker for marriage law/contract (they're the same damn thing, just slightly different setups) fics.

Though they are virtually always bad, I lately have felt drawn to James and Lily come back to life fics.

**** I really love A Black Comedy by Nonjon - linkffn(3401052)

It's a bit more than just a lordship fic; Harry goes through the veil to another dimension where he and Sirius died when he was a baby. He finds his own Sirius there, and the two of them as Lord Blacks cause havoc and mayhem in the wizengamot (and elsewhere).

The bit that for me works really well is that Harry is convinced the system of lordships is stupid, and proceeds to demonstrate exactly how stupid to convince the wizengamot to get with the times and fix the system.

**** Unfortunately, despite it being something I enjoy, there are precious few that are well done, and even less that are finished. I have a bunch on my "to read" list but so far the only ones I can suggest for now are (and some are not finished):

Harry Potter and the Rejected Path: linkffn(6375811)

Effects and Side Effects linkffn(4606270)

Im Still Here linkffn(9704180)

There are also 2 that came recommended, both are actually called "The Harem War" but I have yet to read them and one is much better then the other supposedly, although I have forgotten which one I was told was better LOL:

The Harem War linkffn(5639518)

The Harem War linkffn(11035814)

Hopefully that gets you started. I generally read more Time Travel, Darker Harry, and Powerful Harry, then Harem ones, so I am likely not the best source for good material despite the fact they intrigue me.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.
