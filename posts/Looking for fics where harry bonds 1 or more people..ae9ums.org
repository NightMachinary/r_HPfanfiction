Not looking for soulbond fics. I'm thinking more of ones where people are bound as vassals/slaves/pets. Where harry has power over them but is also completely responsible for them. The bonds can be made on purpose, by accident or even against people's will. Will also accept magical contracts instead of bonds


** One of my favorites is The Poker Game, by Enterprise1701-d.
