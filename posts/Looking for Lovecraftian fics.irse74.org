I'm looking for Lovecraft crossovers or elements (Shoggoths, Nyarlathotep, Cthulhu, etc.) or stories with horror elements.


** The one I enjoy the most:

linkffn(Deathly Hallowed), abandoned unfortunately, but what is there is gold. Probably my favorite characterization of Lily Potter in the fandom.

A close second, linkffn(To Play The Devil), this is a Harry and Voldemort sort of friendship story (absolutely no slash). It's sort of a sword and sorcery adventure kind of thing (reminded me of Michael Moorcock a bit, if you're aware of him). I'm not sure about the first story but the two sequels definitely have lovecraftian elements.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

#+begin_quote
  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

** So, a quick note - some of these are well written, others have... ideas that outclass their writing by considerable margins. They're all fics that've interested me, though, and a significant portion of the Lovecraft-Eldritch HP lot that I've seen.

All My Love to Long Ago is a Joe Ducie masterpiece (yet another one :D) that begins with a Lovecraft Quote. That, in all honesty, is about as much as I really need to say. Dude does 'rock and roll beatpoet eldritch' real good. Also, one of the only Potter Kids fics in my entire collection.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4085860/1/All-My-Love-To-Long-Ago]]

linkffn(4085860)

Touched by the Arcane is a lisbeth00 Bloodborne Crossover, so it's closer to the body-horror, blood-and-gore side of Lovecraft. It's also a WIP that's currently updating, which is always nice. :)

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24230728]]

linkao3(24230728)

Call of Harry is... something. It's only 700 words (ish). It's at least worth the time it takes to read that much, I can say that for certain.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3622203/1/Call-Of-Harry]]

linkffn(3622203)

Deathly Hallowed is one of the most interesting ideas on this list, and I highly recommend reading the first chapter even if you don't plan to read the rest of it.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/]]

linkffn(9172846)

Descent into Madness is a fun, interesting, vaguely eldritch mystery that goes very strange (and not overly good) in the last few chapters. The beginning is great, act II is also great. Act III... not so much.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12892315/1/]]

linkffn(12892315)

Eldritch Asylum is apparently also a Ranma crossover, if that means anything to you (it means bugger all to me). You don't need to know anything Ranma to enjoy it, and the fic does create an interesting Anime Lovecraft atmosphere that I actually enjoyed.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2056653/1/Eldritch-Asylum]]

linkffn(2056653)

Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod is probably the classic Lovecraft Rec. Mystery solving, a Comrade-Romance, and well, it's a good fic.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4323036/1/Gentleman-Usher-of-the-Scarlet-Rod]]

linkffn(4323036)

Harry Potter and the Great Cthulhu is an interesting concept. Also unfinished.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2955826/1/]]

linkffn(2955826)

Harry Potter and the Great Old Ones is another interesting idea, but it doesn't really go anywhere since it's only one chapter posted five years ago.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11365094/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Great-Old-Ones]]

linkffn(11365094)

Heartlands of Time is the sequel to Wastelands. Less Eldritch, but still somewhat.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6325846/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heartlands-of-Time]]

linkffn(6325846)

Wastelands of Time is totes eldritch and a really fun, but basically completely un-HP fic. Harry gets stuck in a Timeloop while trying to save the world. The timeloop did also turn Harry into a drawling beatpoet 'dancing on the head of a pin while spinning through the eternity of forever' whisky-swilling Dude type, but it works for the story.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]]

linkffn(4068153)

Harry Potter, Eldritch Abomination is another 'interesting idea, doesn't really go anywhere because it's only one chapter' fic. It is really interesting, though.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13269157/1/Harry-Potter-Eldritch-Abomination]]

linkffn(13269157)

Horror on the Hogwarts Express. Again. Interesting idea. Doesn't go anywhere because it's only one chapter. Still interesting.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13377783/1/]]

linkffn(13377783)

It's always the Quiet Ones. Luna is Luna, and it's fun.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11636560/1/It-s-Always-The-Quiet-Ones]]

linkffn(11636560)

Its the End of the World As We Know It and I feel Fine is a weird one. It's a Lovecraft-Lite Mild Absurdist-Comedy, really.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12748842/1/It-s-the-End-of-the-World-as-We-Know-It-And-I-Feel-Fine]]

linkffn(12748842)

Leviathan Rising. Ruskbyte did a horror thing. Also 'nuff said.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/952100/1/]]

linkffn(952100)

The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries is a somewhat contentious one, and I can understand some of why, but it's fun and interesting and long-ish and has Harry and Dumbledore interacting amiably.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13438181/1/The-Arcanist-Unspeakable-Mysteries]]

linkffn(13438181)

The Children of Set is probably the most Lovecraft in writing style of the lot. It makes a concerted effort to sound like his original works and does it pretty damn well. Good story, too.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7452468/1/The-Children-of-Set]]

linkffn(7452468)

The Riddle of the Uncanny Portrait is actually one of my favourite-named stories ever. The name so perfectly summarises the plot and indicates the tone of the story right from the start. Fun story, too.

Oh, Merciful Hunter is another Bloodborne crossover. Harry is Eldritch.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12158252/1/]]

linkffn(12158252)

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10390111/1/The-Riddle-of-the-Uncanny-Portrait]] linkffn(10390111)

The Thing in the Mirror is my only Fantastic Beasts fic, and it's a bit more Garth Nix than Lovecraft in my opinion, but it's still sufficiently Lovecraftian that I'm good with recc'ing it here. :)

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12236283]]

linkao3(12236283)

The Worst Muggles Imaginable is another absurdist comedy horror fic. The Dursleys are cultists, basically.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7370842/1/]]

linkffn(7370842)

Haunter of the Dark is a 'Pseudo-Eldritch Harry raised by a Lovecraft Cultist' fic. Pretty fun and interesting.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1720986/1/Haunter_of_the_Dark]]

linkffn(1720986)

The Eyes is the best Lovecraftian Fic in this fandom. It's so perfectly terrifyingly creepy and utterly nails the Small Time Fish In The Cosmic Horror Sea vibe.

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767473/1/]]

linkffn(9767473)

The Fire That Swallowed The World is only vaguely Eldritch, but basically Harry dies and something else moves in. Something that Burns. No Shoggoths, but it's definitely got those sorta vibes.

LINK - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15832620]]

linkao3(15832620)

TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel recently deleted all their fics and purged their accounts because some people in this fandom are womble-fucking twatwaffles, but if you're able to find a copy of their 'Outsiders and Other Eldritch Entities', I highly recommend it. It's great fun.

There's also this snippet from someone's self-promo post here on reddit, but it doesn't seem to have ever been made into a full fic (if anyone finds the full one, I'd very much appreciate a link!).

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4i2e29/preview_harry_phillips_lovecraft_and_the/]]

And finally, the other obligatory Lovecraftian Rec - Luna's Guide to Lovecraftian Horrors.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
