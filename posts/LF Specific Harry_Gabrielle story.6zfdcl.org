Harry and Gabrielle soulbond (I think after the lake) with huge negative consequences like not being able to physically be apart more than a fairly short distance.

It ends with Gabrielle's father finding them after they, having reached majority, managed to solve the problem.


** That sounds like linkffn(10027124)

It might be a different story though, because in this one [[/spoiler][Mr. & Mrs. Delacour find Harry & Gabrielle dead at the end]]

**** I might be in the minority here, but I find this story too melodramatic and can't take it seriously. Showing the potentially horrifying side of soul bonds is a brilliant idea, but I hate how the characters deal with it (or rather, /don't/). We're talking about Harry, the kid who fought Voldemort despite being vastly outclassed, and you'd have me believe he would just give up?

***** When I actually read it I was mostly just disgusted and didn't think about it but looking over it again, yeah. The situation would be immensely shitty but Harry and Gabrielle are both good people, they could make something work. I figure it would take /quite/ some time for Harry to fully forgive her, like he did in the fic, but after that it would get better.

I sort of like the story and I agree with you.

*** That's the one! Thank you.

I tried to phrase the ending to be recognizable without spoiling it in case somebody else wants to read it.
