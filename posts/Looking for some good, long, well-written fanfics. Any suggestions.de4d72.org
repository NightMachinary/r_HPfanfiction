I like practically anything marauders/Harry/next-gen, but not crossovers or loads of bashing.

Thanks

** [[https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] : a fandom classic! It's Remus/Sirius but focuses on all four of the marauders equally. Awesome illustrations to go with the text. Very well written and funny, with moments that will make you cry as well.

linkao3(Astra Inclinant): this fic isn't very well known, but it's seriously amazing. Future (non graphic) slash if that bothers you. It's a next gen fic that focuses on Harry, Draco Malfoy, and their respective sons. The quality is really consistent and the author updates every 2-3 months.

  "The stars incline us, they do not bind us." For Harry, it's something he learned long ago on the battlefield. But for his son, James, it will be a painful lesson in the form of a friendship with a boy named Scorpius Malfoy.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead."---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
