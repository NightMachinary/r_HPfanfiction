Just finished reading the Inquisitor Carrow fics ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][link]] for the first one), and I was wondering if there's anything similar out there. In particular, I'm hoping to find something that does a similar job of setting the entire underlying premise for most HP fics on fire and running off on some crazy awesome tangent that you don't see very often in HP fics.
