Any fic detailing Charlie Weasley's time at Hogwarts? Prefer no pairings if possible.


** Haha I was intrigued by this as I only ever find fics with Charlie in which either

- He is a small side character
- He never commits to any relationship
- The main (fe)male character is intrigued by him, but Charlie doesn't turn out to be his true love
- Leather, dragonhide, etc, etc
- He isn't able to talk about his emotions very well
- No scenes from Charlie's POV
- He is mainly or only used as a romantic/sexual plot device and doesn't really matter as a family member, friend, colleague, whatsoever
- His character is /so/ strongly built around him being a dragon trainer, that he doesn't seem to have any other characteristics that are not directly related to this
- His character is /so/ strongly built around him being a dragon trainer, that he doesn't seem to have any history before becoming one
- Wrong facts about Romania
- All or many of the above

Still I only found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9978764/2/Annie-Are-you-OK][this]], which doesn't look too promissing. Oh well, tell me if it's any good

** If you can find a Tonks-based fic then he'll be in that, they were in the same year at Hogwarts I believe.

** Fairly sure he left right before Harry's first year, therefore, 7 years (+/- several months) older than Harry and co.?

***** Its all good.

Also, do you subscribe to the theory that Charlie Weasley quit Hogwarts his Newt year to work on the dragon reserve? It fits with the ages she gave, and him not being at Hogwarts that year.
