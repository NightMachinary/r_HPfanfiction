** Uh no, no .... how the fuck DID they "invent" fire whiskey without crops? Why would they invent it? The much more sensible possibility would be that through magic they settle down faster than muggles and thereby develop faster. But there are also other ways in which something like this could develop, two as an example.\\
Magic makes them better hunters then the Muggles they stay hunters and gatherers longer. That can of course differ from culture to culture.\\
Then what I think is most likely, they and their families were the shamans and priests, no organized groups at the time and no own cities (not villages) do not appear in the story of JKR either. So it is more likely the magicians spread with Muggle civilizations. Maybe in between they Play gods (Greeks) or rulers (Egyptians) all the pureblood nonsense fits to it. Fire Whisky.....ðŸ¤£
