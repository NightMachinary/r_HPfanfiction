Hi everyone,

I've heard good reviews of this fic, but the author took down all of her writing from Live journal a while ago, advising people to save it. Does anyone have a mirror, or the fic itself downloaded? I'd like to be able to read it.

Thanks.


** I had a "say it isn't so!" moment and trawled for it, but LiveJournal confounds both Google and the Wayback Machine. If you find it, I'd love to save it as well.
