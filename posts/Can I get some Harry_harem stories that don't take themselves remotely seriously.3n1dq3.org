I will freely admit that the idea of Harry gaining access to a bunch of women at once is an appealing idea. The science behind this reasoning comes from me being a perverted straight male. But when it takes place in a story that tries to be a grand epic and yet include a harem, it makes a terrible read. So do you guys know any that don't try to act ultra realistic and just have fun with themselves?


** - linkffn(Do Unto Others Before They Do Unto You by SmallBurnyThing) is one that doesn't and is deliberately over the top pileup of tropes and fanon.

- I recall reading a fic named linkffn(Harry's Harem) a long time ago and finding it amusing. Though, for the life of me, I can't remember if it was intentionally silly or whether I just found it funny how over-the-top it was in every way. Nor do I remember the author.

  1. Your name is Harry Potter. 2. You have seven days to marry Draco Malfoy. 3. Only one person was ever on your side. 4. She's trying to take over the world. 5. Harem? Tropetastic crackshot.

**** It takes 'over-the-top' over the top, yeah.

As a break between learning to forge weapons like Norse deities and tame the mythological spirit of a lake, Harry is encouraged to participate in a touring bicycle race... because why not? He has some downtime before meeting up with Jormundgandr about his dragon-related heritage (part of the magical creature genetic cornucopia Lily used to /make/ him).

Meanwhile, Luna has decided to superimbue her breasts with magic so as to establish her own cult following.

All chapter titles are lines from a Lewis Carroll poem... in order.

** Well if you don't mind Crossovers then Megamatt09 is probably gonna fit the bill. His stories are fun and the arcs are pretty good IMO. A few unappealing aspects in his stories but give them a try.

My favourite was probably the "Beyond the Veil series"

His FF.net profile contains the non-explicit versions and his HPff archive profile contains the explicit versions.
