** Scryer, my brother, here, scrolling through Ao3 with tags I might enjoy, and the ocasional sugestion by authors (mostly from responses to reviews). Which is funny because one of said authors made me get into Doctor Who, after she took the time to explain to me what the fuck were weeping angels and why they were scary.

*** Oh, was that the Divine Comedian?? I ask because that author and I had a very similar conversation! In one of my reviews for Blackpool, I told her that I couldn't follow what the Marauders were getting at when they and Regulus discussed the idea of an "image" of a ghost, and she told me about the weeping angels.

**** Nope, it was Taliesin, the author of Grow Young with me. She's 100% my favourite person on the fandom, followed closely by Taure, who's just amazing.

** The follow/fave lists of authors I like. Not a foolproof method but it often brings up some interesting reads.

** Is DLP active again? When I stopped being active there a few years ago there were like 2 posts every few weeks.

As for recs besides here, I figured out a long time ago, that the authors of my favorite stories usually have a similar taste to myself. So their favorites tab on ffnet has always been a great ressource for when I was out of stuff to read.

*** DLP has never been inactivity. The forum has hundreds of posts a day.

Now, if you are talking about WIP, that has slown down a bit. Mostly because many authors write quality over quantity so chapters can take forever.

**** This is off-topic, but do you know what the countdown timer on DLP is for? I haven't been able to find out.
