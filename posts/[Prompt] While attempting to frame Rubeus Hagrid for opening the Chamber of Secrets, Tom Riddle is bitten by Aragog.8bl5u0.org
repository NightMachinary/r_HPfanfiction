** Tom threw open the door and pointed dramatically at the startled Half-Giant. "AHA! YOU'VE BEEN CAUGHT RED HANDED, HAGRID!"

Hagrid shuffled awkwardly and looked at his hands. "Erm... they don't look too red for me."

"It was a metaphor, Hagrid."

"Righ'. Erm... what've I been caught doin, again? Because I kinda have to go to Defense Against the Dark Arts in a few minutes-"

"YOU ARE THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN! YOU'VE BEEN MURDERING YOUR CLASSMATES, AND KEEPING THE MONSTER UNDER. YOUR. BED!"

"Nah, thats jus' Aragog - I mean, no! I haven't been murderin Anybody! I ain't no Heir of Slytherin, I'm a Gryffindor!"

"HE ADMITS IT!"

"Wha?"

"You used a double negative, Hagrid. '/I ain't no Heir of Slytherin/', the negatives cancel out, making it an affirmative statement. YOU MIGHT BE SNEAKY, HAGRID, BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO OUT-SLYTHERIN A SLYTHERIN!"

"But I thought yeh said I was the Heir of Slytherin-"

"SEMANTICS! Now, back away Hagrid, for I shall save this school from the BEAST!"

Tom tried to throw Hagrid aside but the boy was too massive. The Half-Giant stepped aside anyway. Tom flicked his wand and the bed lifted to the ceiling and was Stuck there.

"Oh. Hello."

Tom stared at the acromantula for a moment before snarling theatrically. "I HAVE FOUND THE MONSTER, AND SHALL SLAY IT FOR THE GOOD OF THE SCHOOL!"

"What strange greetings you humans use. In my species, we say thing like, '/Hi. My name is Aragog, nice to meet you./' Here, you give it a try."

Tom blinked again. "I SHALL NOT FALL FOR YOUR SLYTHERIN-EY LIES, BEAST!"

"Closer, but still not quite. How about-"

"Aragog," said Hagrid. "He's tryina kill yeh."

"Oh. Oh dear, we can't have that now."

"BE SILENT, HAGRID. I SEE NOW YOU HAVE FALLEN FOR ITS SILVER TONGUE-"

"I dunno if acromantulas have got tongues, though..."

"Well they clearly can speak English well enough, and normal spider mandibles - GAH! BE SILENT, YOU MURDERER!" he turned back to the spider. "I'm kinda sorry about this but not really because I need to preserve my alibi. /AVADA KEDA/AAAAAAAAAAAAUGH GET IT OFF ME!"

The acromantula, keeping eye contact with Tom, climbed up his leg and lightly nipped his thigh.

"AAAAH I AM SLAIN! YOU DASTARDLY BEAST, I AM SLAIN!"

"Er.. Tom?" Hagrid shuffled awkwardly, as Aragog took the opportunity to escape quietly.

"HOW DARE YOU, YOU MURDERER, INTERRUPT MY DYING WORDS!"

"Aragog isn't venomous, Tom."

"Oh. Okay. GAH! WHERE IS THE BEAST? YOU HELPED IT ESCAPE WHILE I WAS DISTRACTED, DIDN'T YOU?"

"Yeh left the door open."

"YOU FIENDISH, UH, FIEND! I SHALL TAKE YOU TO THE HEADMASTER, HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOU!"

**** I feel like Hogwarts Tom was really bad at acting and manipulation but made up for it with enthusiasm. His accidental magic did the rest.

But I feel Volderoy has a nice ring to it. What if Voldemort pulled another Quirrel in book 2, and him and the Diary kept accidentally messing up each other's plans?

**** linkffn(HOGWARTS-BOT, ROLL OUT!). I'm working on a Lavender Brown in the Triwizard fic but theres a couple scenes in that that are giving me some trouble right now.

Maybe I should collect all my prompt replies and jam them into my oneshots collection?

  After Slytherin made his Chamber of Secrets, all the other founders made their own secret rooms. Ravenclaw made her own super-secret Librarium, Hufflepuff made the Room of Requirement, and Gryffindor? He decided to outdo them all. [Oneshot, crackfic, vaguely AU]

** So Tom Riddle was bitten by Aragog, rather severely, and he was in the process of bleeding out all over the floor behind a panicking, giant-spider restraining Hagrid, when poof! A portal from the future appears and some strange guy in a beret steps through!

"Dammit, he's already been bitten." Beret grumbled as he bent over the bleeding Riddle, bringing his left arm up, which had a strange kind of square-shaped bracelet, and rapidly sketching runes on it with his right fingers.

Hagrid looked stupefied. Aragog looked stupefied too.

Beret waved a hand, "Oh, just ask your questions already, I need to obliviate you afterwards anyway so it doesn't matter what I tell you."

Hagrid paused at that, then ventured, "Why's saving Tom Riddle right now so important? Not that it's a bad thing, but to come from the future to do it...?"

"Because Tom bloody Riddle is pretty much evil incarnate, but also maybe the most bloody important person to exist over the next century! He causes a bloody civil war (bloody in a literal sense, not a vulgar sense) that's big enough to shape the future of the entire bloody wizarding world!"

Hagrid raised his eyebrow. Raised it extremely far, "But, eh, won't letting him die now stop that?"

Beret shook his head, "Time paradoxes, time paradoxes! Besides, this dumb snake won't die anyway, he's already made his first Horcrux so he'll just not die when he really should have, which kicks off a trend which will get this git even /more/ of a cult of personality which makes the whole stupid war even bloodier."

"And destroying the Horcrux so that snake /can/ be killed will cause a century-spanning Temporal Divide, which when it ends will create a weak point through which Dark Lord Nibiru can attack the world." Aragog spoke up. The giant spider cringed defensively when everyone stared at him, "I read Hagrid's history books..."

"So...he's an evil evil git but he's gotta plausibly live, right?" Hagrid spoke up.

Tom Riddle chose that moment to cough and wheeze and open his eyes.

"Yup. And good, he's up again. Now, places, you three, Hagrid, you were trying to hide Aragog, and you, Tom, catch him in the act, Hagrid gets expelled, Aragog escapes to the Forbidden Forest."

"Can't I kill the spider a teeny bit?" Tom pleaded.

Beret facepalmed, "Dammit, snake, you can't do that. The future will be changed, you'll create a time paradox."

*** Eh. Room for interpretation. Aragog was a secret and Acromantulas are from Borneo, so I wouldn't bet on Madam Pomfrey having a supply of antidote for their venom; not to mention, for all we know, perhaps Acromantula Venom is instantly lethal.
