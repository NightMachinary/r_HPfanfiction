I can never, ever get into *Draco/Harry*. I just, can't. At all. I know it is the most popular slash pair and possibly the most popular pair in HP fandom, but I think my...not quite dislike, but "don't really care" about Malfoy stops me from being invested in this couple. I guess I find Malfoy highly overrated, hence I don't care to read about him with Harry or anyone.

I don't care for *Sirius/Lupin* too much either...but that's because I love Lupin/Tonks. Never got to whole Sirius/Lupin thing, as James always seemed to be the one Sirius liked the most and by quite a bit.

The worst slash pair by far that I've come across though is /definitely/ *Harry/Dobby.*

Whyyy^{yyy^{yyy^{yyy^{yyy^{yyy}}}}}


** It's probably a thing unique to me, but having spent a bit of time as a university professor, I have a very hard time slogging through any story, slash or het, where a professor/student relationship takes place while they are in that asymmetrical role. It's highly unethical and improper and I find that I simply can't identify with the characters. Otherwise worthy stories, e.g., linkffn(Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodpecker) become unreadable to me for these reasons.

*** I loved /Yellow Submarine/. One of my favorite stories from my favorite author. I don't really care for teacher/student relationships either, but this one's the exception: I think its because the author used contrived means (lowering Ginny's age) to achieve this, and Harry and Ginny just cannot have the natural squick factor of say, Snape and Hermione.

Also the teacher/student thing wasn't nearly as important as getting over their past demons (which is central to the story), so kinky sex scenes aside, it doesn't really come up.

I can understand where you're coming from, being the student/teacher relationship is at the bottom of the list of controversial things in the story.

**** Gosh, the summary for /Yellow Submarine/ sounded good...except for the pairing. I simply cannot stand Harry/Ginny either in canon or fannon...and I dislike Ginny too. I really wanted to read it, but the pair turned me off.

I hate when I like the story idea but can't bring myself to read it because of the pair. Damn :(

*** I think, though, part of the intended appeal of Yellow Submarine /was/ the improper and unethical relationship between H/G (and the hurdles associated with it). However, it has been a very long time since I've read it, so perhaps I'm a bit off.

Though the fact that you've spent time as a university professor obviously makes a difference.

I wasn't much of a fan of it for another reason - I found it a bit boring and a bit too dramatic/angsty, despite being well-written. And it was H/G.

*** Since you brought it up- is the story somehow more or less palatable if the relationship existed before the two were put into the professor-student relationship?

I've seen more than a few stories where Harry and Tonks getting together involved Tonks later taking the Defence post, and I could see the same with Bill or Charlie coming to teach after starting something with Harry over the summer. Obviously this would be non-canon- Charlie has been outed as dragon-fond, but maybe if Harry's animagus form was a dragon...

(Sorry Pers- Despite my wandering into parody there for a second, my question is in earnest.)

** Anything professor/student. I had a relationship with a teacher in my teens and looking back on it I realize how f*cked up it was, but at the time I thought it was fine because I was competely immature in so many ways; I just /couldn't/ realize how incredibly /wrong/bad/nope/ the situation was. And at that time, 15 or so years ago, I was huge on Hr/Snape - go figure. Now I cannot read them at all. They just squick me out instantly because /no matter how mature someone writes the student character, they are essentially getting together with someone who not only is at least the age of their parents, but has also lived through a war, and has far too many additional life experiences to ever be emotionally equal to each other./

** /Ginny/Fleur/- Ginny seemed to actively dislike Fleur, and while that could be used in a plotline about how she was covering up mixed feelings by exaggerating angst, I just don't see it.

/Minerva/Hermione/- as an age gap, this goes beyond what I'm comfortable with, and old! Minerva doesn't strike me as someone willing to put up with some of Hermione's shit, or be that close to the chaos that follows her life. As time travel, I actually haven't seen that at all, so maybe? I don't like the idea though.

/Harry/Ron/- ehhhhh. I've given it a chance, I think my problem is that I don't like reading a fic where the primary ship involves Ron (if drama/romance), but with the way they interact in canon, it feels entirely platonic, kinda familial. It'd have to be a really early diverged AU.

/Snape/Dumbledore/- I've actually run into this, it bothered me. I just really can't suspend disbelief enough to get it. Plus the significant age gap here kinda ruins it even if I could.

** I'll read pretty much anything that's well written and has good characterization, but I definitely find myself more forgiving of some pairings than others.

I'm not very forgiving of Drarry. Occasionally I'll find a good one, but making Draco a romantic interest without changing his character radically tends to be difficult, and well characterized Draco isn't super compatible with canon characterized Harry unless they've both matured a lot. Schoolboy Draco with canon-like Harry as friends in an AU is stupidly fun though, and I really enjoy Draco with other characters so long as the author doesn't try to take away his flaws too much.

I used to really like Snarry, but I've been having trouble with it in recent years unless it's super AU. Probably because of the whole deal with Lily.

I don't like Lucius in a slash pairing usually, as they tend to bash Narcissa, and I've always kind of felt that some of the little good one could say about the Malfoys is that they're family oriented.

** Before we start; I have no problems with slash, either reading them or writing them. I'm content with slash pairings, the ones on this list are the ones in this fandom that legit make no sense to me.

Draco/Harry is obligatory on this list. It literally makes zero sense. Plus some people who ship these two tend to make the characters wildly ooc, not to mention that they change the backstories of both characters to "make them more compatible". I can't tell you how many stories I've read/seen with the lead up of "Oh Draco is half-Veela and Harry is his soul mate." I hate soul bonding fics as it is, but that just seems like a lame plot device to shove those two characters together.

Sirius/Harry is kinda not right to me. First of all, there's the age factor. Yeah, you can say that age is just a number when it comes to love. But not when someone is twenty years older than the other and the younger one is still in school. That's Pedophilia.

Harry/Voldemort. Pedophilic pairing, no me gusta. Unless it's a time travel fic where he gets with the much younger Tom Riddle, then I'm not gonna read it.

Harry/Snape. Pedophilic pairing. No me gusta. That aside, I don't really see this pairing work at all for reasons similar to Draco/Harry. Authors tend to make the characters wildly ooc and come up with seemingly random and lame plot devices to force them together. It's also unethical for Snape to get with Harry in half of the fics that I've seen because of his status as a Professor of Hogwarts.

Pedophilic pairings in general are a big no-no for me. So I never really read them.

Weasley-cest slash fics. No. Just no.

I'm also gonna just throw this one out there: Fics where Harry/Draco is the main pairing but where they make /literally everyone/ in the whole series gay as well. I'm like... What's the actual point here?

Possibly wish fulfillment of some gay writer living in a town alone with not a lot of other out individuals. Where I grew up being queer was /so not ok/ I'm talking rocks being thrown at my head, signs saying "die dyke die" being set on fire in my front yard kind of town.

I actually think he has more depth than that, but he's also extremely flawed. The racism he eventually gets over, according to JKR, but he's definitely a whiny, entitled drama queen. That said, when writing a fic focused on him, I think there is a lot of room to incorporate positive qualities (other than loyalty to family, which is canon), because we know that we see the worst of him in canon. I think he does need a major wake up call at some point to become more interesting and sympathetic. And I always have trouble seeing him with Harry, simply because even in fics where Draco does become a decent enough person to be friends with Harry, I don't see them as that compatible romantically. Regardless, even when he is portrayed sympathetically, it does bother me when they take away his flaws, because then he ends up essentially as an OMC with the Malfoy name and money and Tom Felton's face.

As an aside, this is Draco/OMC, and has a slashier feel to it than is ideal, but a really excellent characterization of Draco, in my opinion: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1546436/chapters/3275699]])

** Hermione/Bellatrix. I get why people like it, I do; "Hardcore racist abandons her hate and finds love with the most unlikely of people" but the key word here is *unlikely*.

Hermione is a muggleborn, Bellatrix /hates/ everything about her, and it's not a "I'm repressed so I hate you for giving me weird feelings" hate it's a true "I would gladly see you suffer before you die" hate.

The *only* way this could work in a canon story is if either Hermione or Bellatrix have different personalities, but then it stops being fun since at that point they may as well be OC's.

There is a rather good fic where this paring works (the only one I've found) and it's an AU where Voldemort was never born and as such Bellatrix never became a Death Eater but a detective instead:

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

*** But she's still an entitled prejudiced bitch in Murder Most Horrid.

What's really interesting is it can work if time travel is involved: "Time Heals All Wounds" is a fantastic example, in which Hermione travels back to Bellatrix at her age, and they gradually fall in love, and Hermione mostly succeeds in removing most of the prejudice, but then

*SPOILER*

Hermione is bounced back to her own time period where Bellatrix is an adult, and she finds that Bellatrix grew up to be exactly who she is in canon, and their relationship doesn't work that way. The story implies heavily that adult!Bellatrix/student!Hermione just /doesn't work/, and that ends up having large consequences.

PLEASE give it a try, it's linkffn(Time Heals All Wounds by brightsilverkitty).

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.

*** If an H/Hr is written well enough, I'll read the shit out of it. The problem with it for me isn't really them being brother/sister, which can easily be done away with, with proper character development, it's the sheer amount of Harmonian /bullshit/ in H/Hr fics that turns me off of them. Jealous Ron, Meddling Molly, Manipulative Dumbledore, Love Potion-Master Ginny. Jesus, they're terrible.

I get the feeling that those are merely lazy plot devices thrown in by writers who aren't willing to put in the effort of writing proper character development that leads to romance, and instead have the characters /forced/ together by external circumstances. Which is what happens in most shittily written shipping fics.

***** Certainly, but that particular type of shittily-written shipping fic seems to have over-saturated the H/Hr archives. Now, I haven't read that many shipping fics, but H/G generally doesn't bring Harry and Ginny together by making Ron and Hermione look like toadstools.

Baseless bashing is a problem especially relevant in H/Hr fics, particularly because they want Harry and Hermione together within the first 2 or 3 chapters and they're extremely bitter about who a fictional character married in canon. Which is such a shame, because there's a lot of room to write a really good relationship between Harry and Hermione, if only the authors would let go of their ridiculous need to turn every possible romantic rival into an awful human being, and let H/Hr settle into their relationship over time. I've said before that really like the idea of H/Hr, but most H/Hr fics have made me pretty cynical about the ship.

**** /highfives fellow HHr shipper :D/

HHr is a good ship imo. But only if it's well done. As [[/u/Zeitgeist84]] has said. There's far too many fics where the content just degrades into bashing of Ron, Molly, Dumbledore, Ginny and just about anyone who the author dislikes. The tropes in those fics are usually appalling and unoriginal.

*** I'm alright with H/Hr in the realm of fanon. It's the "delusional" shippers who piss me off, who claim their views to be complete canon, involving lots of bashing and a distortion of Harry and Hermione's beautiful platonic relationship. And sadly these seem to be the majority in the ship, more so than in any other ship (except perhaps Snape/Lily shippers).

** Harry/Remus never works for me as a serious pairing. Their relationship is too familial to me, even more so than Harry/Sirius. It's certainly not an age issue, since Snarry is my bulletproof ship. That said, I do recall reading a few really twisted Harry/Remus fics that worked as a story, but it didn't exactly portray a healthy relationship.

I'm also not a huge fan of Dumbledore/anyone, but maybe that's because I've never seen it done well.
