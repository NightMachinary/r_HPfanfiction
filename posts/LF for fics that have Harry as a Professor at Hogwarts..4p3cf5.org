This is something that I've only just realized could provide a lot of good reading material. If anyone knows any well written fics where Harry takes on a professorship at Hogwarts, I would be very grateful. Despite being a shameless supporter of the Harmony ship, I don't necessarily need any sort of pairing. Rather, I'm just looking for an interesting story to read in my free time.
