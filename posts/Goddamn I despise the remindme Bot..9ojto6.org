** I know! You get your hopes up that someone has answered... and then. They die a fiery death.

I have that same reaction every time I use fanfiction bot in a post. I know it's only the bot, but that little notification icon makes me so hopeful....

** Simple solution: immediately reply to your own thread with "RemindMe! x days" and people will subscribe to that reminder, rather than making their own, preventing you getting false hope.

*** also, interesting trivia: the reminder bot WILL find it's trigger phrase mid sentence, and if it can't detect a number it'll treat x days as one day by default...
