** Have you read [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b6g3ww/teaser_of_my_new_fic_harry_potter_and_the_dark/][April Fools prompt]] with +Dark Lady+ Racial Strobe Light Hermione?

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was having tea with Professor McGonagall when it happened.

  "Professor?" Harry asked, "are you well? You look a bit... pale."

  McGonagall looked down at her hands. They were shifting before her very eyes, wrinkles growing, disappearing then appearing once more. "Perhaps I should see Madam Pomfrey," she said, "it's like my body doesn't know how old it is."

  At that moment, Hermione burst through the door - or at least, it looked like Hermione at first, but then her skin turned black, before switching back to white again. Back and forth it went, white to black to white, like a racial strobe light.

  "Harry!" she said, panic in her voice, "what's happening?"

  Harry grimaced. "It is as we feared. The Author has returned."

** If she always emits light, then the Accidental Magic Reversal squad would have an impossible job trying to cover her up. Perhaps their best tactic would be to take "cover her up" literally... but burqas weren't in fashion in 1980's Britain, especially not for girls of single-digit age. No, the paperwork's probably going to get through for her to be raised in the Wizarding World, most likely without her parents.

Alternatively, perhaps Hermione only glows in the presence of magic, or when she's recently been in the presence of magic, so she doesn't start glowing till after her first visit to Diagon Alley? If that doesn't derail the plot, it'd be fairly useful on the horcrux hunt.

** Polyjuice potion is a NEWT level potion to say the least. Doing this in a literal bathstall as if it's some bootleg gin is not a good idea.

So with this in mind Harry was quick to point out maybe they should find a way to check it before taking it.

Hermione huffed, of course it was perfectly fine. She had checked everything to make sure. Dropping the hair she had gotten she took a drink first to prove it worked.

Polyjuice potion is NEWT level for a reason as it causes a genetic and physiological change based on many factors. The DNA and Magical signature for said DNA are key. Nearly 90% of the potion has nothing to do with changing form. The majority of it is safety measures introduced to keep the potion safe.

Bathtub gin polyjuice combined with cat hair a stable and safe potion does not make.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Madam Pomphrey could only shake her head as she continued her discussion with Mcgonagall.

"I'm afraid it's permanent and none of my spells can hide it."

Minerva sighed as she looked through her charmed glasses at the girl blazing like the sun in front of her.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry was just about the only student who would spend time with Hermione anymore.

Even Ron had abandoned Hermione's side over her condition. That was something that saw a row for the ages happen. Ron was no longer a friend of Harry's.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Harry was not the smartest kid though he was great at coming up with ideas when needed. So when he had found Hermione crying in frustration he had decided to do something about it.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Hermione had made bathtub polyjuice and added cat hair. Harry still had what was left hidden under layers of stasis charms.

If they couldn't make the light go away he would just make it better! Needing money he had sought out Professor Snape. Offering to let the man sell a 1000 year old Basilisk and split the profits had been a great idea.

Snape had even had a goblin contract keeping everything legal created.

Tossing insane amounts of money into the project he had hired a handful of magical researchers to study the remains and make his desire come true.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Hermione gripped the potion bottle in her hand. Harry had given it to her just this Christmas morning. He claimed it was an excellent surprise and it would only get better afterwards.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The school was completely in shock as two Angels of incredible grace and beauty made their way into the great hall.

As the occupants looked closer they found the Angels familiar in some way. When they sat down at gryffindor table Ron finally spouted it out first.

"Blimey is that you Harry, Hermione?"

Smiling at one another they let out melodious laughs that filled the air with the tinkling of bells and fresh snowfall.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Yes it had cost more galleons than the operating quarterly budget of the Ministry but his dream had come true.

Angel's Kiss was finally finished. A potion that turned the drinker into a new magical being. Large white wings, ethereal beauty, soft golden glow and a voice from the heavens.

Smiling over at the love of his life Harry knew it was worth it. With a case of Angel's Kiss still under extremely heavy stasis and security charms Harry was excited for the future.

A new race had been born in the magical world. The Angel's were here, true leaders of the light.
