It seems quite odd since Voldemort doesn't get involved in the first battle of Hogwarts and the killing curse (supposedly) works on him. It would make sense that other Death Eaters would be unable to do anything to him but not Voldemort himself. Any thoughts?


** No, it was Harry's own sacrifice. He even did a long exposition in the Great Hall later. Basically, Harry's sacrifice nerfed Voldemort's magic forever against him and his supporters:

#+begin_quote
  "You won't be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other's eyes, green into red. “You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people ---”

  “But you did not!”

  “--- I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?”

*** Imagine if the bad guys had as much hax as the good guys, and just nerfed the Order's magic with a sacrifice like that. Fucking Bellatrix could do it if she genuinely loves Voldemort. Or Narcissa for Lucius. Or does love discriminate between "good guys" and "bad guys"? Bad guys don't get to love each other? I want to see a fanfic that actually turns the tables like this.

It's the same as that bullshit about dark wizards not being able to make patronuses. Like just because you're "dark" you can never feel real happiness in life, never have cherished memories? What about memories from BEFORE you went "dark"? Or do those stop counting for bad guys once you've made the change to being one?

All the bad guys are humans too, and assumedly have normal human emotional ranges and capabilities - barring Voldemort I guess? But whatever. I contest even that, and I think he could've even loved someone if he wanted to.

**** JKR must be a devout Christian at heart. Harry's sacrifice and resurrection is pretty much a Bible rip off, and she gets very emotional every time she talks about that part in interviews.

**** Snape casts a patronus just fine, and while he's a sympathetic character, he's still very much a dark wizard, with blood on his hands. I don't think that rule is absolute.

Who would Bellatrix sacrifice herself to neuter? Dumbledore? He'd have to kill her. And presumably ritualistically - the whole deal: offering to let her live, her protecting voldy, choosing to sacrifice her life for him. Death in battle wouldn't do it, or every other person would be triggering it. ... Doesn't seem like Dumble's style.

***** Dumbledore specifically says that there are other ways to destroy a man than killing him. And I think that by stripping Voldemort of his power through Harry's sacrifice that's specifically what he intended.

This is fanon as both Snape and Umbridge can do it. JKR said they didn't have patronuses because they didn't need them.

***** You sure? Pretty sure she gave some interview where she said they made maggots instead of Patronuses and it was a dumbass retcon. Wouldn't be the first time she made a stupid post series interview that contradicted her own books.

**** Bellatrix would need to be given the honest option to live if she gives up Voldemort and then choose to sacrifice herself for Voldemort because she loves him for the protection to come into place. I'm also not sure how aggressor/victim dynamics play into this. Bellatrix tends to be the aggressor in most situations. The love protection came into place in situations where the people sacrificing were defenders or fighting to protect one another and ward off their aggressors.

Also, the magic definitely does seem to favor "good" people, but honestly, is that really a bad thing? It didn't stop Voldemort from becoming so powerful, ruining so many lives, and casting powerful magic of his own like the DADA curse.

Wait what? That doesn't even make sense. Magic is a skill that *can be LEARNED*. That's why you have *CLASSES for magic.* The ability to cast a patronus (or any other spell for that matter) shouldn't depend on which side you align yourself with.

*IF A SPELL EXISTS THEN EVERY WIZARD SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEARN IT (PROVIDED THEY'RE SKILLED ENOUGH)!*

Hell, even Voldemort should be able to cast a patronus. I refuse to believe that the guy didn't have a single happy memory in his life.

**** I headcanon myself that Patronuses work not on "Happy memories" per se, but instead is a powerful Magic that is based around protecting that which you love, which also fits with the theme of Harry's Stag and Snape's Dow. That would also explain why a Dark/Sociopathical Wizard always fails to materialize one, they don't truly love anything.

*** I know that. Actually I think that was in fact Dumbledore's plan: to make Voldemort impotent rather than kill him. But since no one else survived the killing curse before and the only other known person to have used that spell died (obviously), it is never specified if the protection worked on that person as well.
