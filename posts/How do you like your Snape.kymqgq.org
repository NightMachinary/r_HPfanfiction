Do you prefer "not reformed, still evil" like in a lot of Evil!Dumbledore fics. Personally I prefer, is reformed, protective of slytherins, but still a bit of a dick. I like in time travel/dimension travelling story's for Harry to semi-befriend him. But still have the sour outside. Like a grumpy grandpa. I dislike when it turns out he was evil and Dumbledore was stupid for trusting him stuff.


** Bitterness and anger are his go-to emotions. He hates everyone and everything, but he hates himself most of all. He's attracted to goodness and does good but is too damaged to become a Good Person himself. The only quality he sees in himself as having any worth is his cleverness, which is why he hones his skills tirelessly to make himself the perfect weapon. He's also a bit of a faker, constantly trying to make himself someone he's not: an impassive, polished, pureblood, but ultimately he will always be the hotheaded working-class half-blood from the bad side of Cokeworth. He also has a dark and sarcastic sense of humour. In short, he is vengeful, loyal, bitter, brave, emotionally-stunted, guilt-ridden, and jealous.

I can read Snape in numerous situations, but one of my favourite kinds of fics is him confronting Harry--the physical manifestation of his sins, his flaws, and his failures-- and achieving some kind of understanding with him. It's a compelling conflict and I prefer it if Snape is dragged into becoming a better person kicking and screaming.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.

** Terrible but not evil. He's a miserable, nasty fucker. I love that in canon he is an important part of the victory over Voldemort, but he's still such a bastard. He did a few good things in his life for terrible reasons. Mostly he's a mirror to reflect different philosophical questions while still being a realistic character because the world is full of people like Snape.

He's a great foil for Harry. A line I really liked in DH was where (paraphrasing) it pointed out that LV, HP, and SS (also Albus Dumbledore but that wasn't part of the line) were poor sad unwanted children who found home and a purpose at Hogwarts.

** Lol, I just so happen to be writing a time-travel fix-it fic where Snape happens to be 1) reformed, 2) protective of Slytherins, 3) still a bit of a dick, and 4) Harry will semi-befriend him. Funny how that works out. 😃

But, yeah, I prefer fics where Snape's not ridiculously evil or anything and is "reformed" or whatever that means.

** I like reading most versions of Snape, although I hate the bashing and borderline-bashing versions where he's just evil incarnate. I think there are a lot of things that went wrong for him to put him in the position he's in.

In my work, I write him as a man whose youth was heavily influenced by those around him, with little choice but to let it happen and try to use them back, due to his home circumstances. He was more-or-less swept along into Voldemort's following, going where the money and influence were so that he could get the education he wanted and become a man better than his father.

What stopped him, initially, from taking the dark mark was his friendship with Lily. When that ended, and he saw that she was unwilling to forgive him, he blamed himself. There was a lot of, “Well if this girl, who is the most lovely, forgiving person I know, can't forgive me for what I have done, maybe I really am just a piece of shit Death Eater. That must be the only path for me. I'm irredeemable.” Lily's reaction to that one slur was disproportionate. Have you ever called someone a c*nt without meaning to? It's like that. You hear it so much around you, it just slips out in the heat of the moment. Even if you hate the word and everything it stands for, sometimes it comes out. She knew he was in that environment, hearing that slur all the time. She knew it was an honest mistake, a matter of the brain short-circuiting out of embarrassment, anger, fear, and all the other emotions he was probably feeling.

I'm not saying he couldn't have gone the other way, but a lot of circumstances led to him taking that mark.

Additionally, the whole ‘Eternally in Love With Lily' thing is.. inaccurate. I think he realised, at some point along the way, that he wasn't a Death Eater; he didn't believe in their values, didn't want to be a part of the upcoming genocide. When he told Voldemort about the prophecy, he suddenly found out just how fanatical and insane Voldemort really was. It was a wake-up call for him. I think a lot of his friends and housemates were in similar positions, especially those whose families were already heavily involved (similar to the situation with Draco and his generation.) The difference between Snape and, say, Lucius Malfoy, is that Snape had that connection on the ‘Side of the Light' through Lily and his presumed love for her. He realised that he could use that connection to get out. He also probably realised that nobody in the order would believe he was genuine unless he claimed to be in love with her. Love is their big thing, after all. Proving it was probably a matter of using his friendship with Lily as the fuel for his patronus, and the rest was acting the part; bitter/heartbroken over Lily's death, heavily biased toward Slytherin, and specifically against Harry, to keep up the appearance of being a Death Eater. Partly to keep from being found out as a spy and traitor, partly to keep Dumbledore's trust.

Of course, saying all of this within the story itself is no good because there's no need to mention all of this so explicitly. It has to be shown through his own words and actions to be at all effective.

Sorry for the massive, long analysis. It's just good to tell someone other than my editor about my headcanons!

*** It was his first time using the slur on her. Not his first time ever using the slur.

Lily knows he's bigoted. She just chose to ignore it until it finally couldn't be ignored anymore.

Lily's the moderate who's finally confronted with the truth of her nazi friend's behavior after being willfully blind to it for years.

**** I'm in no way trying to vilify Lily, to be clear. She was very upset that he called her a mudblood. As she should be.

The fact that he's used it before, however, doesn't negate the fact that he's also in a very ‘toxic' environment. I know from experience that you can't help but pick certain things up, even when you hate them with all your being. She's his closest friend and confidant. She could and should have been a little more understanding, knowing full well his situation.

As I said above, too, (in my headcanon) his heart wasn't in the whole Death Eater thing until after the ‘Mudblood' incident, at which point, her reaction, justified or not, caused him to internalise a lot of horrible, negative things, essentially convincing himself that he was a Death Eater.

I know where you're coming from. I think the books leave a lot to the imagination with his story. Some things, I have taken some creative liberties with to fit my story and create the Severus Snape I want and need in my universe. I'm not going to sit here and argue about whether Snape or Lily was in the wrong. Neither is infallible.

***** Sure. Your headcanon is your headcanon and mine is mine. No point trying to convince one another.

I think Lily was plenty understanding though. Imagine being a black person in the 1960s and trying to defend a person who casually throws around the word "nigger". Or a gay person in the 80s.

If Lily were to be more understanding, she'd practically be a saint or have some serious issues with internalized racism.

** I'm piggybacking off [[/u/adreamersmusing][u/adreamersmusing]]'s response since I really liked it. Specifically this section:

#+begin_quote
  In short, he is vengeful, loyal, bitter, brave, emotionally-stunted, guilt-ridden, and jealous.
#+end_quote

He describes a very compelling character and I hope to see more fics using this characterization.

Personally I have a hate-hate relationship with Snape in large part because a lot of the fandom likes to portray him as a better man than he is. If I had to choose a defining moment for him, it would be in /Prisoner of Azkaban/ where he knowingly lies to Fudge about Sirius. He effectively condemns a man he /knows/ is innocent, a man that has already spent 12 years in a living hell, to a fate worse than death. And he does this over a childhood grudge.

I'd replace "loyal" and "brave" from the section quoted above with "petty" and "selfish." I like to see him portrayed as someone who spent his time deliberately terrorizing children, a man who couldn't forgive a boy for surviving when his mother didn't, someone who was willing, eager even, to see a family (any family) destroyed so he could "have" a woman that wanted nothing to do with him.

I like to see a Severus Snape who is talanted, driven, and knowledgeable, but is fundamentally a horrible person where any good he does is purely incidental to his revenge against Voldemort.

But this isn't true. He was unconscious when Sirius and Remus reveal Peter. He thinks Sirius betrayed the Potters (like the rest of the wizarding world believes) by the time he enters the Shack. You can double check your PoA copy. He is knocked out by Stupefy on page 361 of the American editions of PoA. Then, on page 366, Remus and Sirius cast the spell that forces Peter out of his animagus form and reveals Scabbers to be Peter. Snape didn't hear any of this or see Peter, so he doesn't know Sirius is innocent when he speaks to Fudge.

No wonder you accuse the fandom of portraying him "as a better man than he is;" your version of Snape is going to be vastly different from most people's because you are judging him on a completely different level than what's in the books.

*** Yes, but the thing is that he is loyal and brave as well. I purposely included those two because I think those are his defining characteristics. His loyalty and bravery ultimately helped save the wizarding world.

In the end, his loyalty towards Dumbledore supercedes everything else. He knowingly sends Harry to his death because of that loyalty, even when it meant throwing his atonement away. And as for his bravery, I think he is one of the bravest characters in the series, constantly lying to Voldemort under the threat of torture and death. We praise Narcissa Malfoy for one lie but Snape had to do it consistently, particularly when other Deatheaters like Bellatrix didn't trust him.

I also don't agree with his motivation being revenge against Voldemort, my reading of him is that his entire arc is one of atonement for Lily's death. He doesn't blame Voldemort as much as he blames himself, and his actions after her death are primarily about atoning for getting her killed.

I think he did show some character growth towards the end. He wasn't the same selfish, depraved young man who went to Dumbledore to beg for Lily's life. He tried to save Remus Lupin by aiming at a Death Eater, he genuinely regretted not being able save lives ('Lately only those whom I could not save'). Saving lives didn't really benefit Voldemort's defeat, but he did it anyway. In the end, he did manage to grow morally while still being deeply horrible.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.
