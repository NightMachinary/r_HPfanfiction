The vast, vast majority of stories i can recall has Harry being indifferent or ignorant of the potential of his fame at best and hostile towards anyone wanting to meet, chat with or date The Boy Who Lived at worst.. Could you instead link me stories where he /does/ in some way take advantage of the unique position he is in, begrudingly or not?


** The only reason he got the offer to become an Auror without having the necessary qualifications was his fame. The offer had been extended to all other participants in the Battle of Hogwarts, so it wouldn't be too obvious.

*** Surely that was because of the fame from his defeat of Voldie rather than his BWL fame, which I imagine is what OP is asking about.

**** I don't think so, he was the BWL who defeated Voldemort.

** There's a bit in a few of E7 stories, most notably, in linkffn(Vitam Paramus) They're mostly post-war, and to be honest, they're not my cup of tea, mostly because he doesn't "end" the fic, he ends the arc and then skips with time jumps in the epilogue, which I really don't like, but he writes wonderfully, and he's extremely good at writing quidditch, if you're into that.

  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.
