Or Harry learns about Sirius's innocence after he runs away from the Dursley's and he became quite close to his godfather


** Oooh, I like this idea!

Alternatively, there's a fic out there where Sirius' death is Remus' biggest fear. He encounters a boggart part way through the main part of the series and it's revealed.

**** The part that I was talking about is

linkffn(A Bond Of Family by Daily-Chan)

The first part of the series is either

linkffn(Home by daily-chan)

Or

linkffn(Midnight Conversations by Daily-Chan)

The series' order in the authors profile because they tend to post a little bit of everywhere in the timeline.

Warning, it's got minor sirius/remus vibes. Also slight op Sirius(which is pretty amazing imo) and lord stuff. It doesn't go overly into it though.

Oh and a bit of Dumbledore and Molly bashing. Just a bit.

  After the holidays Harry returns to Hogwarts, but this time he's not alone. Follow Sirius and Remus as they put their own personal stamp on the castle and every resident in it as teachers.

  Christmas Eve of 1975, James could finally welcome his little brother home for good. It was however unfortunate that Sirius was such a bloody mess upon arrival. Otherwise known as the story of how Sirius ran away from home and became the Potter's second son. Described violence in chapter 2! You are warned. This story is part of the A Bond of Family series.

****** Okay ffnbot seems to be convinced that the last two are what I was talking about. There is a one shot called Home and a small, I can't remember if it was a one shot or just had very few chapters, fic titled something like Midnight Conversations.

If these are the fics I'm thinking of, then /slight/ is an incredible understatement. Didn't he disarm the entire great hall wandlessly or something and have Hogwarts (as in the castle) fawn over him? Also, weren't there massive conversations devoted to talking about how awesome Sirius is? I mean, he's my favourite character, but that was pretty off-putting.
