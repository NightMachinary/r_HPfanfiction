Being able to communicate telepathically, share knowledge and gain that power up that everyone seems to agree comes with soul bonds but no one can give a decent explanation for are all pretty darn useful.

But it kind of ruins your secret advantage when it's a matter of public record (even if it's only ever Dumbledore who thinks to check) and you tell all your mates because it's so cool right?


** One of the first fics I've ever read and it's still one of my favorites. It's part of a trilogy but be warned the third one never got written. First two are amazing though. Ginny-centric.

**** I've always liked the writing and it's paced well. It's Pre-OotP so a lot wasn't known yet but on a re read I found it quite refreshing, no worrying about horcruxes or hallows or even the prophecy. I just wish the third one had been written :(

*** Honestly, I love the concept, you can do so much with two characters who are functionally acting as one person. Sadly, it does seem to be mostly used as an out for realistic relationship development.

Taure wrote a story like this, where Ginny dies in the chamber of secrets and Harry's soul gets stretched between his own body and her body, controlling both at once.

I suppose it fits the bill, but it's hardly a 'soul bond' in the romantic sense :P

My mind is going down some dark paths you probably don't want to follow right now. I'll give it a try though.
