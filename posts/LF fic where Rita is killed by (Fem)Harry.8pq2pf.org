I remember Rita being squashed in bug form and then turning back into a human in the trash can. Sirius was there too. Help a guy out please?


** I know which one you're talking about, but I can't remember the name. I can add more details though. Harry is male. Sirius falls in love with Harry's occlumency instructor and eventually marries her. She's German(?) and portrayed as very strict at first. Harry and (either Ginny or Hermione) hide under a bed at one point and the occlumency instructor seduces Sirius while they're hidden.

** Just from the gruesome shock factor, that sounds like one of the "Princess of the Blacks" stories.

*** Definitely not. I remember reading what OP asked for and I am quite sure that it was not in the Black Queen series because I have never gotten past book one there.

And what OP describes is far too tame for the Black Queen series.

**** Black Queen is the one where Fem!Harry starts out as a prostitute, right?

** It's in a trillogy by Brennus. The Thorny Rose or something like that. Not a femHarry.
