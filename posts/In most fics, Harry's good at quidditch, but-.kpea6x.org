Give me one fic where Harry sucks at quidditch. Just one. There's no reason why Harrys good at quidditch, he should suck, like worse than Neville during that first lesson. Please, I just need to see it happen, because I've never seen a single fic where he sucks at it. Not in a Slytherin/Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw sorting, or in any time travel or dark/crazy/insane Harry fics, heck, even in non Harry centric fics, he's good at Quidditch. He can't be that good at quidditch, I'm sorry.


** While I haven't seen this, your request reminded me of a gag in linkffn(The Gates of Azkaban) where Harry's friends tell James about how utterly hopeless Harry is on a broom, much to James' utter horror. It was a rather amusing moment in that fic. The premise of the fic, for context, is that post-war Hermione, Harry, some of his friends, and an alive Snape, travels to an AU version of 1980 (It's not a LESS fic, despite what the character list might imply -- it's Jily, among other things. Figured I'd mention it given the kind of fics I usually read).

** linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure)

Harry (Victoria) doesn't even try to play quidditch, and is totally uninterested in it. I don't think she even flies a broom once in the story, and I think is somewhat afraid to try.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** Yes, let's take the only thing which he was really good in canon.\\
If you compensate this with something else then ok. In many fics where he has other strengths or is a time traveler he doesn't play quiditch and that's ok. But if you take that away from him (and thus a large part of the story revolveting around quiditch ) then his main ability is his shitty luck. I understand your point and I think fics where he is just good at everything are just as bad, there has to be a balance.\\
Take one, give him something else.\\
It has to be story interesting, I think that's how many ideas for fics arise.

*** I take this as a challenge, I'm gonna make his main ability in my next fic just plain shitty luck. I will compensate his quidditch skills for something else, not sure what but you have inspired me
