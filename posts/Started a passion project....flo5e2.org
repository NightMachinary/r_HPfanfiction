Hey I recently started writing again, and I am doing a post Hogwarts fic that may require some honest opinions... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13526601/1/Moral-of-the-Story][Here]] is the story on FF and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23224252/chapters/55602916#workskin][here]] is it on AO3, would I be able to get some honest feedback? Thank you in advance!

EDIT: it's a Hermione based fic, it's 3 years after she completes her education at Hogwarts. McGonagall invites her back to become the new professor of History of Magic. After a major life change the year before she is anxious to start a newer life.

PTSD, mentions of self harm, unhealthy coping mechanisms to warn you. It's a slow burn romance as well. Hermione/Neville and Hermione/Draco pairings.


** Ok, having done a quick read, I'll throw in my 2 pence...

Hermione and Neville wouldn't have greeted each other with full names, for one little tidbit. Call me a perfectionist, but when 2 people who have gone through what they did, well, they would have just used normal names or even shortened names, like anyone else would who sees a friend after a long absence...

I'm also a fan of longer chapters. I'm going to enjoy a read that goes on for a while between breaks, and even fills in what the characters do with their lives in the aftermath of something as big as walking away from the altar, and even going into the blowup of Molly finding out why, because she's as much of a mom to all three of the trio, along with her own, and you can imagine her reaction to why...

It's just my thoughts, but it's still your story... I'll enjoy reading it as you expand on it...

*** I was going to Have all the in between revealed later on as I go! I have not forgot to include that. I'll rearrange how I have it laid out for sure, I agree with you. Didn't think about it that way, I was worried it might be too boring if I built too much up to where I wanted the story.

Great feedback thank you!

** Why don't you tell people what it is about, warnings, and genre instead of using this method.
