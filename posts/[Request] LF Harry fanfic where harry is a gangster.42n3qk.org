I read this one few years ago, in which Harry is basically a bad mouthed gangster. There was also a scene during GoF where Harry gets into a knife-fight with Voldemort.


** There is one with Harry a bigshot in a Japanese gang.. I can't spell the Japanese word for mafia/ganster type stuff, but yeah. Decent story.

** I would thoroughly recommend Incurable by Warholhp. I think it's a really good read but I know not everybody likes Harry/Draco. Harry's not exactly a gangster but is a violent individual in this story.

Summary: Non-Magic AU. Harry Potter was not sent to Hogwarts at age 11 as his parents intended. Instead, when an altercation with his uncle turns violent, he is sent to St. Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys. But four years later, he has the opportunity to attend Hogwarts, where he learns to live a life he never thought possible for himself. H/D and a bit of mentor-Snape. Genres: Angst, AU, First Time, Fluff, General, Hurt/Comfort, Romance, Smut, Non-Magical Rating: NC-17 Warnings: Adult Language, Angst, OC, Sexual Content, Violence, Hurt/Comfort, Non-Magical
