I had finished a good fanfic,when I thought about this....why am I reading fanfics??? This was a quite interesting question,I know some of the reasons why I read fanfics but what are the rest and basically, I wanted to know your opinion for a new perspective....


** Because I prefer to deeply immerse myself in a few fictional universes rather than going through many of them (watching a different series every week wouldn't be something I enjoy).

And when you finish a good book/series/movie, you feel a sense of sadness that that's it. Fanfic is the counter to this since it is more content in a universe I like.

And I generally prefer stories focusing on characters I can relate to. That's why I can't stand the Big Weasley family fics since as a single child, having so many people around 24/7 would be a nightmare for me.

** a) I love the HP universe

b) sometimes the original story doesn't go the way I'd like it to go so I just read a fanfic that appeals to me

*** Exactly! With the tags on AO3 I know what happens and can emotionally prepare myself for it (I'm not getting thrown into a Major Character Death without warning!) I can also include or exclude specific tropes, whereas with a book I might get halfway through before being hit with a surprise trope twist I didn't sign up for.

** Less emotionally exhausting.

Hear me out. I already am attached to characters so i dont need to develop attachments with every story, unlike in books. With every new book and tv show and movie i need to spend emotional energy learning to like characters.

Also i think because fanfic isnt commercialized, its not generic. The author isn't trying to grab a lot of attention aka money as a form of salary or to get an opportunity to keep writing. A very specific trope or plot idea can gain a following but by publishing standards not have enough monetary support to be worth publishing.

Lol i have thought about this a lot and thought of writing fucking researched papers on this even though i am not a lit major.

** Mostly because I really enjoy the world of HP. The lore and magic and fantasy. It is so deep and rich and there's so much you can do with it.

People are so damn clever. The stories are fantastic. I want to know more about Sirius's family. I want to know more about Remus and what he did in the in-between years. I want to learn more about Dementors and boggarts. I just want more!!

*** I deeply love the HP universe, and you're right about us writers being able to do alot with it. I'm having quite a bit of fun.

However, I feel I must disagree with your point of it being very deep. I find the HP universe to be very superficial. There are very few things that are explored in any depth. Just so many things introduced, that, when the story is over, we're hardly any more knowledgeable than we were in the beginning.

Now, don't get me wrong, that's completely fine for a children's novel, but to me, the HP series moved from being a children's fiction at the end of The Chamber of Secrets, and ends life as a full blown adult fiction, with the Deathly Hallows.

I need more in the way of world building. I didn't realize any of this until I read the books again as an adult, and found something missing.

Having said that, I do love HP.

**** No no this is the thing you're completely right!! The books are very superficial. They imply a big world but don't go near exploring it. It is rich but jesus the books barely show the surface.

It's a kids book, so fine.

But there's so much you can do with it! The Marauders are a key example. A werewolf, a disowned aristocrat, a future traitor and a murdered father who marries a woman that dispised him their whole childhood. What a wild group of people!!! What a whacko group of people that is!! I want to hear more about that! How the hell can you gloss over that!?

Little things like exploring what a Dementor is, what a Boggart is. That's some big existential shit right there and JK barely touches it. The moral ethics of Horcruxes. The entire first war or Grindlewalds war.

There's so many waay more interesting stories than the cannon HP story you could explore. And thats what I love about fanfiction is they take this superficial world and just flesh it out. Give it the justice it deserves.

** I just love it. You get to make your own pick of what tropes you enjoy. Like, want time travel? A badass MC? Harry joining the dark side? No summary of a book will ever tell you that or warn you from a major character death. You can see your favorite characters interact in a different way, I mean alone the Marauder fics out there... I always wanted to know how they interacted when they were young while reading HP and thanks to fanfic it's possible. Also fix it fics. I live for those.

The funny thing is I stumbled upon fanfics when I was 12 or whatever and listened to a podfic on youtube in which James and Lily Potter get together. It was rather bad and I rember a Mary Sue OC getting together with Sirius in the background.

Back then I couldn't have even imagined what path this small 20 min. Audiobook would lead me down.

I've seen everything and more.

** Seeing a hundred points of view on a story lets you dig deeper into it. Consider the impact of books that challenged a classic, like "Gone With the Wind" being answered with "The Wind Done Gone", told from the perspective of some of the slaves. Or "Wide Sargasso Sea" in response to "Jane Eyre". Telling someone else's version of events makes you rethink what the original story told you, maybe doubting it, or maybe agreeing with it but better understanding it. Or a mixture.

Fan fiction does that. It can immerse you in a story, but it can also help you to analyse what you're reading. Seeing so many versions of events encourages you to pick them apart and recognise which parts are good, which parts need work, because they're side by side with others that do things differently.

I read one in the past few days where Petunia died in an accident without telling Vernon about magic. He raised Harry somewhat better than in canon, yet he still favoured Dudley more, and remained awkward with emotions, leaving Harry still feeling left out. But this Vernon still felt a duty toward Harry, and made some effort to be involved in his life, flawed though it was. Comparing and contrasting with canon was definitely educational, in a way that would be hard to achieve with a wholly original story. I doubt that it would have been very interesting as a stand-alone story, especially being less than 40k words; probably not publishable. But as a fanfiction, it worked, and had valuable lessons to teach.

And then, of course, some fanfics are just genuinely brilliant stories that are enjoyable in their own right.

** Harry Potter was the first "fictional universe" that I really bought into. I know more about it than I know about a lot of things. I feel connected to the characters and the settings, I want to learn more. When I start a new story, I don't need to put mental effort into learning what they look like, the setting is vivid in my mind. It means that the story becomes more about the plot and it's easy to get invested in a story.

** I love the HP universe, forever will, and fan fiction is full of people who love it, too. And, wonderfully, those people are creative as hell. I've read fics that got me so lost in the magical world that I felt the same way I did the first time I read the books, a feeling I never thought I could get back. Fan fiction keeps that 'oh my god, this is incredible' sensation going indefinitely.

** So many reasons:

1. Love the HP series and want more of it
2. Love the imagination of the fanfic writers whose world building blows my mind
3. Love the theorizing of magic when you get to see how it would operate in different contexts

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

Because it is self-published, it has not been censored or vetted by publishers who may consider some content boring or trite or not cool.

As a result, when authors put their own experiences into the stories without any limits, it gives me an understanding of human nature. For example, how would one cope with PTSD realistically? What are people's real experiences of childhood abuse, a pogrom or online dating. How does people navigate their sexuality? What are people anxious about?

[In my published fiction reading experience, people usually commit suicide or become numb after trauma; fanfic shows the healing process. Similarly, women are just badass nowadays in regular fics; I like the more complex characterizations in fanfic, especially for obscure canon characters]

Also, crack fanfic and pranks are the funniest. I haven't seen such fun and elaborate humour setups in regular fiction.

** I love reading in general and Harry Potter is my childhood love. With age, I've started to realise I can't seem to relate to cannon much and some of the stories I found made me realise how much more could be done with the universe and how many beautiful stories can come from it.

Now, I'm hooked.

** With novels, there is a lot of variation in writing styles and info dumps, and they make it difficult to listen to, while fanfics can be easily sorted by tags, and once I finish one, I can look at who else liked it, what the author wrote, and what they like and branch out into finding more reads. It is also easier to find a story that fits what I want to read when I can search a term such as, “Severus Snape Time Travels,” instead of looking for a book that covers the psychological effects of someone traveling back in time, seeing what they were right and wrong about, and grappling with what to change.
