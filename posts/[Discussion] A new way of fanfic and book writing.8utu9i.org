We have an interesting idea, which me and my team are currently working on. The idea is to allow the community to create books and worlds/universes around these books by themselves. The books will be written chapter-by-chapter, and the community will vote to choose the direction they go. The process will go like this:

- An idea of a book is announced, with a brief description
- Once enough community members are interested in the idea, a competition for writing the first chapter is started
- Any community member can apply his or her version of the first chapter of the book, and the community then votes to choose the best one
- Next chapters are written in the same way, taking into account the events of the previous chapters
- Once the book is finished, it goes through an editing process to correct the writing styles of different authors
- Successful books are sold and the money is split between the contributing community members, proportional to their contribution

We will also make tools which will allow creating universes around these books, and make the process more engaging and fun for the community.

The alpha product is planned to be live next month or so, and it will be based on HP universe, since all of us are big HP fans! So, effectively, it will give HP fans a new way of creating fanfic, while becoming the backbone of this new huge thing.

I would like to hear your opinion about this idea, and see where it can get us.


** DLP did this a few years back. It never got past chapter 2. I'd identify the problem as:

1. Authors get attached to their preferred story direction and drop out when the story goes in a direction they dislike.

2. The voters' preferences do not line up with those of the authors, accelerating the process of author alienation.

I mean, I have to agree, planning exists for a reason. It's super hard to be fully aware of things like foreshadowing and theme when more hands are in the plot. I've tried 'co-authoring' things outside of fanfiction and it's an utterly miserable experience to me. I can't imagine doing it with multiple people.

As a whole the OP would have to convince me why I should bother when I know I'm perfectly capable of writing my own stories and thinking of my own plots.

And sure community vote is great and all, but..well...I can tell you the way the community will vote and that there's almost a 100% chance that is not going to be where I want to take the story. Christ had I done that on LdS I shudder to think of the final product.

*** Could you please tell what DLP is? :)

Well, we want to target people who will know beforehand that this is not a usual book writing, and that they should be ready for not having full control over how the book goes.

** You can't set it in the HP Universe and sell it, splitting any profits. That is copyright infringement and Warner Brothers will swiftly put a stop to it.

*** Our alpha-product will be based on HP universe, but this is just the test product. Later when we get enough community members, we will kickstart writing of new original books. Sure, fanfiction books can not be monetized by any means.This is why we are planning to monetize only the original books, not based on any existing universe.

**** All I can say is best of luck. There tends to be a reason books written by multiple authors don't go Well, but you never know.

As a writer, it's not something I would be interested in because I like having control over my own story and characters. But there are authors out there that lile to collaborate so best of luck.

***** Yeah, years ago I was part of a HP fan fiction Yahoo group and we tried doing a round robin story. I think we got to like 3 or 4 sections before everyone lost interest.

** This sounds like something that is a good idea on paper, but a disaster in practice.

First, writers tend to be more creative and (arguably) connected to their works and vision. I know I am. Communal creativity is not really a good idea when applied; there is a reason you don't have many great works of art that are painted by a team of people.

In my own experience, what it usually has to devolves into is one of two things: either a hierarchy is established where one person has control and can make all the decisions and decides who does what, or authors argue and compete until its a game of last man standing, and it just becomes a solo fic.

And besides which, this sounds like nothing short of attempting to create a literary equivalent of Frankenstein's monster. You have a mish-mash of multiple writing styles and agendas that people are arguing for. Even if people stuck through it, I can only imagine the narrative would flow like honey or molasses.

*** Two-person collaboratives work pretty well. One example I can think of is the Expanse series by James SA Corey which is a pesuodym for Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck who have published works on their own. I know in manga/anime fandom there are creative collectives, but I don't know exactly how those work. Beyond that though, I agree it would be very difficult to make something in this way without some parties getting out of sorts and quitting. We've all done group projects that sucked!

**** There's also Good Omens, which was a collaboration between Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Of course, with those two names attached there was already a guaranteed audience. And, despite the difference in genre, their writing styles were pretty well compatible.

***** How could I forget that one? Such a fantastic book. One of the highlights of my trip to Bermuda was finding a paperback of it in a used bookstore in Hamilton. Excellent re-read on the cruise and I left it in the ship's library for the next person. :D

** I look forward to reading the first story about Lord Harry James Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor, who gets top marks in all his subjects at school and lives in a huge mansion with Hermione Granger-Potter, Ginny Weasley-Black, Luna Lovegood-Peverell, Daphne Greengrass-Slytherin, and Susan Bones-Gryffindor. I'm sure it'll be great.
