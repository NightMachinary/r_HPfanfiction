Hello Everyone!

In the books and films, there are lots of fun little extra 'cultural details' as well as tiny little details which make the wizarding world feel unique and distinct. Examples of these are;

- Moving stained glass windows (Goblet of Fire- Film)

- Magical bubble bath (Goblet of Fire- Books)

- Gravity Resistant Trees (Goblet of Fire- Film)

- Animal Sweets (Prisoner of Azkaban- Film)

- Flying Memo's (Order of the Phoenix- Book)

- Wizarding Watches (Deathly Hallows- Book)

None of these things are relevant to the plot, but they add vital flavour to the books and films. I was wondering if anyone could help me with finding more examples of this sort of thing for the fic I am currently working on?

Thank you :)


** I always liked Molly's clock. It first shows up in the Chamber of Secrets book, though I'm going to give points to the movie since that's where the hands for each of the Weasley first shows up the OotP book incorporates it later, but in CoS book the clock is more for indicating chores, and only has one hand; can't remember if it shows up anywhere else). In the same chapter, self-shuffling cards are mentioned, so that's neat.

*** Ooh, thank you for the tip about the cards- I shall add it to my list!

** I think looking at the magical items/enchanted items list on the wiki might be a good starting point for the canon ones. However, for a fanfic, I think it adds more to it when you come up with some yourself!

A good way to do that, IMO, is to think of a common item in life - and then think about how it could change up to be magical. An easy example there would be the canon newspapers - the magical 'twist' to them is with the moving pictures, but that little change is enough to make it stand out. Another would be quills - having one that automatically writes down what's spoken is another way to make it magical and stand out.

That doesn't have to be functional, either - part of the whimsical feeling from the HP world comes from those sorts of items/magic that /aren't/ functional or the most effective.

But overall, I think you get the most bang for your buck in these sorts of things from those that feel both normal & strange/exotic in the same item.

** I actually found the first Fantastical Beasts movie pretty good for this, since it shows adult wizards in their home, going about their daily life, and just using magic for everything, all the time, without thinking about it.

** I know they're not supposed to do magic without wands, but I always appreciated the shot of the wizard stirring his tea with wandless magic while reading a book (prisoner of Azkaban movie, I think? In the leaky cauldron def.). It would be so handy.

That being said, I have so many ideas:

I like it when fics include enchanted hairbrushes. There's a new hair drying brush IRL that looks witchy. Imagine being able to run a brush through your hair and it's perfectly dry and shiny and styled!

Charmable nail polish. Like you paint your nails with the polish and then use your wand to charm it to the color/design you'd like. (Premade nail art designs sold separately).

Hats that keep your hair in perfect condition for when you're flying, potioneering, etc.

Fabric for clothes and upholstery charmed to move, shine, change color, etc.

There's no trash system. You fill up a bin and vanish or burn the contents.

It's also important to remember that in the books it's stated that most people don't like to apparate. I like to imagine different landing spots for brooms in places like Diagon alley.

I don't believe it's from canon, but I've seen several fics describe the bin at Grimmauld as "eating" whatever is discarded in it, usually punctuated by a belch after chewing and swallowing noises.
