You wake up and find yourself as Harry (or Harriette should you prefer) right after the battle. You have Harry's powers (meaning you can do magic), the Eldar wand, his gold, everything and no-one seems to suspect anything as long as you won't mess up.

However, mentally and in memory it is *you*. Only things you know about Harry is from canon and what can be reasonably inferred.

What will you do?


** Find Hermione, tell her you felt a spell hit you during the battle but did nothing. After waking up, you can no longer remember any spell, as if you have forgotten how to do it.

Have her and the teachers help you "relearn" magic. Study a lot harder than Harry did. Study to become a cursebreaker/adventurer and go travelling the world.

Explore tombs, try and find atlantis. Learn magic from different species. Meet and cuddle with as many magical creatures as possible. Use magic to invent a spacecraft and travel space. Terraform mars. Learn to make a philosophers stone to become immortal. (Space is vast!)

** Retire... Become a recluse for a few years to learn things about HPverse better. Then come back, try to stay in background, meet a sweet gal and date her (or continue with ginny if she still has the feelings), raise a family and so on.

I'll try to be friends with hermione but I know I'll fail. Harry sees her as a sister but I have a huge crush on her. She won't see me like that and loves Ron, so I'll be selfish and stay away. I can practically picture many fanfics like that xD.

Speaking of which, can someone recommend me some good fics (completed and above 100k) with the plot of Harry secretly loving hermione but hermione not knowing (she might love him subconsciously too) and they finally end up together. (Ron and hermione didn't work out and Ron is ok with Harry and hermione dating)

** My different behaviour and memory gaps immediately clue Ron and Hermione in. Probably nobody buys "I'm actually the soul/memories of a fan transplanted from a universe where you're all fiction", so they assume that either Harry's experiences drove him mad, or I've been possessed. I probably end up in the St. Mungo's permanent spell damage ward with Lockhart and the Longbottoms for company.

If not, the first thing I do is break-up (or reconfirm the existing break-up) with Ginny. Because a) mentally at least I'd be in my thirties and she's about sixteen, and b) I'm literally not the person she knew and loved- from a certain perspective, I'm the guy who (inadvertently) killed him.

Making an SI scenario that is realistic without being depressing is really hard.

** Hmm, now that I think about it, if the Elder Wand recognizes me as its master, that has some fairly significant implications. It implies that some part of Harry, in terms of mind, soul, or magic, is still there, inhabiting the same body as my mind, for the wand to recognize me as "Harry".

Unless my displacing Harry's consciousness with my own counts as "defeating" Harry and transfers wand mastery. That's possible.

Either way, I curse Harry's memory for announcing he was the wand's master in a crowded great hall, and putting a gigantic target on my back.

** First things First... Round up all the Death Eaters and force vows from them to either no longer push Pureblood Supremacy or to leave the shores of Britain and not return for 5 generations.

You fight and sacrifice and you win the war, only to lose the peace.

Afterwards you reconcile with the Goblins and then hide yourself away while "retraining" your magic. Then you can re-emerge and travel and discover all the wonders of the Magical World
