By courtship I mean do you think that there are magics that help a couple work out if they are compatible and could work out in a relationship long term?

And do you think that there are magics that help with marriage ? Like a happy Marragie potion that both people take that smooths over any rough edges in the relationship?

The reason I ask is because all the marriages we see in the Harry Potter books seem to be pretty happy and one even lasted Hundreds of year(the Flamels)


** It really depends on your point of view. Love Potions are pretty much what you call "Happy Marriage Potions". The magical world has a pretty relaxed attitude about them, despite the fact that Love Potions are just a nice term for mind controlling rape drugs. They are sold in a joke shop for fucks sake.

As for the relationships in the books, Rowling cannot write romance. Almost no build up, little onscreen evidence that the couples would work out and creepy obsessions (James, Ginny, Snape) are supposedly signs of TRUE LOVE^{^{TM}} . The woman can't write romance, simple as that.

To be fair, these things are fairly typical of teen romances, where it is common for:

1. The relationship to be based almost entirely on physical attraction and social status (people dating because it's cool/expected).

2. Very early declarations of true love.

3. Deciding that a certain person is perfect for you without ever really having spoken to them much (creepy obsessions, more charitably described as a crush).

Like, people say that Harry/Ginny came out of nowhere. Not only is that just false (she'd been flagged as having a crush on him for years beforehand), but it's also off the point. In real life relationships also come out of nowhere. She's hot, he's powerful, and they have friends in common. That's more of a foundation than most IRL relationships have XD

Teen romances are the keyword here. Yet all of these "teen romances" turned into marriages while the people involved have very little in common yet a lot of conflict potential (at least what we see in the books). It would probably make for a good fling, but lifetime commitment?

**** IÂ´m not sure if Ginny is hot i mean attractive sure but hot is more something like Fleur while Ginny has great legs and most likely a good ass, from what we know witches are overall more attractive in comparison to there non magical counter part maybe because of better beauty product or magic just does not allows acne etc. I believe Ginny would count as attractive for a witch, but hot would mean she is in the same league as Fleur(part Veela enough said.), Daphne, Susan and Luna(Luna is kinda hot because of her looks remind of a high elf who most people if not all can agree are most of the time hot.)

***** Only three female characters are ever said to be particularly attractive in the books: Fleur, Ginny, and Cho.

There is no "league" containing Daphne, Susan, and Luna. The first two are barely mentioned in the books, and certainly never described physically. And Luna is never said to be particularly attractive (indeed many consider her odd looking).

I'd add Padma and Parvati Patil to that list, as Harry described them as very pretty several times, and Dean complained that Harry and Ron got the best-looking girls in their year as dates.

Have you read the books she writes as Robert Galbraith? There's some pretty good UST in those. I wouldn't say she /can't/ write romance, but that she /doesn't/ in the context of HP.

i mean, they have love potions. People intentionally using love potions so they like partner more is probably quite common in the wizarding world. Its also one of the few uses that would justify love potions being legal.

why is alcohol legal? because its way to easy to produce to stop the supply and people have a demand for it.

and that matter how? if people only use it on themselves and not on others, it would be no different than other mind altering drugs.

we also know that a normal love potion only works for 24 hours, doesent affect the memory and is forbidden at Hogwarts and probably other places.

***** Um, the usual point of love potions in canon /is/ to use on others. Because using it on yourself would be rather redundant unless you're trying to make yourself become infatuated with someone, which is a rather... odd circumstance.

****** Unless it's an arranged marriage of which you never wanted to be a part. If your parents invited a classmate's parents over, along with that classmate, and said "This is your future spouse. Best get used to the idea.", and you feel it's your obligation to marry this person for the family name, you'll do whatever you need to in order to make that work. If that means putting a few drops of love potion in your drink every morning because you can't stand that person, then it's for familial obligations.

** Fics written by Ellory show elaborate courtship rituals the Purebloods follow in order to find the loves of their lives. The author's works are massively AU explorations of this 'Pureblood Culture'.

For instance, linkffn(Of Caresses and Constellations by Ellory) features a fem!Harry and Draco who bond over hairbrushing. It sounds silly written that way so just read the fic to see if you might like it.
