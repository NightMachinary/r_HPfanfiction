Some authors like to use this (or even older starting ages) to get around having to write about young children. It's an /"easy"/ way to write more mature characters and make romance/sex less icky, while still getting to start in Year 1 with the Philosopher's Stone.

I always get the feeling that it's never really thought through and it has become one of my pet peeves. I'll list just some of my thoughts about *consequences* below. Please bear with me and just tell me if I'm being stupid:

Assuming a starting age of 13, does Harry start Hogwarts in 1993? Did Voldemort still try to steal the Stone in 1991? Was the school closed in 1992 because of a Basilisk? Is there a resurrected Diarymort running around and who died? Or maybe everyone was just born two years earlier? That wouldn't work, because then Voldemort was also born two years earlier relative to Harry and would probably try to steal the stone in 1989.

Maybe it's only Harry who's born two years earlier? So no Hermione, Ron, etc. for the first two years? But how would that work? James and Lily would have had him while still in school (they have to stay in school until 19/20, if they want to sit for their NEWTs). That's strange... so no Godric's Hollow. Did Voldemort try to murder Harry in Hogwarts? Or was Harry with relatives at the time? Is Harry even The Boy Who Lived?

In actuality, if James and Lily both had to stay in school until they were 19, they probably would have had a child later in life, which means Harry was maybe born in 1982 and starts Hogwarts at age 13 in 1995? So is Harry a first year now when the tournament happens? Is there an almost three year older Hermione running around and Sirius dead by Dementor's kiss? To be fair our Harry would really never exist either, because it wouldn't have been the same sperm+egg during conception, but alright, that's a golden opportunity to write about a ginger Harry who hates Quidditch.

Then of course there's the thought that Hogwarts is pretty central to the history of Magical Britain. Everyone being two years (or whatever age) older when starting Hogwarts should have wide repercussions: What if Tom Riddle freaked out at the age of 12 and set the orphanage on fire and died in the process? Maybe he wouldn't become a Dark Lord if he came in contact with Hogwarts at an older age? I can't imagine the story of the Marauders, Lily and Snape playing out exactly the same either if they are all a bit more mature. James would probably start "getting his act together" much earlier in their school life. Would Snape still join the Death Eaters if he wasn't antagonized so much by James and Sirius? Would James and Lily even get together?

It's easy to see the potential cumulative effects of this when going back generations: The circumstances of meeting people when they are two years older would change future relationships and marriages. Some people who were friends at 11 might be antagonists at 13 and the other way around. Really /none/ of the named characters (except for the Founders and maybe the Patils) have any right to exist in a "Hogwarts starts at 13" AU.

*TL;DR*: "Everyone is older, but everything else stays the same" is really kinda nonsense. There's probably a few things I've missed or gotten wrong, but the general idea seems solid. *These kind of fics should be some of the most radically different AUs instead of canon rehashes where everyone is just older.*


** I agree with most of this, but---

You fail to account for the fact that he too would have started Hogwarts at 13, which would account for the difference --- if he started Hogwarts two years "later", he would have become a Dark Lord two years later too, gotten defeated in 1983, etc.

*** Yeah, but I get into that later... I don't think it's very reasonable to assume "starting two years later at Hogwarts" would just shift everyone's life two years back. Actually I think that's completely ridiculous, so I didn't want to get into it too much.

** Most authors in fanfiction /cannot/ write children well. They either are:

- *Too serious* - Thinking in adult manners. Almost every fanfic involving "pureblood tradition/families" hits this one.
- *Too horny* - Children at 11 years old still think the other sex have cooties.
- *Too logical* - Even smart children are not capable of plotting out serious plots. "I'm going to invite my rival to the trophy room for a duel and then not show up" is about the extent of 11 year old plotting.
- *Too rebellious* - Young kids tend to be trusting of adults. They don't tend to think they "know better" until their teenage years.

Thankfully, most authors also don't have a plot that requires the characters to be young children.

If an author wants to fudge some dates forward/backwards in order to not have to write children I won't fault them. I personally think it's a decent workaround. It sure beats reading about 11 year old Harry getting a boner thinking about /insert girl/. Or 11 year old Harry immediately thinking Dumbledore is stupid and seeing the correct way to train/kill Voldemort.

Another workaround is simply to pick up Hogwarts after the 3rd or 4th year. However this is not so workable if you put people in different houses. If you want to explore Harry in Hufflepuff with Hermione in Slytherin and Ron in Ravenclaw... you kinda have to have the sorting hat scene.

--------------

The stations of cannon in book 1 works well with 13 year olds as well as 11 year olds. But doing it with 13 year olds gives you the ability to have serious/horny/logical/rebel children and have it not be so out of place.

It is really easy to fudge dates to make it work. Shift everything and everyone backwards 2 years per generation. Rowling does not use concrete dates in her plots with the exception of Grindelwald (done to match WW2). And that one is far enough back that an added 4 to 6 years to the remaining cast does not matter. ^{[1]}

Also change the age of wizarding majority from 17 to 19... or even 18.^{[2]}

--------------

[1] Dumbledore and Grindelwald are "old" enough that fudging 4-6 years does not impact plot at all.

[2] This fixes the Triwizard plot (assuming you are still on canon rails).
