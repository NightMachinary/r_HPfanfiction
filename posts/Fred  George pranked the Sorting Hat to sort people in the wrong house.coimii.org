It's a humor fanficiton, Fred and George somehow pranked the Sorting Hat to sort everyone in Harry's year to a wrong house.

I think it's an old fanfiction, but has been reposted to AO3. It's a short series <50k words, and I think it only finished the first year.

  The Sorting Hat has sorted thousands of students in the course of its life. If it makes a mistake or two, who's to say it's wrong? Certainly not Fred or George Weasley.
