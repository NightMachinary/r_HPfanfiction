** Hmm, you seem to be posting this question similarly in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8u1b0f/locking_for_any_fic_where_harry_lives_with_it_is/][here]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8up0as/looking_for_any_fanfic_similar_even_slight_to/][here]], and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8v6xbq/looking_for_a_wrong_bwl_fic_with_hg_pairing/][here]]...Sounds like someone is still in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6pkhj2/the_three_stages_of_fanfiction_evolution_your/][Stage 1-2]] transition. Don't worry, you will work it out of your system eventually. Anyway:
