I've been an avid fan of HP since 2007 maybe and Fanfiction since 2009, and I've read way too many fics to remember every single one. As soon as I see a fic mention going to Gringotts it just gets so hard to continue, no matter the trope or plot. Something about the “May your gold/coffers flow” and “may the blood of your enemies flow”, etc, just grinds my gears.

Not to say there aren't great fics out there with these concepts but overall I've noticed a pattern of excessively descriptive scenes of inheritances and real estate and obscure laws... is it just me?

I know HP is a series about Witchcraft and Wizardry and I know Fanfiction is literally a product of our imagination but I imagine plausibility should be a factor in the fics.

EDIT: definitely don't want to attack any authors! I think every fanfic does their part in keeping this fandom alive and this is my own preference. Overall it seems like the goblin trope within the HP world is at first glance feasible (testing lineages and the amount of gold in vaults), just tends to be a bit over done by authors for plots' sake.

“Playing idiot wizard bingo. This is a /bank/ - we do not keep track of the wizarding worlds inbred familial ties, we do not have ‘rituals' to ‘unblock your core' whatever that means, and while we can give you a list of transactions made with your vault - which look to be solely covering your Hogwarts supplies since the vault fell under your control in 1981 - /it does not matter to us who accesses your vault if they have lawful and rightful access/. If there is nothing else I have clients with intelligence to get to.”

*** From [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12999698/10/Scribble-Pad]], in which a typical indy!Harry fic is an in-universe book about Harry's adventures, and he gets some wild ideas:

#+begin_quote
  "Greetings, noble goblin," Harry told him. "May your gold always flow."

  All of the Weasleys and the goblin gave Harry a strange and confused look, and he blushed and lowered his head. That didn't go off so well.

  "What was that about?" Ron whispered.

  "I was trying to be polite," Harry said.

  Percy shook his head: "Goblins are practical beings, Mr. Potter. Excessive politeness annoys them more often than not."

  That was a surprise to Harry. That greeting had come from Ginny's book. He knew a lot of it wasn't accurate, but he had thought they would get basic facts about the magical world right.

  Sufficiently chastised, he played it more cautiously with what he really wanted to ask. The Harry in the book had got a lot of help here, but now, he wasn't so sure. When the cart came to a halt, he said, "Um, excuse me, Mr...?"

  "Gornuk," the goblin grunted.

  "Mr. Gornuk, I was wondering if...Gringotts has any legal services."

  Gornuk looked at Harry like he was stupid. "And why would you ask that Mr. Potter?" he demanded.

  "Well, it's just that my muggle relatives are really awful, and I'm pretty some of the stuff they've done to me is illegal, and I was wondering---"

  "No, Mr. Potter, I meant why would you ask that of us? I would think you would want to take something like that up with your Department of Magical Law Enforcement."

  Harry wasn't sure what to say to that. He really hadn't expected a flat-out dismissal. "I, uh, was just wondering if there was anything you could do---"

  "And why on earth would you wonder that?"

  "Um...If you had any special legal services for your customers---"

  "Mr. Potter," the goblin said in an aggravated tone, "we run a bank. We handle money. We are goblins, not wizards. Even if we were in the business of law enforcement, which we are not, and even if we took any interest at all in the private affairs of wizards, which we don't, we wouldn't have the jurisdiction to punish offences committed in the muggle world, now, would we?"

  Harry was speechless. His entire view of goblins from the book was turned on its head. The Harry in the book had had the goblins go after the brutal owners of the orphanage for him straightaway and sentence them to a life of hard labour in their gold mines, and here, Gornuk was just looking at him like he was from Mars. But he was right: why would the goblins get involved in something like that? And why would wizards let them? "I...didn't really think of that, Mr. Gornuk," he said awkwardly.

  "Ugh. Wizards," Gornuk griped. "Just where did you get these wild ideas, Mr. Potter?"

  "Well, there was this book---" Harry started, but Gornuk immediately started growling.

  "A bit of free advice, wizard---and listen well because that is something extremely rare in Gringotts. Most wizards know nothing of how goblins operate. They make no effort to learn our culture, and they would rather concoct their own fantasies from whole cloth than actually talk to us. You should be cautious in trusting an actual history book about goblins, let alone an admitted fiction."

  Harry was taken aback. He didn't realise that even a wizard who wrote fiction would be so sloppy about something like that. "Oh...Sorry," he said sheepishly. "I'm kind of new to the magical world."

  "Hmpf," Gornuk said. "I will not begrudge you, Mr. Potter, this time, because you are young, inexperienced, and muggle-raised, and you have been misled by an absurd book. However, I warn you that you are only the latest in a long line of wizards who think that if they spout off some supposed secret goblin greeting or because their great-grandfather was nice to us once, that we'll suddenly fall all over ourselves to be their friends. In the real world, that's a good way to 'accidentally' get redirected to the wrong department, or worse."

  "Oh..." Harry said nervously. Considering that some of the 'departments' had dragons in them, that didn't sound like a very good thing. Although wizards surely wouldn't have much tolerance for goblins actually hurting wizards in the bank. Right? Well, he decided it wasn't worth the risk to find out.

  However, when they got to his vault, he realised he did have one more question. More carefully than last time, he said, "Mr. Gornuk, do you know if I have any...other vaults here?"

  "Other vaults?" the goblin said suspiciously. "Are you a business owner, Mr. Potter?"

  "No."

  "Then almost certainly not. And I can't imagine why you would need them."

  "Well, there's only gold in here. I was wondering what happened to my parents' stuff."

  "I would suspect it's in storage with your Ministry, wizard. What you see is what you have."

  "Oh. And if I had any distant relatives who, er, died in the war or something?" Harry said carefully.

  "Ministry records. In the unlikely event that you find something, bring us notarised documentation, and we'll release it to you."

  "Alright. Thanks, Mr. Gornuk."

  Gornuk rolled his eyes at the courtesy, but that one really was just Harry trying to be polite. Maybe he would take up his questions with the Ministry, like Gornuk said, he thought. Deciding he would ask Mr. Weasley about whom he could write a letter when he got the chance, he successfully got out of Gringotts without annoying any more goblins, and he and the Weasleys rejoined with Hermione's family to do their shopping.

They also predate the Ministry and seem to operate independently from it.

It's a trope that makes sense if you apply it right.

The having secret rituals however is totally out there.

In fact, Bellatrix Lestrange one of the most bigoted of them all, trusted Gringotts to hold one the Horcruxes.

Umbridge may call them creatures and everything, but she never implies they were thieves.

Voldemort was the only one to attack them because he wanted the Sword back and knew he had to take it by force.

So even pureblood supremacists may hem and haw but in the end all their gold and valuables are in the hands of the goblins, what's the difference of letting them validate bloodlines that will have access to that gold?

***** They trust them with their GOLD, their money, their valuables.

If they thought they were unreliable they wouldn't leave their money with them. Throughout all canon, no goblin was ever accused of being a thief.

Wizards wouldn't trust themselves with their bloodlines(if such a thing was needed in canon), the Ministry manages to screw up a lot of things and it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility for line theft to be practiced.

I am talking of the possibility of Goblins being True Neutral as if one side has the majority there's no way to know if the heirs from the other side would be denied their inheritances. The same way the Ministry could freeze or monitor specific Vaults, or even confiscate them. But Goblins serve both sides as long as they aren't attacked.

The Lestranges all got life sentences and left no heirs, in this case the government would confiscate their assets, and yet 16 years later it's all there, including the Soul Jar.

And not all Wizards are racist assholes, I would guess not even all Death Eaters are racist, they are just assholes and only want to kill and torture(doesn't make it better).

I'll admit I've used the concept of wizarding aristocracy in my own fics (because the political heirarchy isn't properly explained in canon and I needed something as I was basing the ministry on the two tier way the Muggle UK does politics), but the idea that an eleven year old suddenly controlled half of the magical government is just, nah. Also the tropes of the kids who are normal in canon suddenly start bowing to each other and saying "well met" and other bollocks like they're in a Georgian novel, and Ron is inevitably discarded because he's just too stupid and common. Argh.

See also the fics where the trip to gringotts takes about five chapters and three of those are just /lists of properties and random "magical inheritance" things/ all of which have been stolen by Dumbledore.

Like, dude, fuck. I think the author had some problems, honestly.

I kinda want to read a fic where the ICW fucking politically annihilates wizarding britain as soon as they hear about that shit. Like, ICW troops occupying the ministry and every major wizarding space, including Hogwarts, suspending and annulling all political positions held by citizens of that country, starting an account of all wizards and their conditions to detect and free any such slaves.

** Helpful Goblins is basically a series of plausible enough conclusions taken too far on a slippery slope.

We know Goblins handle banks. In the Wizarding World, banks basically seem to be glorified storage safes. Thus, it would make some amount of sense that they would have a hand in executions of wills -- which would transfer ownership of a vault to the next of kin, or whatever the late owner wished. To facilitate this, it's plausible enough that Goblins would have a way of tracking familial ties, to legitimize someone's claim on a vault. And so on, until you suddenly have fanon helpful goblins, which is no longer in the realm of plausibility.

*** A good way to somewhat alleviate this is by making the goblins as intentionally obtuse, annoying and unhelpful as possible. I usually use these few rules when writing them:

1. answers cost money. If you ask something, the answer will cost money depending on its length and complexity.

2. No forthcoming. There are no hints, no helpful suggestions.

3. Always aim for circles. The goblin you're talking to wants to maximize his own cash, so he answers questions in such a way that the wizard never quite gets what he's actually looking for.

Justice you shall Pursue by White Squirrel is the second one you mention.

There aren't many stories where Goblins raise Harry. I made one of the Harrys in Keystone Council the adopted son of the Goblin King, but his adoptive mother is an Irish muggleborn witch. So they treat it like a multicultural thing and try to give him the best of both worlds, so to speak. And even then, with him being pretty much a dual citizen, I still find myself trying hard to avoid cliche nonsense.

** I have a little plot bunny that started as a side-quest for the goblins in another epfic I'm writing, but I think it might have to be its own fic... The protagonist OC is a musician and a Healer, learning about the /old ways/ with elemental magic, and the main story is set during books 6 & 7 but I think this might be sequel material as she learns about the complicated and bloody history between wizards and goblins.

--------------

When she approached the first available clerk with her name and wand, he, rather politely for a goblin, said, "Before you go to your vault, please follow me." And then he led her to one of the offices on the back wall of the atrium.

The goblin inside was Sorayo, who facilitated Liz's through-service with the even more elite bank Gavivis in Egypt. "Come in, Healer Althea. Have a seat."

She did, but this was weird. Goblins being cordial? She was actually surprised to see a guest chair in a goblin's office at all.

"We wish to learn the magic of your recording devices."

"Ah," Liz said, relaxing just a bit. Business schmoozing. That she understood. "A third party has begun wholesale production under my patent. Would you care to be connected to this supplier?"

"No. Relying on mass production is insufficient. We wish to learn the magic directly."

Liz rather wished she had Herr Schwarz in the room, but she figured this might be a little too high-stakes to delay for the arrival of her solicitor. "All musical applications of this magic must be licensed under my patent, but I suspect that your intent is about security surveillance for Gringotts. Is that right?"

"And also Gavivis."

"An important detail. So, I would teach security personnel for Gringotts and Gavivis. Anyone else included in the /we/ who want this magic?"

Sorayo shook his head.

Pinching the bridge of her nose, Liz said, "The thing is, under patent law, I must pursue either compensation or litigation for all use of my patented work. If I teach you this magic, my solicitor will draw a magical contract to be filed under my patent, with strict outlines for how it may be used, but I am flexible as to the nature of the compensation. You know better than most that I don't need more gold."

A twisted little smirked graced Sorayo's face. "Humans."

She smirked right back. "Goblins."

"Ha, you are an odd one, Healer Althea. What kind of compensation do you want?"

"If I am to teach you a rare /new/ secret of magic, then perhaps you have a rare /old/ secret to trade me. In particular, any Mysteries of Air should be mine to practice and protect."

Sorayo's posture straightened. "You are an Air Priestess?"

Liz nodded.

"Music and sound and soul healing. I see it now." He rose and stepped over to the long shelf on the wall behind his desk. He carefully selected a glass box holding a single scroll and laid it gingerly on his desk. Then he took his seat and said, "You must be aware that Storytelling is a Mystery of Air."

She was only just learning this from her extended family, but she said coolly, "Of course."

"The history of us goblins is mostly locked in oral tradition. Wizards," he sneered the word before he schooled his expression, apparently remembering that he wanted something from the witch across the desk, "have revised the written accounts to include but a shadow of our heritage. I will offer you the story of the goblins."

Liz shifted in her seat. She probably should have studied harder for Binns' class, but it was far too late to regret that now. "You have my attention."

Sorayo opened the lid of the glass box by stroking one long finger across the edge. Then he picked up and unrolled the parchment, setting it down for Liz to examine.

It was crammed full of drawings and runes, some of it overlapping, with four distinct colors of ink.

"In the Wars of Genocide, we lost nearly all of our Priestesses."

Liz blinked in surprise, and she wondered if he meant the period that Binns referred to as The Goblin Wars. Naturally, the goblins would have seen things a little differently.

"With the wizards closing in, the last four High Priestesses hid their grimoires and made this map."

Her stomach dropped. He was offering her a map to a goblin library? Probably the only goblin library outside the banks? Damn. She needed to play it cool, though, to be sure. "Let me get this straight. In exchange for exclusive new Air magic, you are offering me /work/? A quest to uncover your history for you?"

His eyes narrowed. "Most of the remaining goblins would call me a traitor for even showing this to you. They believe, understandably, that wizards only rape, pillage, exterminate, and /erase/ other magical beings."

She didn't know what to say, so she waited. She got the impression that she was representing wizard-kind at the moment, and she didn't want to muck things up like everything else lately.

"But I am inclined to trust an Air Priestess. Air and Earth are the Soul Healers. Air and Fire are the agents of swift change. Air and Water give life itself. And, among them, Air is the most rare."

Liz had wondered about that. In all her travels, she had met many women who could have been Priestesses, both alchemical and celestial, but only one that she now suspected was an Air Priestess. What she would give for five minutes alone with Madam Miku!

"What I am offering you, Air Priestess, is a chance to be the kind of Healer that I now know you are."

Closing her eyes, she looked inward and realized that he was right. This was exactly the magnitude of duties befitting a High Priestess. If the wizards had murdered the High Priestesses among the goblins, then maybe she had a responsibility to set it right. She opened her eyes and insisted, "I'm not ready."

"No, of course not, and even this map is too much for you alone. You might be able to decipher and understand the contribution of the Air Priestess, but you will most likely need the other three to unlock all its secrets and begin the quest."

She understood the scope of the problem now. She dropped her eyes to her hands, wringing in her lap. "I have so much work to do," she whispered, and then raised both her head and her voice. "And I do not know any other alchemical Priestesses to help me."

They both leaned back and regarded each other for a moment. Then Sorayo said, "It has waited centuries already. Do what you must, but for now, have Herr Schwarz draw up that contract. Once it is signed, I will deposit this treasure in your vault. And I will ward its case to be opened only by the full quartet of Priestesses required to read it."

Liz nodded.

"Now, get out before my colleagues start to wonder what we're up to."

Chuckling in relief at his return to barely-disguised contempt, Liz did as she was told.

******* I recently read Harry Crow, though I really skimmed through the last couple of dozen chapters. I agree that the writing style works but after a while the events involving Harry and the goblins virtually taking over Hogwarts all start to become more and more unlikely, though this is one of the few stories I have read which makes a reasonable attempt to portray goblin society in more detail.

******* Robst was very popular writer. No need to worry about grammar and spelling. He regularly completes his stories unlike so called great writers who takes a year to post a chapter. That's what I admire in him. But, he mostly writes stories with overused tropes. Or, many authors uses his stories and made them into tropes.

******** I mean, to be honest, tropes work most often for a reason. Others may be sick of reading the same thing over and over again, but for the most part, some events change. That's kinda why I like to read things over and over until I get bored. I'll eventually come back, though.

***** I liked it first time, I read it. That's around 4 to 5 years ago. It was fun read. Now it'd make me cringe. Don't worry about others and read it for yourself

** I quite like the goblins . They are another magical race in the Harry Potter books that allow you to explore different cultures and customs of Rowlings magical world. If they're used incorrectly it kind of makes the story a little much but if you use them As part of the plot to add some intrigue politics or just some interesting characters they can be quite useful I wrote a story ones were Mycroft Holmes Evans Harry Potter's stepdad. It was really enjoyable writing a chapter where Mycroft paid the goblins A ridiculous amount of money to ward the Holmes estate agains Death Eaters. I researched a lot about ancient cultures and druid runes To kind of tie that into the goblins culture, and their skill with wards and Crafting magical objects. The goblins are a great tool for world building.
