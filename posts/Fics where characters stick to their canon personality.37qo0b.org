One of the big things about fanfiction is how often Characters act way different than their canon counterpart. Sometimes this is acceptable, based on an AU setting, or the event that happen to them cause for them to behave differently. Do you have any fics that are favorites of yours, where the characters stay in character?

I'll be among the first to admit that, even as much as I love Harmony above all other ships, that Harmony writers tend to remove any character faults (especially from Hermione). One thing I've really enjoyed about [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/][bobmin]] also known as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/777540/Bobmin356][bobmin356]] is that (not only do they have a wealth of different types of stories and pairings, is that when they write Harmony, they keep their character flaws, Hermione is incredibly stubborn when she thinks she's right and often doesn't see how her actions affect others.

So what about you? Admitting our favorite characters have flaws is hard, reading them is harder. What are some of your favorites?


** I'd say Stanrick's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9649736/1/Thresholds][Thresholds]] qualifies for me. Harry and Hermione have dialogue that is well beyond their years in the story, but the author manages to make Harry intelligent without breaking character or succumbing to the temptation to make him as academically driven as Hermione.

FF.net user [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1591992/ScytheRider][ScytheRider]] has an excellent quote about Mary-Sues on his profile:

#+begin_quote
  "Mary Sues" are not bad, they are just aimed at a younger audience. Most readers frown upon characters without flaws whom the whole universe seems to revolve around -- but there was a time when their own heart pined for such simple, child-like, consequence-free fantasy, too. Everyone needs this at some point or another; it leaves a deep impression on the heart that lasts for a lifetime. Unfortunately, when you grow up, you tend to look back with disgust at the childish ideas of others, and you feel the deep urge to help the children along their path in life by making them see the brutality, pain, unfairness, and tragedy of reality -- encouraging them to "grow up". That is the core reason why Mary Sues are rejected by the heart; they represent the kind of whimsical, restrained naivety of a child who doesn't know anything about the world and refuses to take the step into maturity. But this is the reason Mary Sues are sometimes strongly accepted by some readers, even though they are resented by most others; they actually do speak to the hearts of those who are hindered in maturity, or are truly just young. But remember that you can't force someone to grow up. That's something that they have to do on their own.

  And while you might look down upon the poorly-written Mary Sue characters you find, remember that many of your favorite fictional characters probably would fail a Mary Sue litmus test, too! Everyone still has a bit of childishness left in their hearts, and that is how it should be. Avoiding Mary Sues in your own writing is as simple as understanding the feelings and expectations of your target audience.

But all jokes aside - you should try the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken][Promises Unbroken]] trilogy.
