Okay so it's a strange think to ask for, but I've read a few fics from other Fandoms where it's a thing and I've read a new Addams family crossovers that do manage it. I'm curious to know if anyone has any recommendations. Maybe a character is doing it to hide, or just for grins and giggles.


** Slightly off-topic, but why would a wizard want to cross-dress if there's polyjuice potion??

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  A little death can change so much. Delightful, isn't it?

** I can't remember where I read it, but there's a story where Snape starts wearing a corset to deal with his back pain and then discovers he likes to crossdress. It has Snape/Hermione pairing, and I think it's a one-shot. I will keep looking, but maybe someone else knows where to find it.

** A common dress code for both males and females of robes in all colours of the rainbow and any outlandish pattern you can think of is really not very conductive to crossdressing. You might have more luck with something that uses more distinction between the sexes when it comes to clothing.

** “Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the GirlWhoLived” (linkffn(6343543)), for what it is or is not worth, technically has that. It's not really explored deeply as the others think he's wearing the correct clothes, though.

  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?
