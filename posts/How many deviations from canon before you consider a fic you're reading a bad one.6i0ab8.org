I just started Wind Shear and Harry mentions werewolves are silver-susceptible and I scoffed hard. I'm worried I'll see tempus and have to tap out---because why would watches be a gift at seventeen if they learn how to cast a simple, always correct spell?---which would suck because while it's no Whiskey Time Travel, I like it.

Edit: great, he mentioned wards. One more egregious fanon idea and this story sucks.


** To me, canon deviations aren't a good measure of a fics quality. The entire idea behind fanfics is that they're NOT the exact same as the universe that birthed them, otherwise we'd just reread the original books all the time. Especially since so many fanfics hang on differences from canon, like a slytherin Harry, or Draco and Hermione somehow becoming lovers. As long as they state it obviously enough that I know it's a difference and they're acknowledging that fact, I'd read a story where all dragons produce asexually if it's well written.

*** I think my issue is that you've changed one, two, maybe three elements, How much more can you pile in to the story before it's no longer fanfiction but an "original" story that just uses elements from something else?

Edit: And the use of fanon elements that are so overused just screams a lack of imagination to me or a lack of critical thought and/or a lack of knowledge of canon or a lack of research skills.

***** While I don't side with the rather standoff-ish feeling of this comment, I do have to agree with the underlying sentiment. Fanfic isn't written for anyone except those who want to read it. While I realise that the community as a whole tends to have standards, or likes and dislikes, if someone has a story they want to tell, who are we to criticize that? Saying they're unimaginative or lack research skills isn't super constructive, and if you don't enjoy a fic, don't read it. I stopped reading Harry Crow recently, because I didn't like the characterizations and overall plot, but the author has found an audience, so more power to him.

** linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is just about as far from canon as you can get, and it's absolutely brilliant. I've read it at least twice already. I'd say it has a near infinite number of canon deviations, but is still acceptable.

But just a single mention of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6h4s3a/petty_reasons_for_dropping_a_fic/divq9xr/][Christian prayer]] is enough for me to drop it.

** Now for me, werewolves being silver-susceptible is very very believable. Everything you read has werewolves have a problem with silver so I do not see what you what “scoff hard” on it.

What I have a problem is stories were there is no reason or back-stories or honest way for the deviations to be that way. Like Draco/Harry is a Veela stories? Narcissa is not a Veela. Lucius cannot be one, as there not male Veela. So for Draco to be a veela you have to have someway that is very believable and that makes sense. In most stories, suddenly Draco is a veela at the age 14 with no reason. Gabrielle is a veela, but she is one when she is 7, and 10, and 13, and so on. The only thing is she gets her veela powers when she is older.

As long it is logical and well written I'm ok

Huge, rambling exposition dumps about wards don't interest me, but stories where it's both imaginative and easy to follow get solid pass there.

I agree on the /Tempus/ thing, as that spell doesn't make sense in a lot of ways (like, what about time zones?). However, I wouldn't think it's worth getting your ire up about the inclusion of some of this fanon stuff in fanfiction, all things considered - there are so few well-written, technically competent stories out there, that getting irritated enough to quit out of an otherwise good story is a bit of a shame.

** Wards are not fanon. Protective enchantments are canon(Fidelius Charm, several other common charms that were used even by the protagonists, Gringotts itself had several enchantments,etc.) and /wards/ is just the same concept taken from other fantasy books with a different name--despite contrary popular belief, Harry Potter isn't /that/ original, it just was the best execution of several things already done in prior fantasy books.

While I agree that quite a lot of deviations from canon are plain dumb, the writing and execution is more important than if it's actually canon or not--a point I don't even consider relevant unless the story is so far away from canon that could be original material, and this is mostly because it's not what I look for in fanfiction, not because it's a bad story. Besides, it isn't like canon is perfect. First, it's inconsistent. Second, it can always be improved. And changing some rules of the world can improve a story or be a fun concept in itself.

If you'll excuse me, I'll use one of my own stories as an example : linkffn(Harry Potter the Muggle). That story essentially reverses canon but couldn't exist without Harry Potter canon - mirror images don't exist without the original.

Having said all this, I know where you're coming from. But I don't think it's about how much a story changes, it's about whether it changes things in a way the reader doesn't like that's important. If you don't like the changes, stop reading.

** The way I look at it, fanfic is to canon as canon is to real life.

In "original" fiction like the HP novels, realism and verisimilitude are evaluated relative to real life. In [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml]["earthfic"]] in particular, we expect the story to be something that /could happen/ in reality as we know it. In sci-fi or fantasy, we expect internal consistency, and for the elements that could not be found in reality as we know it (like magic wands) to be justified --- to contribute to the story.

In fanfic, realism and verisimilitude are evaluated relative to canon. Therefore, deviations from canon setting and characters are a bit like "unrealistic" elements in "original" fiction: they need to be justified, either in that they contribute the story or in that they are necessary for internal consistency with deviations that do.

Another way to look at it is that a story has a Suspension of Disbelief Budget, and every inconsistency, internal or external, spends from that budget. In "original" fiction, external consistency is relative to real life, but in fanfic, it's relative to the canon. (If one change logically implies others, there is no double-spending, however.)

For example, a canon Gryffindor being sorted into Slytherin costs relatively little, unless their character traits and values are profoundly inconsistent with Slytherin (e.g., Luna). However, the same fic introducing a Manipulative!Dumbledore or Nice!Accepting!Slytherins or BloodPurist!Bully!Gryffindors as fics like that often do are very expensive, and do have a cost, because the first divergence does not imply others.

*** But since HP canon is not internally consistent, and opens several plot holes as well, deviating from canon can actually greatly increase that "Suspension of disbelief" budget. Replacing the obstacles in book 1, replacing the tasks in book 4, that sort on deviations are good things.

**** Indeed, tweaking the setting to make it more internally consistent can offset the cost of the external inconsistency. Though, almost all internal inconsistencies of canon that I know off can be addressed by interpolating setting and character elements left ambiguous in canon to explain the apparent contradictions. But, that's a separate discussion.

** For fanon, it's more to do with type than amount. Certain things just don't work with canon as is, but other things don't work and resolve conflict in cheap ways. Take glamours vs 'I swear on my magic' type oaths. Both of them, if they existed the way they're used in fanfic, break a lot of canon. But I'll shrug and continue reading with glamours because they trend toward being a plot mover that can keep other more interesting pieces of conflict moving. In contrast, the 'I swear on my magic' brings it to a halt so the self-insert of the author can pontificate obnoxiously on how innocent they are and how absurd it was to be accused of whatever.

I dislike pretty much all fanon that involves aggrandizing characters: 'Lord' used in any context outside of swearing and dark lords, 'Most Ancient and Noble' being a legal term, every random character has a family manor, or anything else that sets up the wizarding world as some kind of quasi-feudal society so authors can puff up Harry or whoever into a much bigger/more important figure than they already are in canon. Alternately, I'll happily read Veela or other weird creature fic, and don't really care if a story call things that are referred to as protections/enchantments in the books as 'wards' in a fic. I might roll my eyes at werewolves all having yellow eyes or *movie canon like Lupin having facial scars when nothing like that was ever mentioned in the books, but it's not a stopper for me.

*I do consider movie canon that either contradicts the books, or is noticeably absent in book canon as a drawback to a fic. The 'choosing the wand = picking one that doesn't start destroying things' is the most common one and it sucks. Works better than the book on screen, but a pointless and uninteresting change in fic. Not something that would make me drop it, but ugh.

*** Unbreakable Vows are canon, and therefore characters could easily offer to swear such a vow to say the truth (say, for a minute - easy not to break) to prove their innocence. Once again, it's better to change canon and drop those vows, instead to make up fanon to explain why that wouldn't work.

**** Something like that, where it has to be a lot more formal and deliberate, would still be less irritating than a casual wave of a wand with 'I swear on my magic.' I agree I'd rather just not have it even come up than someone use it though. We only ever see one Unbreakable Vow used anywhere in canon and I think it's easy to drop, though stories like Forging the Sword at least work to give it some weight that I find interesting.

Also, the penalty for breaking the vow is death, not loss of magic, which seems more in line with canon. The only things we see that involve any loss of magical ability in canon involve depression on the part of the magic user in question and I'm skeptical it's something that can be permanently/completely done. Yes, book 7 has the whole 'Muggleborns stealing magic' accusation but I take that with the same seriousness I take 'the Jews are poisoning the water which is why I can no longer get it up.' I think 'stealing magic' is one of those ideas things that float around the wizarding world because people know magical ability can fluctuate, but there's never been anything substantiated that would give credibility to the claim it's actually possible (outside of bigoted maniacs running the government).

** To me fanfiction is any story based on canon. As in it is inspired by and captures the feel of thr world.

Some of my favorite fics have huge changes either to characters or the entire magic system. Some are totally canon compliant.

If it's good I'll read it. At least that's my motto.

** Sort of a side tangent, I always imagine the tempus spell to be largely useless and personally subjective. For example Tempus! And then the character has a vague impression that s/he is early/late/missing something. Pretty much tempus is part of the magic what's incorporated into the rememberall.

*** The tempus spell never made any sense to me. How is the information presented? As an old-fashioned clock face because the spell was invented centuries ago? Digitally because it depends on the caster's preferences and expectations? What about accuracy? Are we talking about atomic-clock precision, or Weasley-clock approximations, like "teatime" and "you're late"? And then there's time zones and daylight savings time...

Perhaps the tempus spell would show some kind of sundial? That would work, I think. The spell would show the position of the sun on a rough dial, not adjusted for anything. The user would then have to mentally adjust for longitude, timezones, and daylight savings time. But why would wizards mess with muggle concepts as longitude or timezones anyway? Do they even need accurate global timekeeping?

If I wrote a fanfic, I'd have to nerf the shit out of a lot of stuff.

**** I'd just as soon write it off as being intent-based, where the outcome is dependent on what the user expects or wants, both for a physical appearance, and degree of precision.

Honestly it's just a boring thing, but some writers like to inject magic into everything and add unnecessary detail. JKR never explains why Hogwarts has modern plumbing in an ancient castle and how the entrance to the chamber is throw it if it was retrofitted, so some users feel the need to explain it. How exactly students find their way to classes or wake up on time isn't really explained either, but boom magic solves it.

I don't think some things need to be explained, but I don't generally begrudge an author their details as long as there aren't an excessive number of them, or unless they are all tired fanon.

** I was tempted to tap out in chapter 1 of Wind Sheer. The scene with Moody was terrible, and the pureblood idealogy was so bland and generic. None of the characters showed any signs of life and were just speaking with the author's mouth. Tons of warning bells going off.

So, I'm not for deviations of canon, but rather, I like things that are potentially and realistically plausible within the realms of canon. And, if they're not, they're at least presented in an interesting and entertaining way.
