*** Thanks for the feedback! English isn't my first language, so I really do need pointers like these.

Third chapter coming today or tomorrow!

** Quick addition: Not sure how I was supposed to post this here, hope I didn't break any rules. Also, I love HP fanfics, and I've had this idea for more than a decade. Even if no one reads this, it feels good just to write it down if only to see how everything would play out given the changes I've made to the canon.

​

FYI: Teddy Lupin does not exist in this AU, unfortunately. Harry needed to be alone for this to work, and I figured he would never abandon him. And I didn't want to kill him.

Nothing in JK's "19 years later" exists in this AU either, as I change the events right after Voldemort's demise, as explained in the summary I linked above.

​

Thanks!
