Might be just me, but there is something about this pairing that is so adorable. I know it would never work in the real story, but I think if the two ever really crossed paths and talked, they would have great intellectual chemistry. Just a thought :3


** [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset]] and [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise]] over Britain are the first to spring to mind, both serious stories and classics in HPFF. Over a million words for you there. They're key characters, but it's not a Draco/Luna-centric story.

Enjoy!

** I love Draco/Luna! But I've really only enjoyed one fic from the ones I've read. They are, I think, are amongst the hardest characters to write well, and I usually don't like the way they're portrayed and the rampant theme of 'love fixes all wounds~' grates on me. I am definitely love the idea of them though, because I love imagining their potential influence on each other.

*** Exactly. They are very difficult to write and I totally agree with you of the "love fixes all wounds". it's cheesy and shallow. I don't picture their relationship like a "girl softens up the tough guy" fairy tale experience at all.
