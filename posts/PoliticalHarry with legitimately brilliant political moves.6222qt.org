We all know how Political!Harry usually goes. "Oh (insert stupid reason here) so therefor I am exempt!" or some equally bullshit reason.

So, im looking for a political Harry where everything done is actually pretty smart.

Over 100k+ words.


** Mm, I'm kind of interested in this too. A political Harry who's elected by virtue of his celebrity, who goes around talking to and listening to his constituents, who proposes and sponsors bills that promote the good well-being of everyone in the magical world and sustainable management of the surrounding environment...

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
