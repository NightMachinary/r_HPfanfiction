I'm looking for a complete series that tells the story of Slytherin Harry over 7 years. Bonus points if it gives details about the Slytherin hierarchy.

No slash please!


** It's unfinished, but linkffn(On the Way to Greatness by mira mirth) is the only one of those that didn't make me cringe. It's probably the most universally acclaimed Slytherin!Harry story out there (and generally one of the best stories in the fandom).

** /'Paid in Blood' by zaterra02/ is my favourite on ffn. Time travel fic. But he's slytherin. Its complete. And it has a sort of hierarchy thingy. I love it. Although it tails of in quality to the end and theres a few too many flashbacks.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is the go to but people say that year 3 isn't that good.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) is like POS but farther along. Both are unfinished

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The conclusion of the AO3 work Sarcasm and Slytherin. Chapters 1-16 are available here. https://archiveofourown.org/works/15848610/chapters/36912186This is Sunmoonandstars, back from the dead. Original work summary: Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.Happy reading everyone. I have no clue when book 6 is going to be done or ready to post but have at least the end of book 5 because it's been languishing on my hard drive for too long.
