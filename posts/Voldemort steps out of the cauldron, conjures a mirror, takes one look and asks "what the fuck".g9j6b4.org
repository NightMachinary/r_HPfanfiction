He never heard of the details of Harry's adventure in the chamber of secrets, and the basilisk venom in the blood caused him to have a snake face. Lucius has some explaining to do...


** Huh. That's a plausible explanation. Though that begs the question: Why didn't Harry have a snake face?

Moreover, I think in canon, when Tom returns to Hogwarts asking to be made DADA teacher, his appearance already becomes snake like...

​

EDIT: There is a relevant quote in Philosopher's stone. Apparently Voldemort looked snakelike even when he was stuck behind Quirrel. So the whole point of getting Basilisk venom from Harry's blood causing it is moot.

  Ravleen: How much does the fact that voldemort was conceived under a love potion have to do with his nonability to understand love is it more symbolic

  J.K. Rowling: It was a symbolic way of showing that he came from a loveless union -- but of course, everything would have changed if Merope had survived and raised him herself and loved him.

  J.K. Rowling: The enchantment under which Tom Riddle fathered Voldemort is important because it shows coercion, and there can't be many more prejudicial ways to enter the world than as the result of such a union.
#+end_quote

So it's more of a symbolic use of it rather than systematic, IMO. But it is a narrative choice to help explain why he was incapable of loving, which I can easily see why someone would stretch out even further for love potions in general (given how much more sinister they are when looked at realistically, in comparison to the cavalier treatment they're given in canon).

Nevermind the idea that, in order to cure Age, you would apparently have to do some pretty heinous things, at least on the level of a planetary-level Thanos snap, given that Horcruxes apparently require a life sacrifice to create. Even the Philosopher's Stone only traps the user in a cage of flesh indefinitely.

I don't get what you mean. Of course he still has a choice?

I mean, one could say that love had something to do with why Wormtail hesitates in killing Harry, but otherwise I'm not sure what love's got to do with it? It defeats Voldemort because he doesn't understand it, and underestimates it's power.

The reason why Voldemort died the first time he used the AK spell on Harry is "the power of love" not some fanon ritual. Love isn't what defeats Voldemort in the end, fate is, because too many things went wrong for Voldemort and right for Harry for it to simply be luck.

******* Sure. But Unicorns have nothing to do with snakes, and the curse seem to imply a metaphysical blight, not a biological one.

Herpo the Foul only ever made one Horcrux. We see Voldemort's appearance after one Horcrux, and his appearance barely changed until he'd made five of them. Original-body Riddle was never described as snakelike.

Herpo the Foul was also the inventor of Parseltongue (and likely was an ancestor of Salazar Slytherin, as a result), which would be an explanation for his own snakiness.

However, I don't think Voldemort's snake appearance is due to basilisk venom in Harry's blood either, because the homunculus that Voldemort inhabited before his resurrection also looked snakelike. It is therefore most plausibly a by-product of the ritual that created that rudimentary body for him, which required Nagini's venom to sustain itself.

It is stated and accepted as general fact in the books that Voldemort was the first known person ever to create more than one Horcrux. Slughorn had a higher than average knowledge of them and was flabbergasted by the idea.

Given that Herpo doesn't appear to still be blighting the world with his presence, and is discussed in a historical sense and not a contemporary one, we can probably assume that he only made one unless indicated otherwise.

As it is a ritual, you would need to follow the steps to the point accurately that you can get the desired Effekt. One drop of Blood to much, a little bit of dust on the bones, the smallest amount of magical creature essence and the whole ritual is ruined. That how i explain myself the look of ol‘ Tommy Boy.

** "Wait...what the fuck?"

The assembled Death Eaters looked around in confusion. Slowly, hestiently, Lucius Malfloy spoke up "Is there something wrong, My Lord?"

"I-is...yes there bloody well is something wrong! I look like a fucking snake person, I have fucking blood red eyes! I used to be so handsome too!" Voldemort adopted a mocking voice "'Is there something wrong, My, Lord?'" Then, to Harry's utter astonishment, the Dark Lord scoffed "Moron."

A stunned silence followed his outburst. Just as it seemed Malfoy was going to speak again, Voldemort sighed deeply "Okay, okay, we can fix this let me think." There was a pause as Voldemort appeared contemplative before sighing again and speaking "Yes, it's the only option. Someone let the Potter boy go then kill me, we're doing this stupid ritual again, I am not ruling the world looking like this!"

For the second time that night the Death Eaters were completely stunned, and Harry could hardly hope to believe, he couldn't be /that/ lucky could he? Suddenly a seemingly collective cry came from the Death Eaters "WHAT THE FUCK!?"
