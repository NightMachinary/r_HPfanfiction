Sites other than hpfanarchive, fanfic.net and archiveofourown. Groupwise I'm looking for something similar to Rotaryfile, mainly fics that don't get posted on the main stream sites. Bonus points for groups that have harem fics.

P.S.: Can somebody tell me why plums for fanfic.net stopped posting? my last thread kinda got derailed.


** You might be able told find some archives that are ship specific like "Sink into your eyes" is Harry/Ginny and relatively still active.

*** Meh I don't care about pairings as long as it's not Hermione, Ginny or slash and I doubt I can find any groups by myself at this point, I actually tried.

** the most active HP yahoo group I know of is [[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/CaerAzkaban/conversations/messages][Caer Azkaban]] there are quite a few writers inhabiting this group, although none of them would put up Rotaryfile as anything but a bad example.

*** Thanks. People generally find harem stories bad, and some of them there are really stupid but it was there that I found the pseudo successor of the last survivor by plums so I sticked with it. That and overpowerd mc's are a guilty pleasure of mine.

**** I have no problem with harem fics, per se, just poorly written ones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10127417/1/Emerald-Coven][emerald coven]] though I prefer the Lunar Harmony track myself.

***** God I hate Lunar Harmony, mostly because of Hermione but usually Luna is some kinda of crazy seer in them that destroys it even more.

****** unfortunately, there are well written and poorly written stories everywhere. I prefer original ideas and writing, instead of stories where I have to look at the title to see which one I am reading.

**** Nevermind, those sites are literally spawning pools of all the things I hate in fanfiction, them being Hermione, Ginny, Snape and slash. Thanks anyways.
