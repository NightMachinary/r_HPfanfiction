For April I picked Soul Bonds for the theme, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9818387/1/The-Amplitude-Frequency-and-Resistance-of-the-Soul-Bond][The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond]] as the specific fic because it immediately stood out to me as interesting. I'll be keeping track of other suggestions people have already given, but feel free to repeat suggestions next month. If something is requested frequently I'll give it more weight in consideration.

Please refrain from posting any spoilers in the first two weeks or so, and after that mark your post if it contains spoilers. Note to self, create spoiler tags.


** An interesting story. I had some fun reading it, but it wasn't exactly a masterpiece. The best parts were the well-realized and explored soul bond effects. I was unimpressed, however, by the author's use of OOC hijinks and the overall pacing and plotting.

It is listed as "humor," but that isn't, in my opinion, a license to dump compelling plotting by the roadside or to abuse canon characterizations for yucks -- certainly not without a big crackfic warning somewhere. To me, the FFN "humor" tag means intentional funnies incoming, not crackfic OOC shenanigans. For me, those parts almost spoiled an otherwise interesting fic.

I discuss my reasons for these opinion in general terms more after the break. Avoid if you haven't read the fic and that sort of thing bothers you.

--------------

No outright spoilers, though.

--------------

This story seems like more of a "tech demo" of the author's idea than a fully fleshed out story. The endless sniping back and forth gets a little filler-y and seems to poorly advance either plot or character development, dragging on long after the problem is established.

To any other authors out there: please, don't waste the reader's time just to try to maintain emotional effects, especially in novel length fiction. Writing about a repeating or continuing situation might be a good time for once to /tell/ instead of /show/ that something is making the characters bored and annoyed.

Still, there was an interesting effect established, with characters' emotions swinging back and forth constantly and endless childish psychic chatter. I quickly came to hate the soul bond myself, but I also started hating the story a little bit every time the same situation yet again repeated itself at breakfast or during classes.

In a non-Ginny/Harry area, I didn't like the author's take on Dumbledore. But that isn't really an objective complaint about poor writing, just that he is a different, entirely OC character in this story.

My biggest complaint is saved for plot, however. "Bad Vibrations" and the new Defense teacher was, in my opinion, the most jarring, most annoyingly OOC, and most pointlessly AU plot line I've ever read outside a crackfic.

So maybe this is somewhat of a crackfic after all, which in my opinion sort of undercuts the author's cool ideas about how serious soul bond consequences might be interesting compared to instant "twu wov."

**** I haven't finished either and I don't think I will, if only because taking it where I left of feels like such a chore.

May contain inadvertent spoilers:

First, everyone feels so OOC and although the author justifies her choices on this about Ginny, it's just really annoying having a bitchy Ginny, a weak submissive Harry, an overly childish Dumbledore, a Ron that only lives for food (literaly)... Oh well I just realized the author forced traits of characters so much, they're just not realistic or enjoyable anymore.

The other thing that bothered me is the lack of plot. Where is this story going? I have absolutely no clue. It reads like a sort of day to day account with not much happening, there's no pull, no urgency, no goal (they're not even researching for a way to break the bond for God's sake!). So why would I want to read more of it? That's right, I don't.

And I didn't understand the premise: they are soul-bonded by accident, it's horrible to live with even from the very beginning, but they don't tell anyone? Not even just Dumbledore? Why? Maybe he could have fixed it in an instant after all. I just don't get it.

That said, I know I'm being harsh and it's probably an entertaining story if you're looking for some light reading (I said some light reading, Hermione, put down that encyclopedia!)

** Done already. Horribly disappointed that it's not finished. I was really enjoying it. The problems related to having someone else's voice stuck in your head sound very believable. I'd hate to have to go through some woman's pms with her. Harry's already a moody boy; that must make him a nightmare to deal with.

Seriously not funning with you. From chapter 16, or whatever: „They were bloody stubborn though, both of them equally so. They each dragged on either side of the arrow equally stubbornly, and the arrow would fly perfectly straight.”

„Stubbornly stubborn”.

** I actually suggested this one, glad it got chosen!

Like I said in my original post, this is one of the very few soul-bond fics that's actually worth reading. The writing is fairly good, not amazing prose, but it gets the job done. You can understand what the writer is trying to get across fairly easily, and it's never bad to the point that you get yanked out of the story by the writing.

It's one of two soul-bond fics that I've read that utilizes the (completely obvious) idea that two people who can suddenly hear each others thoughts, would probably despise it. At least at first. Most other soul-bond fics (granted, there's like 4 soul-bond fics that aren't actually awful) have the two bonded enjoy the experience immediately. Not only is the idea laughable, but it would be even worse considering the age Harry and Ginny are at in this fic. Can you imagine having a hard on at 13, and having a /girl/ know about it immediately? How about having your first period, and the crush of your dreams experiences it along with you. This fic does it right.

The author has a very interesting take on the McNair character, probably the best I've seen. It's a bit contrived, but so it just about everything else in the HP world. I actually found him quite creepy.

You see the authors growth as a writer as the fic goes on. Chapters get longer, dialogue gets better, and descriptions become more detailed. The difference between chapter 1 and 16 are appreciable, and it'll be interesting to see how the writer continues to improve.

Overall, it's definitely worth a read, especially if you're a fan of soul-bond fics. I think Error Of Soul did the idea better, but as EoS hasn't been updated in forever, it may very well be abandoned. This fic, while not quite reaching the quality that EoS did, is still very enjoyable.

I found him impossible to take seriously as a character, which is a theme in this fic. It has more caricatures than characters. McNair, Ron and Dumbledore especially are ridiculous. I'll probably continue following it. It's not great, but it's readable and has an interesting enough premise to be worthwhile.

I agree that McNair especially is someone who you can either love or hate depending on how you look at it. Honestly, I lowered my standards as soon as I started reading the fic, just because of the writing level. I just tended not to take it as seriously as I might otherwise have, so that's probably why I enjoyed the character.

Dumbledore...Honestly, I don't even remember him in the fic. Which probably says more than anything else, because I only read it a week ago. Same with Ron really.

This is exactly how I would describe it. If it wasn't a soul-bond fic, I wouldn't be reading it. It's just that the level of quality in soul-bond fics is so horrible, that I adjust my expectations based on that. Like I said, there are like 4 fics that are actually worth reading, and the rest are trash. The fact that this one /isn't/ horrible, is what makes it stand out, not so much that it's good.

The success or failure of the book club does not warrant the book club getting special treatment. Further, it appears to me that there wasn't any more traffic in this tread, even though it was at the top of the list - and so I don't think that a stickied post actually helps.

I understand the concept of monthly book club. I also have no problem with there being an [[/r/hpfanfiction]] book club.

By having the post stickied at the top, your practically saying "the book club is the most important thing happening in this subreddit". This is what I have a problem with. I just don't understand why it deserves such special treatment.

Do you understand the concept of a subreddit? You've already stated that you know that the thread would be off the front page by the end of the month. That this is the normal behavior of reddit. And so you are purposely and intentionally going against the system as original designed.

Instead, I would suggest that the book club create new book club threads whenever a new discussion point arises. The reddit system will make it visible based on the normal rules. The new link flares can be used to easily find book-club posts.

For example, this original post was declaring the story to read, and that after two weeks spoilers could be discussed. Why not, after the two weeks, start the a new discussion thread?

***** I think part of the reason it is sticked is because a lot of people on the site upvoted/showed interest in a book club for each month. He presented it as an idea for the sub, and it had a lot of interest. I think the only reason it is stickied is because a lot of people seemed to want this to become a thing within the sub, and it is a monthly thing. No one wants to sift through a months worth of posts to find it over and over again for a discussion. It makes sense for it to be kept at the top.
