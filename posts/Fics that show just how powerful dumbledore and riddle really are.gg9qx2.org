Despite being told that they are really powerful they rarely use their abilities Any fics where the difference between them and normal magicals is demonstrated properly? Preferably where Harry has the potential to be on their level but lacks the knowledge and experience No slash no fem Harry no hinny no bashing


** One of the linkao3(Prince of Slytherin) books has him viewing pensieve memories of Voldemort fighting in the first war. They're pretty horrific.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
