EDIT: Chapter 4 is now complete and uploaded. Wordcount ~42000.

This is WIP with no set update schedule. I am halfway through chapter 3. Currently at ~22000 words, 26000 with what I have of chapter 3. I have planned concretely to the end of the first book, and vaguely to the end of the second. It's a bit rough. When I'm done I'll tidy it up and post it other places too, but while it's WIP it stays where it is.

This is set in an AU with a number of points of divergence. The basic premise is that 10 years ago, in 2001, Voldemort returned from Europe with a Dark Lady responsible for his resurrection. They invade Hogwarts, murder Albus Dumbledore, and then over the course of four long years conquer the wizarding world. Except Harry Potter and several of his friends were kidnapped in 2002 by the Unspeakables, who have since disappeared.

It's now 2011 and the Ministry has declared war on the Irish Court of Magic. Voldemort has established 'new communities' for the 'Purebloods of the future' which are basically breeding camps for muggleborns. Society has gone a bit dark. Imagine what was going on in Deathly Hallows, but much worse and for far longer. On top of all that, there's some weird prophecy things going on and the Unspeakables have decided now is the time to act.

That's where the fanfic starts. The Unspeakables and Harry launch a massive operation against Voldemort and the Death Eaters. From there, the series will explore aspects of politics and wizarding culture, the nature of magic and a bunch of other cool stuff. It's very AU but not necessarily always in an obvious way, although there are many things which aren't recognisable from canon. Lots of things will start out different and stay different, and some things will start out the same and end up different, and other things will start differently and end up the same. Stick with it! The setting is, in universe, occurring in an alternate reality for which the actual books are the baseline (I guess you could say that's the case for any AU, but this is explicitly so (although they obviously don't consider themselves a 'secondary reality', they're the 'main' one as far as they're concerned)).

I've put the canon characters into a variety of situations which might seem odd at first, but make more sense given the context of the world. At the moment there's not a ton of information, but I promise I'll get there! It's not romance, I'm not a shipper of anything in particular, and I'm not writing porn. I think I have an interesting story to tell and I want to tell it.

Anyway I'd really appreciate it if you could take a look and read a bit if it sounds interesting. If you have anything you think might be useful to me after reading it please say something! I'd love to get some feedback on this because it's been sitting in my head fermenting for quite some time.

*TLDR: In 2001 Voldemort and his Dark Lady invade Britain. In 2002 Harry Potter and his friends are kidnapped by the Unspeakables and Voldemort conquers Britain. In 2011 Harry and the Unspeakables launch a massive operation against Voldemort to mark the anniversary of Dumbledore's death, and to announce their intention to end his reign for good.*

** Gog or Taff?

I'm curious as to what you have planned for Valmira. Are you basing this OC off of anyone in particular?

*** Valmira isn't based on anyone in particular. She's an amalgam of three earlier characters I created, but if you want my basic inspiration for the character, it was Lillith from Abrahamic mythology. Valmira had an interesting storyline, I think.

Taff, Welsh learner rather than native speaker. Thanks for taking the time to respond!
