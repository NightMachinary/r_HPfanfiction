I have only ever read that Sirius was an auror before his imprisonment. Is this ever mentioned in canon? Or is it just a fanon thing?


** Sirius as an Auror is fanon. JK Rowling hasn't said-- my guess is living off inheritance and working for the Order, like James and Lily did.

** My stupid anwser is that he worked at a mattress store as a night janitor in the Midlands due to James pranking him saying that this is the easiest way to pick up women. He worked there till he became imprisoned but the store was told that he died due to the fact he won employee of the month 6 times in a row. Surprisingly he never used magic he was just that good of a janitor.

But for real I think he just lived off his inheritance/mooched off his friends money.

** Sirius lived of the money he inherited from his uncle. He chose to focus on the Order of the Phoenix instead of working a regular job.

The same applies to James, Lily and Lupin who lived of the Potter family fortune.

  Information on the original Order members was also revealed during tonight's event. Jo related the fact that Remus Lupin, prior to the third book, was unemployable because he was a werewolf and upon his graduation from Hogwarts along with James and Lily, was supported by James using their own money. In addition to this she shed more light on the early days of the Order, saying James, Sirius, Remus and Lily were full time Order members. “Full Time Fighters,” as Jo put it
#+end_quote

Also

#+begin_quote
  Q: Harry often wondered about his parents lives before he died. What did Lily, James, Remus, Lupin and Sirius do after Hogwarts?

  JKR: To take Remus first, Remus was unemployable. Poor Lupin, prior to Dumbledore taking him in, lead a really impoverished life because no one wanted to employ a werewolf. The other three were full-time members of the Order of the Phoenix. If you remember when Lily, James and co. were at school, the first war was raging. It never reached the heights that the second war reached, because the Ministry was never infiltrated to that extend but it was a very bad time, the same disappearances, the same deaths. So that's what they did, they left school. James has gold, enough to support Sirius and Lily. So I suppose they lived foff a private income. But they were full-time fighters, that's what they did, until Lily fell pregnant with Harry. So then they went into hiding.
#+end_quote

Sirius also mentioned how he got his own place after his uncle died and he inherited a lot of money in Order of the Phoenix

#+begin_quote
  “You ran away from home?”

  “When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I'd had enough.”

  “Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him. “Your dad's place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad's during the school holidays, and then when I was seven-teen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold --- he's been wiped off here too, that's probably why --- anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potter's for Sunday lunch, though.”

** I think the whole 'James and Sirius were aurors' idea is mostly an excuse to give them some sort of martial training that isn't from their families or the Order of the phoenix.

Which means the author can make either of these three factions incompetent and still have Sirius be absolutely hell on wheels in a fight

*** Definitely. In canon, if they were Aurors, it would have been a big deal, and would have been definitely mentioned at least once. One of the defining things about the Longbottoms was that they were both respected Aurors, and for that reason it was a huge deal that they were tortured by Death Eaters. If it came out that an Auror was killed and betrayed by another, it would have been a huge part of what people talked about when talking about that night.

Also keep in mind that they had only been out of school for 3 or so years at that point. We know that Tonks had 3 years of training under Alastor Moody in order to become an Auror (and that she was 7 years older than Harry and co.). So there was simply not the amount of time for James and Sirius to even become fully fledged Aurors.

** The only canon thing we know about Sirius's financial situation is that his (great?) uncle Alphard left him some gold in his will. I am pretty sure that was shortly after he ran away from home when he was 16.

That said I can't see canon Sirius - especially the barely graduated one - as someone with the temperament to join the Aurors.

** Like others said, the Order was his job.

But, fanon-wise, there is one story where I read about Sirius' having a job prior to Azkaban and I went, "yep he totally was doing that". That's [[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/harry_potter_and_the_years_of_rebellion/index/][HP and the Years of Rebellion]] and Sirius's job was to fly experimental brooms for the company that later made the firebolt.

*** Nope, but there is a offhanded comment that he was arrested by them and not the Aurors.\\
Which for me always meant that they didn't thought he was that big of a threat when they arrested him. If he had been an Auror (the ministry elite for catching dark wizards) or had any formalised training, they wouldn't have sent the hitwizards which in my understanding are like a specialforce but not the "top dogs". You don't even need your NEWTs to become one.

**** The quote has a different tone than what you remember:

#+begin_quote
  “You don't know what you're talking about, Hagrid,” said Fudge sharply. “Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered.”
#+end_quote

---PoA, /The Marauder's Map/

This is after a section describing how bright he was in school. I've always interpreted it as the Hit Wizards being soldiers specially trained for the war---not much use for a standing army in Magical Britain---whereas Aurors are more like domestic intelligence with an emphasis on detective work.

Of course, the real explanation is almost certainly that Rowling didn't bother making a coherent law enforcement system or maybe didn't even remember she'd mentioned Hit Wizards when she introduced the Aurors in GoF.
