*** I can't be the only person that couldn't get past the first few chapters in Child of the Storm right? I really wanted to get into it because it is a fic with 800k+ words,

but the author made so many of the characters know each other, be squibs, somehow related to each other (wizards being shield agents and so on) before the second chapter was even done that the world felt minuscule.

The best part of crossovers is the characters discovering and interacting with the new characters and their new world.

I felt like the author robbed the readers of that in a way by making all those alternative relations and origins stories right at the start.

**** I'm very familiar with both universes so it was a nice change to not have an origin story for all the characters. For example, I am well aware of who Professor X and the X-Men are so I don't need half a chapter going over their backstories. So Professor X is Tony Stark's godfather. The Scarlet Witch is Harry's godmother and is {REDACTED}'s mother. Harry Dresden is Harry Dresden. I know those people so I don't need an explanation as to who they are. I'd rather just have the story continue.

Harry is still getting to know the people so there is that. It's just the adults that know of each other, usually because of WW2 or the first Wizarding War.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Loki's in for it now. Odin has had enough and has banished him to Earth to relearn some lessons. Too bad he hadn't paid attention to where Loki ended up. Now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has to deal with memories that aren't his own while he gets his revenge on those who sought to use him as a weapon. Can Harry regain what he lost, or will his past self take control first?

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.
