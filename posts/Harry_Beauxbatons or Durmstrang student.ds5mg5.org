Hey guys,

just had a bad day at work (loath my job, but it's retraining after losing my last job in my chosen field (multilingual administrative assistant...sadly not too many companies in need of one in my area and I am not financially stable enough to move) and not finding another quickly...so I kind of have to suck it up and stick with it!) and a dentist-appointment...so help a tired guy out with some reading-material, please!

So, this time I am looking for some Harry/other school girl (Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are just the most well known examples, but others are welcome as well!)

Please no Ron/Hermione (no, not even in the background - I simply don't like this pairing!) or Hermione/Draco (even worse IMHO!)

Otherwise the stage is yours guys :)

Thanks in advance for any recommendations :)

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  What to do when your parents are immortal and your best friend is a fireball throwing Veela? Henry has no idea. But when the Triwizard Tournament comes to Beauxbatons, the young Flamel has to survive both his former family and the trouble of his own fame. - on Hiatus, possibly to be rewritten someday... maybe

** I would be shocked if you found any non one-shots that are not just Harry/Fleur or Harry/Gabriel in this style.

I have long requested Harry fics where he attends either Durmstrang or Beauxbatons OR fics with Harry paired with girls from those schools and there seem to be almost none of either. For whatever reason basically no authors have really tried branching out beyond Hogwarts as a school other than ones that are mentioned in passing or just blips in a journey, and none that I have seen have tried pairing Harry with anyone other than Fleur or Gabrielle when it comes to different schools. Likely because beyond those 2, you basically have to completely create a character from the ground up and it would be easier to just do an OC at Hogwarts.

I wish you luck, and I certainly will continue to keep my eyes open.

Sorry ;) - Still, thank you but I've red those!
