Sure, fanon has its issues - from Lord I-have-so-many-important-titles, to the concept of being soulmates at eleven. But overall, fanon just seems to be so much /richer/ than canon.

Don't get me wrong; without JK, we wouldn't even have the Potterverse! There are so many good/great parts of the canon series. On the other hand, it feels as if JK really wasted some golden opportunities. Even though the series is mostly - if not all - in Harry's POV, the universe feels so isolated and small in the books.

What about schools in other countries, or the different branches of magic? What about a far more defined magical system? The variety of magical cultures throughout the world? Other, far more complex antagonists that would really question our views of right and wrong?

Yes, there was a genre shift from children's fairy tale to a darker, young adult tone, but the way some topics were covered e.g. child abuse, and why Dumbledore didn't do a damn thing despite knowing about it. What about how no characters needed therapy after all the shit they went through? Harry /may/ be justified, due to his mother's protection, but what about Ginny after the Chamber incident?

Don't even get me started on the whole "mother's love" protection, which really begs the question: did no other person ever sacrifice themselves, despite having the choice to step away? Really? It seems much more likely that Lily prepared some ancient, archaic form of magic that might have been powered by love. If I were to write the HP series, here is how book 1 would go:  

*Book 1*

- Harry's abuse from the Dursleys is treated a LOT more seriously. As a result, Harry has the uncanny ability to read body language and be incredibly stealthy. He knows when to speak, when to reply, and when to stay silent. He knows how to hide things, and every nook and cranny of the neighbourhood. Even so, he is still a witty, snarky son-of-a-bitch.

- Instead of Hagrid picking Harry up, Dumbledore arrives in a show of magical wonder. This leaves an impression on Harry, as he is whisked away from the Dursleys. Why would the Headmaster of such a prestigious magical school rescue /him/?

- While incognito, Harry and Dumbledore tour Diagon Alley. Harry is in awe, and his hero-worship of Dumbledore only increases. He finds out that Dumbledore was sorted into Slytherin House. The Potter account is full of money and valuables, even if the Potters aren't even close to the richest family in magical Britain.

- Harry meets Draco at Madame Malkin's, but decides to stay cautious and keep an eye on him, instead of voicing his true feelings. He knows Draco's type - playing it safe is better than being reckless and making an enemy right away.

- Sep 1st: Harry has absorbed every book in the syllabus, as well as any other book he could find. Finally, a chance to prove himself! He boards the train and meets Ron pretty much the same as canon. When Draco opens the carriage door, Harry diffuses the situation quickly. Though frosty to each other, this Harry's relationship with Draco is probably the closes to civil they can get.

- Harry is sorted into Gryffindor (almost Slytherin), as is Hermione. However, Ron is sorted into Hufflepuff, which he doesn't really know how to feel about. Despite the difference in house, Harry and Ron still remain friends.

- This Snape still berates only the incompetent students. Any student (even Slytherins) are treated with apathy, but no-one more than Harry. Harry might as well be drying paint on a wall.

- During the levitation charms lesson, Ron and Hermione are paired up. Ron, like in canon, cannot do it. Hermione shows him how, though without most of her canon self's haughtiness. But, unlike in canon, it is Hermione who badmouths and humiliates Ron, who already feels like an outcast for being a Hufflepuff Weasley.

- Harry and Hermione save Ron from the troll in the bathroom. Instead of jamming his wand up the troll's nostril, Harry used a fireworks spell he had learned from his "additional" reading. After all, he knows how to get the attention of fat, stupid things. Ron uses WL and knocks out the troll. As a result of the incident, Hermione's trust in authority figures is shaken, while Harry questions how a troll could have intercepted Hogwarts.

- The events pretty much follow canon from this point, until after Voldequirrel 'dies'. Dumbledore tells Harry parts of the truth, as well as how he placed him at the Dursleys. Harry's trust in Dumbledore is shaken, and he doesn't know if he can ever regain that image he had of the man at the start of the year.


** Bluntly, your sorting is wrong. If you are focusing on rewriting the series, you need to take each character as they are, not how they were in the series. The Harry in your description is as close to a Ravenclaw or slytherin harry potter i have ever seen. Why not put him in ravenclaw?

And Hermione from how you describe her, would be in slytherin.

** The first thing I would change is to remake Voldemort. I don't care for that typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain that has been done ad nauseam these days. I would make him a complex person with some great personal virtues, but unfortunately found himself on the wrong side of history.

The next thing I would change is Dumbledore. He should no longer be that dumbed down plot device who only showed up in last chapter to sort out things. He would be that machiavellian puppet master who fought on the right side of history, and he would do lots of heavy lifting and maneuvering himself.

I would also get rid of the entire Roald-Dahlesque Dursley scheme. It made no sense to dump the hope of your nation into an abusive home, and the chance of getting your next deranged dark lord was just too high. Buying reader sympathy by letting heroes growing up in abusive household is way overused IMO.

--------------

Here, I'm basically continuing with the theory I've been proposing for some time: the Books were a test and PR campaign undertaken by the British Ministry of Magic. Its original goal was to identify Muggles' response to the concept of Magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded its most optimistic expectation. Not only were the great majority of Muggles happy with Magic, but those involved in this campaign made billions in profit off those gullible Muggles.

While key outcomes in the Books were not altered, actual details of that conflict greatly differed. As often the case in history, winners were highly praised, and losers mercilessly bashed.

--------------

Following this theory, the 'real' Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul (although he did perform several dark rituals to increase his magical power).

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World (one major point of the conflict was the governing structure of Magical Britain. Voldemort favored the traditional oligarchy in which 'Old Families' called the shots, while Dumbledore wanted to turn MoM into a centralized modern government. The boiling point was reached when Dumbledore tried to pass a law that slapped enormous inheritance tax as a mean to weaken the 'Old Families'.)

Tom Riddle had been teaching DADA from 1957 to 1968 when he resigned the post in protest. The war began in earnest when MoM tried to arrest him for his almost militant opposition to the Inheritance Tax in 1971. From then on, he adopted the mantle 'Lord Voldemort' as he completed a very important power boosting ritual.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership. He was also very protective of his loyal members, and went to great length to extract retributions for their sufferings.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore in a decisive engagement, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Magical Britain, and silenced most critics. The Trio, almost or exceeding the political skills of Octavian (the most famous case of a trio of teenagers seizing power), eventually earned legitimacy by improving the lives of most wizards and witches in Britain.

--------------

I'm indeed taking a page from the Roman history, in which the teenage trio Octavian/Agrippa/Maecenas (perhaps the only instance in our history) overthrew the government against heavy odds and established a lasting new order. Dumbledore and Harry would have a similar relationship as Caesar and Octavian. But of course, history would never repeat in the same way.

** The bigest mistake in the Harry Potter books was the prophecy saying that Harry would be Voldemorts equal. Because Harry never lived up to the hype.

There is also the fact that the first villains we meet the Dursleys win in the end because Harry becomes infected with there obsession with being "Normal".

** Ruined canon? Only in the way that highlights some of canon's shortfallings (terrible with numbers, no explanation to how magic actually works, demonizing an entire house, etc) but I have yet to actually read a story I like more than canon as a whole.

Your idea just reads like a generic fixit attempt with heavyhanded plotting using the author's foreknowledge. You're changing things, but everything is still the same, so what's the point?

** This may be an unpopular opinion but I hate book 7 so much. I feel like it's Harry Potter and the great camping trip and didn't satisfy me at all. Also, I refuse to acknowledge the epilogue.

I really wonder why fidelius wasn't explored to hide Harry away while they researched possible horcrux hiding places. It would have also been great to have seen more of what was happening at hogwarts during the death eater reign.

Remember the heroes had to suffer so readers will feel more for them!

They had to forget all simple solutions and become so stupid as to hang a Horcrux around their necks.

*** How to fix book 7 and convey the right messages:

- Hermione takes the Death Eater inside Grimmauld Place and wipes his mind/let Kreacher kill him (Voldemort betrayed Regulus, Death Eaters are working for Voldemort, Kreacher can avenge his master)

- Ditch Ron due to the Horcrux or not, I don't care.

- Seeing as their hunt is getting nowhere and the Ministry is literally building concentration camps the duo/trio gathers evidence.

- A pregnant Tonks turns up in Grimmauld Place since her husband ran off once more, ignoring the whole "in good and in bad times" of his marital vow (she knows the secret and it is not that hard to guess where Harry is hiding)

- The group takes the evidence to the ICW after leaving England on a plane, train or ship.

- Some ICW members are reminded of the Holocaust and actually do something about Voldemort using Hitler's playbook. If you want to add a certain irony have the German Empire/Prussia/Austria/whatever the magical equivalent of Germany is called lead these efforts.

- An anti-Voldemort Coalition invades Britain with a force of thousands, liberate the camps, cleanse the Ministry and face Voldemort

- Outnumbered at least 1000:1 Voldemort is eventually overwhelmed and either taken alive and strapped into magical restraints or simply executed.

- Harry can search for the remaining Horcruxes without worrying about all Death Eaters.

- Thorough cleanup of Britain, a Dark Mark earns you a lifetime behind bars, no exceptions.

- After "Teddy" is born make Harry the godfather and let him take care of the boy without killing off his mother (Lupin is out of the picture by now).

- Harry does not name children after the guys who made his life hell. Snape leaked the prophecy that got his parents killed and only turned due to an honestly creepy obsession with a married woman, Dumbledore left him at the Dursleys even though he knew of the abuse ("10 dark years") and did nothing to ensure the Death Eaters faced justice after the first war.

- As for pairings, I don't care at all as long as it is not canon pairings. Hermione/Tonks and Harry/Moonboy makes more sense for all I know.

***** I mean, I don't like him, but we don't need to turn him into a Death Eater in disguise or a rapist to avoid Ron/Hermione. Common sense is all that's needed. In this plot it would make sense for him to leave so that Harry and Hermione have nothing keeping them in Britain but it could still work with Ron in the picture.

** If I were to write it, Harry would have a personality and an active interest in what happens around him.

The Dursleys wouldn't be abusive. At worst, they would be deeply upset by Harry's use of magic, but they would have a way to contact Dumbledore, and he would end up taking Harry away and raising him himself. He'd have prepared Harry as a combatant.

Voldemort would have a list of honest grievances with Magical Britain and a plan of how to address them. If death were his primary fear, he'd have made his horcruxes, lived a normal life, and faked his death and an heir. My version would want a better future for the nation enough to risk death.

Either there's a much bigger thing about "the hat sorts you according to the virtue you need to cultivate" or Hermione goes to Ravenclaw and Neville to Hufflepuff.

Snape actually teaches. He's crabby and not very good at teaching, but he seems to have caught on that you have to explain things to people and even explain the reasoning behind some of it.

Either that or all the teachers are terrible. Like McGonagall starts with human transfiguration on the first day, and the first spell at Charms is colloquially known as Fiendfyre's little brother. One of the more common detentions is to dig out more mass grave for dead students, and teachers commonly single out students for crud. I saw at least one fic like that. Don't think I'd want to publish it myself, but it would make the story in general a lot more consistent.

** Number one resonates a lot with me. In general, I think the entire HP series does a bad job with representing mental health/depicting trauma, especially on young children and teenagers. The closest thing we get is Sirius' drinking problem after Azkaban, and even that is sort of stereotypical. I don't know, of course everything is from Harry's POV so we really don't know what's going on with characters like Ginny, Remus (who had his entire life just ripped out of his hands at five years old, like that's horrible), Hermione, even Ron in Philosopher's Stone when he gets into that chess match is horrible (I mean the kid is 11). But you're right totally right about Harry and the abuse he faced, constant shitting on his parents.

** Personally, my biggest issue with canon is Voldemort, more specifically the ideology he spouts to recruit people. So, he needs an ideological cause to gather followers. You might assume his was pureblood supremacy, but that literally cannot work.

After WWII you didn't have a bunch of nazis continuing to act like the nazis they were, chances are they were scared of what angry people, who had fought their ideology tooth and nail, would do to them. The purebloods who followed Voldemort would have made it very clear they were not racists, else they opened themselves up to retaliation.

In canon Draco commonly insults Hermione by calling her a mudblood, he clearly fears no retaliation nor does he receive any. If pureblood supremacy was the primary cause, chances are in book 2 Draco would have had his shit kicked in by someone who remembered losing family members to Voldemort after he publicly calls Hermione a mudblood in front of two quidditch teams.

So I really doubt their cause was pureblood supremacy, and we don't really know enough to come up with a clear cause that would get a few thousand people to fight for you in the wizarding world. But I can tell you that Rowling's idea is total bullshit, she didn't think it out.
