This is just a little thing that bothers me every time I read it. You know the story, people get outfitted with dragonhide or basilisk skin armor (wasn't the basilisk described as neon green?), and then the author drops the ball and makes the armor enchanted, or charmed.

Well, we know that Dragonhide and Basilisk Skin are both resistant to magic, much like trolls and probably a bunch of other animals and plants too. That means they can't be enchanted in any way! Indeed, you can't even use a spell on yourself when wearing them, like the popular temperature charms.

In fact, making them is probably even more of a pain in the ass, since wizards don't have non-magical ways to sew or cut or do any tailoring, and charms for that don't work on the materials. So you're left with using crude muggle methods to somehow shape these extremely tough materials.


** Smart authors put the enchantment on an inner lining, having muggles do the sewing.

*** That would probably be a good alternative, alongside enchanting your undershirt or the more magically-receptive bindings or metal parts.

** You usually enchant the thread, or the lining as the other comment said.

/Spellthread/ is a sort of common trope in some games.

** It's possible that dragonhide or basilisk skin - while spell resistant - would still be able to be affected by magic. You might just have to spend a /lot/ more effort doing so, but I don't think 'resistant' implies 'immune'.

For making using those materials, wizards already are able to make dragon hide items (boots, gloves, etc), so working with them is possible - and at least for dragon hide, it seems to be quite a high class/stylish material, so they're able to work them into something that looks good.

Color wise I believe the basilisk is dark green, but that its shed skin is the vivid/bright green.

We know that Madame Malkin uses "normal" sewing stuff (pins when she's fitting Draco, etc). She just makes them move on their own, similar to how Molly cooks. This seems to imply that clothing (including dragonhide clothing) is being created by objects manipulated by magic, rather through direct enchantments.

*** I think that 'resistance is not immunity' is the key phrase here. It's canon that dragon handlers use stunners to deal with dragons, iirc? Magic works on them, it just takes a shitload more effort.

** I personally like runes as a method of enchanting, and if you can get the runes into the material it is able to be enchanted.

** I don't know about the tailoring thing because, yes a spell can't effect it but why not a selfsewing needle and thread? The spell is on the needle and thread.

*** I guess it depends on if the material is magically resistant /through magic/ like a shield charm, or if it disrupts magic. In the first case, an animated tool would most likely work, but the second case would most likely make the enchantment not work.

**** I feel like it would be more like a shield charm since it takes dragon handlers several stunners to stun a dragon. Also the wiki on dragon hide says

“Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate...”

** There's usually a line about how dragonhide with enchantment is that much more expensive due to its resistance making it more difficult to enchant.

I've also seen a few where Harry has to relearn how to apparate because the spell resistance of the dragon hide makes it more difficult

** There was one fic (that I dropped, because wish fulfillment) where two paragraphs were wasted stating about how lucky Harry was when he fought it and how magic resistant the hide was. And then he uses some deux ex machina spell (from the Hogwarts Library) that magically renders the Basilisk down to parts. And then Another spell that magically converts the hide INTO ARMOR... Don't forget another spell that changes the armor back into the hide... Yes, the super OP mega armor can be easily defeated by a spell. Found in the Hogwarts Library...

BRILLIANT!
