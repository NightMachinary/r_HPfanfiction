I'm looking for fics in which Harry behaves and is similar to Tony Stonem from Season 1 of Skins (the TV show). So essentially Harry is good looking, charming, smart but also rather sociopathic on some level.

I suppose this is similar to Riddle-esque Harry, but I'd rather Harry not be quite on Tom's level. He should be able to care and feel for people, and not be insanely OP.
