** That's an interseting concept, I read similar idea on other fanfiction universe but never in the Harry Potter Verse.

You might change your tag from recommendation to Prompt/Request because I don't think it exists, OC/SI stories tends to go toward "fixing" the plot or becoming a powerful wizard/god, but personal enrichment and only fixating on wealth is rare or even non existent.

*** "cocks her head"

It actually does exist in one fic I've found, and it may be the only one of its kind. An AU Remus Lupin becoming a Mafia don esque crime lord known as the Uncle. It's a great read.

***** Yup. Copperbadge does a hell of a job with most of their stories and is one of the better fic authors I've found. The Uncle is one their finest and is hliarious. It also presents such an interesting AU take on Remus and the potential of magic in the Muggle World. Also the potential of importing muggle crime into the WW.

***** I've already published 3/4 of first year, with half of the Voldemort arc. Voldemort arc and invention arc overlap in second year, further development in third mostly fast forwarding, then there's the triwizard and the Greyback arc planned and the business arc won't really take off until sixth year when Fred/George graduate and start selling. I have everything planned out but at my current pace of writing it's going to take forever to get there.

It's not SI/OC, but an AU Remus Lupin who was raised in somewhat different circumstances that lead to him becoming a wealthy crime lord in both the Muggle and wizarding worlds. It involves the Trio getting involved in petty crime and showing why magic would be absoloutely /devestating/ in the Muggle world if the wizard or witch were clever enough.

** In Say a Prayer, Harry and the crew do something like this. They charm trashcans to sort soda/beer cans into one of their warehouses. They then magically remove the paint and melt it down. Sell the aluminum ingots via the goblins to the muggles for good money. They also bought landfills and used alchemy to separate the trash/pollution into its base forms and resold it back to the muggles. There were also boats that dredged trash for the same reason as above.

It wasn't money with no consequences either. The oil they ended up flooding the market with caused a terrorist group to form.

TL;DR: Magical Recycling for tons of galleons?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1149623][Disillusion, by Hermione Granger]] definitely satisfies this, but the essay format may not be for everyone.

If you're okay with the business empire being in the magical world, I'd highly recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][Business]].

** Why even bother? Just buy one of those magical trunks, Apparate into Fort Knox, steal all the gold, and take it to Gringotts. Or go on a bank-robbing spree using the same method. Always liked that Ancient Egyptian piece from the British Museum? Well, take it. It's not that hard. Apparition, Disillusionment, Confundus, Obliviate and the Imperius is all it takes to completely hoard all the wealth you can nab from the Muggle world.

In the canon world, the WW are completely cut off from all reality when it comes to Muggles. The supposed Muggle expert of the British ministry can't even pronounce electricity. As the Goblins say in so many cliche-riddled fanfics, /wizards are idiots./ Canon Potterverse is the most easily exploitable world in literature for any self-insert with half a brain.

Now, if you go into fanon... Well, you have to really watch your steps. The ICW most likely has wards over strategic, Muggle sites. They probably have a whole division scouring every website, news outlet, and tv station for any weird news that sounds like it's caused by magic. There is a magical signature which can be traced to you. There are probably all sort of talismans that would protect other wizards from the Imperius, and wouldn't surprise me if high-end muggle politicians are given such things too. It would be hard to exploit a lot of the fanon Potterverses. Not saying impossible, it could definitely be done. But much, much harder.
