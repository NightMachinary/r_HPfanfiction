When Viktor Krum asked, "Harry Potter? Vhat on earth are you doing?", the Boy-Who-Lived looked up and answered:

*"Yo Krum, I heard you like galleons,"* he motioned to the ship around them *"So I put some Galleons on your galleon so you can-"*

He never finished as about a dozen different Silencing Charms shot at him from all directions.


** Heh.

Though speaking of golden coins... Crack idea: Harry sneaks on board the Durmstrang ship at night time and stumbles upon a chest of galleons. Suckers, he thinks as he sneaks one coin out of the chest and steals off into the night. Just one, for good luck.

Years later, Voldemort's Killing Curse strikes him... and does nothing.

Harry Potter and the Curse of the Black Pearl.

****** The first movie is already considered a modern classic by some critics. Its a great movie with great characters.

The following ones were rather "meh". Johnny Depp created a fantastic character with Captain Jack Sparrow, only to make the character a caricature of itself in the sequels. Not to say that the sequels are completely bad, but they surely will never be considered modern classics by anyone.

******* Sometimes I feel like the only person in the world that actually really likes all the POTC films. (Except /Stranger Tides/, that was very meh; I really enjoyed /Salazar's Revenge/, though.) The initial trilogy are the only films I've rewatched as much as HP (although /Now You See Me/ is quickly gaining; fucking love that film) and I can never watch just one of them even if I start with /Dead Man's Chest/ or /At Worlds End/.

That said, thank you for finally mentioning /why/ the later films aren't as well liked as the first. I've spent years seeing people say that DMC and AWE aren't as good as CotBP, but no one ever actually said why and it's been driving me fucking nuts for years.

*** You know, I'm not actually sure. Normally it ends 'so you can [verb] while you [same verb].'

But I can't think of any verbs that would describe something you can do on a ship AND what you can do with some coins. Float? Parley? Sink? Transfer? Bank?

That last one could work. Bank as in tilt a ship, bank as in store money. Bank while you bank.
