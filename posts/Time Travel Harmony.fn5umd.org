Any recommendations where /both/ Hermione and Harry end up going back to the beginning of first year?

I'd love to see them go back as the best of friends and everyone seeing the ‘strangely close' bond that they both have even though they've only ‘just met' kind of thing.

Obviously it would develop into a Harmony. I would prefer something that didn't start with Harmony already established, I'd like to read the angst etc that leads up to it in the fic.

100k+ words preferred! Well written too, of course! Thank you!! :)

  In which Hermione attempts a time-travelling ritual without due preparation and Harry happily goes along for the ride, and both have to cope with living their best friend's life.
