This fic is great. I never thought I would enjoy something like this. If you'd like a different look one Petunias character, great writing and slice of life's stories you might enjoy this.

** It has two sequels from [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][the same author]]. And *SELF-AD* I have written my own sequel to “Petunia's Family Issues” (when it was only three chapters long) as linkao3(18770464).

  This was the craziest thing Petunia decided to do in her life: speak the truth. Also, how parents disappoint us.
