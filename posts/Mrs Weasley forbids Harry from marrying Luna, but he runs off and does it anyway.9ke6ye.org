I could have sworn I read a story like this several years ago. It may have been deleted by now, so finding it may be a long shot, but I believe there was a marriage contract with Ginny involved - which is why Molly was angry that Harry wanted to marry Luna instead.

The only other details I can recall are that I think it was some sort of AU - maybe a Victorian /Downton Abbey/-style setting - and Harry hadn't gone to school with Luna, so they met as adults.

Anybody think they may have a lead as to what this story was, please let me know.

*** Afraid not. I'm starting to wonder if I made this fic up in my head by combining two separate ones. Or else I'm having a [[/r/MandelaEffect]] moment.
