In this parodied trailer, every. Single. Wand. Has been replaced with a firearm of some sort. When Harry goes to Ollivander's, he gets a gun. Dumbledore blows out the lights in the muggle neighbourhood with a gun. Hagrid shoots Dudley. Hermione blasts her feather in Flitwick's class with a gun. Of course, this is all just an edit, but it's still hilarious!

** The entire movie was remade like that, not juste the trailer. Look a bit and you should be able to find it. It's quite the enjoyable watch, you're just watching Philosopher's stone and suddently there's a gun.

It has also been posted again and again everywhere even remotely Harry Potter related for a week or so.
