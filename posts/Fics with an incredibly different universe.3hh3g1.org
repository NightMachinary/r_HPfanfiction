Something like linkffn(reign of the serpent).


** The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig is a good example, although it's got some sci-fi elements, especially later on. Also, it's complete, which is always nice. There's even a sequel (which I haven't read), but it's both unfinished, and a Star Wars crossover.

Wit of the Raven is similar to Hogwarts Battle School in that Hogwarts is fiercely competitive, but it follows a different route - instead of duelling being the only measure of ability, the challenges are more varied. Nice world-building, with very minor magic-replaces-technology as well.

The Serpent and the Crown is an excellent example of world-building, to the point that large parts of the setting and magic aren't recognisable. There's a parallel dimension that wizards live in, instead of them hiding in the same world as the muggles. There are changes to the magic system, economy, school and a few of the characters (for example, Kingsley is a sailor).

I got really excited because I love Hedwig, but then I started reading and realized it was post-DH and so far canon-compliant. I'm going to read it anyway, because I love crazy sci-fi AU/xovers. =D

** - linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has a richer wizarding culture distinct from that of the Muggles, including some nice touches that seem obvious in retrospect.

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] takes place in a non-magic AU where "Wellesleys" and "Malenfants", as well as Harry and Hermione, attend "Harworts", a school for spies run by a "Dumont Appledore", where skill and technology (and occasional superscience) replace magic, even while "Death Strikers" terrorist group is making a comeback.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
