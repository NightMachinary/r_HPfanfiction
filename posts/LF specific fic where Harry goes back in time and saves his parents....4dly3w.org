Harry goes back in time to Godrics Hollow a few days (or perhaps weeks) before Halloween 1981 to save his parents. I'm pretty sure at least the first few chapters are from Lily's or James' point of view.

The only scene I remember is Harry sitting at the table with a hood or mask on and talking to James or Lily, and then he pulls the hood down and shows his face.

I'm pretty sure they enter a state of stasis or something and finally reveal their existence after Harry returns to the future.


** I know exactly which story you are talking about yet I can't remember the name of it. Damn it.

I should follow the example of those guys who favourite every story they read, I barely have 9 stories favourited in my account.

** I'm /pretty/ sure this is it. He stops Voldemort during the attack without making it look like anyone else was there. Puts James and Lily in a short stasis to make Voldemort think they're dead, then leaves after killing Voldemort.

*** This is definitely not the one I was talking about, but thanks for the rec.

The Harry in my story most definitely intended to back in time and save his parents, and IIRC he put them in stasis, so they would appear to see him after he returns to the future so as not to create a paradox.

**** There is one where H/Hr move in across the street but the name escapes me. It might contain that scene. Decent story but that's all I have..

I know I've read that scene where he lowers the hood but my memory is shot.. getting old isn't for sissys
