I'm looking for any fan fics that after Harry gets to Hogwarts he realizes that some of the teachers suck. Mainly for potions, DADA, and maybe history of magic. So he hires his own teachers/tutors for the classes.


** In RobSt story Knowledge is Power and his rewrite/revise version called Proud Parents. Harry starts off talking about getting tutors for potions and a few other subjects but then ends up starting his own school.

In the story Harry Crow by RobSt harry is raised by goblins and when he goes to hogwarts he brings tutors for potions and defense.

****** While I don't really care for /In This World and the Next/, for the most part, I actually like RobSt's stories. /Proud Parents/ even limits the bashing to mostly just Dumbledore.

******* I know, I've read quite a few of their fics. But the grandstanding and over-exaggerated Harry/Hermione moments are really not my cup of tea.

And Dumbledore bashing is something I really hate. Not because of my love for the character, but for the sheer stupidity behind the reasons for Harry/Hermione/any other self-righteous arse hating Dumbledore.

******** I think the only Dumbledore bashing I really really hated was when he was a colossal ****ing idiot in the fic, trying to be a manipulative chessmaster, to the point where he nearly died repeatedly because he kept skirting the edge of an Unbreakable Vow he made not to attempt to manipulate Harry in any way. If it only happened once in the story, fine, but it /just kept happening/.

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione

  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.
