Greetings! I've been lurking for a bit now, and am pleased to announce I've begun releasing an audiobook of Browncoat, Green Eyes. It's unabridged and dramatized through the use of sound effects, atmospheres, and music. My first release covers the prologue and chapter 1. I hope you enjoy listening to it!

I assume many here have read the story already, but for those who haven't, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][it can be read here]]


** I've just listened a little bit, but this is a cool project. Good production quality. Since I've already read the story I'm way too impatient to listen to the slow pace of your dramatization, but that's entirely subjective.
