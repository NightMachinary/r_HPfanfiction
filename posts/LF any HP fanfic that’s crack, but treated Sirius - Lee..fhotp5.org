** Very late, but...

linkffn(13230340) Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay.

The premise is effectively pure crackfic - Harry's a dragon. Somehow this goes unnoticed by everyone but Harry, until Hagrid shows up to deliver his Hogwarts letter.

The resulting story is actually really compelling and well-written for a self-proclaimed comedy-fic.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
