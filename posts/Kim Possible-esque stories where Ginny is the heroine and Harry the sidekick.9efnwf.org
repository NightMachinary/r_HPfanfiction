** Well, I wouldn't call Harry a side-kick, but in the Buffy-Crossover [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=27958]["Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller"]], Ginny activates as a Slayer. Which makes her super-athletic and strong, and she easily outperforms him in the fight after Dumbledore's death, which might fit your request.

** Now I can't help imagining Voldemort as Dr. Drakken and Bellatrix as Shego.

The irony is Harry would be the Ron in this metaphor.

*** I mean, Harry basically fumbled his way to success, Ginny had another boyfriend while Harry was crushing on her, they had a school dance where they didn't go together...

This crossover basically writes itself.

**** And Ron acts as Rufus. Our Ron not cartoon Ron.

** You want to ask this question in [[/r/harryandginny][r/harryandginny]].

This premise is very interesting and especially plausible, if Ginny's ability was boosted by the Diary. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9631998/1/][The Thorny Rose]], linkffn(9631998), starts with Ginny being dominant, but Harry still takes over in its sequels.

#+begin_quote
  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
