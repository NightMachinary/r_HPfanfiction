Hello there.... I am searching for a Harry Potter fanfic story I had read quite some time back on FanFiction.net that was either lost or removed in the “mature content purge”. In my attempts to track it down, here was suggested as a possible resource to find lost stories. The story is “What a way to go” by Severely Snaped. The general summary is Snape was auctioned off at a Christmas charity auction. Thank you in advance for any help or assistance!


** Not looking good, only one google result, that being a link to a 404ed page. I'm currently extracting a 100 gb zip file full of hp fanfics to search it but i dont think its in there.

** Nope not in the archive. I think your best bet would be to try to contact Severely Snaped and see if they have a copy.
