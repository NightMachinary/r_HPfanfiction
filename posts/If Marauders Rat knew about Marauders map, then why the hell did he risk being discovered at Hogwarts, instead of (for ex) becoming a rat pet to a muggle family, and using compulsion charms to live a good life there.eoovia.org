#+TITLE: If Marauders Rat knew about Marauders map, then why the hell did he risk being discovered at Hogwarts, instead of (for ex:) becoming a rat pet to a muggle family, and using compulsion charms to live a good life there?

** Personally, I always thought he just happened to wander in to the Weasley place, found it was a pretty good ride with Molly making a crapload of food all the time, and then just metaphorically went to sleep for a decade - basically 'becoming' a rat or falling into the instincts, I forget how it is that people always talk about the animagus transformation.

Either that, or maybe he's just an ignorant Pureblood who wouldn't have the first idea of where to go in the Muggle world, or just knowledgeable enough to know we would probably just kill a rat on sight instead of adopting it. Bubonic Plague stereotypes and all.

** I think Remus asks Harry where he got the map, since he knew it had been confiscated at some point. This makes me think Peter knew it had been confiscated as well but wasn't being used. That made it an acceptable risk to go back since there was little to no chance he'd ever show up on the map.

*** The map was gone before they left Hogwarts. And there wasn't really anyone left who knew what it was and how to use it.

** Well, they put security measures on the map (a password) to ensure no one could read it and it was with Filch, so that Harry ended up with it and was able to read it is not exactly likely. And staying close to the wizarding world had the benefit of keeping him informed of what was going on, eg if Voldemort returned

** A rat can't just wander up to a muggle and count on being adopted. We don't know if he had any particular skill at compulsion charms, the imperius curse, or whatever to try to improve his chances.

*** He had Black as a friend, who have could give him some books from Black's Library, and a Death Eater not able to use Imperius curse? Please...

**** Which Black? Sirius hated everything his family stood for, so he wouldn't act as their librarian. Death Eaters may have all been interested in Dark arts, but that doesn't mean they all had the opportunity or aptitude to learn them. Peter's specialty was sneakiness, not forcefulness.

If you're writing some fanfic that requires Peter to be good at some Dark art, it's certainly possible, but that's not the only interpretation, or even the most likely one.
