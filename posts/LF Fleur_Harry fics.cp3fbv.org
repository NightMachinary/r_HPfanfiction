I am looking for long(100k+) Fleur Harry fics, I've read a few on AO3 and a few on Ffn that were decent, however most of them end as soon as Harry and Fleur get together. Which sucks! Rating doesnt matter.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
