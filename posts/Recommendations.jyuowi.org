Two things, I can't quite work out how to navigate through the page in order to find where people have previously recommended what I'm looking for? Is there a search bar somewhere?

But I'm looking for long fanfiction, preferably multi year... I have read a lot, DangerVerse, Innocent series, A Marauders plan, etc etc. Just searching for more well written long fanfiction


** When you are in the hpfanfiction subreddit there is a search bar on top, write what you are looking for there, example: Long Fanfiction, when you press enter you will get a search where it shows all of reddit, but right under the tab "Best result you can click a line that says show results from [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]], there you will find older threads that people have made with the keywords you have typed.

An alternative source is to use [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Scryer (darklordpotter.net)]] . Just put in what you want there.\\
If you put +Harry -Draco it will search for fics that have Harry in the title/summary and no Draco in the Title/summary.

For you who are looking for long fics there is a tab at the bottom of the page where you can choose long fics.

Good luck.

** what are you looking for in terms of length? I've got recommendations for everything from 100k+ up to 750k+ but I don't want to throw a bunch of links at you with no other info, that doesn't help anyone.
