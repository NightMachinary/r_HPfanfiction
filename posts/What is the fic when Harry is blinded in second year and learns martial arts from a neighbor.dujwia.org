**** I'm still searching. I swear I got it from a rec list. It's just which one. And I originally thought I had it in my bookmarks but I probably cleaned them out recently. Still looking. I know there is an unfinished one that is similar called the blind boy I believe but I know there is a completed one that I believe he lived on his own and started training.
