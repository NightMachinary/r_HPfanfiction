#+TITLE: Is it just me or anyone else thinks that Harry warning Ron about the locket trying to fight from being destroyed, based on what happened with the diary, just ludicrous and with zero logic to it, despite the fact that he ended up being right ?

*** Because the diary was only able to put up a fight because it had nearly finished draining Ginny, and therefore had a semi corporeal body.

** The Diary Riddle did put up a fight, and since the locket had been with them for a while, it would be reasonable to think, that locketRiddle had nibbled on their souls enough to make some form of an appearance.

** "Harry using his experience with a similar object to caution Ron is stupid, even though he was correct."

** The locket had already tried to drown Harry at that point, so i think it was a pretty safe guess.

** Well, given that the Diary tried to kill Harry, and the ring tried to kill Dumbledore, expecting the locket to put up a fight is hardly illogical. Why would Harry expect the third Horcrux to be any different than the two before it?
