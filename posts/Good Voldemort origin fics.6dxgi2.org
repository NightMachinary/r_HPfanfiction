** Linkffn(witchcraft by a picture by anyavioletta) is something I'm partial to as it's canon compliant and a sort of romance that I think would be believable for Tom Riddle as he grew up.

  If you think that Hogwarts was squeaky clean in the 1940's, think again. Sex, drugs, violence, love, jealousy, and a bit of murder... Welcome to Hogwarts! Tom Riddle/OC, Alphard Black/OC, OC/OC. Rated M
