I just love for there to be logic and realism in my fics. It's not a judgement against those who like time travelling Founder!Harry fics or something (I'm a Draco/Hermione shipper so I cant judge lol), but I just don't understand the appeal of them. Can someone explain?

And before the retaliatory comments happen, draco and hermione are appealing on many levels, but I understand why people wouldn't see that. Different strokes y'all.

Draco was just a not-so-evil coward. He couldn't hold a candle to Ron's character.

And it is and could be realistic giving certain circumstances. People aren't there 17 year old selves forever and I think a lot of people have a hard time seeing past that.

**** The fact that he, as a pureblood who could have laid low, sticked his neck out for Harry and Hermione against overwhelming odds is enough testament to his character. Do you have friends like him?

--------------

And don't give me the vibe about him abandoning his friends. I firmly think it was mostly caused by the Locket Horcrux. Just minutes after taking that thing off, Ron regretted his decision, but then he ran into a snatcher squad and was held up. By the time he got free, Harry and Hermione already left and their protections were too good for Ron to find them again.

It was Harry who got that brilliant idea to wear a Horcrux around their necks. It was utterly insane IMO. Why the other two didn't object was beyond me. Harry had as much to blame for Ron leaving as Ron himself, and he seemed to feel partially guilty about that. In the subsequent weeks, he was constantly worrying that Hermione would leave him as well.

So when Ron came back in such a spectacular fashion (saving his life, destroying the Locket), he was more than happy and relieved.

--------------

Then there are people who complained that Ron was 'useless'. Well, he hadn't done a lot from Book 4-6, but he accomplished a LOT in Book 7:

- Stunned Rudy Lestrange, potentially killing him, in the Flight of 7 Potters
- Prevented the other two from saying Voldemort and triggering Taboo
- Saved Harry from the pond
- Destroyed the locket Horcrux
- Disarmed Bellatrix at Malfoy Manor
- Took great care of Hermione in the aftermath
- Came up with the idea of using Basilisk fangs
- Opened CoS with fake parseltongue
- Saved Harry again in RoR
- Brought down Greyback together with Neville

--------------

How many of us can claim to have a friend like him in our lives? He perhaps made ONE major mistake during 7 years, as a 14 years old; and he deserved YOUR eternal hate?

***** His family was already known to rub elbows with Dumbledore, couple that with the fact that all of them were considered Blood Traitors before that, and you have the reason that he wasn't safe at all (even while staying low).

The Horcrux just brought out the feelings that were already there, he was clearly doubting Harry, to begin with. If you don't believe that, just look at when Harry wore it himself (Paranoia increased, Fear of failing increased etc...) he already had all those things, it was just amplified.

1.)Stunning someone doesn't mean much, but I'll give it to you. 2.)Wouldn't have needed that if Harry used his Skill of Learning High-Level Spells over the Summer to actually be useful (seriously, one second he is capable of defeating hundreds of Dementors, the next he is getting destroyed by Snatchers). 3.)Harry wouldn't have needed saving if he used the bubble-head charm. 4.)Harry could have destroyed it as well. 5.)Disarming someone isn't a feat, Harry's best spell was a Disarming Charm, does that mean he is the most powerful wizard in the series? Nope. 6.)What did he do to take care of her with great care? And which aftermath are you even referring to? 7.)Another Plot Bunny, the only reason he came up with it is because Rowling wanted it, I'm 100% sure that Harry was the one who originally thought of it (after all, he was the only one in the Chamber). 8.)This isn't even explained in the slightest, how Ron managed Parseltongue when it is a Slytherin blood-only trait is beyond me. I think it was another Plot-Bunny to show how awesome Ron is (despite nothing leading up to it). 9.) Getting the movies confused with the Books, Ron did not save Harry in the ROR. 10.)I'll give him that too, despite us never seeing how/when he had time to learn enough magic to deal with Greyback.

Yes to the last question. Just...Yes.

** I do prefer low-key, low-fantasy character driven stories myself and I tend not to read stories which break canon though I really like stories set outside canon.

Thinking about it, in my own fanfiction writing, magic is probably rather less superpowered and with greater rules and limitations than is suggested by canon, and I do interweave the Muggle and wizarding worlds a lot. I admit I don't understand the appeal of superpowered magic/wizards and the more extreme AUs but that's probably because of me age.

** I'm curious just how realistic you're preferring. Non-magic AU's don't feel like Potter stories so much as teen-soap-opera labeled to sucker in the unwary.

On the flipside, illogical power fantasy wank leaves a different kind of saccharine taste. The only advantage is that the writers of those sometimes include an insight on canon characters or inventive use of spells in combat or some kind of comedy worth a chuckle.

And no, not non-magical AU's. I've read a few, and I agree that they just tend to be teen soap opera's. I'm sure there are a few out there that are good, but I likes me magic in my HP fic.

** I sometimes find myself looking for realism in Harry Potter that more closely aligns with what a normal real person would experience versus what the Harry Potter character would experience.

For example, I really enjoy post-battle fics that deal with the emotional repercussions of the war, especially on the relationships between Harry and Ginny, and Ron and Hermione to a lesser extent. I like fics that have them go through relationship issues based on the effects of the war and just normal life, because I feel in real life, a typical couple would have these issues. I often forget to view the characters within their own world and instead of asking "would Harry and/or Ginny really have this emotion," I ask would a person in the real world have this emotion and then apply it to the characters.

Then I wind up in friendly disagreements on reddit over whether Ginny would have been mad at Harry or if such a story that had them experience issues would be contrived or not.

Slightly off topic, but I will say this: I think in regards to post-battle fics, people sometimes get too stuck on a character acting true to how we read them in the original series and forget that the war could very well change them. Yes, there are clear examples of characters written tremendously OOC in fanfiction. But I'm fine with a character behaving differently after the war so long as it can be justified by the actual events. Harry being super cheerful or Draco being a really good guy with a heart of gold after the war are completely unrealistic and OOC. But Harry being an emotional wreck is not completely unrealistic, IMO.

***** Social justice warrior hehe. And it's Miss. I'm also a feminist if you'd like to dig into that.

There are waaay more unrealistic relationships out there. Mostly cross-generational ships string to mind. How many novels are written about people who are polar opposites who learn to care for one another, even in friendship, even when they were terrible enemies before? Thousands. Millions. Their changing dynamic the deeper they delve into each other and discover their own and each others authenticity. It's a slow burn, a cold glass of water after a long hot day.

You're claim of unplausibility of their relationship denotes a lack of imagination and open-mindedness on your end, not lack of realism on mine.

Realism in a Magic world is exactly why you're a Dramoine shipper. You have no imagination, you don't enjoy the books for what they are, so you read a story where characters are something they're not.
