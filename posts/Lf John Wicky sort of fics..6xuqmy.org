Just think about how awesome this would be like my dream fic is Cho Chang killing an invisible intangible snorkack or whatever when she's stealing stuff so Luna breaks out her supplies from the false bottom of her trunk and goes on a rampage through Ravenclaw with nameless Order members bursting out of +fucking nowhere+ secret passages to try to stop the slaughter but they fail and it all culminates with a Luna vs Dumbledore knife fight at the top of the Astronomy tower while Chang desperately tries to make her escape.

Wouldn't that be so fucking cool?

*** I found one where he goes full witchhunt with torture and stuff after Cedric gets offed. It's not actiony enough for me though. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12140398/1/The-Purge][The Purge]]
