** Parade of the Sun is amazing, as is The Fallout. Another long time favorite is Silencio and the Bracelet. Ahh! As I'm writing, I'm realizing how many fics I love and that I can't really choose a favorite. :O

** I am kind of split between Parade of the Sun and Turncoat, but it has been a long while since I read that pairing.

To Begin Again looks very interesting, added it to my list.

** This is shorter than your 100k requirement, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9076506/1/For-Her-Favor][For Her Favor]] by Captainraychill is one of my HP all-around faves.

** That is absolutely my favorite one I've ever read. I'm so sad it hasn't been updated since June...

That being said, I also enjoy A Regular Life a lot and think it's pretty fun as well. Nowhere near as dark but I really like it! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9018291/1/A-Regular-Life]]

Eros and Psyche is also pretty well written, still being updated, and is very smutty. I enjoy it because of the variety of pairing involved, definitely over 100k, actually a bit longer than TBA.

**** I've been following it on fanfiction.net and yeah, it hasn't been touched since September 2013... which is unfortunate because at the time I found it, it was being updated relatively frequently.

** Isolation was excellent. It's really easy to find on Fanfiction.net. Filter Hermione, Romance, sort by favourites or follows.
