Tell me what you think.


** Sadly it's not a good fic, there are serious problems with both style and substance.

Let's start with style, the writing is rather clunky and dry. This is serious problem here, because to write scenes with boggarts well, you need to convey characters' emotions and sadly you didn't manage to do that.

But let's not put style over substance. Fanfics allow to something new, that weren't in canon, I will even say more, there is no point to showing what we already seen. And this fic doesn't really show anything new. Of course we haven't seen Slytherin's boggarts earlier, but the fears aren't new and aren't interesting. There is also a crucial mistake. It's not Riddikulus spell that defeat's the boggart. It's laughter. And nobody in the whole fic laughed.

Generally, boggart encounters are hard to pull out well. They work better if we know more about character and their fear. The second thing is mentioned earlier matter of language. Fear is an emotion, and the writing needs to convey this emotion well enough to work.

But what really killed the emotional impact was sole focus on Lupin's thoughts. He was well prepared to face his fear, and even that face off was practically ignored. But the titular "skeletons" belonged to students, and showing their thoughts as they faced their own fears would give much needed substance to this fic. After all, we didn't have occasion to look into their thoughts in canon.

An example of what I think, is boggart encounters done right. There are probably better ones, but this show all crucial points.

#+begin_quote
  "Mister Goldstein!"

  As he approached, the flames transformed into a vision of a rabbi he'd known well -- only this man was looking at him with hate and disgust written on his face.

  M'khashephah lo tichayyah.

  The rabbi's form flickered, becoming one of his friends from childhood, a young girl who pointed an accusing finger at him.

  M'khashephah lo tichayyah.

  Again and again the form shifted, becoming each one of the many people he knew from synagogue.

  M'khashephah lo tichayyah.

  And they repeated those words -- those hateful hateful words that translated to "Thou shall not suffer a witch to live."

  Against them, what could he do? Raise his hand and cast a spell, thus revealing himself to be exactly what they accused him of being?

  He...he...

  ...but the point was rendered moot when he too was pulled away from the Boggart by a rope of enchanted light.

  (...)

  And so on and on it went until at last Matou Shinji was called to the front, with the Boggart taking the form of a wizened old man with a gnarled cane -- a man who was almost a shriveled, hairless version of Alastor Moody. He looked harmless enough, with olive-green kimono and a charcoal-grey haori, but there was a sense of malevolence and danger that radiated from every move the man made.

  "Useless," the man spat. "You are indeed a disgrace to the name of Makiri."

  "No."

  "You and your father both. No, you are worse. Your good-for-nothing father left an even more worthless son. The only one worthy of anything was your repl---"

  "Riddikulus!" Shinji snarled, as the shape before him changed, the old man's form catching fire as Matou Zouken screamed, strange, unnatural sounds issuing from his throat as he writhed and twisted and howled in the heat of the fire.

  And at the sight of his nightmare burning away to ash, Matou Shinji simply laughed and laughed and laughed.

**** Not really, it helps to know Fate/Zero (as it is firmly canon for this fic), but all necessary information is provided within fic. Be advised that, this is second part of the story, the first is linkffn(Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone).

** Please work on your punctuation. Commas should go at the end of quotes like this:

#+begin_example
   "This is a really nice apple," he said.
#+end_example

You screw up your punctuation quite a lot, usually by not adding enough commas.

With a proofreader/beta/someone of the nature, your writing could certainly become fairly promising. But if I might be a bit brutally honest, right now the writing level isn't really high enough for me to read it as proper fiction- it kinda reads like it was written by an eighth grader.

If you want me to pick out some examples of where exactly you've gone wrong, I'd be happy to help.

As for the actual story itself, it's quite interesting, but it's really a little too short for me to say much.

**** I actually quite like this. Besides the obvious spelling and punctuation errors I was intrigued, I find myself wanting to know more, especially with the ending and to me that makes a good fan fic. Keep tweaking the story and it will be brilliant :)

** Your punctuation was a bit odd, especially placing periods and question marks after the quotation marks.

But let's get to the more important part. I really liked the idea of repeating the boggart lesson with the Slytherins. I enjoyed reading Lupin's thoughts about Slytherin at the start of the story.

The boggarts were all quite serious. I liked the idea of Draco's boggart, as the love for their family is the one redeeming quality of the Malfoys, but I think it's more fitting of sixth year Draco than third year Draco. I'd generally expect some more "silly" boggarts from some of the third year students, for example from Crabbe or Goyle. Maybe you could have started with the funny ones, and gradually have made them more serious. Your characterization of Nott was very interesting and a bit terrifying. I didn't see that one coming.

The most important part is that the characterization was good and the premise of the story was interesting. Wording and flow will improve with practice.
