I am looking for fanfics where Harry is sorted into Slytherin house and slowly rise in it's power line. And they must have h/hr pairing.(but It should be a sub plot)

I have already found many slytherin dark Harry stories like /the prince of slytherin/ or /on the way to greatness/. But none of them features h/hr. I once read a story called /the warlock of slytherin/(which was perfect). But it's abandoned.

So please suggest me some great and lengthy stories.


** The only one I can think of is this one:
