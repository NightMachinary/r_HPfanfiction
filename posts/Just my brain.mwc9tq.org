Ok here me out, its 5th maybe 6th year, harry is in a cranky mood cuz the dursley, hes walking alone, snape walks by, just kind of watching as 5 slytherins, the usuals you know, Draco, Theo, Blasie, Crabbe, and Goyle. They bicker back and forth, someone insults harrys parents... the usual. Harry pulls out his wand, Draco rasies an eyebrow, "Potter its 5 against 1" Harry who is annoyed, comes back with his hidden sassy and sarcastic side and says, "Thats fine, you can go get a few more people so it'll be a fair fight."

This was just in my brain and I had to put it somewhere.


** I can see this, he's (Harry) so used to fighting adults that people his age would seem like no challenge.
