:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fic a while ago where the pure blood families still had to follow certain traditions (as payment for having magic?).

Hermione for some reason was selected by magic as a representative of the Prewett family and one or two others, and she and Molly talked about what was expected of her.

It's sort of an arranged marriage fic, but I can't remember who she ended up with. It might have been Draco? I know Kingsley was the officiator at the meetings.

If anyone could help me out I'd really appreciate it!

Edit: Solved! :)

  COMPLETE: An ancient power has required generations of purebloods to pledge their lives to the blood pact. Draco has long known he was born to uphold this tradition... but Hermione's parents have secrets, hidden details about her heritage, and soon it will be her turn to cast in with fate.

** Was it the Firebird Trilogy?

Warning! The words “Alternate Universe” do NOT do it justice. Extreme AU. Throw out everything you know about the HP-verse, it's useless to you here...

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
