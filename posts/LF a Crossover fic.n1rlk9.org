*** I was really enjoying this story. Until the last chapter had so many Norse words in it that it might as well have been written in Norwegian. I really hope the author gets as tired of inserting those special characters as I am of reading around them.

  “Doctor! It's spiking again.” To which, the Cube sparked one more --a much larger spike to the previous. “What's that?” Before Fury could so much as tense, eye on the Cube, it sparked again --for the ground and walls to visibly shake.It continued to spark some more, bigger each time - to which a beam of energy was suddenly brought forth and -an explosion... Once visual on the platform returned, it was only for Fury to tense further.Confusion and concern ran through him as he took in the several unknowns now of the platform, each more confusing than the last. In the centre was a dark haired kid - ten or eleven if Fury had to guess - complete with a bloodied sword in his hand. Yet, they were not the oddest thing. That was reserved to the brightest tropical bird he had ever seen, complete with a wide colourful wing span and a long back tail rivalling that of a peacock's, which flew in suspension above the boy.
