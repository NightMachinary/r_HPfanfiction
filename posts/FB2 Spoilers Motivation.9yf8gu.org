Grindelwald didn't have a lot of motivation in the Harry Potter series. We knew he was a Dark Lord. We know that Dumbledore defeated him during a time period which overlapped with WW2. With the publication of Deathly Hallows we knew that he had a desire to rule that Albus attempted to temper with the rational that Wizards ruling over Muggles would make a better world for everyone.

But good god the scene beneath the tomb worked for me. I completely bought the vision that he was selling. A vision of the devastation World War 2 would cause. Most of the Witches and Wizards he was speaking with came of age in a time just before, during, or right after The War to End All Wars. They had seen Europe devastated as Muggles killed each other with the efficiency of the industrial revolution. The idea of it happening again, in a relative blink of the eye for the life span of a Witch or Wizard, capped off by a look at an atomic nightmare......

*shiver*

I get it. Say whatever you want about the rest of the movie (I have thoughts both good and bad after having watched it twice), but I get Grindelwald now in a way I don't think I did before. I hope that there are move movies, because I want to see it get from here to the War itself, and see what role he plays around it.


** Yes, this! Honestly there were many things I disliked about the movie, and many things that I loved. Grindelwald's speech was in the latter category. I can totally buy what he is selling. Also before this movie I really dislked Depp as Grindelwald, but that scene totally changed my mind.

** Kowalskis reaction, as a veteran of WW1, was heartbreaking, the emotion in his voice and on his face sold it for me.

*** Very much this. My wife and I are both army vets who were on active duty when 9/11 happened and for a good chunk of time afterwards. I can't imagine what it would have been like to go through WW1, much less to live long enough to see WW2.

** More than that, Grindelwald's vision is a true prophecy. The movie's set in 1927. The discovery of the neutron, which led to the fact that the nucleus can be split, and thus the nuclear bomb, happened in 1932...

The destruction shown in that vision is both unprecedented and unimaginable to them, magical or muggle.

I hope he's trying to prevent the war but ends up actually causing it. Which eventually ends up in the dropping of the nuclear bombs on Japan.

After all, he eventually repents and shows remorse for what he did.

I'd prefer him to be a tragic person who did all the wrong things for the right reasons rather than just another evil Dark Lord.

*** This fits in well with the prophecy about Harry/Neville whereby Voldemort was the one who made it significant by acting on it. I hope FB goes into something like what you described, with Grindelwald being instrumental in causing or escalating World War 2 despite that not being his intention.

** There are supposed to be 5 movies from my understanding... Imo one of the reason the 2nd was average(besides high standards for hp books and movies) it just seems to me like they are making 3 movies and stretching it into 5 making most of the movies just filled with filler... But hopefully the next one isn't too bad...

It reminds me of LOTR's great movies, "prequel" in the hobbit movies.. 2 real long movies that probably should have been 1 long movie, but that's what happens when big companies get a hold on these things, squeeze every last drop of money out

*** Honestly, Jo always said that 1945 would be the endgame for Fantastic Beasts, I think a trilogy wouldn't cut it. That said though, some plots felt like filler in Crimes, but the final scene dramatically changes everything.

**** That's just about all filler movies in series, they all end with a crazy scene so you'll come back for more.... It's even done in episodic games, just about all have a middle episode that's just filler.

Like I said above I didn't think it was bad, it was just average and maybe it's just my high standards of HP and J.K. but I expect more than average..... I'd much rather have 3 good movies in a 3 movie series than 2 and a half good to great movies in 5(I'd imagine 1, last half of 4, and 5 will be(or is) the good great parts of the series

***** The middle part of the film is average, the opening and the final scenes are easily the high points...truly breathtaking

****** I felt the beginning was a bit slow as well, but Now imagine how good the movie would be with the beginning, very abbreviated middle, the end and then the next part of the series....

**** To each their own, but spreading something that should be 3 movies to 5, without filling it with great content, doesn't work for most people.

That being said a lot of people (me including are judging it against the Harry Potter movies/books which are so nostalgic to us, it's hard to match up

Also as a side note even though I try not to pay attention to much of what JK says outside of the books I feel she's kinda painted herself into a corner with all the lore she has personally created, and it not necessarily matching these movies
