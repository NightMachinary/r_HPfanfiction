Hey guys, i've already searched in the entire internet about this but never found out something at least well written.

What im looking for is a fanfiction where Draco and Harry became friends and Draco ends up paired with Hermione, i would preffer something with Harry paired with some unusual female, like Daphne, Susan or even OC.

The fanfiction has to focus on Draco and Harry friendship as well as on the pairings.

It not has to be necessarily a Slytherin Harry fanfic (But i don't have any problems if you guys remember some), or a fanfiction where he and Draco became friends from the start, they can create a friendship after they became rivals in the school.

Extra points: Good Dumbledore, Ron bashing and prefferable a more confident Harry, a bit pompous and cocky due to his relationship with Draco.

Sorry about the errors in the language (My first language is very different from english :P)

That's it !


** The pairings aren't a major focus of the fic, but !linkffn(Moratorium) has Harry being friends with Draco and ends with Hermione and Draco getting together.
