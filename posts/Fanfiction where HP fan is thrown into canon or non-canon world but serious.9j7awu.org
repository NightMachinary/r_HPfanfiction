Preferably non mary-sue gary-stue. When I say serious I mean the fan doesn't automatically know what they are doing or is super important.


** I've read some for Tokyo Ghoul but don't recall any for Harry Potter. Excited to see what gets recommended.

** Try linkao3(Rose petal red) At first it doesn't seem like much. To many swearing and OC seems OP. BUT it really gets better. The author did a lot of things the right way, so anything else can be forgiven.

  I'm a little upset with the creativity of my and my twin's names. I get that it's because our father's name is Arthur, and I was an unexpected --- though pleasant --- surprise. But Guinevere is just the English version of Ginevra! That's so- Wait. What do I even care about that? I'm the eighth Weasley. In the Harry Potter universe. Ginny is my twin sister. Oh god. (Well, at least magic is super cool. Right?)
