I have found very few stories like that and I was wondering if anyone knows of any like that. One in particular I am interested in because I have only found one on wattpad and cant find again is female weasley twins.


** Please note that the Recommendation flair is for when you're recommending a fic to us. Use the Request flair when searching for fics that fit within certain criteria. The flairs are explained on the sidebar: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/meta/flair]]

^{Sorry, I can't contribute. The only fic I know of that matches your criterion was already recommended.}

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Proof of Concept) and linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9666689/1/A-Beautiful-Collision]]) are all I got. The first doesn't entirely count, since it's basically a prologue to a longer fic that never got written, but I enjoy it for what it is. The second is amazing, but it hasn't updated in six years, although the author is still active on the site and has said that they might go back to it.

  The Dursleys resolved to have as little involvement, positive or negative, in Harry's life as possible, and when he finally receives his Hogwarts letter, Harry isn't what people were expecting: intelligent, calculating, and proud, Harry is set to take the wizarding world by storm, starting by building a group of worthwhile friends. (Independent!Harry, Fem!Draco)

  Voldemort isn't a man. Ginny Weasley died in the Chamber. Twin divergences, though insignificant compared to the infinite majesty of the universe, spell a destiny irrevocably altered. Watch as Harry's life, the lives of those around him, and eventually the fate of Magical Britain herself are affected by his slowly-growing relationship with a female Tom Riddle.

** There aren't very many out there that I've found. !linkffn(A Life Twice Lived) is Harry/fem!Draco, and !linkffn(Power is Control) is Harry/fem!Voldemort (a pairing that is very much not for everyone). !linkffn(Holly Potter and the Witching World) might also count, as it's an AU in which 90% of the magical population is female. It's too early for pairings to be a major part of the story, though

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, the cupboard which her aunt and uncle never let her go near... and what did it all have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about in hushed tones? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)
