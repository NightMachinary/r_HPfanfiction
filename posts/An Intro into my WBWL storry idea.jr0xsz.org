I just read a post about someone's ideal WBWL story and thought well that's a bit cliche and has been done before so I thought I would go out and present my head scenario because I think I have a good story idea for a WBWL story but no idea how to post it on Fanfiction.net and I'm probably too lazy to write more than one chapter so here goes an intro into my head WBWL Story:

Charles Potter, 6th year Gryffindor and Boy who lived was not having a good time. Professor Snivilus Snape was ruining his favorite subject, Ron and Hermione were constantly bickering, and his annoying Brother who he was forced to share a dorm with was way too happy for his liking.

The little shrimp had grown over the Summer and stood now at an impressive 1,86m ( sorry don't know the other measurement system). His annoying twin brother had sadly for him received the better results out of the DNA lottery. Whist I have mum's red fiery hair and dad's eyes harry received the opposite. Raven black hair and piercing green eyes adorned his head and I would be lying if I said I was not jealous.

But his good looks were not the reason for Harry's happiness, it was Halloween and nobody knew why. The boy was always more happy around the 31 and he couldn't understand why. It probably should be him who should be happy about that date. He got proclaimed to be the boy who lived at that date and got the V-shaped Scar that signaled Voldemorts defeat and gave him the life of fame and fortune he enjoyed so much. But no it was Harry who was happiest around Halloween not him.

Harry always snuck out early during the feast and disappeared. The following day he would show up early in the morning well-rested and in high spirits and nobody knew why. This behavior started when he was eight and repeated every following year since then. And today he would find out!

His brother had left the feast, like every year, quite early and headed out of the great hall in a hurry but this year I followed him and saw him ducking into an abandoned classroom and closing the door behind him with a looking charm. I cursed myself this will take some time to get undone but then after a minute, I heard Harry speak inside.

"I know I tell you this every Halloween but I never wanted any of you to die for me! Remus I.." was all his brother got out before I managed to unlock the door and stumble into the room.

Right before my eyes were the ghosts of Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and Lili and James Potter, four people I knew were still alive, and right in the middle of the room stood my brother, wide-eyed and in shock holding a tiny black stone with the symbol of the deathly hallows.

That's it for the intro. If you're wondering where this is going write it in the comments and ill answer.

If you want to continue the story from here feel free to do so just post the link to it here so that I can read it.


** It is good as you are directly entering into the main plot before showing what happened on Halloween and so on.

*** That was the plan many "Wrong/Other boy who lived" stories get bogged down with the same introduction that everyone uses those events can be explained throughout the story.

plus I often find that the power scaling often progresses too fast thus I decided to start in one of the later years it gives the author more liberties when creating skillsets for the characters.

I think that no first year should be capable of using all of the 7th year spells at the beginning 1 or 2 ok but to enter Hogwarts as an Auror and the teachers not noticing is just completely unrealistic and boring because no one can challenge the MC
