** Always came across as highly pretentious and elitist. Gatekeeping what is good and isn't good fanfiction as if they were the absolute authority on the subject. Never forgave TheSanti for abandoning his stories on FF.net to write exclusively there.

** I think that discussing DLP here leads to a shitfest far more often than not, and as such we should avoid doing so.

*** Especially considering that the person behind this account (and many others, listed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8esbrp/why_is_ronhermione_hated_so_much/dxxt288/?context=3&st=jgfsg1zr&sh=68961d7e][here]]) seems to have a vendetta against DLP.net, and has been banned several times from the forum itself.

*** I don't see this to be the case at all (minus them being HP centric).

The most popular fics on the site are AU and tend to be the most common. They tend not to like fics where little changes, or it's too heavily based on canon.

** Elitist and closed minded. They don't care for anything that isn't canon compliant.

*** I wouldn't call that closed minded, i would call it sticking to a strength. By following a specific standard, they can b more efficient. And I believe I've seen a number of stories that are pretty deviant AUs do rather well in their library.

**** That's good to hear. I did not have that experience on their forums. Bad apples spoling the bunch maybe, but they don't seem to differ once an opinon is given. Maybe it's the difference between a posted story and someone asking for help/sugestions when writing an AU, or For-Want-of-a-Nail fic.

** Elitist but a good tool though I prefer Spacebattles's forum for writing evaluations.

** Use it as a sieve to filter out types of fics you don't want to see. Like many other sites, the kind of reccomendations you will get will vary depending on the culture/hivemind of each website. DLP is good at removing the type of fics that you would skip by only reading the summary/first chapter.
