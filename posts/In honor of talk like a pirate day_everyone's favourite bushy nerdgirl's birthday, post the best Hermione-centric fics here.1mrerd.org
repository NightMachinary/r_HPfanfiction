Well, go on then!


** My favourite Hermione-centric story is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]] by Vera Rozalsky.

#+begin_quote
  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.
#+end_quote

This is a very well written story that takes a much darker and more complex look at both the post-Voldemort Wizarding World, and the post-war relationships between Hermione and her friends. /Warning/ There are some (few and brief) scenes of F/F and M/M slash

** Just made it in under the wire for Hermione's birthday with an update for my fic, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]]. Hope you don't mind unfinshed fics. Things are from Harry's perspective, but it is obviously all about the smartest witch around. Note that this is AU in plot line and some added elements, but plays nice with canon.

#+begin_quote
  Harry never beat Voldemort, only barely managing a stalemate. Years later, Harry falls victim to a Dark ritual that sends him back in time to when he was 11. After Dumbledore discovers Harry's abuse by the Dursleys, things spiral out of control fast. His magical abilities damaged by the trip back, Harry's only hope is the Witch Queen herself, now known merely as Hermione Granger.

I like [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]], which also updated today. Good read, Harry/Hermione but rated T, romantic in spots but mostly an adventure. Also, the best multiple-second-chance time travel HP fic I've ever read.

#+begin_quote
  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
#+end_quote

--------------

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8137134/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Prince-of-Serpents][Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents]] is an odd one. Some tone and pacing issues, but all Hermione all the time.

#+begin_quote
  At the age of five Harry turns into a snake. Five years later he saves a girl named Hermione.

** I enjoyed Arsinoe de Blassenville's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1875189/1/The-Prefect-s-Portrait][The Prefect's Portrait]]; 94k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Now AU sixth year. Hermione's quest for a quiet place to read leads to the discovery of a remarkable portrait. CHAPTER 18:The Order of Merlin. The living are celebrated, the dead remembered, and it is a new day for the wizarding world. Multifaceted Nominee
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]] by Larry Huss is also enjoyable; he writes in a Jack Vance-esque, indirect style that appeals to me; 95k words, WIP, last updated June 2013.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione gets some of the answers early. She has trouble understanding what all the questions are.
#+end_quote

I wrote a Hermione-centric one-shot [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/14/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Hermione Interlude]] that might qualify for the list.

#+begin_quote
  A brief Hermione interlude written for the Teachers' Lounge "Iron Fic" Challenge competition, a timed event, 1500 words with the prompt: "Is this real, or has it all been inside my head?"

** Chem prof's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3290886/1/Hermione-s-Plan][Hermione's Plan]]

#+begin_quote
  Post HBP. Hr POV. The shock of Dumbledore's death plus some unexpected news cause Hermione to reflect on her decisions and actions of the previous year. She resolves to do what she should have done in the first place. Unabashedly HHr.

** Here are a couple more recommendations:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] by MissAnnThropic: To me, this is THE classic H/Hr fic. It contains many of the cliches common to this pairing, but pulls them off better than anything else.

#+begin_quote
  Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become animagi.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun][Chasing the Sun]] by Loten: I'm usually not a huge fan of Hermione/Snape, but Loten does a fantastic job of developing the pairing. Their relationship builds gradually and feels entirely believable.

#+begin_quote
  AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold. Complete.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Finding Himself]] by Minisinoo: This is the only Hermione/Cedric fic that I've come across, and it is quite good. Minisinoo's Cedric is a complicated and conflicted young man, which makes this version of the character far more interesting than most versions I've read.

#+begin_quote
  The-Boy-Who-Almost-Died has to figure out what it means that he didn't. Harry's tumultuous 5th year at Hogwarts is Cedric's 7th and final. Bound together by shared trauma, both boys fall under Ministry suspicion ... Who is Cedric Diggory? Cedric!Lives AU
#+end_quote

I'm also in the process of reading [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3553046/1/Spellcaster][Spellcaster]] by SGCbearcub, and thus far I am really enjoying it.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger was a witch. By the time she was done, the whole damned pureblood world was going to know it. HG/SS. Spoiler HBP

** I love [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1844462/1/The-Twenty][The Twenty]] by Leyna Rountree. It is Hermione/Snape and I have read it several times over.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE! Hermione and an unlikely Pansy form an elite group of witches, and possess one unusual commonality. Facing their most carnal desires, they will harness a power not seen in an age, to save themselves and protect Hogwarts. Can it stay a secret?
