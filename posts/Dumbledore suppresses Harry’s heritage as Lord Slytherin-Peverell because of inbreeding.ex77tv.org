** Maybe Merope Riddle placed heritage blocks on her son which gradually unbound as he created horcruxes.

** Humans aren't inherently magical, they never were. The greatest ability that they do posses is the ability to cross breed with any species that can accommodate human copulation.

This has posed an issue due to atavistic traits tends to express themselves the more magical a human is. Not that Harry knew of it, he was muggle raised after all. Besides, Goblins will never turn down good business nor do they make a habit of volunteering information wizards unless asked.

The human body is never built to carry that much magic. Slowly the body starts to morph to its closest magical being form. The change itself isn't bad, it's just maintaining magical body needs magic. Thus all available magic for basic spell casting is non existent. The only bright side to this is that the changeling gets the ability of the magical creature they partially become. It is common sense that a limiter is placed to keep magic level to wizard. Unfortunately, no one explained to Harry and the goblins plan to offer a new block to be placed of him for a price.

No one expected a non magical ugly squib will be Harry's transformation, in fact, no one expected a transformation at all. It was baffling until they looked at Harry's family tree. It seems that the Atavistic genes of Peverell-slytherin overpowered and is a closer creature origins than Galatea of the Potter's. Too bad all Harry got is an ugly fishy face, no magic but able to breathe underwater and ability to speak in tougues. It seems the Salazar came from the fens, in a sleepy town called Innsmouth.

It seems the goblins win again. Another poor sucker pays for removal of blocks then pays to put it back again. Hey at least Harry can read necronomicon without dying. Not that he plans to build a bridge over our time stream to the old ones, that's certain death for sure.

** Would fall the logic test : magic block vs consanguinity, magic block don't block blood. The only way to block interbreeding would be to delete the blood that is consanguineous and replace it with an other bloodline.

*** Heh. Blood Transfusion is the key to Magical Survival. Vampires suddenly become the heroes to Magical Society, with a monopoly on Blood Banks like Goblins have on gold Banks.

**** Not exactly what I had in mind. Like in a fic where Harry and Salazar are in the family castle and salazar discover that Lily blood is incompatible with the slytherin blood in Harry blood (the fic assumed that Cadmus Peverell line and Antioch Line intermarried at a point, not impossible parseltongue is a blood trait and a horcrux is a magic and soul trait, for Harry to speak parseltongue he had to have slytherin blood), and so salazar recommended a ritual to bleed out lily blood from the rest and research a blood line compatible with slytherin bloodline and potter. I sadly do not have the title of the fic and research it.

***** I mean, that's not how biology works, so I'm kind of curious where that idea came from? Incompatible bloodlines and whatnot. Is it from that fic specifically or was it a cross-over or some sort/plagiarism from something else?

***** I remember reading that fic but It's a dead one so I didnt bother remembering the name. That and it leaned towards death eater mentality. I believed Harry end up believing that Lily's blood really look like mud and just bleed it out.

I think a more interesting way to change 'dna' is for a magical bone marrow transplant. It's more visceral and can be used to steal identity. Imagine having Harry Potter's Dna but when the blocks comes off you find out your not really HP, someone just changed your blood dna but not the rest genetic make up, hence the block to prevent the original gene from expressing themselves.
