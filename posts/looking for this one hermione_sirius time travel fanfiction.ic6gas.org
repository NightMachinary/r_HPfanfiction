:END:
so it's been a while since I've read it, but I know it was on ffn- basically, it begins in the trio's 5th year. Sirius acts sort of strange around hermione- he knows a lot about her interests, etc. Later in her 6th year, slughorn is also curious about her and suggests that she do some work in the wolfsbane potion. When hermione finally goes back in time, she ends up befriending the marauders, helping snape and slughorn make the wolfsbane, and she saves sirius from dying in the department of mysteries. Anyone know what I'm talking about?
