Due to some issues with 3rd party apps scraping Ao3 (along with some other problems), many authors are switching their fics to be available only to registered users. I'd hate for readers to lose access to their favorite fics, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to throw this out there.

+I have 9 invitations to give out if anyone wants/needs an account and doesn't want to go on the waiting list (it's been ages since I got my account and I think they're pretty fast, but if you want instant gratification...).+ EDIT: I AM OUT OF INVITATIONS, but there are still plenty of people offering them up in the comments, and I'm sure someone can hook you up!

Leave a comment or shoot me a PM if you want an invite and I'll be in touch.

Alternatively, if you've got invitations to throw out there, this might be a good post to hook others up.


** Just throwing this out there, currently, the invitation queue is a 1 day wait on the archive. We are sending out a few thousand a day, and the queue is less than we are sending out in a day.

*** Yeah, I figured. I just saw this getting tossed around on Tumblr and the Ao3 "comment of the day" account was posting about it, too. Like I said, if anyone wants instant gratification... :)

I'm also finding out that some people had no idea that there were "locked" fics, so I guess the info is still good for some.

Thank you! üíú

*** In AO3, go to your dashboard, under your user name there is a button called invitations click on it. Now you can see how many invitations you have and request new ones via request invitations button.

*** Ao3 allow authors to lock fics so only registered users can access them. That's always been an option, but more authors are locking their fics recently due to outside sources scraping the site.

The invitations get you an account so you can register and read locked fics (and save bookmarks and all the other fun stuff you can do on the site). I'm out of invites, but there are plenty of people still offering them up in the comments here.
