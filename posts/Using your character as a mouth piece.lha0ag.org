I came across a sentence on a thread the other day, it was along the lines of "people using characters as their mouth piece" and it was given a negative connotation.

What exactly is using a character as a mouth piece and how should one avoid it?


** Have you read, say, Ayn Rand's books? Atlas Shrugged etc? Those were works written to convey a certain philosophy. Consequently, the characters, scenes and plotlines are used to +indoctrinate+illustrate certain things, and this leads to the main characters suddenly standing somewhere and delivering long speeches that is really the author speaking to you.

Mapped onto HP FF, a typical example is (male) teenagers getting fed up with Dumbledore and writing Harry standing in the middle of the Great Hall, monologuing about "Dumbledorks's" failings. That's one of the more terribad cringe scenes you may encounter.

.

Now, realistically, obviously /everything/ a character does is something planned by the author, so the point that it can't be an issue in general is well-made; however, the trick is to hide the author behind the character. Whenever something feels forced, when a character's motivation is unclear, when there are random actions that leave you scratching your head: All this is bad writing, because the author appears from behind the scenes. The height of good writing, in turn, is presenting every plot point you want to make arising organically from what came before, deriving current behaviour from previously established traits, writing reactions that necessarily follow from actions, in a perfectly coherent way.

The way to achieve this is either a lot of talent, a lot of practice, or, at best, both.

*Edit:*

A good way to practice is writing characters with opinions exactly opposed to your own, by the way. That way, you learn how to separate your world view from the one of a character, and how to consider multiple angles and slip into different mindsets. It's like this thing you may have had in school, or debate club/Model UN/whatever, where you have to argue for the exact opposite position to the one you actually have.

I can highly recommend it; it creates a certain mental flexibility that is helpful not only in writing, but also IRL.

** Pretty sure this should be labeled as “discussion”. “Request” means you're looking for fanfiction. As for the mouth peace thing, it means that the author uses a character to voice flaws/criticisms that /they/ (the author) has with the story/universe. Like imagine 11 year old Harry suddenly spouting... oh I don't know... that he thought Dumbledore wasn't as powerful as everyone thought, despite Harry knowing /nothing/ to make him think that.

TLDR: It's when a character says what the /author/ thinks instead of any opinion formed on their own.

** It's another way of saying "soapbox."

It's when you use the characters as a vehicle for expressing the author's views, whether or not they're really relevant to the story or not.

There usually is a socio-political element at play. A tell-tale sign is when the characters begin talking about /modern/ problems in a story set in the 1990s, in a /magical/ Britain boarding school.

Sometimes, if the author knows what they're doing, it actually work. /Sometimes,/ but I've never seen it done well in a fanfic.

And this is not a problem unique to fanfic at all. It shows up in professional works all the time. One of the most egregious examples of using characters as a mouthpiece that I ever saw came from that blasted episode "Let's Not Be Skeletons" from /OK KO! Let's Be Heroes./

With regards to /avoiding/ it, I would say write the story first. Character-building filler is all well and good, but If it doesn't help the story, then jettison it.

** If you are interested in the theory of writing, then I have to suggest to you two very obscure and old books (yes, old books are quite often better than the new ones): “[[https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20140909][The Mind of the Maker]]” by Dorothy L. Sayers (yes, the author of detective stories with Lord Peter Wimsey, so she knew one or two things about writing) and “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Not_to_Write_a_Play][How Not to Write a Play]]” by Walter Kerr (he was the chief theatre critic of The New York Times long time ago). The first one is probably very hard to digest for some (it uses the analogy with the Trinitarian Theology), so let me summarize what I mean:

Every story should be about [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][how the hero got from A to B]]: how a young abused orphaned boy found his way to find peaceful and loving life while defeating the worst wizard of his times; how the young Danish prince found the courage to revenge the murder of his own father; how a boy and a girl from two families which hated each other found love and finally were killed by that hatred. There are some requirements for the good story I described in the linked blog post (using the Kerr's theory; namely, it shouldn't skip the story itself as many fanfics do), but there is also more: the hero has to get there on his/her own, the author cannot pull him there against his will and powers. That's the clear sign of problems with writing, when suddenly [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][characters start to behave like an idiots just to keep the plot together]]: all characters have to get from A to B because of their own decision, ruled by their own decisions, not because the author needs to make them these decisions.

Subset of this problem is when not only heroes of a story behave out of their character, but even worse when their behaviour is driven by the author's opinions more than by their intrinsic decisions. Juliet is not in love with Romeo because she would be in love with him, but because she needs to show how it is bad to marry as a teenager (and thus making bad decisions, as teenagers do); Hamlet doesn't struggle with his path to kill the ruling king, because of moral problems, but because he wants to preach to us how his mother is just a tool in the misogynistic world. And yes, somebody mentioned “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged][Atlas Shrugged]]” by Ayn Rand, which is an horrible example of the sermon on extreme individualism pretending to be a novel. Or even worse, when in every other Indy!Harry story, a reader suspects his not behaving out of his own heart, but because the author wants him to preach the author's relational problems with his father (while shouting at Dumbledore).

And yes, every books has a message, but see for example “[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451][Fahrenheit 451]]” by Ray Bradbury (one of the best short novels of all times, I believe). It has a message as well, but first it is rather complicated to say what the message really is and to be honest to the story. More importantly though, heroes of the story never shout out the message to us (actually, the main hero of the story works most of the time professionally against the message), you are just lead to find it on your own.

** I think it's basically using your characters to get your opinions and ideas across to people. Let's say an author is homophobic, and suddenly, Harry hates gay people. It's really nasty.

I will admit that my Harry reflects me a bit, but it isn't jarring or outside of what I see Harry wanting to do to change wizarding society...

*** You see the opposite quite often as well, where suddenly Native Americans/Aborigines/African tribes and whatnot have the best magic because they are in touch with their nature, uncorrupted by technology and so on. "foreign" wanks are surprisingly common when other magical societies are mentioned.

** u/Ash_Lestrange:

  What exactly is using a character as a mouth piece and how should one avoid it?
#+end_quote

Either a character used to convey ideals or a character used to explain plot. Dumbledore, and Hermione at times, were the latter. Tyrion on the Game of Thrones TV show is the former.

Recently, if you've watched Malcolm and a Marie on Netflix, Sam Levinson uses Malcolm to criticize Hollywood.

I don't think it's entirely avoidable as an author's ideals are wrapped up in the themes and their characters are supposed to help convey whatever message they're trying to deliver. But I think Secs advice to give characters opinions different from your own should help minimize it.
