** omg it really does! It really sucks trying to look for work with your fave as a main character when the tag will be filled with fic with them as a minor character

and a main pairing, minor pairing or like endgame or something for ships. It sucks so bad when you're looking for your rare pare and all that comes up is those people as a minor pairing for a more popular pairing

** Yeah, we definitely need a kind of 'display tags' vs 'sorting tags' distinction, even if it's just the fandom coming to some agreement on how that works. Nobody sorts by 'Like, totez omg they're so cute together', but 'Regency AU' isn't that evocative an advertisement for a story when you're scrolling (even though it is pretty much a good description/guide for the Noble Houses, Pureblood Traditions stories).

*** But they do, there are tags that are official and searchable and tags that aren't. The problem is that characters are searchable even if that character only says two words in the story. If the writer tags every single person in the marvel fandom then that story will show up no matter who in the marvel fandom you search for.

Sometimes I think writers tag everyone because they want people to find their story no matter who they search for, it's a bit of a cheat.

Ao3 is always looking for tag wranglers to help out.

  *Add minor roles in the Additional Tags field.* If a fandom, character, or relationship is only a passing reference in your work, you can put that in the "Additional Tags". This includes tags like *Ru Pauls drag race references, Yagi Toshinori Is Mentioned, and Small Mention of Flynn/Yuri.* That way, other users know your work isn't primarily about Ru Paul's Drag Race, Yagi Toshinori or Yuri Lowell/Flynn Scifo (which they might think if you put these tags in the fandom, character, or relationship fields instead).

I see people tagging /everything/ in their fics, even if it only shows up for one chapter and is never mentioned again, and that's ridiculous. Not only does it clutter up the tags, it often spoils the plot of the fic. If it's a recurring thing, yeah, tag it. Otherwise just put a warning in the author's notes for that chapter if it's important.

Out of all of those, maybe 10 (on a good day!) will be what I'm looking for, because people tend to tag the character even if they've only got one line in the whole fic.

It's gotten to the point that I don't even search for rare characters unless I'm also searching for a pairing with them, because I know I won't get any results either way.

** I think a lot of it is people tagging things improperly. You're supposed to tag things that are an important part of the story. You don't need to tag “Slytherin Harry” if the story is about a group of Hufflepuffs in a different year and Harry makes a brief cameo wearing a green tie. You don't need to tag “Charlie Weasley” if he doesn't actually appear in the story, but Ron mentions he has an older brother who works with dragons in passing. You don't need to tag “Harry/Luna” when the story is about Draco and Hermione and there's a single sentence about Harry and Luna making out in the broom cupboard. Etc.

And then people treating them like tumblr tags. Nobody is searching “no ships because they're 11” or “everyone is gay,” you don't need to include that. People will figure out there are no ships when you don't add any romantic ship tags. People will figure out everyone is gay when you don't add any tags for M/F relationships.

I really try to limit tags for BT for that reason. Nobody wants to skim through an entire page of tags that don't tell you anything about the story.

The user has an easier time engaging with the website in a meaningful and useful way, where as the website will likely get increased traffic due to better features and ease of use.

Personally if I am looking for a fanfiction to read AO3 is always the last place I will look for something. I go so far as to google story names that people post here linked to AO3 to see if they are hosted on other websites.

Now, there are a few things that I like better in AO3, like the lack of adds, the layout, summary and (yes, even them): tags.

These days it has the suggestion for nukenin ready, making that a searchable tag & easily chosen when people are adding tags to their story.

So it does happen, but I don't know how the tags are adopted.

Edit: often you do find extra tags about the main character and what makes him unique in this story.

"MOD Harry Potter", "Ravenclaw Hermione", "ANBU Kakashi". It certainly lets you know what the emphasis of the story is, and search for a specific type of fic. At the risk of excluding the ones with the same qualities that forgot the tag.

*** yeah, there will often be specific tags. For instance with my most searched character there will be ‘regulus black lives' and ‘good regulus black', for Harry there might be others but my brain isn't working very well so I currently can't think of examples. But yes, there should be for pretty much every character. Sometimes it will say whose POV it is? So ‘Harry's POV' might be a tag?

These kinds of tags are my favourite because different tropes and genres will generally have their own set of tags and you learn to be able to figure out if you're going to like a fic if certain tags are present or absent.

even with the clogging I prefer AO3, it does take some getting used to though, and obviously not everyone is going to tag appropriately

** I agree and disagree.

I agree that a protagonists for elf would be great. I am in the process of writing out a book that frequently goes between a handful of characters and it would be useful to point out the most frequent and consistent ones.

I disagree with the limit though. The book I mentioned goes between more than 4 characters, AO3 would let me cite the important ones FFN would cap it off. Also, if I may rag on FFN for a bit, it's absolute limit is four. If a character is in a relationship with a side character you have to decide weither to keep the 4 most important and get blasted for not putting the ship or put the ship and be blasted for not having an important character there. Also to get into writing tropes quickly, it's far more common to have 5 protagonists (for protagonist groups) than to have 4, almost as common as having 3. I'm gonna cut myself off before I continue my endless vent against FFN, but overall I don't agree with the limiter. I like the protagonist list idea though.

- option to declare one single primary pairing.

- automatically coalesce variations of the same tag/relationship into one well understood one. We have variations of "HP/GW", "Harry/Ginny", "Harry Potter/Ginny Weasley", etc. all are the same bloody thing.
- ability to filter out stories with too many tags. Usually they aren't good anyway

Like, because they're either popular or canon, they get featured in the relationship tag but they end up being background characters who are together and the story doesn't even focuses on them. With the protag field you could tell if they were featured just featured or if they are going to be focused on.

(just commenting because the other day I was in a shipping and romance mood and decided to search fics with a certain pairing but ran in just as many fics with them as back ground as fics focused on them.

Child porn, though despicable in real practice, is not always illegal to write about in a fictional setting (it is legal in quite a few countries, including US). There are lot of niche topics and for some people may be the only way to express themselves. We shouldn't be vigilantes and start deciding what is proper read and what is not.

Main reason ao3 started was because many other sites started cranking up censorship rules. Which were mainly driven by advertiser demands than anything else.

Also keep in mind lot of fanfiction is written by teenagers - it is only natural that they prefer writing about their own age group.

What do you do when one character is 16 and one character is 18? Where do you draw the line? And, keep in mind just about everyone will have an idea of where the line should be drawn and it's not easy to reach a consensus on what constitutes written child pornography. What about the book Lolita? What about books that have underage sex in them? What about the movie Cuties that everyone was upset over a while ago. This problem isn't unique to fanfiction.

AO3 advocates for free speech. As long as fics are rated and tagged with the appropriate warnings (or choose not to warn) then people can choose to avoid what they don't want to see. If you want restrictions on what you're allowed to post and see, go to ffn.

Sometimes, it is true that there are many protag. I'm thinking about fandom such as Marvel, if someone write a story about all the Avenger team. So it makes senses to tag a dozen character, if they have equal screen time in the story, and equal importance.

So, the limit would be bad. And it's one of the reason AO3 is good with the tags.
