What do you think about OC-centric fics? Do like them? Despise them?

Do you like stories focused on them, or when they are in the background?

During canon, or pre or post canon?

Complete outsiders, or something more like an OC-Weasly, or another Potter?


** There was a good post on this awhile back that might give you some interesting answers to your questions. I copy-pasted my answer below from the one I gave in the other thread.

#+begin_quote
  Generally, my two preferences/guidelines for OCs are give them a reason for existing and give them a niche to occupy. Other than that, anything goes. That basically means they have some actual meaning or contribution to the plot/setting, and that they aren't just 'Canon Character, but...' and have a unique place to occupy in your fic.

  Meaning and contribution can be both from an in-world and writer perspective. Could be anything from a character's death sending out ripples through the world, a historical figure setting up or doing a thing that affects the present-day characters, or a character that pushes elements of the plot along though their dynamics with your protagonist or other characters. Basically, why do they matter? Why aren't they just 'Chorus member no.136'?

  I'm not sure if the 'niche' term is an actual thing I've picked up or not, but it basically refers to the 'roles' of your various characters and how they fit into the world around them. The big-name characters need to be distinct and more than just a reskinned version of another character, or you risk people confusing them or just not caring. If your character is just 'Ginny, but likes Divination instead of Quidditch', then my preference would be to just give Ginny an experience that makes her interested in Divination rather than just 'cloning' her and changing a few things. If you're going to have a second Weasley daughter, you need to make sure she fits into the world in a way that makes her different as a character (to clarify - that doesn't mean make her a chosen one, just distinct from other people) and where her interactions with the various other elements of the world (people, resources, places, etc) make sense.

  I'd also recommend doing a search of this sub on the topic - there have been some really good discussions on this that I've seen in my year here.

** In general, OC-centric fics that are well-done and don't end in romance are often in my opinion, one of the best fanfics in the fandom. If well-written, I find that they're one of the best ways to explore family/school dynamics, especially pre-canon.

However, there's so few that fit this category for HP that I'm still trying to find them (not counting the ones where it's focusing on a minor character).

** Frankly, it depends on the OC.

The question is like "What do you think of fanfics?" or "What do you think of TV Shows?". It's too open ended to really give a good response. An OC major character, or even an OC main character isn't really going to dissuade me from reading a fanfic. Hell, I spent a good deal of time reading the /Alexandra Quick/ series(that one is based ENTIRELY on OCs, so much so that with a little pruning it could be considered an original universe) before I gave up on it, as I just didn't like /any/ of the characters.

I know that it's a vague question, but that was intentional on my part. I wanted to find out if people here would outright skip an OC-centric story, as I'm toying with the idea of writing one myself

**** Can't speak for everyone, but an OC centric fic is not enough to dissuade me. I've read several. I liked a Curse of Truth, which was a self-insert, and there was another interesting one that centered around an OC that adopted Harry Potter(which I'm sorry to say seems to be abandoned because I was absolutely loving it).

**** A lot of people refuse to touch Alexandra Quick because it doesn't have any connection to canon and/or Harry as the MC. If you're looking to try to hit huge readership, writing an OC fic is probably not the best move. AQ is probably one of the most acclaimed fics on this sub, but in terms of overall readership metrics on FFN it's astonishingly low.

** I am writing one, so I guess I have to say that I like OCs. But in reality, it depends a lot on the plot and the identity of the OC. I might be turned off by some OCs like I don't like WBWL with an arrogant brother for Harry or an OC Weasley like you said because I feel like they don't really make for an interesting story.\\
But for the most part, I love OCs! Despite the bad reputation they have there's plenty of /very/ good fics. I personally read everything as long as the plot is interesting.

I wish more people stopped looking at OCs like they are the worst thing ever while that depends solely on the author's writing skills. Let's be real there are plenty shitty fics without the OCs in them...

BTW, I'm writing an OC female Lupin and OC male Black which is almost never done, actually probably never! I've not seen a fic like mine yet.

** I tend to like stories about Harry / Hermione / Ginny. Without one or more of these three, it doesn't feel like fanfiction to me. So many named characters don't have many canon traits that fanfic authors can easily shove in any type of character they want while still feeling like a version of the world.

But hey, what I like doesn't matter. If you're writing, what you like matters. The biggest complaint people have about OC'S is that they are OP. Conflict drives plot, suffering drives plot. If your protagonist can breathe fire, drop them in the ocean...

** For Next Gen and post-Hogwarts more generally, they're fine. Ditto eras where we basically don't know anyone or where we know the wrong characters (e.g. you want to write a fic about Voldemort's Hufflepuff year mates? sorry, mate, gotta make a bunch of OCs... or have Tom's besties all be Hufflepuffs).

When it comes to canon settings, I don't like OCs.

** As long as it doesn't become a completely unrelated story that just uses the franchise name to get views it's fair.

It's just another tool, it's not good or bad on its own, what the writer does with it matters the most. Some people are against it on principle, but I can't see why it should matter. It's fanfiction, even the original characters are as similar or different to canon as the writer needs/wants them to be.

*** Agreed, it's not inherently good or bad, it matters more what the writer does with it. To be fair, a lot of characters in fanfic end up as being pretty much OCs who happen to have the name of a canon character anyway.

Happy cake day!

** I like them when they're in the background because I read these fanfics to read the stories of the lives of the HP characters. Maybe it's because I don't like change. If I see something on Ao3 like 'George Weasley/Original character' as the first tag I probably won't read it. But if they sneak into a story I'm likely not going to abandon it.

** Background OCs are fine/expected. Main character OCs turn me off unless the premise is really unusual and interesting. I'd prefer a Reader Insert to a main character OC.
