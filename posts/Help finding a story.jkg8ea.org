:END:
So from what I remember Hermione goes back in time to the Maurders (I think I spelled that right). She trains in the ROR secretly but those four plus Lily and Severus find her one day and by this point she's kind of friendly with them. When they see her she's battling dummies to have a death eater mask on them and she's to where they can see all of her scars and stuff from the Department of mysteries battle. I don't remember this is before or after the war and I know that it's a couple painting but I don't remember who she ends up with either. Any help would be appreciated I know it's not much to go on but please help and thank you


** Couple pairing not painting
