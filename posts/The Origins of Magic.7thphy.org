In the fic I am working on I wish to expound on where magic came from, how the magical community was blessed with it but Muggles did not. I was simply wondering if JK Rowling ever said anything on the subject, I am researching but have found nothing just yet


** It is implied that the ability to use magic is some sort of genetic trait, or similar to it, since all Muggle-borns have a magical ancestor somewhere. Canon does not account for the actual origins of magic however. For all we know, magic just is; it came with the universe, and so will it disappear with the universe. Or perhaps it existed before the universe, and was responsible for its creation. Or perhaps some higher entity gifted it.

Regardless, we do know a few things:

- The ability to use magic can skip generations (hence the existence of Squibs and Muggleborn)

- Magic does not seem to be passed on based on what we know about natural selection, since otherwise it would be widespread (this assumes that the trait is not in fact both recessive and hoarded very carefully since times immemorial)

- Souls exist, which may mean that magic is not so much genetic in flesh but rather in soul

- To continue, magic can be performed without a body (e.g. Voldemort), which lends credence to the magic not being determined by the flesh

- Magic use is infinite; that is, magical exhaustion (and magical cores) do not exist

- Magical strength varies, which suggests that something, be that willpower, or strength of soul affects it

Together, we can conclude that magic is most likely not a genetic trait in the fleshy sense of the word. Magic is probably intimately tied to souls, or something similar.

** I'm not sure that there needs to be an origin of magic. It's like asking for the origin of electro-magnetism/gravity/strong nuclear force/weak nuclear force IRL. They are the four forces which have been identified as fundamental i.e. they are the things which describe everything else, the "end of the line" in terms of explanation.

Instinctively we want there to be an explanation for everything, but it may be that it's not "turtles all the way down". There may be things which cannot be explaned because there's nothing "behind" them.

** Isn't it just a genetic mutation?

*** I don't know is it? That is my question, I do not know. I only have knowledge of the 7 HP books and movies, none of which mentions it. But that begs the question of why after thousands of years only select people have the mutation. And when did it first crop up? There were witches and wizard back in the BC's, so how far back? Thats pretty long for only a small population to get a mutation; since Muggles still outnumber magical people. I mean the tailbone is a mutation too but both magic and muggle people have the same mutation. This is why it doesn't make sense to me to have to do with anyhing genetic or blood.

And also what of Muggle-borns? Muggle-borns with no magic in their background/ancestry at all (Including Squibs which also how?), there's no way a mutation can just suddenly take up out of nowhere's. Muggle-borns throw everything through a loop

*** Hm just found a wiki page on it, it doesn't seem to make sense, Pureblood families have Squibs too, which means there would be no recessive non-magical genes to pass along.

Also how/where did the first magic person come from? What caused the genes to mutate if thats true? How would a genetic mutation cause something so powerful to occur? What in our genes makes it so?

***** I just found an interview where JK said No one knows where magic comes from, it can be inherited or not (Muggle-borns), but the origin no one knows hmm

** What does magic and souls mean for the whole universe? :) Does that mean there are mage ALIENS and ALIEN GHOSTS on all sorts of planets that once had life but were destroyed or died naturally?! When humans start colonizing and stuff like star trek are they going to find whole ghost alien societies on dead moons and stuff?! ALSO was the confirmed afterlife created at the start of the universe with everything else, or did it even exist before? Will it exist after the universe dies? Can magic STOP the universe's death when the time comes, if whole civilizations of magic humans and aliens come together to stop it? And what if there are like huge magical ENTITIES that consume planets or something?! ALSO DID MAGIC ITSELF GET CREATED WITH THE START OF THE UNIVERSE, LIKE IS IT JUST ANOTHER NATURAL FORCE LIKE GRAVITY OR SOMETHING?! WILL MAGIC STOP EXISTING WHEN THE UNIVERSE DIES?!

Hmmm. I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want to read, or write myself, all these super awesome space magic concepts and lore ideas!!! :) :) :) :) Has anyone EVER explored any of these sorts of things in fanfics before?

  Out in the Universe is a bright blue box, holder of a fantastical realm. Inhabiting this box is a mad man who calls himself the Doctor, his son, the Savior of the Wizarding World aka Harry Potter, an immortal man from the 51st century who affects a Captain in front of his name, Jack Harkness, and a pink and yellow once-human who is simply Rose Tyler. What was Dumbledore thinking?
