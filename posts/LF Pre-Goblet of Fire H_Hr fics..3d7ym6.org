** When you say "together", are you referring to a sickly-sweet-but-mostly-awkward-preteen-holding-hands "together" or an Undying Declaration of Love "together"?

Either way, I'm pretty sure [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst]] does this on the regs. If you look for Reptilia28 or witowsmp on Portkey.org, I think they've both done this too.

*** The former I suppose. The latter kind is weird for that age range.

Thank you for the suggestions but I have already read all the stories from those authors and only a couple of them were good enough to reread. If you have know any less mainstream fics that would be great.
