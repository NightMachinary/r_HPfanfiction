I was reading some story the other week where Harry referred to Malfoy as a ferret as early as first year, and it struck me that a lot of fanfics do the same thing. Have people forgotten that the ferret thing doesn't happen until fourth year or did they find it so amusing that they use it early anyway?


** Fanon definitely tries to associate certain characters with animals in a negative way. Dumbledore bashing fics frequently refer to him as 'the old goat'. Likewise, you already mentioned Malfoy and the ferret thing. Also Snape is referred to as a Bat, and weasley bashing fics like to relate him to a pig.

Its basically just a cheap way for authors to dish out some insults, with a thin veneer of being classy about it. **

** He's described as having a long, rodent-like face from the beginning. Crouch chose ferret as the thing to turn him into because he already kind of looked like one so it's a little meaner to turn him into that specifically.
