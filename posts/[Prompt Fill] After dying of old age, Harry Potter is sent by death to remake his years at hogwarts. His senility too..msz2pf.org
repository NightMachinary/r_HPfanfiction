** This is an attempt to fill that prompt?

Are you sure?

Because the original prompt was funny.

I remember that thread. It was a crackfic prompt about Harry being sent back to live his life again by Death, but he's senile, and how it causes all sorts of problems, like Harry confusing people for their great grandchildren, losing points constantly because he calls people 'Minnie' and 'Albus,' but then gets every single spell perfectly on his first try. Constantly trying to attack Neville because he confuses him for his great-great grandnephew who became the next Dark Lord. And so on.

You've sucked everything funny and interesting out of this. The funny is gone, and it's been replaced with an incomprehensible plot about gods power-struggling against other gods that nobody asked for, it's a super!Harry fic where Harry is *also* some sort of god now, and also utterly incomprehensible pronouns. We're talking Mister Mxyzptlk levels of incomprehensible. This is just a gross generic superhero timetravel dimensionlord Potter fic, but Harry is forgetful. That's what you've done to this. That's all it is.

Why? Why, for all of that? What was your reasoning?

Do you need help? That's not a condescending question, I'm serious. I have a great big bag of classic Harry Potter crackfic right here I can share with you. The /Where In The World Is Harry Potter/ trilogy, /A Black Comedy. Larceny, Lechery, And Luna Lovegood/. /Make A Wish/. /Let's Do The Time Warp Again/. /Lovegood Boobs Gooder/. Most things by nonjon. Pretty much everything by Rorschach's Blot. And that's just the beginning. If you want examples of how to do a comedic parody timetravel story where Harry just drives everyone up a wall, there are very successful and entertaining examples of that exact thing.

This entire subplot with gods by itself is just ridiculous. Why does it exist? Can't Harry just go back because he's the master of death? Or because the Death that spoke to the Peverells is very real, and said "wow, your life sucked, here, do it again"? Or not even that, if you're really so stuck on this hyperdimension ultrareality gods-sitting-behind-desks cliche, just have one sentence that says "and the last thing Death was expecting on his workday was for a Harry Potter to die of old age, so it's perfectly understandable for missing this one."

This can be excused with one sentence, it's a joke fic. You don't need all of this. Brevity is the soul of wit, and you've cut out all the jokes and funny interactions to load up on some power struggle plot between gods. It's like a completely different prompt. Are the pronouns supposed to be the joke, or are we taking that seriously?

*** Yes, it's a /setup/ chapter to fill that prompt. No I do not need help. The prompt doesn't necessarily need to be craic, though I know most people interpreted it that way, but it was going to be once I got passed a setup chapter. There's not really a large subplot with gods, it was just to setup why Harry had gone back. Harry isn't going to be super!harry or know he's a god or any of that. The clich√© gods thing is in it's own way a joke, yes it's dry and not American in-your-face, but it's still a joke.

Just because it wasn't what /you/ would have written, doesn't mean it's not a fill

Edit: also, have you considered the possibility of a god not knowing they're a god and blindly fumbling through their powers not knowing that's what they were using? Have you considered an old god trying to shepherd our HP into doing certain things, whilst Harry is oblivious and keeps going the wrong way? There's comedic potential there, too.

** I don't get it. How can he remember names or faces he shouldn't know if his memories were removed before being sent back?

*** Death needed to make eye contact, but missed that the Harry he sent back was blind.

#+begin_quote
  And this time, Death had truly fucked up. Somehow he had missed that this Harry Potter had grown old and blind, had missed that he needed actual eye-contact to wipe their memory
