:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
That was part of it. It was a slash fic, Tom/Harry. I think it starts with Harry feeling abandoned and he some how finds the diary again? The Slytherins shielded him away from Ron, and Hermione, when they saw Harry was starting to become neutral or agreeing to their views I believe? I also think he ended up moving into either the Slytherin dorms or the Chamber? If anyone could help me find this fic that would be great! I'm been trying for weeks to find it.


** This sounds a bit like Ink Stained Pages by Excentrykemuse. Used to be on FanFiction.Net but I think they removed all of their stories several years ago and I don't know if there is anywhere that would still have them.

*** You know I think that might be EXACTLY it! I remember that's author's name and remember I loved their work!

Time to go over the internet with a find tooth comb to see if anyone saved it, ha.

Thank you so much! I was seriously starting to think I made this story up in my head and it was one of my fanfiction day dreams.
