Hello

I read this fic ages ago and just remembered it. Of course I can't find it anymore... Harry is kidnapped by Voldemort who adopts him in order to become Lord Slytherin. The adoption ceremony was something with water and magical snakes (?). There was also something about a magical snake familiar for Harry that could fly and was tiny.

The fic is probably unfinished but I'd still like to reread it if possible.

All help is appreciated :)


** I don't think linkffn(Benefits of Old Laws) is what you're looking for, but it has a similar base idea

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
