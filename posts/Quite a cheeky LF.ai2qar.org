So I realise this is basically a shopping list of fics I'm looking for, but I figured it would be better to do it all in one post than across lots of different ones.

1. A Dark!Ron story. *Not* a Ron bashing fic where Ron is just a disloyal idiot, or a fic where Ron has an alternative timeline where he's born rich or whatever. Rather something where Ron gradually shifts Dark. I don't mind if it's slash.

2. A well written Dark!trio fic. Not something where they're just evil supervillains who like to do bad things for the fun of it, but something where the three have genuine motivations for their actions, etc.

3. A fic where class is the primary dividing line of the wizarding world, as opposed to bloodline. Lots of money, society, etc.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
