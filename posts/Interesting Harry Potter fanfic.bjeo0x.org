I'm looking for any slash Harry Potter fanfic, that has Harry in the pairing. If there isn't slash can someone recommend me any long and innovativ fanfics? Like Harry being summoned or something. The longer they are the better.

This is because I already read so many and perhaps other people know some that I ignored.


** Man Out of Time [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16816447/chapters/39472441]] Harry/Sirius time travel.\\
Summary: Harry gets hit with a piece of the veil, and falls into Sirius's past. And back again.

Loosely inspired by The Time Traveler's Wife.

** It's not quite slash, but linkffn(World in Pieces by Lomonaaeren) has Harry summoned to another world, and the Harry he's replacing was in a relationship with Draco.

*** I prefer slowburn and established romance, can contain bashings. I don't really like rape or pedophilia but everything else is okay. I'm open to every type of plot. It can also have a very subtile romance or nothing.

  He opened his eyes to a gradient of green and a lingering feeling that something was wrong.A sound to his left make his ear flick - he pushed down another spike of panic. Since when did his ears flick in the direction of sounds? - and he levered himself off the ground, pulling himself up with the help of a nearby tree root. He didn't know where he was, didn't know who, or what, was out there. It wasn't safe to just hang about in the open, not with-Not with what? The thought teased at him, slipping out of his mind like smoke between fingers every time he tried to remember. Not with what?

*** Yeah, I read this. It was really weird but once you get over that it gets dramatic and you love it.

It's just a shame they don't update so often.
