** Linkffn(Fair Lady by kideaxl) comes to mind.

Linkao3(Certain Dark Things) fem!Harry. Death follows in her shadows, /literally/.

Linkao3(saltkin by slex) Death is her cat. [[http://archive.transformativeworks.org/works/5836459][Link]]

Hmm, there was also that fic where Tom Riddle eventually becomes Death and Harry becomes Life. Will post if I can find it.

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.

  Harry thinks to himself; why the f-ck not? So he picks up a little Tom Riddle and tries to indoctrinate the boy into following a Gryffindor approved set of morals. He grabs Gellert Grindelwald too because if he f-cks up with one, he still has another try. (Poor Harry never does quite understand that he's not the one pulling the strings.)
