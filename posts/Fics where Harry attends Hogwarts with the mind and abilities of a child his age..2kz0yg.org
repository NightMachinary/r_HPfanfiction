I want to see childish curiosity and intrigue.

I want excitement and moments of practicing magic for the sheer fact that it's /awesome/ and other-worldly.

Hit me with your best.

EDIT: Amended - Hit me with anything that kinda sorta applies to my query.


** Strange disappearance of Sally Anne Perks is pretty good and was book club a few months back. On mobile so can't link.

** Well, I'm not sure about childish glee, but On His Way to Greatness by Mira Mirth does a very good job at a Slytherin Harry, keeping him very much a realistic interpretation of canon Harry with the same strengths and weaknesses and similar convictions.

** Yeah the original series is basically the only one where I see that to be honest and it gets burned out pretty quick by first year. Curiosity and intrigue is pretty hard to keep alive when something weird is after your life.

*** NSFW language.

Yeah totally - in the fic I'm penning I sort of cheated and had Neville as the boy-who-lived - complete with a scene of Harry thinking Neville must be a powerful wizard, and that his scar is pretty cool.

Because, I mean - "Yeh feckin' scar was made by an unblockable curse that killed er'one who was hit with it yeh ungrateful shite."
