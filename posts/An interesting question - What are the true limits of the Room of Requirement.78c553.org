This is actually a very interesting question. At most, we know that food and drink can't be made by the room, but what else can/can't it do?


** One fic I read had an interesting premise - if something was in the castle, the room could summon it (explains those defence books and furniture). Also it postulated that, barring things in the castle, everything else it summoned was an illusion (that could not be dispelled because Ravenclaw built the room). A bit like a limited holodeck. So, say, you could summon a swimming pool, but not an actual beach with palm trees. I like this interpretation.

I know fics have used the Room in ludicrously OP ways - like in Miranda Flairgold's fic, Harry uses the room to freeze time and train for years (hello, isolation-caused madness). I don't like this interpretation. If an author wants an outlandish magical solution he should invent his own, instead of using the Room like a lazy bag of dirt.

I just assumed the Room just took it from the Room of Hidden Things tbh.

**** That's what I always thought too--though it's possible both might be a little right.

** Some stories (as T0lias already mentioned) hold that it merely summons items (or copies of items) found elswhere in the castle. Certainly, there's some appeal to the idea.

For me, the Room was created by Rowena Ravenclaw and is her equivalent of the Chamber of Secrets (what became the Headmaster's Office was Godric Gryffindor's room, the Elves' common room was Helga Hufflepuff's). It can Transfigure anything that is required of its owners, based on a wish-extrapolation mechanism not unlike the one Nicholas Flamel put in the Mirror of Erised.

Of course, Gamp's Law means it cannot create food, nor truly living organic beings, though I'm not sure it couldn't make an artificial sentient construct a la Sorting Hat. It also extends to medication --- you can't just wish up a cure for cancer and get a room filled with anti-cancer pills. It can't be used to create knowledge either --- if asked for a library, the books will be copies of the books in the Hogwarts Library as well as any other books that may be in Hogwarts at the moment.

Whenever someone leaves an object behind when departing a version of the Room, that object ends up in the Room of Hidden Things, and may be called upon for a version of the Room, if the semi-intelligent enchantments feel that the 'true' object would be a better match than what it could Transfigure.

Two versions of the Room cannot coexist within the same timeframe. The Room will be inaccessible from the outside as long as the person who initially wished its opening is inside.

For me, Voldemort hid the Diadem in a version of the room he'd wished up to be "A room for hiding a precious object, such that the object may not be summoned by anybody else". He wasn't an idiot. So wishing for "A room containing Voldemort's Horcrux" wouldn't have worked. However, as per White Squirrel's clever idea, asking for the Room of Hidden Things is essentially 'root access' --- it's not just another version of the Room, but its 'unenchanted' state.

** I suspect it probably can't get bigger than say, the great hall.

I doubt it can do moving things - no interactive practice dummies or floating/moving platforms.

Other than that, I'm not sure what sort of limits you're looking for. It can transform into any sort of room you want.

** To consider the true limits i think we should consider the origins of the room. I like to think that the room of requirement is created by the ambient magic of Hogwarts and grows stronger and stronger with each new generation. So following that line of thought, Gamp's law of elemental transfiguration is out. It cannot obviously summon or create anyone or anything outside the premises.

On the other hand, it could be created by the founders themselves as a helping aid to any student in need and as a last defense mechanism in Hogwarts. Or it could very well be Ravenclaw's secret chamber.

I don't think it can create books or potion ingredients or the like. I think it merely summons a copy of the book required. In a fic I read the room provided Ravenclaw's library when asked for one and the library contained a copy of every book anyone has brought in Hogwarts premises. That seems possible and quite interesting.

I think the room can do everything magic is capable of doing. Or maybe it's the heart of Hogwarts and it's magic, doing its bidding and providing help to the students.

** My personal theory is that the room was enchanted to perform magic on and using the objects left in it. Rowena does this to the best of her ability, and creates the room to take advantage of her diadem, which enhances the creativity and wisdom of the wearer, but when used by the room creates a pseudo-sentience akin to the sorting hat.

As the diadem is lost and Hogwarts ages, the room is not sentient and reverts to it's natural state - merely a room that summons specific objects (like a hammock) rather than fulfilling dynamic requests (like a place to sleep). The room only regains full functionality when the diadem is hidden in the room by Riddle.
