:END:
SPOILERS btw

There's this story I read a long time ago where shortly before his Wizengamot trial, Harry learned the Potter family is actually the renamed family of Avalon(some other mystical heritage that might not be called Avalon tbh). I remember that the families that supported the Dark Lord did so because the wizarding lords/wizards in general need a proper king to aid them in their connection to magic and they couldn't find the heir to Avalon (because James/the Potter family before Harry didn't know they were the heirs) and blood traitors were blood traitors because they gave up searching for the King of Avalon.

Anyway, all of the family lords pledged themselves to Harry and felt so connected and good with their magic, v heartwarming. Also Ron and Hermione pledged to him and they became more connected too and loved it.

I don't think it was completed but it was so good I want to read it again, any help would be appreciated guys!

UPDATE!! I found it!! It was not Avalon but a bloodline older than England, linkffn(9825937)


** Well that sounds awesome! Definitely not the one you're talking about but check out linkffn(gods amongst men). Towards the end, Harry gets Excalibur and becomes the future king of Avalon, which is most of all of Britain I think?

** Not sure if it's what your thinking of by linkffn(Expelled by broomstick flyer) Harry is kick out of Hogwarts after he is framed for raping Hermione and discovers he is the heir to Arthur Pendragon. Warning this is an older fics and has a lot of old tropes.

  I had an idea to take Harry into a new future, one I hadnt tried before, anyway this story is how after a rather traumatic event in his young life he got to be more than just a wizard. H/Hr again.

** So on a side note in its myth: Avallon is a small island where Excalibur was forged from the shards of Caliburn and the place King Arthur was taken to recover after his final duel with Modred.

If you are asking for a fic where Harry becomes the new King Arthur your asking for him to be King of Camelot/Britain not Avallon.
