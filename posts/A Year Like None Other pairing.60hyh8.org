  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** [[/spoiler][Skimming the last chapter and reading the epilogue didn't show a main pairing. Ron and Hermione kiss, and Snape gets teased about some woman, and that's about it.]]

** If you read on to the third "book" in the series, there's some Harry/Luna. Otherwise, like others are saying, no real Harry pairing.

**** Lol! So it's called a Family Like None Other, the third book in the series.

But you should know.. It's not complete. And it kind of looks like Aspen may be done with it, it hasn't updated in... Oh. Three years. That long already, I guess.

Anyway, it's still pretty good, for what's there. Also, I'm a super lurker with no idea of the proper format for posting links so, I'll just give you this one?
