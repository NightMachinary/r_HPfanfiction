I made a similar request some time ago, but I figure that with all the Rondemtion discussions of the last couple weeks, I'd try again.\\
While we know the Weasley's don't subscribe to the Pureblood rhetoric, it often seems like its used as an excuse to have them ignore the rest of Pureblood/WIzarding culture and heritage in general, and..yeah, I can see it, but I wouldn't mine seeing more works where they don't ignore it. Weasley's (and Prewett's, for that matter) are implied to be fairly old families, i think.\\
The ones I know of are Runaway Wizard linkffn(Runaway Wizard) where he shows up later, and 'The Chessmaster Series', which is currently ongoing (don't have the link since ffn's blocked here, but I know the author roams around here somewhere. Currently reading Harry Potter and the Claw of the Raven. Good, but it's one of the ones where the Weasley's ignore the culture.\\
Looking for any more you might know of.\\
Thanks!


** The Weasleys don't ignore pureblood culture in my story "Patron", and Ron's a main character.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

*** Pretty much. the bot can be picky some times. I'm at work, and while ff.net is...not /technically/ blocked in the normal sense, the request gets bounced around enough that it'll eventually time out, so it might as well be.\\
Ao3 was fine though. *shrugs*

  Harry finally gets tired of being mistreated by the Dursley's and his complaints ignored or dismissed by the faculty of Hogwarts so he runs away. He learns a lot on the streets and in the world he falls into.

  A stranger to Hogwarts brings some interesting changes. Being a Pureblood matters, suddenly. Even in Gryffindor.
