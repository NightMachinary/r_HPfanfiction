What is the oldest hp fanfic you know of? Not the first one you read, but the earliest written? Do you know of any pre-Goblet Of Fire fic? What about pre-Prisoner Of Azkaban? Was there anything before Chamber of Secrets? I'm curious to see how the characters were interpreted before it was even known that, for example, Scabbers was not just a rat. Even if you don't have a link, but remember reading something, explain or post the earliest Harry Potter fanfiction you know of existing.


** i remember that for a long time female!Blaise was a pretty common place thing to have, purely because Rowling never clarified his gender in the first couple books

** I read a fan fiction that was Pre-Goblet of Fire. It incorporated at least one rumor about book 4 that circulated before its publication, the inclusion of a Doomsday Tournament. I don't remember much about it (read it 15 years ago after all) but Harry had a crescent moon scar on his wrist from the Tournament. I think it was either Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, and involved Hermione traveling in time and meeting a young McGonagall.

** I just checked my favorite pairing and apparently H/Hr wasn't a serious thing until 2002 which was only 2 unfinished fics, and it actually picked up in 2004. I guess after OOTP people got tired of waiting for relationships.

***** From what I understand [[http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Time-Turner][here]], there isn't really a limit on how far back you can go but there are certainly risks and problems with going back arbitrarily far into the past. So it is still possible.

  Time-Turners are used to send the person or persons who wear it travelling through time. For every hour travelled, the Time-Turner must be turned once. Time-Turners are potentially dangerous contraptions, and thus are protected by the Ministry of Magic, who only give them out in very special circumstances. [[https://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Professor_McGonagall][Professor McGonagall]] had to write many letters to the Ministry of Magic before they allowed Hermione to have one. The consequences of using Time-Turners can be very serious; many wizards who have meddled with time have ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake, not understanding how or why they are able to see themselves.

This cannot be correct , killing your past self is impossible (paradox , hello) , isn't it said in canon that time-turners cannot really /change/ the past? Or i'm confused?

******** Rowling never really explained it, past the few lines we got in PoA. I think that, like in Doctor Who, that there are fixed points in time (like someone's death) that can't be changed through time travel and could result in a paradox if you tried. Or, like with /Back to the Future/, that it would create another, [[/s][separate timeline]].

**** I haven't heard of that but if that is the case then it is certainly possible they deleted even older fanfictions. Then again the website was founded in October 15, 1998 so ... It's not a huge time frame for others fanfictions to be put online and the whole Internet thing was still new. But yes, maybe there were older fanfictions!
