[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6963092/1/Keeping-Appearances]] sorta like this but maybe without the whole dumbledore and all of Harry's old friends are evil thing and without the twist you can see coming a mile away involving Tom.


** Linkffn(the brightest witch in the darkest house) stars a slytherin OC who is good friends with Harry.

Linkffn(a new kind of normal by brilliantlady) stars a Harry who finds out that Pansy Parkinson is his second or third cousin and befriends her.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. Complete. Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller
