I've seen a few different discussions about stories where Harry has abilities that he gained from sacrificing the spoils of a kill. I'm curious to know if there are more. I can easily see where this could create an overpowered Harry, but I digress. I think it could be interesting if used well and with a purpose. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10349675/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lightning-Scar]]) is my example, but linkffn(make a wish) also does this.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has a spell where you specify what you want to happen, then pay for it. It could cost you anything. Your life, for instance.

linkffn(Saving Connor) has a magical ability that involves taking magic away from others. It's plain power, nothing more.

In linkffn(Xerosis), Harry has a soul sucking ability. He can acquire magic powers by sucking souls.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
