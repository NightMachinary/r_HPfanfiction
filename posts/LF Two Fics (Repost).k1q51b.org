:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
1st Fic:

The Triwizard Tournament had a misspelling in the contract which is "Complete" instead of "Compete" and the champions have to work together after Harry tells them.

2nd Fic:

Harry is adopted by this family (forgot about if it's magical or non-magical) and they make a business??? or something and connect technology and magic together.

** I think the second one is All at Once. It's a fic where the Dursley's didn't let Harry go to hog warts and he ends up getting pseudo adopted by the people who own the car shop he got a job at. The tech part comes fairly late on and it's incomplete

*** Ah, that's not it. It's a pre-Hogwarts story or something.

  AU. Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, he went to Stonewall Secondary. His main goal in life was to leave the Dursleys' and go to college, until Remus Lupin finds him on his seventeenth birthday and his life changes all at once. See Ch 1 AN for more info.
