** No specific stories come to mind, but the most common flavors of disapproval that I've seen are sad!Remus, huffy!Hermione, and screeching!Molly when it eventually comes out that a 22 year old Auror is screwing a 15 year old student. Better yet when Tonks is stationed as a guard in Hogsmeade/Hogwarts or is the DADA Professor. Conveniently enough, nothing bad ever comes of it. I think there's even one where Madam Bones finds out and approves of the relationship, though the name of the story escapes me.

There's one called Nymphadora's Beau where her parents trick her into dating Harry, which was. . . weird. linkffn(10256543). It isn't the best written fic but the matchmaker premise is unique.

Conveniently enough, no mentions of statutory rape or age of consent are ever made in most honks fics.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer prior to fifth year, Andromeda Tonks finds out her daughter Nymphadora has set her sights on Remus Lupin. She's not happy with this, and tricks Tonks into going for Harry Potter instead. What starts out as a way to "get back" at her parents, turns into an uncommon romance... Canon until the start of Book 5 'Order of the Phoenix', mild lemons. / No updates, on hold.
