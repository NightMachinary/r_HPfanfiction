Hi ~ I'm new here so please let me know if there is a proper way to ask for advice or if I should head over to Discord or the chat room.

I need advice on how to get a letter to a person internationally without revealing the person's name or their location along the route.

Basically, Harry needs to send a letter to Snape (internationally) without revealing that Snape is alive or his location.

I have Harry casting an anti-location charm on the letter but I think I need more to ensure privacy.

House-elves? Numerous Owls?

Any advice?

Thanks!


** Is there some reason it can't be with an owl? In the fifth book Harry sends a letter to "Snuffles" and tells Hedwig it's Sirius. [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080317113347/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=18][Canonically owls can't be tracked to a secret location]]

So if an owl knows who it's going to you just tie an owl to it and say "you know where to go" and leave the mystery

*** I love the idea of an owl but I was concerned over it traveling long distances. Thanks for the link!

I tend to overthink things!

**** Yeah I think you're overthinking it. Nothing in the series points to seasoned owls being unable to travel long distances

***** Sirius sends letters with tropical birds, so long distance is definitely not an issue.

Are you referring to someone being unable to track the owl to the particular location or choosing a method that can work internationally?

In GoF, Harry sends a letter to Sirius via Hedwig when he is in hiding and Sirius sends his letters via tropical birds. It is a similar situation so I would like to think they would consider the same safety measures. But since it is Harry and Sirius, it is possible that they don't.

I beleive a variant of a disillusionment charm on the owl could work, and of course not mentioning Snape's name in the letter.

*** I totally forgot that Sirius used a tropical bird! I like your idea of a disillusionment charm on the owl.

** If there's a chance of setting things up ahead of time, they could arrange for a postbox at a very busy place and a way to notify the other that a message has been sent using Protean charms on a coin or something.

If Harry is sending blind, then he has to give Snape the clues publicly, but in a way no one else could decipher, like referencing his Aunt Petunia.

If it's just a message and nothing is important about the letter or package itself, then he could send a Patronus with directions to wait until Snape is alone to deliver it. In the books, Arthur sends a Patronus messenger to the trio about the status of the family, without knowing where they'd gone. His message also warned them not to respond, as they were under scrutiny.

*** The Arthur patronus thing bothers me with how easily exploited it could be to find people. I mean just cast it and then follow it! You don't have to know where they are and you can just find anyone.

*** Ha, as if I would flesh out a story before publishing it! :-(

I missed an opportunity to set up anything ahead of time so now I am kinda of stuck.
