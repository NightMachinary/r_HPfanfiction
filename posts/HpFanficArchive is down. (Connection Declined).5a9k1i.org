Looks like a page admin is doing some update work of some kind; connections are allowed in but cut off and declined as soon as it requests a page :( I was in the middle of a long chapter and it disappeared.

--EDIT-- WE ARE SAVED, hpffa and ffn.net are both back up!


** It's back up.

*** Yep, looks like the hosting system had problems; fanfiction.net went down for the exact same space of time :)

** If this happens again, I have an archive from 13 September. (Ish. I think it took a few days to download with my settings.)
