Every time I read a fic starting from the beginning, with conversations amongst 10/11 year-olds, I always think: "11 year olds don't talk like this! They're barely self-aware!"

"...Right?"

But you see, as I read more fanfiction, I'm less and less sure I'm right. There's this doubt slowly seeping into me, that 10 year olds actually /are/ self-aware, and I was just a stupid 10 year old, lagging years behind my peers, and I must have sounded super dumb every time I opened my mouth.

You see, I'm 22. I don't exactly talk to 10 year olds on a regular basis. So I've lost sight of what they really sound like. Let's take this excerpt from linkffn(*The Pureblood Princess*):

--------------

"Good morning, Mr. Black," she served herself a plate of fruit, fussing over which piece of melon she wanted, before continuing, "I was a bit surprised to see that you'd already left this morning." There was an unstated /without me/ at the end of that sentence, but if Pansy thought to throw Rigel off she should have been more direct. There was really nothing she did better than communicating without speaking.

"I've always been an early riser," she said. /You weren't there when I left./

"I see," Pansy said, "and just what about the early morning do you find so agreeable?" /Would it be worth my while to rise early as well?/

"I find the general lack of noise to be appealing," Rigel said, pretending not to notice Pansy stiffening in offense as she paused to finish her milk before continuing, "it allows one to understand the few things they do hear more clearly." /I wake early to avoid people, but I would make an exception for you because I value your company and would like to better understand you./ Truly, the second half of Rigel's statement might also be interpreted as a desire to have more intimate conversation, away from prying eyes and distractions, but she thought that between their young age and Pansy's good sense she was unlikely to be misunderstood.

"There seems to be some value in what you say," Pansy demurred, offering a small smile to show that Rigel had escaped Pansy's irritation for the time being.

--------------

I'm 22 and I can't do this!

Like, 11 year olds can't /really/ be this smart, right? To infer that subtext from every sentence? Shit, if 10 year olds do this, do adults do this even more!? Do I sound like a <10 year old to all my /current/ peers!?


** Oftentimes, 11 year olds are written unrealistically because it can be really boring/annoying to write them realistically. You could make some argument, though, that certain pureblood children have politics, etc drilled into them from an early age and thus are significantly more mature than expected.

** 11 year olds can be brought up (trained) to speak this way, just by being purposefully exposed to adult conversations in a (micro-) culture where education and critical thinking is valued. You raise your children (train them) to read a lot, be attentive to adult conversations (and discuss the conversations afterwards), and seek out a dictionary when they hear a word they don't know. Some of the phrases or manners of speaking above might just be copied from adults --- they may sound "intelligent", but they were just the proper manner of speaking for educated households in the 18th/19th centuries.

It's a widespread myth with little scientific basis that avoiding baby talk makes kids smarter or produces better verbal abilities.

****** Do you mean when babies are learning their first language?

Most of the (linguistic) books I've read about that seem to agree that there are many cases of kids with strong verbal abilities that were raised with baby talk, and there are also many cases of the opposite. There are even cultures where they don't even talk to babies when they're young (for cultural/religious reasons) and kids end up still speaking fluently. Parent input to children (when acquiring language) is /vastly/ overrated by most people.

Nothing conclusive has yet to be shown (if someone has evidence against this or that there's now a consensus plz lmk because I'm interested).

EDIT: In regards to reading to children producing strong verbal abilities (which is proven to happen), I'd argue it's more a factor of (1) Parents spending time with kids in general, forming a closer bond and (2) showing kids that reading can be done for pleasure. The actual reading itself probably isn't what matters, just the fact that it's a critical bonding moment.

** It's half-half. You don't write speech like in real life, as in writing conversations get to the point faster, discussions are shorter, problems are solved more quickly.

The level of speech you write is usually a bit higher, otherwise it would be pretty boring. However, what you need to always keep in mind: Adults often tend not to give 11-year-olds enough credit.

When I was 11 I had read all 6 parts of Harry Potter that were out until then, and I'd say I had a pretty good understanding of what happened in each of them. Sure, no complex literary works by any standards, but certainly no dumb books. I could read messages between the lines (comparison Werewolf / AIDS came to my mind), I could discover things not outright said (I had written down the theory that RAB is Regulus before DH came out) and generally keep all the information of the books in my mind. I also remember clearly that subtext existed in my school, even if I wasn't particularly good at it.

While pureblood-pretense is certainly over the top with it, you generally want to write smart- and clearly-speaking 11-year-olds, especially if the characters are important.

In a way, yes. However, in this particular case I think it's not an issue with not giving kids enough credit but rather with the fact that speaking like that is a skill of a certain kind and not everyone had it even amongst adults so those authors who make every kid speak that way because of what really is no reason are just being stupid instead. Heck, I will note that even the kids that are smarter than you'd think, even those who happen to be smarter than you (whoever you are and however smart you are, that applies to everyone reading this), can be and often enough are fairly naive and it is this naivete that makes it so unlikely for them to speak in such a way, at least not even close to as commonly as some authors write it happening.

***** While I do agree with the statement in the first sentence of your reply, it most cases it would be precisely this naivete that would make it so unlikely for children to sound the way they way certain writers make them speak. Because this isn't a “mature” style of talking, oh no no no; it's basically a discussion's equivalent of a political game.

That's the crux of the issue here. Maturity does not automatically equal being able to talk that way. No, /that/ is a particular skill that anyone who is naive is quite unlikely to be able to learn until they lose a lot of that naivete.

I could (if you weren't across the internet, that is) point you to a kid who happened to be /very/ mature, to the point that many people took her to be a few years older than she was and just petite even during her early teenage years. She never really spoke like that, and when she tried the result was more funny than anything (if you felt like laughing at someone else, that is), or maybe awkward; even when she did have smart-sounding she wanted to show others she knew, she was more like Remus with her speech, only with more pauses and less woe about being a werewolf. I do realise it is only an example of one so it's not much, but the point is, if we want to defend the decision to make the characters talk like that then we must stop pretending that it's really maturity that is behind such a way of speaking.

** Some 11-year-olds could speak in such a way for whatever reason, but that is not common; most just don't behave like this. More notably, even smarter and more intelligent kids generally don't behave that way, especially since kids tend to often be to some degree naive and it's that naivete that makes it impossible for them to be “political players” of the kind they'd need to be to behave that way.

Some kids might, if they've been taught to always do it or, in some cases, taught and then had it beaten into them. But applying /that/ to 90% of characters in a fanfic (do remember the words “beaten into them”) is not something I feel we should be doing.

One unfortunate thing about canon when you think about it is how few muggle or muggleborn kids and characters we ever actually see. As such the only reasonable estimates of a 'normal' child - not a genius - from our world that canon gives us to any level is Dudley, Colin Creevey and Dennis Creevey.

In stark contrast, many of the interactions that I had with public school kids (Eton boys included) were remarkably casual, even when they were talking amongst themselves. And at cadet camp, at that!

There's a balance to be struck, of course. Most children, issue of the nobility or not, would care far less about geopolitics and macroeconomics in comparison to the average adult. However, restricting their speech to baby-talking Quidditch is not only unappealing, but wildly unrealistic. Kids are sharp, devious and vulgar when they want to be, and naivete doesn't preclude them from that.

** Yes, and also no.

11 year Olds can talk and think like tyat, especially if they were trained to do so from a young age. If you get punished for being vulgar, you learn how to be vulgar without getting caught, which is learning to talk the right way. On the same level, it is unlikely that they speak that way all the time, especially amongst close friends. Draco probably talks similiar to that in oublic, but in front of Crabbe and hoyle he's going to be blunt and make poop jokes because they are funny to him. He just won't make them where he has been taught it is innapropriate. I.e. where he can get caught.

Also remember that 11 year Olds see thenselves as people to be taken seriously, even if adults don't. Whether or not she is reading the subtext correctly or not is a valid question, but she is definately going to read subtext, and make it I can't count the number of time ls I've talked with elementary schoolers and gotten that look that says I'm super dumb for not understanding what they meant when it is "so obvious" because I don't understand their subtext.

** I think it's a limitation of the written word rather than an inaccuracy, particularly for authors who have more stilted prose. In real life, subtext is a lot easier to pick up on but at the same time more instinctive and difficult to explain-so whilst a ten year old certainly might read that much into an exchange, it would be more of an impression than a certainty. So for example, Rigel's enunciation and general demeanour might help to convey the general idea 'I do like communicating with you early in the morning' even if at no point does anything as formal and exaggerated as the italicised text in the sample text pass through the minds of either child.

That is, it isn't something most would be capable of in their everyday lives on the fly, but given time to write out a scene like this they'd be perfectly capable of thinking up subtexts and such. Especially if they enjoy reading.

*** Having seen the essays 11-year olds hand in in school your post was good for a laugh. There may be a small minority capable of that but in the current educational climate the vast majority is utterly incapable of it.

**** Oh, well, you're probably right. I have some things that I wrote when I was 11 or 12 that read very much like this because I was into a lot of old-fashioned writers like Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte at the time. But I also wasn't allowed to watch much television and we didn't have smartphones or today's type of internet in the 90's either, so that probably contributed.

***** And that's the thing everything hinges on right there. /You/ were influenced by authors who were not only very skilled with word but also of a linguistic style that fostered verbosity and a more mature use of language. The average child through, you are lucky of the read /Goosebumps/, if at all. And that certainly reflects in their linguistic capabilities just as it did in yours.

And for the general Hogwarts attendees, we cannot use the outliers like you but must look at the averages. And they, unfortunately, barely rise above outright idiocy linguistically.

**** I think they are capable, they are just expected to remain children until they turn 26 so the develop slower. All it takes is extreme trauma, or very attentive and nurturing parents to make a kid act much more mature.

I don't disagree that most parents are not involved enough to treat 11 year olds like little adults and force them to act mature. I also do not want a bunch of heavily traumatized kids who were forced to grow up too quickly.

** I am no genius but I clearly remember things from when I was 3-4 years old and onward. I was rather self involved, I only knew the things that were going on around me. That does not mean that I could not have understood a greater extent of things if I had been exposed to it.

I have been at least partially sexually active since I was about 5, and so were most of the other kids at my pre-school center. Playing doctor and truth or dare. None of us were from abusive homes or were exposed to perverts etc, we were just curious kids. So sexuality in 11 year olds doesn't phase me either.

Given a chance, and treated/expected to act like a little adult I have zero qualms with someone acting like these kids or canon Hermione. Most children are not expected to act like this however, and so are self involved as you stated.

I think most adults forget what it is like to be a kid and so they see children as dumber than they are. The truth is the littlest little kids can be conniving, covetous, intelligent, saints or assholes. They will rise to the level you set for them. Common parenting however doesn't acknowledge this, instead they want "kids to be kids" for as long as possible. They put off adulthood until well into the 20's so kids stay self involved and unaware of the world around them until it hits them in the face.

So Ron is probably the most typical 11 year old depicted in the series, but with so much shit going on it is not surprising that others are acting much more maturely than he. Even Harry is much more mature, he just acts like he isn't for the sake of fitting in.

** I've forgotten a lot of things from when I was 12 and before, like I don't have much memories of it. I might remember like little moments, and I remember how to do the stuff I was taught in school then, but I don't remember how I acted and so on.\\
11 year olds could talk like that if they were raised like that. Of course it would be boring to write 11 year olds realistically, also not even canon writes 11 year olds realistically. 11 year olds would not be willing to go near a giant dog just because they believed that their teacher was trying to steal a stone of eternal life. (Sure Harry MIGHT do it, because he has no sense of self preservation, but I highly doubt the others would)

** No, it's just poorly as fuck written. i have a rule. 11year olds speak predominantly in single or two syllable words unless they're insanely common words. As they grow older and these longer words are used around them more often, then new longer words come in. It's only college educations or a fantastic reading program that have people shift from words like sleepy to fatigued or from hate to aversion

And even when writing hemione, i wouldn't have her say "he's indefatigable!" She would say something like "he's tireless!" Because she knows her audience is other kids who won't know what that means.
