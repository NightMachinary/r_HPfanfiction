It has always confused me when I read fanfiction where Harry would suddenly become godlike by collecting the deathly hollows or become immortal etc I mean why in the series when they described how the three brothers or the deathly hollows from death after they pissed death off so why would one who has ownership of all three deathly hollows become deaths master would it not be more reasonable to assume they would become deaths slave?


** The true master of death is one who accepts death is inevitable and "greets him as an old friend." Ignotus and Death walked together as equals. I guess you can twist "equal" to make the MoD immortal given that, in a sense, death is immortal, but you can't twist it to make him a slave.

*** Why not while the legend says ignotus and death walked together as equals who witnessed that ignotuss family don't really see them saying that ignotus was dragged away screaming and yelling like a child.

** Ah, but you see, eternal life wouldn't really be a good thing. You ever met an old person in their 80s/90s that is ready to die? Imagine what it might be like to never die. For Death, who knows what comforts the dead have, what could be worse than never having that rest, for walking alone through the endless echoes of time?

The well written MoD fics aren't Death giving a grand gift to Harry, they're Death giving the most potent curse imaginable.

*** For Harry, maybe. He's pretty broken by the fact that everyone he loves is dead by the end. I'd rather live forever so that my life would actually matter, personally.

If we're born just to die, then everything we do and are is utterly meaningless, and what we feel during this life doesn't matter because all suffering and all joy will add up to zero in the end.

And I've not seen any proposed afterlife that actually makes it any better.

So, no, I'd want to live forever. Even if it leads to sorrow.

** I like the fics where Death set the whole thing up to hire a replacement.
