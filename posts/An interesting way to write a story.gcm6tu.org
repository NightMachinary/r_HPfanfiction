A competition of sorts that begins with one chapter as a base and different people writting a second chapter and then being voted on by the readers to find the most liked one. The decided chapter becomes the official second chapter and it keeps going until the story reaches an end.

I think this would be really awesome because you get a small say in the direction of the story and there are always twists amd turns that you might never expect. If it had enough people involved it could really work great.


** Oooo..that could be the best way for some JUST starting out; to get some experience without having to worry about writers block (which is something I'm currently dealing with). I would LOVE to participate in something like this.
