All of them or just one, crossovers or not, I don't care. Just no genderbending (being reborn as a girl for a GOOD reason is okay though). Thank you!


** I love Cartographer's Craft by copperbadge. It involves a 16-year-old Sirius being brought to life through the Maurader's Map.

It's completed, and wonderfully written ( by the same author as Stealing Harry ). I highly recommend it!

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8376253/chapters/19188754][Misplaced Moony]] is kinda like this. Not reborn, but young Remus time travels to a sorta alternate reality in the future and has to pretend to be the adult Remus's son. There is both an ffn version and an Ao3 but the ffn has more chapters. The ffn is supposedly moving over to Ao3 now though because the author is moving all of her stuff. Not sure when that is happening though. linkao3(8376253)

  A mysterious item and mischievous Marauders end up accidentally shoving Remus Lupin into another time and place where he has to rebuild his life from scratch, deal with the aftermath of a war he hadn't yet been a part of, all with the help of new friends and a special young witch.
