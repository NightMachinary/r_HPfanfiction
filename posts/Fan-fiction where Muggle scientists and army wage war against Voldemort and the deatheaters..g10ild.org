What I found really weird while reading the HP books was how the muggles were treated as though they knew nothing. Which is certainly not true. We had used atom bombs in the WW2 and had progressed tremendously in science and mathematics. Our armies were extremely powerful and whatnot. But Rowling does a really poor job of doing justice to the muggles in this instance. The prime example would be how naive the British Prime Minister is portrayed as. As if MI-6 won't be immediately notified of the upcoming terrors that the minister of magic had told him.

So, I would like to read a fanfic where the idea of muggle technology and manpower is explored alongside their magical counterpart and how they handle the upsurge of the 2nd magical war after being notified by the minister for magic.


** There is whole group of stories (unflatteringly called “Muggle-wank”), where Muggles resolve everything, e.g., linkffn(Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue by White_Squirrel) or linkffn(Long Live The Queen by offsides).

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

** Wizard's Suck by Ares.Granger has Hermione reach out to the British Government and they help her rescue Harry from the Dursleys and then they and some other friends get military training and primarily uses military weapons to take out the deatheaters.

linkffn(9802351)

I think the reason a lot of fans don't go for these is that if muggle weapons work so well against wizards the wizards wouldn't last very long. Just from basic firepower and then quite frankly sheer numbers. So while you can find quite a few stories where muggle weapons are used most stories either have wizards use shields that prevent the rounds hitting or explain how the technology fails around magic eg primer won't ignite when struck, etc.

This story has Harry easily handling the third task. Atonement by old-crow

  Begins summer after fifth year. Harry is stuck at the Dursleys until a phone call changes his life. With goblins, the muggle government, and one Hermione Granger at his back Harry is ready for change and eager to leave an unjust, cruel, and stupid magical world behind.

** This... isn't really true. Wizards have every advantage except for numbers. Complete mind control, memeory erasure, matter alteration, teleportation, control over whether or not Muggles can enter the space they charm, etc. That's why MI-6 has no chance of knowing anything about the cause of the magical catastrophes, because they literally had wizards in the PM's office (it was Kingsley, in this case), protecting him and also allowing them to stop any attempt of what you're talking about. Muggles actually are defenseless against any concerted wizard attack, or even just a determined loner. I know this isn't really what you're asking for (others gave you some), but Muggle wank isn't really reasonable against just what I mentioned above. Atom bombs don't matter when there's no way, for instance, to use them against the wizards without just mostly or only killing Muggles (I don't think it's possible for Muggles to even interact with the space of Diagon Alley without a wizard literally walking them in).

*** As long as wizards keep track of what muggles are doing yes. But if you have a Voldemort controlled society that's completely isolated from muggles where barely anyone knows how guns work then a well prepared and coordinated surprise attack of professional muggle soldiers could be effective.

**** A Voldemort controlled society isn't one that's hidden from Muggles, he's actively attacking and seeking to eliminate them, especially in ways they cannot understand (i.e. Dementors, dark magic in general that they have no counter for, any charm that repels Muggles is simply unstoppable). Guns really have no use here. Kingsley got into the UK Prime Minister's office as a worker, and not a single person in the bureaucracy realized he was a person that didn't exist, according to Muggle records (Kingsley is a pureblood).

***** You're forgetting that secrecy is an international agreement. If Voldemort kills a few muggles here and there and obliviators cover it up then other countries will want to stay out of it and hope for someone else to deal with it. But if Voldemort threatens to expose magic large scale other countries won't be able to ignore him and the Voldemort war will turn from a local civil war into wizard world war. Assuming that Voldemort knows that he can't take on the entire magical world, the best option is to isolate magical Britain as much as possible.

****** The scenario you present is nonsensical..it's not an assumption to say Voldemort knows he can't take the rest of the magical world on, because we see that he does not even try that in canon. Even with magic exposed, there is literally nothing Muggles can do against even a tepid wizard offensive. Teleporting, mind control they cannot break, enchanted areas they cannot enter or physically interact with (Unplottable places). It's simply impossible, which is why the Muggles are portrayed the way they are. They really haven't got a chance.
