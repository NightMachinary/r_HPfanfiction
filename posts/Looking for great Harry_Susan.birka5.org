** Well, there's def no fics that I can remember that are Harry/Susan that could be classified as great.

There are good fics, not bad fics, and the most common rating, awful fics with this pairings.

The only 4 good fics imo that exists of this pairing, in a non-Harem Setting, are linkffn(Final Protocol; Harry Potter and The Worth of a Soul; The Forgotten Contract; You've Got a girl at home)

The not bad, but not good either, meaning, meh fics are linkffn(Thank you Ms Bones; Not the Only redhead; Harry Potter and the Shadow Hunter; To fight the coming darkness)

Awful fics are pretty much all of the rest.

Which is unfortunate, because Susan has a lot more potential for a good pairing than Daphne, even if you don't play the "niece of the Head of the DMLE" angle, like a 6th year fic.

There's a couple Harem fics with Susan that are ok, but not a one could be called great.

  Susan Bones, permanent nurse and bodyguard to the comatose Harry Potter, is commanded to execute the Order's final protocol. As hoped, Harry and Susan are transported to the past. But, Harry's recovery is only partial, so Susan must add to her duties the role of foot soldier as the two use their knowledge of the future against Voldemort. H/S. Time Travel. Subtle Soul Bond

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

**** Because you can extrapolate more things about her than Daphne, if you don't want a blank slate. You know, for instance, her friends, somewhat her personality in public, you know she has/had an aunt in the DMLE, you can either play she's an orphan or not, you can use exactly what you mentioned about the Hufflepuffs as a redemption arc, You can use the death of her Aunt as a gateway of introduction, something like the Order getting hold of her (if you go the orphan route) after Amelia's death, so Harry would meet her more and be sympathetic to her, seeing Sirius just died aswell.

There's a lot more potential for logic leaps with Susan than Daphne, but that doesn't mean they've been achieved. My favourite pairing is definitely Harry/Daphne, and I must've read at least 95% of all fics in ffn and a bunch in ao3 with it, so I know that some people are great with her and can give her depth. Also, who gives a shit about houses?
