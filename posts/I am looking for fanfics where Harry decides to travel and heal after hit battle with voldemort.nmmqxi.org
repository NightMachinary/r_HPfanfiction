As the title suggests: this. I would love a fanfic where he's slowly healing and doing things he's never done before and maybe even finding love (with any character, I'm not partial to any particular pairing)

Thank you!


** For what it's worth, you should probably change the flair from *Recommendation* to *Request*. Recommendation is for topics when you want to recommend a fanfic you've read.

Anyway, onto the fanfic recs...

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238750/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Antiquity-Link][Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link]]/ is the only one I've read that really fits this criteria(I tend to read a lot of fics taking place at Hogwarts)

** Doesn't exactly entirely fit your criteria, but linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot) is my go-to fic for whenever I get into the 'Harry travels the world' kinda mood. Cause every time I search for something else, it usually falls short, plot wise, or is incomplete/abandoned.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

  He's never been as clumsy with anything as he is with his affection for Deku. It's one of the only things that has ever truly left him speechless. When it gets really bad, Katsuki finds himself in bed, replaying their fights like a movie on the ceiling. He sees Deku's mangled body in his nightmares, jolts awake with saltwater vision and a lead tongue. He can never sleep after. On those nights, he spends hours upon hours fighting in the trenches of his self-induced mental warfare---what could I have done differently, how could I have protected him better, how do I pretend that I'd be able to live in a life that's not in Deku's shape.

** The epilogue of linkffn(Endgame by Lequin) is like that. There is also linkao3(Abandon by continuedinterests) which is some years after the war. And also linkffn(Imagination by Potato19).

I know of one other story but that is about Harry returning to Britain years after the sabbatical.
