The Second Wizarding War takes place in the 2010s, not the 1990s. The aliens invade in 2015, and suppress all magic(Humans must lose, remember? This really is the only way that happens), resulting in the ICW revealing itself and pledging support to the XCOM project. Of course, XCOM fails, resulting in Earth becoming dominated by the aliens. A few wizards, (Death Eaters and the Order), manage to reclaim some limited magical abilities. These two separate factions later join XCOM's Resistance Council, along with the Skirmishers, Reapers, and Templars.


** Or the magicals managed hinding during the first war but become exposed with muggleborns born during the advent regency. they forced join the fray on one side or the other. Maybe the Psionics of the first war are even a kind wandless magic and the amplifier of the second rudimentary technological focis. So the Templar could be a militant splinter group of the wizarding world/muggleborns out of the secret...
