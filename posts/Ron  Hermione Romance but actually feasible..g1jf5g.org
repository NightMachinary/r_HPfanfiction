I feel like this might be asking a lot. I know most people in this fandom don't like these two together. I get it. I don't think they'd ever have become friends if not for Harry.

Still, I want to read a story were they fall in love and it feels right rather than a hamfisted way of tying off a romantic loose end.

What ways could canon be twisted to push them together? Can anyone fit them together withOUT drastically changing personality to make it easy? Has anyone managed that already? Can I see?

Since I don't really see it happening easily in Hogwarts, what further experiences after canon could have brought them together? I feel like this would be easiest because it preserves how they develop in school while still allowing for further development.

If this fandom can write fics pairing Draco with Hermione and make it actually good and even make sense then I think they can do it with Ron.


** It's a more likely relationship than Draco to happen without majorly twisting canon, as you have to rewrite Draco's character majorly or do something stupid like make Hermione a pureblood and/or ok with bigotry to get them together.

At base, the most likely way is some kind of shared interest outside of school (chess? I dunno) and each having poor romantic experiences elsewhere. . It's not really a pairing I'm into at all, so I don't read such stories enough to recommend any. ðŸ˜…

*** That's what I was thinking, you read him and Hermione and the relationship is caustic. He behaves like he'd rather die than treat a "mudblood" well. Even then I've read stories where Draco is a little racist, elitist, deatheater but the situation and the narrative forces him into a situation that challenges his views and he develops into something different. It's even done well sometimes. He still feels like Draco, because you can follow the line of development, but now he can actually be involved with Hermione without it feeling wrong. Same goes for Hermione in some of these fics, though in those fics it feels like her character is devolving rather than developing.

I guess development is the key word here, no one seems to realistically develop Ronald.

Draco and Hermione's animosity from being on polar opposites of both war and worldview makes a great setting for more sweeping and dramatic romantic ventures, I suppose, but so does her and Ron traveling the nation with Harry as fugitives. The book even has strong bonding moments between Harry and Hermione (they dance together I think?) would it be that hard for an author to construct moments like that to give credence to Ron and Hermione's canon relationship?

God i'm having fun ranting about this.

**** To be honest, when characters are written to change that much, I rarely find myself interested in them or that story as much, it's just a preference of mine. I read fanfic for very specific characterizations that are similar enough to canon that I can make it mesh in my brain. So a Draco without the pompousness, at least some of his bigotry (lapsed or not) just feels too off, like a Harry that is a coward. Personality wise, I just don't think the 2 can work and still remain who they are (and Ron as well, but it's more likely imo).

***** Yeah, I absolutely see where you're coming from. That's the general mentality I have as well. I remember feeling offended when I realized I was enjoying a fic that paired the two together. It felt like I was betraying some kind of personal ideal. I wish I remembered what that story was. Pretty sure he kept the pompousness, he just was shocked into a more realistic view of the world? I don't know, I wanted to get into how Ron and Hermione could work, not Draco, stop distracting me

Because of both of their actions in the book, but for all Ron's faults he never magically assulted Hermione, but fanon (taking cues from canon) would rather make Ron the bad guy who /dared/ insult Princess Hermione.

Hell, /Harry/ wouldn't be friends with her either. Just read the first few chapter of Book 1. Failing that, put yourself in Ron and Harry's shoes at 11 and imagine some bossy girl bothering you all the time. She was seriously annoying until after the troll, which made them fire-forged friends. /Failing that/ remember 4th year. When Ron and Harry had their fight and Harry hung out with Hermione, he was seriously bored.

*** Good point, I suppose if I really want to get a pairing together I could just throw trolls at them until they click.
