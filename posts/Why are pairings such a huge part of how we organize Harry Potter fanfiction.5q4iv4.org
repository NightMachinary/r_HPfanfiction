** I think it's a side effect of the distinction between fanfiction and regular fiction. Fanfiction requires that the author and reader come to the table with prior knowledge of the story, while more traditional fiction does not. As a result, your audience already has things they want to see pr don't want to see in their stories. Pairings are simply one facet of that. Bashing, MoD Harry, maaipulative!dumbledore, etc. All of these are the same concept as pairings in that they are a preview of the content of the story so the audience can filter to find the variation of cannon they want to read. Pairings are probably more popular, but it's still the same reason. Different pairings imply a different variation that you may or may not want to read.

**** One example: Harry/Snape doesn't fit at all in my mental image of Harry /or/ Snape - two important characters of this series.

So, with one glance I know that the fic author and I have so different views about this rather important topic, that I probably won't be interested in what the story has to offer otherwise, simply because his (/ her) different interpretation of these characters will make me discredit the rest of the story.

**** Every fandom has their preferred pairings. Some people love Harry and Ginny other is Harry and Hermione. Some people even like Harry and Tonks or Harry and Daphne or Fleur.

Myself I don't have a particular special pairing. I've read great stories with almost every pairing you can imagine.

**** Because everyone has their own headcanon (I, for example, dislike Ron, Molly and Dumbledore based on their actions which, in my interpretation, are criminal therefore I don't want fics where they are good). People want to read stuff which makes sense for them or at least has a good excuse why they act differently than in JKR's canon(Bella being fed loyalty potions or Ginny being brainwashed for example).

So when I encounter a story I ask myself if it makes sense for me (and I am not only talking about pairings here). Arthur Weasley being Minister? How, he's one of the most incompetent department heads. So if a story has elements which I think are not plausible, even in a magical world I tend to dismiss them. Therefore I tend to ignore all stories that involve said elements.

Am I missing something by ignoring fics just because I dislike the pairings? Probably. But I also avoid starting twenty fics and dropping them all because I cannot dive into their world.

**** It totally depends on the reader.

I, for instance, dislike to write fanfics with pairings (there is an exception, but that was an experiment), but enjoy to read those which have them. Why? Because I feel that romance tends to disrupt the storyline of my stories and adds nothing relevant.

** People focusing on a pairing rather than the plot as a whole is what leads there to being such a large amount of unreadable stories in the first place. A pairing can be a part of the plot as a whole, but figuring out how to get two characters together shouldn't be the driving focus.

Of course, I'm extremely guilty of this.

** As long as a fic has one of my shipped pairings, I'll read it regardless of the category. Sometimes I want my main pairing in a humorous fic.. other times I want lots of angst. However, I would rather look through a list of fics using my pairings to find something I want to read (which is likely to be almost all of them) vs. a list of humorous fics and only find one or two I'd want to read.

** Youve raised some good points. I think we should also take into account what fanfic was to a lot of us back in the day.

Fanfic was at its most popular during Harry Potter 4 and 7. When most of us were that age, we were 11-17. Sexual energy with no outlet whatsoever so it was channeled into Fanfiction. ( Plus Highspeed internet and Video porn was prevalent but not THAT ubiquitous) So Fanfiction writers and readers sometimes wanted to pour their sexual teenage energy into something - Slash and pairings. They imagined themselves as those characters etc.

And since fanfics are mostly women as well ( source needed) there is relatively a lot of gay slash.

So when readers wanted to scratch their itch, they just sorted by specific pairings. And it just stuck I guess.

At least that is my theory

** It's not about the pairing so much as it is about the characters.

Characters are the most important part of the story, only fandoms with plenty of interesting characters become large. Not that plots are necessarily unimportant generally but I like exciting situations because I like to see different facets of my favourite characters.

It's more the characters than the ship in my opinion, I want the main characters to be ones I want to see interacting together.

** Lots of reasons.

Me personally, I like romantic aspects of stories and felt Rowling's work, while utterly brilliant, lacked significant romantic plot. The relationships themselves were only brushed upon and served as a side story to main Voldemort plot. So I like to read fics that focus much more heavily on romantic plots to fully round the story. Also, as much as I enjoy a good mystery or adventure story, so many fics either rehash the actual main story of Harry Potter or come up with a new tale that is significantly weaker than what Rowling wrote. The romance stuff, when written well, is one of the only aspects of Harry Potter where the fanfic author can improve on Rowling's writing.

Finally, much of fanfiction is about a much deeper character study compared to a plot-driven story. One of the best ways to explore a character in greater detail is through a relationship.

#+begin_quote
  We don't approach traditional fiction that way, so why fanfiction?
#+end_quote

A lot of fan fiction is of the romance genre -- as of this day, FFN has 724K HP fics, with 399K falling into the romance genre, without accounting for secondary genre. That's a sizable percentage.

In pro romance, the pairing is the whole point of the story. It makes sense for that to be the case with fan fiction romance too.

As far as pairings in non-romance fics go, the reasoning is probably much the same as it is for writing any fan fiction: /Wouldn't it be cool or amazing or interesting if ...?/

The "path not taken" is one of the biggest draws of fics.

Finally, no one, not even romance-genre-fic-avoiding people like me, wants to get twenty chapters deep into a story before realizing that their favorite character, X, is being paired with their most hated character of Y, and now what has been a perfectly good, nay, even great fic -- it's spelled right and updates on time and is in character and, my god, the writing is actually /good/, as in this could be published *good* -- has been utterly spoiled by that vapid, colorless, awful turd-in-a-punchbowl of a character whom you suddenly suspect is a stand-in for the author ...

... not that I would know what that's personally like or anything.

** I definitely think that romance is a huge part of it. Typically, we like to read the good stories and we enjoy them, but you have to always keep in mind the sheer number of fics out there. On FFN alone, there are upwards of 700k stories. I wrote a story, about 50k, which is the most terrible, badly written piece of shit that I have written. And it has enough favs and follows to qualify as better than 99.9% of the fics on the site. The other 99% is for the most part overly cliched, badly written romance oriented or dark fics, seemingly written by hormonal or angsty teens. I personally blame the overall demographic. Of course I may be biased. I generally dislike romance in stories because I am much more interested in the plot, and to me, romance is not plot, not enough to justify 50k words about it. Sure, I will read something unique such as a Harry/Neville pairing, but really, I think that the demographic is just too romance obsessed, and there aren't enough GenFics.

** Often the type of pairing will dictate (or hint at) the type of Harry it will be. This is especially relevant for HP fics where there are so many possible types of Harrys (does this make sense? lol).

For example - Voldemort/Harry and Harry/Hermione and Harry/Fleur - the pairings alone give me a pretty good basic idea of the type of Harry and the type of direction these fics might go in, and also whether or not I might be interested in reading to find out more.

** It probably has something to do with how characters interact; certain characters will react and interact certain ways to others if they're paired or not, and thus change how the react to other things as well. Romance may not always be a huge part of a fic, but it often is some part of it, and thus being able to pick how that part plays out on some level is pleasing. It means going into a story you at least know you will enjoy some part of it, even if the rest wouldn't normally tickle your fancy.

** I identify with reason 1 for why I look for stories by pairing. I've read enough of the run of the mill stuff that I immediately get turned off to a story if it's full of clichés.

I've lately been interested in stories with fem!voldemort just because a lot of different stuff had to happen to get that point and everything after will usually be unique as well.

I no longer want to read scene for scene interations of canon where Harry just has an extra power or discovers that studying makes you better at magic.

**** Depends on the association between magical ability and life success. For instance, as a Malfoy, your level of success might depend mostly on your ability to turn money into more money. Or your ability to gather blackmail material. Or maybe you need a lot of personal facility with magic to impress and gain followers -- as would the average Dark Lord.

A shopkeeper can make do with much less magical skill than a Dark Lord.

** Hello. I think a pretty major reason is because so many fics have pairings, and only a minority of fics don't. That makes it a really good way to categorise and sort fanfics into neatly ordered sections. Then there is the fact that stories with similar pairings seem to follow similar patterns. For example, Harry/Hermione often sees Harry getting really into books and intelligence and the two fighting out against the oppressive pureblood regime, either from the inside through politics or from the outside.

** I have always thought that reading fanfiction is more therapy for me than reading regular fiction. Like a little kid that can watch the Lion King 1000 times in a row, my psyche is working through the HP universe to try and understand my universe. If I pick up a book in an unknown universe, I'm looking for new things and adventure, but often I'm not quite up to that.\\
Harry's dysfunctional roles are the scapegoat and the invisible child, both of those roles were mine as a kid. It is kind of obvious why I like the stories where he is rescued from that and don't like the stories where those roles take him out.\\
