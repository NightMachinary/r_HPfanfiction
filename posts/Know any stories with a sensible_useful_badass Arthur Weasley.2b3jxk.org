Even in canon I don't remember Arthur Weasley actually DOING much; Molly seems to run that house with an iron fist, and then she gets to kill Bellatrix; Arthur's only thing of note in the battle is a collab takedown with Percy (Pius Thickesse). In fanon I've seen Molly and Ginny villified (and Ron sometimes too), but I've never really seen any stories where Arthur Weasley has much of a role beyond being the Weasley dad and just being there.

Anyone read any with a more proactive Arthur? I couldnt even tell you what his particular magical skills are.


** Forging the Sword gives him a few paragraphs in one of the more recent chapters. Its argument is pretty good, and canon compliant.

I wanted to mention it too. Here's a relevant quote from Ch.13:

#+begin_quote
  By the time they reached their camp again, Mr. Weasley had pointed out an obliviator, two unspeakables, an auror, a secretary for the improper use of magic department, a diplomat for the being division in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and a member of the Floo Regulation Committee. Ron was apparently used to it, because he didn't seem all that captivated. But from what her friend had said, she'd gotten the impression that even though Mr. Weasley headed the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office, he wasn't really that important.

  That wasn't what she was seeing now.

  Well, maybe he isn't /important/ important, but he sure seems to know a lot of people.

  Though come to think of it, hadn't he sponsored a bill a year or two ago? The one that Lucius Malfoy had been so determined to foil that he'd placed the Diary in Ginny's hands? And before that, she'd heard from Harry that Mrs. Weasley had said something about Mr. Weasley deliberately writing loopholes into one of the laws so he could make his magical car...

  She stared at the man. He was kneeling by the fire, trying to light a match. The evidence of failed attempts lay all around him in splintered litter. Finally he managed to spark one into flame---and promptly dropped it in surprise.

  She tilted her head.

  It's like looking at one of those illusion drawings.

  One way: friend's father, kind of silly about muggles, a good man. Another way: writes and sponsors his own laws with private loopholes, trades favors for favors, knows everyone in the Ministry by name.

  Both are true.

  Which meant seeing him only one way... would be false.

Be warned though that it's a slow WiP, and I feel like his character is only starting to get developed\revealed.

**** I know! It's so good! Another argument: Arthur Weasley is Lucius Malfoy's archrival. Presumably, that's another sign that he's extremely competent, though perhaps he doesn't show it. This argument isn't made within forging the sword, but I can imagine it appearing in later chapters.

*** That would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2107570/1/Lord-of-Caer-Azkaban][Lord of Caer Azkaban]], the Weasleys (including ScaryPast!Arthur) are minor characters.

I vaguely recall a Weasley family-centric fic that involved them kidnapping Harry away from abusive training the Order put him through and adopting him into the Weasley family, I think Arthur had a pretty good fatherly role but I'm too tired to try to find it right now. If someone else wants to search I remember Harry had claustrophobia and Moody/couple other Order members (near nameless/faceless Auror cronies of his?) eventually locked Harry in a dark closet to force him to get over it.

** Related: fics with a highly competent Ron Weasley? I sometimes feel Ron's potential as a strategist was wasted by the books.

*** If you haven't read it yet, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix][Blood of the Phoenix]] features Ron as a very competent and likeable person, even showing him overcome his hatred of Slytherins.

P.S.: If you have anything competent!Ron fics to share, it'd be awesome ;)

** I know of two that feature Arthur actually doing something of use:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4755852/1/Where-Does-It-Keep-Its-Brain][Where Does It Keep Its Brain?]] by Sarah1281. "What if, instead of going back for Ginny's diary, Arthur decided to owl it to her? What if he discovered it wrote back? What if he took this knowledge to Moody and Dumbledore? The Chamber of Secrets has NOT been opened. Enemies of the heir, rejoice." Oneshot, 3,839 words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2881749/1/The-Weasley-Plot][The Weasley Plot]] by loralee1. "AU, Complete, post OotP, No HBP, The Weasleys believe family comes first, even if they are not blood, Arthur must choose his course what is right or what is easy, Harry Potter or Albus Dumbledore." Three chapters, 19,808 words.

** I don't remember much of anything about the fic (name general plot etc...) however out there somewhere exists a fic in which you find out that in the first war, out of desperation to protect his young family, Arthur took a job at the unassuming misuse of muggle artifacts office, then used his time to basically spy on death eaters and went behind Dumbledors OTP orders and turned vigilante assassin. You find this out because as the second war starts he takes up his cloak again. The most badass thing, if I remember correctly, was that his mask to hide his identity was a partially destroyed and blood stained Deatheater mask from his first kill
