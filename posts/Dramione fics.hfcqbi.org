Hello there! :)

I wanted indications of post-war longfics or in a universe where Voldemort won the war, or one in which Draco is a spy for the Order (like Snape). I really like fanfics in this sense, and of course, with a lot of tension, angst, rated M, and slow burn.

Note: I've read Manacled and Isolation. I'm looking for similar or well developed ones.

Thank you in advance!


** "Clean" by olivieblake is really good. The relationship is built beautifully and it is just an incredibly well-written story. It takes place during their 6th year and the sequel "Marked" is in their 7th. Draco's not a spy but Hermione knows about his mission and it's a whole thing.

For future reference, the Tumblr page "dramioneasks" is really good for recs. Also, [[/r/Dramione][r/Dramione]] is pretty useful.

  Malfoy's handsome face was contoured into a condescending smirk. "No faith in that giant brain of yours, Granger?" She looked up at him defiantly. "Maybe I don't have faith in you!" she said, raising her voice. Malfoy only looked at her. "You'll find I'm very surprising." Dramione AU, Year 6 with a slow burn and a killer twist. Book I of "This World or Any Other" series. COMPLETE.
