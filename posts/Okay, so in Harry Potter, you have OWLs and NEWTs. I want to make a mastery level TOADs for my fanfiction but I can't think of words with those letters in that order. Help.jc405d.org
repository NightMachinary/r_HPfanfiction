I mean, that's what I can gather from this comment section.

Edit: Not gonna lie, but E.A.G.L.E. is something I would most probably see in the States. Can you imagine the Brits (even if they're magicals) daring to use an acronym that is literally the national bird/symbol of those pesky revolutionaries in the New World?
