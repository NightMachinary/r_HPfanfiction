** I would say it's a mix of both. Many of the tropes found in TLaT were common before she started to write the story, but they weren't as cliche as they have become now. They were just common tropes that were done incredibly well with TLaT which caused a lot of new writers to try and imitate. Such is the way of well written stories: They may use some common tropes but everyone likes them so much they begin to become cliche.

Personally, I don't care about any of the cliche tropes as long as they're done well, which they are in The Life and Times.
