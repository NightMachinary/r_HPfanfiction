I have been trying to read 'The Rebel and The Chosen' by chelseyb1010, a Harry/Tonks story. It was removed from FF.net before I started it. Thankfully, it was archived on Fictionhunt and I was reading it there.

It seems that it was removed from there as well, at the request of the author. Does anyone have an offline copy of the complete story, that they are willing to share?
