** The trope-creator in this case is almost definitely linkffn(Reign of Power by Fyrning) -- we had a thread maybe a month ago talking about other trope-creator fics and I couldn't remember the name of this one... finally found it the other day.

Plot is standard indy!Harry fare, although it has quite a few clever twists and turns.

It's the execution that made this shine though. The author knew the value of, and utilised, *restraint* very well. There is actual political discourse and wizarding lore. Scenes are interesting throughout. There are no curb stomps, no rants, no cardboard characters getting "owned" by Harry. Well, plenty of people get owned but it's done in a fun, exciting way.

As a fic coming out right after OttP, this was the breath of freshest air, as half of the fics coming out were depressing angst fests (Sirius biting the bullet and all), another half was shitty indy!rebel!Harry bs (was a lot more attractive then due to freshness of the trope) and the third half (lol) was sickly sweet H/G or H/D turds.

So yeah, it still stands pretty well today -- the author was quite talented, both in inventing new stuff and using them to their full advantage.

(This is also a trope-creator for the much rarer ManBehindTheCurtain!Harry, or a Harry that's pulling everyone's strings. Have honestly read very few fics featuring it.)

*** This person knows their fanfic history :). Yeah earl of the north and lord of caer azkaban are the beginnings of the lord harry fics.

A lot of the lord harry tropes come from power of time though.
