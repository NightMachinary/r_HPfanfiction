After reading 25 chapters, I can say that I don't really like this fanfic. It has good writing but I feel like it doesn't have that much plot besides Snape and Hermione shacking up. I know it's a romance fic and I shouldn't be complaining but I can't get past Snivellus Snape and Hermione together.

I feel the best parts were before they left Hogwarts. Seeing Hermione becoming friends with Lily and Marauders is so cool but then, she's best friends with Snape. We really can't see her hanging out with the Marauders much after they left

What are your thoughts, guys?


** Ah man, it's frustrating me because I'm sure I've read this (or at least tried to) before; maybe the fact that I don't remember is a clue into how I felt about it. For every well-done Snape/Hermione fic there's at least ten more that, while maybe aren't horrible, don't really sell you on it because they assume that, if you're already reading it, you don't need to be sold.

If you're a fan of Hermione meeting and befriending the Marauders, there are lots of fics out there for that! Look up pretty much any Hermione/Marauder (there's a lot of Hermione/Sirius for some reason) and the well-written ones have way more than just the romantic plots. My favorite of all time is /The Debt of Time/ by Shayalonnie - I'm on my fifth read-through or so of it, it's my absolute favorite.

If you'd like to try to get past the Hermione/Snape thing (I never thought I would, but I've made a few exceptions) read either of Loten's fics, /Chasing the Sun/ or /Post Tenebras Lux/. It's a squicky pairing for some, so no worries if neither of those is up your alley either.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

  AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold. Complete.

  "After Darkness, Light." A chance meeting ten years after the war may not be just a coincidence, and may prove to have very far-reaching consequences. A story of many things, but primarily of healing. SS/HG; rated M for later chapters. Complete.
