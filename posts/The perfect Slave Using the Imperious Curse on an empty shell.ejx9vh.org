What are the limits of the Imperious curse?

Can a mage imperius oneself, and become enslaved to their own will, or does the structure of the spell collapse because of the paradox?

Can a mage imperius someone who then imperiuses the mage in turn, or does the second spell break the first?

How often can the imperius become diluted - can an imperius victim's victim imperious someone else?

How many Imperius curses can be maintained at any one time? Lord Voldemort supposedly directly controlled much of the ministry.

All these are interesting questions, and much of this probably depends on skill with the curse, as well as the caster's intent.

However, there is one thing I just thought of: Can you use the Imperious curse on a being without a soul? I'm unsure if animals have souls, but Spiders could be controlled through the spell. There are certain beings like Ghosts, Boggarts and Dementors which might not have souls in the mortal sense, but we don't know if they can be controlled through the curse.

Still, though - can you use the Curse on a Dementor's victim, given very complex instructions, and gain a perfectly docile slave?


** Don't know about all the other questions. I would however say that your last idea could be possible. When Harry gets hit by the Imperious curse he feels like he's out of control and there is this gentle voice in his head telling him what to do. And now imagine the same thing in a body without Harry (or anyone) in it. Would the body just do what it is told, or would you be screaming into an empty mind without effect?

You need to decide (for your fic/or headcanon) if the imperious curse takes away someone's control or if it just prods and convinces the victim to comply. I personally tend towards the second option, but I don't think it's really clear in canon...

** I like the theory that the unforgivables are soul based. They require hatred. They probably stain your soul from using them too much.

One instantly severs the soul from the body. One causes you to feel the pain down to your soul. And the last influences the soul to follow your will.

No Soul, no unforgivables.

That's the main problem I've always had with this theory. The Killing Curse can't just rip out someone's soul, because canonically the soul is not what keeps someone alive, it gives them consciousness. A person can live without a soul as seen with the Dementor's Kiss.

#+begin_quote
  You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no...anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just --- exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost.

-Remus, PoA

Now, your soul can tie you to life (Horcruxes), and when you die your soul leaves your body, but a soul leaving your body is not a cause of death. Souls aren't explained all that well in canon, but this theory contradicts what we do know about them.

**** I phrased it badly and missed a part.

The killing curse severs the soul from the body by making the body inhospitable for a soul by instantly killing it.

In my headcanon, I have the soul anchored to the body's lifeforce. The killing curse slices through that anchor. Soul goes onto the afterlife, the body instantly stops all operation from that anchor being severed.

*** See, that gives me the idea of somebody somehow turning Dementor victims into soldiers/weapons specifically because they're both expendable (being kinda already dead) and immune to the Unforgiveables. Maybe a gray, less evil analog to Inferi?

**** If i was a wizard and u called me a magician, i would probably give you a pumpkin for a head. If u called me a trickster...i think that's more giving you to the dementors territory. Anyway! As of the imperius curse, the way i understand it from the way it's effects are described in the books, it has more to do with the mind than soul. I imagine that anything with a brain could be put under the curse, in theory. Now, someone who has suffered a dementor's kiss and therefore no longer has a soul, is described as a shell, living dead, so maybe they would be easier to put under the curse because they obviously lost the will to exist, let alone fight it. I think the more intelligent the creature, the harder it would be to control, because when Harry was under the curse, the way he was snapping out of it was by questioning the reason behind performing the commands given to him by the caster and i think it's fair to say that the smarter a creature is, the harder it would be to control it(i say creature and not human since there are other kinds of beings that are proven or hinted to have similar or higher intelligence than wizards, like centaurs or even phoenixes). I imagine external factors would play a part too. Creatures like dragons have very thick hides so spells have a hard time penetrating them. Even if it was in theory possible to control a dragon's mind through the imperius curse, i doubt a single wizard could get to said mind and i don't think there is a way to perform this curse in a group. Giants are generally pretty low on the intelligence scale so perhaps that would make their minds easier to control by that prospective, but are also much more resilient to spells so i guess that would make it much harder to put them under the curse?

** We know the imperious can be chained, we see it when an imperioused Rosmerta cast the curse on Katie, however while Rosmerta acts normally, Katie acts more robotically, I don't know if it's because Malfoy Is a better caster than Rosmerta, or because Rosmerta is fighting his orders, or because the imperious gets more "diluted" the longer the chain is.

** I guess it depends on how you think the imperious curse works. So if you basically sublimate a person's entire will and personality by casting the curse, then you could certainly get your victim to cast on another victim but I don't think you'd be able to efficiently maintain active control over that person because you'd have to give the original victim instructions to provide the new victim. Unless you gave your victim instructions that could be paid forward indefinitely. Like “cast the imperious curse on someone you don't know, tell them to transfer all their funds to x bank account, and then repeat these instructions to them.” If, however, the curse is more like strong hypnosis where the person has most of their faculties but don't notice the effects of why they're doing something or why it's out of character, it would be much easier. You could be like “you serve the dark lord, and if anyone tries to get in your way cast the imperious curse on them and tell them that they serve the dark lord” etc. But then that gets into the duration of the curse - does it end as soon as you break the active connection? Can you have it continue indefinitely? Can it still control a victim after you end the spell? Does it have a half life?

My headcanon re: the ministry is that Voldemort didn't /need/ to use the imperious on too many people because corruption and coercion took care of most of the resistance at the top level, and lower-level bureaucrats just kept their heads down. But I recognize that's a pretty jaded view lol

Anyway, thanks for an awesome discussion post!Now I kinda want to start writing something
