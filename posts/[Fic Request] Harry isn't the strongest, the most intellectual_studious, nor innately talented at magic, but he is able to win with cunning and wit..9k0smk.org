** Here: linkffn(3885086)

Pretty hard concept to execute, cunning is probably the hardest attribute to write down.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

*** Yeah, JKR's magic system is ridiculously simple, so it honestly doesn't make sense when authors try to make characters in the series out to either be super weak or super underpowered. Spell casting in HP, when not involving Dumbledore or Voldemort, is basically just throwing spells at one another until either character either tires out or makes a mistake in blocking.

I'm not trying to knock JK's writing, but I really think that she was more interested in the world and the characters than the actual magic.

***** On the contrary, I've read fics where young students have used 'playground hexes' to get the upper hand. The kind that aren't exactly combat orientated and are usually used for small pranks but are surprisingly good at surprising, buying time and temporarily incapacitating opponents.

** There are hardly any fics which meet all those categories.

This one is where he wins using low grade spells and cunning. Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter by ShayneT)

This one is where he is regarded as a kind of an underdog and is horrible at magic at the start (though he improves). Linkffn(No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim by Eternal Payne)

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
