I was inspired by the thread on how JKR fails the Slytherins and short changes Draco out of a real redemption arc. Have you read any good fics where he works with Harry, Hermione and Ron while they're on the run?

  The night that Harry and Dumbledore return from the cave, the Death Eaters are delayed from reaching the top of the Astronomy Tower for one more minute. Draco Malfoy lowers his wand. / An AU in which Draco accepts Dumbledore's offer to fake his death and go into hiding with the Order of the Phoenix.

** "Draco Malfoy and the Truth of the Heart" but it's the seventh of a bigger series in where Draco time travels back in time and goes to Hogwarts all over again. Over time he forgets he time traveled (to an extent) but by that time he's already friends with Harry and Hermione. I really like it.

  Dumbledore, throughout his long, colourful life, had made a lot of dubious decisions, but the choice to send four emotionally constipated teenagers on a Horcrux hunt across the country to save the Wizarding World might have easily taken the cake. Or: The Camping Trip From Hell, and everything that followed after.
