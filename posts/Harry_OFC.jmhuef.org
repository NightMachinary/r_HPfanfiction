I'm kinda looking for a specific plot. I'd like a well written or at a minimum readable fic that has a focus on a Harry OFC romance. (not a daphne style but an actual made up OFC).

The story starting pre Hogwarts/other schooling is a must. Harry also going to another magical school is another must. I would also prefer finished works but if not wip is ok to.

If Harry is op or the wbwl or Dumbledore bashing etc. does not really matter as long as it meets the requests above.

Thank you in advance for any recommendations.

800k words, used to be on ff.net but was deleted for some reason.

I really love this fic, immersion might be a problem for people though since a LOT of the OC's in this are named after TV characters (most specifically, The West Wing).

***** Harry Potter and the Refiner's Fire. It also has Harry/OFC extremely well written at the beginning of the book.
