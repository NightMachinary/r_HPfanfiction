Hi there,

I am going to need a lot of reading materials for a 12h bus/train trip. I have read my fair share of Fanfictions and now I want to explore HP-Crossovers. Yesterday I attempted to find some fanfictions that I coul read on my trip, but ended up getting pretty frustrated in the process. All I found was Slash - or Hurt/Comfort/Angst stuffs that makes me feel nauseous.

I am looking for Harry Potter - Supernatural Crossovers that are NOT Slash/AngstFluffHurtComfort. I am fine with Female Harry, if it is not a pretty bad written selfinsert. I am not fine with SamDeanCastiel go to Hogwarts-Stories.

I you have got any gems that fit please let me now.

All the best

*** Did check the stories and while I appreciate the effort, I'll have to say maybe.\\
I am not a big fan of Hermione stories - as they tend to be selfinserts (sooner or later), but I'll give it the benefit of a doubt and read them anyways.

​

Do you have per chance any other suggestions? (I have tried finding Non_Slash Fics on Ao3 but was severly disappointed).

**** Sorry, can't help with more - I only discovered those because I was looking for Hermione-centric stories; I'm not into Supernatural.

** 4 days late but I just finished linkffn(illusions of grandeur)

Honestly the only HP/supernatural crossover I've ever read but it's pretty good. It has an incomplete sequel that seems to be very irregularly updated

#+begin_quote
  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.
