#+begin_quote
  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

****** It is a fine fic. Its a one shot for a reason and its an enjoyable read. Just because its only 10k words doesnt mean anything especially since 10k is long for a one shot

******* I read when I have shitloads of time to kill. As a result, I don't really bother with anything less than 80-100k words.

I'm not commenting on the quality of the fic. Could be written perfectly. I just very much prefer longer fics. Therefore I ain't reading it. The summary hyped me up, and the wordcount let me down.

And yeah- 10k words is great. For a oneshot. Which I don't read.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
