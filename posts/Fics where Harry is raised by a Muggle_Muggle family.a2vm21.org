Maybe they found Harry on the Durselys doorstep before they did, or the Durselys gave him up for adoption and a Muggle family adopted him. I just really like reading stories where Harry was raised in a good, decent household


** This one is really sweet and well-written. A wonderful Muggle mum and dad raise Harry, and it features Sirius Black as his godfather/uncle. His Muggle parents aren't super heavily featured, but definitely present for the majority of the story, as is their impact on Harry was he goes through his first year. A very wonderful and charming story.

  After March 13th, 1988, Harry Potter was no longer just the wizarding world's 'Boy-Who-Lived.' As the sole survivor of Flight 1326, he became the 'Boy-Who-Lived' to muggles as well. Despite Dumbledore's protests, Harry is now being raised in the home of Britain's Muggle Prime Minister, Gordon Rollins. Rollins is determined to unleash a prepared Harry onto the wizarding world.
