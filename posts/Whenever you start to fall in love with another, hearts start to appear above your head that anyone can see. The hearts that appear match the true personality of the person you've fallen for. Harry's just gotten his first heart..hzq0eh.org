The girl he likes hide her true personality and Harry doesn't understand why the heart "doesn't fit".\\
A big, pink, throbing heart with the usual Ice Queen Daphne and a blackn whitered heart for Horcruxe controlled Ginny are the most obvious choice, but people can get creative with it.

** To expand on this, it's not just colour but also texture/imagery as well.

Medieval heraldry had symbols that represented virtues or aspects of the owner, and in flowers different types have different meanings, too (e.g. some flowers mean platonic love, romantic love, condolences, et cetera).

The heart is the shield, and other symbolism is carved into/surrounds the heart.

** Time: Middle of fourth year, right after he rescues Gabrielle. Color: Light green.

It he spends the rest of the year trying to get to know the Delacours, an platonic relationship forms. They becolme freinds, going to hogsmede together, sharing tea, that kind of thing. Yet the heart never appears, only arriving during moments of stress, yet, as they gather for the maze, the heart returns, in its eternal hue. The contestants huddle, say good luck, may the best win, and the heart remains.

The maze looms, the heart fades, there is no time for love here, only survival. He enters, the maze is as danger as it is in canon, yet at once he sees it, a heart over the hedge. Harry pushes on, searching irlt out. An cry rings out, Krum has attacked fluer, not much hope remains, he has to finish this. The cup, he sees it, if he gets it, the contestants will stop, he grabs for it, only to see Cedric made it as well, there is a tug at his nabel, and the portkey activates.

"Kill the spare." Diggory falls, Voldemort is resurrected. Harry barely escapes, dragging cerdic's body back to Hogwarts. There is panic. Cedric is dead. Fluer wounded. Krum imperioused. Voldemort alive. Looking up he sees the heart.

Heart: Light green. Location: By Harry's side. Status: Shattered.
