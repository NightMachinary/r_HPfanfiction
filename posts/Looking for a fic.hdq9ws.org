:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In which Harry time travels to the Voldemort's time in Hogwarts. Unfortunately I don't remember how. He tries to stay as unassuming as possible to avoid attention, but it backfires and Tom takes interest in him. Then he drugs him at the party when he's drunk and tries to interrogate him. Potion don't work on Harry as it should I don't remember why, but Tom blames one of his "friends" who gave him the potion. Harry is not paralyzed like Tom planned and they have a huge physical fight. Both end up in infirmary. In this fic one from Tom's cirle, I think it was Lestrage, is in love with Tom and is jealous of his interest in Harry.

I thought it was on ao3, but I couldn't find it so I'm not sure. Thanks for any help!

  Getting stuck in 1942 was bad. Getting put into Slytherin was even worse. Having Tom Riddle practically stalk him? Harry hated his life. Prequel to Fate's Favourite. [ABANDONED.]
