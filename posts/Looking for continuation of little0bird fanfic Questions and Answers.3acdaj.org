Hello again guys ! I have written here 2 months ago, and you helped me A LOT with finding a fanfic that I wanted to read. I have written everything that she wrote. I mean [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][her]].

Thank you @silver_fire_lizard for helping me the most. From the list you gave me I chose The First Day and I literally got addicted to it.

Little0bird last story is Questions and Answers, but it is unfinished. Maybe some of you know if there is continuation of it somewhere else, and if not I would like to know other fanfics, similar to this entire series.


** I'm glad I'm not the only one still sad that Q&A went unfinished! I loved the writing style, and I wish it had the ending it deserves!

*** True that. Her writing style felt like I was reading another book written by JK Rowling.
