Doesn't matter what it's a xover with, I just love seeing how authors decide to combine two worlds.


** I really like Browcoat, Green Eyes; it's a Firefly crossover.

*** Was ok, but anyone wanting to try it keep in mind that Harry gets to keep all the magic of a wizard with (Dumbledore times Voldemort) level of experience in Firefly's setting. So he is pretty much God there - don't expect any kind of tension/peril.

** Harry Potter and the Natural 20; a Harry Potter + Dungeons and Dragons Crossover

"Milo, a genre-savvy D&D Wizard and Adventurer Extraordinaire is forced to attend Hogwarts, and soon finds himself plunged into a new adventure of magic, mad old Wizards, metagaming, misunderstandings, and munchkinry."

It is WIP, with first book completed. Usually I am not recommending unfinished stories, but this one is perfect - humor is great, crossover is done properly, characters are well done, no bashing, no OOC and Mirror of Erised chapter is among of the best things that I have ever read (and the best one that I have seen in fanfiction).

  "In accordance with Section Thirty-Two-Point-One-Four-One-Alpha of the 1634 Statute on Inexplicable Phenomena of a Magical Nature," Umbridge declared in an authoritative voice, reading from a scroll she'd been carrying somewhere on her person, "which states, in the words of the Great Wizard Peabody, 'When something really, really, really wyrd happens, and hear ye me I do mean REALLY wyrd, and lo, it hath never happened before, and neither sir nor gentle lady knoweth what to do, let the goddamned Department of Mysteries handle it, y'hear?

  "You see?" Milo said. "There's obviously some kind of subplot or sidequest involving Quidditch. I can only assume that we'll get bonus XP or Magic Items if we win the Cup. So: we'll win."

  "This place is awesome," he said. The amount of XP he could get just from random encounters in the school grounds... it suddenly made sense to him how such a school could be an effective way to gain power. This place was clearly, really, incredibly, obviously, brilliantly dangerous. With all the adventure and monster fighting that must be happening between classes, not to mention the magical brawls that naturally occur when you give an eleven-year-old untold arcane power in a practically unsupervised environment (it would take a staff of thousands to keep an eye on all of Hogwarts at once), these kids would be leveling up like crazy.

  "I can't let you start on teapots until you've managed to transfigure more than just the colour of the stick, young man. I'm sorry," she explained, then sighed. "If you can manage to change its weight, sound -- that is, the sound it makes when dropped --, or shape at all," she added, "then I'll let you move on."

  Milo frantically pulled out his spellbook and re-read the description of Prestidigitation. There was nothing in there about anything beyond colour. He bit his lip. There was a sewing needle in his Belt of Hidden Pouches, but Milo assumed that other students had tried to pull that one in the past and McGonagall probably had a way to tell the difference. He hadn't prepared Ghost Sound, which could create illusory sounds, but even if he had he probably couldn't get the timing right to make a ping! sound at the exact moment the pin hit the table. If he'd prepared Mage Hand, a weak telekinesis spell, he could maybe push down very gently on the pin to simulate the metal's higher density, but his only 0th-level spells were Dancing Lights, Prestidigitation, and Acid Splash.

  Milo ran his fingers through his hair nervously. There was absolutely no way he could turn this stick into a pin using his arcane magic.

  "Cuddly Cannons," Hermione laughed. An uncharitable person would call the sound she made a giggle, because while it was still politically correct to have giggling girls in a piece of literature in 1991, this is no longer the case.

**** It is a high fantasy series written by Robert Jordan and then finished by Brandon Sanderson when Jordan died. It involves a magic system (called "channeling") in which people can access the two halves of the One Power, saidin and saidar, to weave the five elements. There are dozens of POV characters, political intrigue, and of course a Huge Horrible Evil which our main protagonists must fight.

Only ones I've kind of liked were with torch wood. I liked the author, hadn't even watched torch wood at the time. It was suggestive of slash (rl/sb), I'll try and root out the link if any ones interested. On my phone at the mo.

**** heya i've actually been looking for the original story I was talking about for the last few days. and I've yet to find it?! Been trawling through the many authors I follow and reading the first few bits of any torchwoodxharrypotter fics I find.

It's really odd. The story involved SB and Ianto Jones stuck in a bar, whichs is supposed to be purgatory, together talking about their lives post veil/death.

I have a memory of remus wandering into the bar eventually after he passed away and Ianto being left there alone wondering if anyone would ever come for him.

It was really interesting. I have this thread earmarked, and if I come across it i'll let you know asap.
