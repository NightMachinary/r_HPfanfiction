I've been looking for this for a little while and would be very grateful if anyone could help me find it. Google hasn't helped as I don't remember enough, and while I'm pretty sure it is on either FFN or AO3, even their search (and scryer) hasn't narrowed it down enough for me.

​

Harry gives Voldemort the prophecy, wanting to break it.

Voldemort turns Harry into a girl to break the prophecy.

​

I'm pretty sure Harry ends up staying with Voldemort as she doesn't want to fight at all or he promises to keep her safe.

The only other thing I remember for sure is that by the end of the story, Harry has become a mostly traditional pureblood wife, planning parties and galas, etc..


** I totally remember this fic, but it took me a bit to track it down. I'm pretty sure it's Safe by being his Daughter linkffn(5774328)

  After having been kidnapped by Death Eaters, Harry Potter is offered a unique opportunity: to die or to become someone else. But could a new life that would be dictated by his archenemy even be something worth considering? And could death truly be so much worse? Harry has to find out what he wants to do with his life and time is not on his side. Warning: femHarry, character deaths

*** Thanks for helping, but while some parts are similar, and I enjoyed reading it, this isn't the fic I was looking for.

​

As a further upside though, the author of this did have another story that was on my list to be tracked down, so I'm now reading '[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5131411/1/Of-dark-and-light-veelas][Of dark and light veelas]]'.
