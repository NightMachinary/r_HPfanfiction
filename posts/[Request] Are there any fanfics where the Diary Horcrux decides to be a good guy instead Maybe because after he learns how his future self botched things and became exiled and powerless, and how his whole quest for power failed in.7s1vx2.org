***** Pronouns aren't the problem.

"Looses" means "not firmly or tightly fixed in place; detached or able to be detached." You loosen a knot to untie it, or a jar lid.

What the author meant was "loses", which means "be deprived of or cease to have or retain something." or to "become unable to find something or someone". You lose a game or, in this case, a diary.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

** linkffn(12473874) Sort of? It has a Slytherin Ginny who befriends the diary horcrux and when they meet the real Voldemort the diary realizes that his real self is crazy and no longer human and decides with Ginny to destroy the other Horcruxs' so that he is the only one remaining.

Not really "good guy" per se because he wants Ginny to become the new Dark Lord but he seems to at least actually care about her.

** I am afraid I don't have such a story, from my point of vue it doesn't sound very logical coming from a guy who had already made a Horcrux by that time. But then again I guess if the author is talented enough, they could weave quite an interesting tale.
