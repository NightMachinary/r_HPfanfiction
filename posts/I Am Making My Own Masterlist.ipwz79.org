Essentially, I've begun to compile a list of my favorite fanfictions and my immediate thoughts on them into a single list for my own self to reference as well as to allow me to easily make recommendations here. However, while my absolute favorites obviously stick out (you'll notice Delenda Est is at the top and no I will not be taking criticisms) I have been reading fanfiction for roughly eleven years, and many have slipped my mind over the years. So, if you like, please take a look at my list and then hit me up with your own recommendations. Either you'll turn me onto something new or you'll remind me about a fic I forgot.

Oneshots welcome!

Edit: Okay I don't know why I was given awards on this post, but thank you?


** I haven't read any of the fics on this list but will check some of them out. I like the thoughtful way you write the reviews and summaries. It would be nice if you could also indicate the length of the fic (no more million word megafics for me please) and ideally, give ao3 links (or ffn when necessary). I prefer ao3 links to ffn because ao3 lets you get the whole story on one page with a single click. Anyway, nice work!

** I highly recommend Birds of a Feather by Babylonsheep. Its a time piece of Tom Riddle in his Hogwarts years, but if Hermonie was born in that time period with him instead, it's very interesting and very well written characterization and very good at bringing you into the 1940s mindset. It's not complete yet though, and hasn't gotten a new chapter in a bit idk if author intends to complete it and just taking a break or if its abandoned still great

***** Really? Okay then.

There's no conflict. The story can be summed up as "Harry fixes the world by flinging huge amounts of cash at everything". Every problem that comes up is dealt with this way within moments of the issue being identified. Every other chapter seems to have a former classmate with a problem coming up to Harry, who hires them, throws cash at the problem and then moves on.

The writing is, at times, laughably bad. In the very first chapter we get the incredible line

#+begin_quote
  "This was my father's business," said Daphne. "Unfortunately, he was murdered by Death Eaters two months ago."
#+end_quote

...because everyone would describe their father's murder as unfortunate after two months, right?

Don't try to claim that Harry and Ginny splitting up is conflict either. The author is set on a Harry/Daphne pairing so simply moves the totally undefined Ginny out of the way and brings in the totally undefined Daphne instead. There's no romance, no wooing, no actual love: the switch has all the love interest of a set of Ikea instructions. Remove girlfriend A and insert girlfriend B. Jane Austen must be gutted she didn't manage anything so glorious.

I read a recent update to see why one or two people still think this is a readable story and it started with a healer having a headache, then a long discussion about renovating a hotel, and Fleur walking around an apothecary. There was zero plot movement, zero magic and zero interest. Oh - I see it's still the latest chapter. What else?

#+begin_quote
  While the GSC team finalised the details of Prisma, across the country at the James Potter Institute, the Cornfoot brothers had a meeting with the Institute's lawyer, Pearl Proctor-Langley.
#+end_quote

That's seriously a line in a story about magic? I've seen episodes of The Apprentice that have more to do with magic.

I've previously described Novocaine as "A story about accountancy set in the Wizarding World" and that's basically it. The whole story is full of boring characters doing boring things. If you're an accountant wanting to read about accountancy then you might get something out of it. Everyone else should steer well clear.

****** I didn't get as far as [[/u/rpeh]] but to tack on to it all, no one ever responds in way that feels authentic. There's never a scene of Harry offering to help someone and getting a response of, "Eh, thanks, but no thanks, I'll figure it out." There are people that, you know, like to accomplish things themselves. Everyone falls right into line.

You can jumble around half the names in the story and nothing changes.

The opening politics drags for all eternity and can be boiled down to nothing more than a list of names Harry now controls because plot reasons. And those reasons require a lot of suspension of disbelief for what is otherwise presented as a modern society. And, as of like twenty chapters later, or at least what felt like that long, it hadn't had any bearing on the story after it was discussed. Which make me wonder why we bothered spending so much time setting it up.

The Ginny subplot falls flat on its face as the only real conflict between the two boils down to Ginny would rather be her own person than Harry's trophy girlfriend. Harry starts throwing money at everyone in an attempt to become a political hegemon for....reasons...and never even talks about it with her and then we're supposed to be surprised when she has little interest in it. Breaking up over that is the most authentic thing in the story, except that it's done in such a robotic, almost transnational manner that it seems almost comical.

There's a lot of sentence structure issues and comma splices and the like, rpeh even points one out above while harping on a different issue. That alone becomes distracting.

I'm shocked it's got the following it does. It seemed very flavor of the month when it first started getting recommended. And I'm also almost positive I'm to blame for the Daphne/Lawyer troupe but...ugh. At least one or two of my readers picked up that Harry was using her when he'd fuck her.

******* While you and rpeh make several valid points, it seems that you're neglecting the reason why this story gets the following it does. It's because HP fanfic is so inundated with Lord Potter of Hogwarts BS while doing nothing with all the possibilities it offers.

Yes there's no conflict, but imo that makes sense since this is set in post-war. It's meant to be a slice of life story that doesn't focus that much on magic because that arc is considered to be over based on the setting. If I wanted magic, there are tons of fics that cater to that. Whilst the story is set in a magical world, people seem to forget that even wizards & witches have jobs. While some occupations are lucky that they deal with magic on a day to day basis, there are also a lot won't be able to do so. Apart from magic, all problems of the mundane world is mirrored. This story is a breath of fresh air to the community of HP fanfic full of OP Harry, Lord Potter of Potter, Black, Slytherin, Gryffindor, etc., sex fics, and the like.

Also, it's not fair to harp on the grammar of this story to the point of labelling it as "dreadful", whereas HP fanfiction contains a fuckton of stories that seems have not been proofread but still has a large following.

You're lecturing a guy who's written multiple fics that deal with exactly that and manage to do it with plot and characters that are more than just a list of names on paper.

Novocaine is plotless and dull. Arguing that it 'doesn't need conflict' because it's post war just points out how pointless the whole thing is. Conflict doesn't need to be people hexing each other. There's no difficulty in it, nothing feels earned, none of the characters develop at all, and, as [[/u/rpeh]] says nothing happens. It's the same thing over and over and over and over. Some conversations are repeated verbatim. Everything goes exactly the way Harry wants it to.

Novocaine is only popular because of the pairing. And because it updated frequently enough at the start to get everyone salivating about it. It does almost every technical aspect of actual story writing poorly and will continue ad infinitum until he gets bored because there's not plot. I'm also not sure how it can possibly be a breath of fresh air because what you cite it avoids...is literally the first chapters that boils down to 'who has what political seat even though it doesn't matter because Harry is the Hegemon.'

********* Well, those tropes that I cited are terrible simply because most of the time that this setting is used, only one thing is focused on. One fic I recall has the lordship trope, where Harry inherits Black, Potter, Slytherin by conquest/or his mom (somehow), and Gryffindor. Now nothing is wrong with using tropes, but if you're going to use it, at least do something with it. This story continues on where his titles are simply used as foil to make Harry even MORE ostentatious.

Have you ever played a game where you maxed out your level, finished all your missions/quests and there's simply nothing left to do? Well this story feels exactly like that to me, except there is the purpose of rebuilding/improving the infrastructure of the wizard world as well as giving more opportunities to muggles, since that's also a common trope where muggles are marginalized in the magical world. That's why this feels like a breath of fresh air.

******** You're making it sound like I don't criticise other stories. Definitely not true. Inter alia, I've criticised - and been criticised for criticising - Seventh Horcrux, which I consider to be one joke spread thinly over 100,000 words; A Black Comedy, which is *no* jokes spread over 250,000 words; and several other popular stories. I also praise stories quite often. It's how I started working with [[/u/TE7]] for instance.

On the grammar issue specifically, I've stopped reading plenty of stories because of poor grammar alone. On the other hand, once or twice, I've been gripped by the plot enough to offer to help out. In fact I did it just the other evening on a Discord channel, where a writer with English as a second language was... having trouble.

Other witches and wizards do have jobs. We see quite a few of them in canon and we see that, magic or not, a lot of jobs are still utterly tedious. In fact if you had to come up with one single theme for the seven canon books, it would be "Not even magic would be a panacea". But even when Rowling is writing about dull magical jobs, they're still magical. Self-inking quills, flying memos, rain in an office, and the like. If you're taking the magic out of a Harry Potter story, why not go the whole way and take Harry Potter out too?

If you want to see well-done slice-of-life stories, there's a good set by [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] at linkao3([[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1344409]]). Or try TE7's own linkffn(Vitam Paramus).

**** Understandable. It is not for everybody. Before I started reading it, I was also skeptical. But I found that there was so much more going on in that series than Draco Harry slash. However, romance begins in earnest in Book 5. By then, I was already ensnared.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins]] is my favourite fanfiction of all time. Its amazing.

** I really enjoyed Harry Potter and the Natural 20. It's a DnD crossover that focuses mainly on an original character, a human wizard from DnD pulled into the HP universe. Its delightful seeing how the different rules of magic dictate the story.

** I'll check out what you posted, but I think you are missing out if you have never read Blood Magic by Gateway Girl.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

I read you don't care for slash, so I'll tell you upfront that Blood Magic has some Snape/Lupin, but it is not the main plot of the story. Main plot is that it is Severitus and Harry and Snape struggle to build a relationship.

Another set of fics that has been around for ages and that deserves more recognition IMO would be Angie Astravic's work.

** Interesting, found a few I hadn't heard of before that sound interesting, so thanks for sharing!

Just a minor note: In your description of Strangers at Drakeshaugh, you use the phrase "deep-seeded". I believe it's actually "deep-seated" - I can't find an origin for the phrase that sources agree on, but most of them agree that it's seated, not seeded. Hope I didn't come across like an ass with this!

** Nice compilation!

If you have been reading or plan to continue reading a lot more in this fandom, I would strongly suggest adding more to your notes and descriptions to help you if you're looking for one of these again. Using Delenda Est as an example, I imagine if you read 30+ stories with this pairing, some of the details may blend together and it might be hard to figure out which is which later.

For example, my masterlist has a column for Sortings that differ from canon, to help keep track of the ones with Ravenclaw!Harry, the Golden Trio all in Slytherin, Gryffindor!Draco, etc. There's a column for which years the fic takes place (e.g., 1-3rd year, 7th year-2 years post war, 1945, etc.), a column animagus transformations, patronuses, and who lives/dies that's different from canon. It may seem silly to put in so much detail, but after 500+ fics listed in the last 3 years, plus many more forgotten before I started keeping track, it's really helpful when wanting to compare details or give a recommendation.

** I like your summaries, and I am going to read(or re-read) some of what you recommended)

I would just like to point out, that according to Author notes, the "canon" epilogue of Letters is in Chapter 21 and is very much Harry/Fleur, it's the Alternate Epilogue that's +bullshit+ not "canon". Still one of my favorite stories.
