** I actually sent an email to the moderator and got this in reply;

/"The site's host server is currently down. I'm trying to get ahold of them, but so far no go. I have an old backup of the site, but I'm going through some computer issues at the moment and can't get to them. I'm hoping to have the site back up again at some point."/

**** No prob. The timing couldn't be better really. I sent it a week ago and only now got a reply after getting three notifications that the message couldn't be delivered. I was worried the email wasn't even in service anymore!

** [[http://www.restrictedsection2.org/]] Isn't that the same site?

*** No and they say right in the FAQs that they don't have any of the stories from the old site.

** I'm not entirely sure what happened. I noticed that there aren't any records returned when I do a DNS lookup for the domain restrictedsection.org, and when I do a WHOIS lookup, it still appears to be registered. So, it's entirely possible that whoever was maintaining the site either had a problem with their hosting provider or their registrar.

I did notice that a different site, [[http://www.restrictedsection2.org/]], appears to be up. I don't know if those two are related.

** If you're stuck there's always the Wayback machine on archive.org:

[[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.restrictedsection.org/story.php*]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.restrictedsection.org/author.php*]]

If you can remember the author id, that would be helpful. Best of luck!

*** I've tried using the wayback machine but i run into the problem of a username and password for restrictedsection.org and as I can't remember or find my old one I get stuck.

** Hello, I'm an admin over at RS2. We're more of an extension of RS1. We were members of RS1 when it closed down so we created RS2. As much as we would have loved to move fics over, we couldn't. The problem was we couldn't bring any over. We would like to get more fan fic up at our site but for that we'd need authors. Feel free to post what fics you've written. There is some there but not a lot.

RS1 is down currently, and Libbie is working on it. There has been some hosting issues that goes beyond the RS1 server. For information check this: [[http://restrictedsection2.org/messages.html]]

If you want to start posting things or whatnot click on the forum tab or go to [[http://restrictedsection2.org/phpbb/index.php]].
