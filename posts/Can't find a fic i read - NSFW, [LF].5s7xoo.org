I at some point read a fic, in which the basic premise was the playing of a card game.

It was Gryffindor vs Slythering, in where 5 couples would be paired up, and the first to drop out would give a point to the other house.

There was a question asked in the beginning of each round, and they had to either answer truthfully (with a spell to hold them to it) or skip their turn. if they answered truthfully, they would then get a "good" card, while a "bad" card would be issued if they skipped their turn.

The pairings (as far as i remember) went like this Harry/Parvati - Draco/Hermione - Blaise/Ginny - Ron/Pansy - Dean/Lavender

Im not quite sure about the Dean pairing, i just remember it as Lavender..

If anyone knows what it is, or knows a place where i can get very specific search results (I read it on fanfiction.net)
