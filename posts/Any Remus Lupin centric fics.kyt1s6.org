Before you say it, I've read ATYD!!

I find Remus Lupin just a fascinating character. He's just had a very hard but interesting life! And I've read almost everything I can find with him as one of the centre characters but I'm always looking for something new!

I'm not picky on what the story is about. I love a good, juicy, plot heavy story rather a lot of romantic pining. But pairings within a plot driven story is fine. I'm good with pretty much any pairing. I like Wolfstar 😊.

Any universe, timetravel, era.

Any help at all is desperately appreciated!!

** I've seen /The Bureaucratic Error/ linkffn(13052940) recommended quite a bit. It's on my list to read, but I haven't yet, so this is more an observation of its existence and popularity than an actual rec. It's a "newly-dead Remus time-travels back to third year" fic.

I rather liked /A Lonely Path/ linkffn( 5411398). It's a "Harry ran away and never went to Hogwarts" fic that catches up with Harry when he's 14 or 15 or so. Remus is the only one that Harry will initially trust, and there's a lot of "found family" and angst happening. It was completed kinda recently after a really long hiatus. I didn't care for the ending much at all, since it felt rushed and tacked-on to me. Nonetheless, you may enjoy it if you're into those tropes. No romance that I recall, though there could be wolfstar at the end. It was so fast I don't really remember.

I don't know why you're getting the NSFW warning. I'm amused wondering if it's because of the confluence of terms in your post like "hard," "juicy", and "romance."

*** You and OP both should DEFINITELY read The Bureaucratic Error. It's fantastic---wonderfully nuanced characters, deeply moving at times, exciting in others, and not without dry humour. Sirius is done particularly well here as well. I think it's one of my fave fics in the whole fandom :)

Also, the bot does say it's not very smart...

** Hey [[/u/WhistlingBanshee][u/WhistlingBanshee]] I remember you recommending ATYD and just finished it. It's. Phenomenal. Feel like it spoils me for a lot of other fanfics. Admittedly I skimmed some parts like Remus/Grant's relationship after the first war but jeez it was incredible. I do think they could have shown Peter to be more suspicious though, or maybe those were in the parts I skimmed. I know the author has other smaller works but would love a sequel! Thanks for the rec!!

*** Haaa on brilliant I'm glad!!! I'm so glad you liked it!

Grant will always have a special place in my heart but I get why you skimmed those bits. The Bootleg Tapes and Out of the Blue are the side stories and really worth the read I promise.

Yes I do think they could have done that with Peter but also... I dunno, since we only see things from Remus's point of view and Remus never suspects peter it kinda makes sense?

They're other fic Dress Up In You is also well worth the read!

And if you want to see a fic with a suspicious Peter, linkao3(Remain in Light by veeagainst) has the most incredible Peter chapter. The whole fic is brilliant (but explicit... Warning). Sirius doesn't die in OoTP and it's how him and Remus get back together and fight the war? With flashbacks and insights. And it's just brilliant! Recommend. Thanks for remembering me!!!
