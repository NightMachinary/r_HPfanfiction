I have read so many fics that have a premise based on the Potter family being inherently good at wards yet cannot for the life of me recall at any time during canon where this is mentioned. So, tell me, why is it so widely accepted that the Potters are warders?


** It's entirely Fanon, generally when people wanted the Potter's to have a family trade they made them warders, whether this was because information about the Potter's had not been released on pottermore at the time the trope became popular im not sure. (because quite a few of the Potter's have been inventors/poitioneers, so that would be a more logical family trade)

** There may be several protection charms mentioned but I believe the word "wards" was never used in canon. Now since it seems you can layer multiple protection charms on a property it might not be that much of a stretch to calling them "wards".

As for why the Potters are "good at wards" that's just the choice of fanon authors. Considering the wiki etc has several of Potter's ancestors creating well known potions (Sleakeazy, pepper-up etc) I'm surprised more fanon authors don't make potion's the magic that the Potters are most known for.

** It's all fanon. Come to think of it, most fanfic tropes have no basis in canon. I honestly can't think of any HP fic that doesn't have some over the top fanon element.

*** It depends on what you mean by "no basis". Most fanon tropes are the explanation or possible reasons for the various plot holes or discrepancies that "don't seem quite right" eg while they may not be explicitly stated they are quite often implied.

Now the plot holes and discrepancies are easily seen when the reader (as an adult) looks back at a children's book. Remember for a kid to be the hero the adults either have to be unintentionally incompetent or intentionally negligent. Most of the tropes are an author's way to explain the discrepancies in canon.

So I would say that most fanfic tropes are at a minimum implied in canon.

**** I think it's more like a few people came up with ways to explain some plot holes and then everyone else went along with those explanation without really considering weather or not they were good explanations. For all his mistakes, Dumbledore is a good man trying to do the right thing, but because he messed up somethings that should have been obvious in hindsight, he's a manipulative dark lord who wants power even though in canon he turned down a bid for the position of minister out of fear of the person he might become with that kind of power. See what I mean? They're explanations but they're not rooted in anything concrete. There are ways Harry can be a hero without every adult trying to ruin his life for a laugh.

***** It depends what mood I'm in that determines whether Dumbledore is a good man that made honest mistakes and in hindsight his actions were wrong, or whether there was something much more sinister to Dumbledore's actions. In my opinion there is certainly enough leeway in canon to arrived at either of those two polar opposites and anywhere in between.

In terms of the minister comment I've read fics that explained that becoming minister would have restricted his power and that he had the maximum power by being Headmaster, Chief Wizard, and Supreme Mugwump. So in those fics he didn't turn down the position of minister from fear of what he might turn into but rather because he thought the position of minister would hamper him.

Again I see enough flexibility and leeway in canon to support that.

****** Tbh I don't see it. At the end of the day it's still a story meant for younger kids. You can really only go so far in how you want to reinterpret cannon events while still staying true to the characters and themes. I think the only way I can accept a story with a dark Dumbledore is if the whole thing is an AU and Dumbledore being dark is only one of many things that get changed in the story. If you have believable consequences for his shift in character from canon rather than just have it be that he's evil but he keeps that to himself and is just a master manipulator, then fine. I mean the guy is smart but he's not smart enough to fool literally everyone we might ever meet in the story.

Although come to think of it that would make a pretty interesting mystery story. Everyone is struggling to get the edge on Voldemort but there are little clues popping up that all come together at the end to show Dumbledore was the true threat all along. I'd read the crap out of that.

*** Perhaps none with the label, but there were plenty of examples of long-lasting, self-contained, static, area-of-effect defenses that could've fit the bill.

** As others have said, it's entirety Fanon. It's also, imo, not a fanon that makes sense. If the Potter family are master warders, then surely their ancestral family home is warded to the hilt and thus there was an option of somewhere James and Lily could have lived that, even if the fidelius failed, Voldemort would have had a hard time just walking through the door.

No, much better to say the Potters money came from potioneering and marketing said potions. Because that explains their wealth without blowing a huge hole in the one canon event most fanfics still need to have happened.

** This is rather hilarious bc James and Lilly are literally famous for You Know Who getting through their defenses and killing them.

*** Ah but that helps create the fics where Godrics Hollow was not their home. Instead it belonged to Dumbledore and he convinced them to stay there under a fidelius charm that he cast. Which leads to Dumbledore knew that Sirius wasn't their Secret keeper etc. Then of course that leads to how Potter Manor had these massive wards so why did James and Lily use "security through obscurity" by staying in Godrics Hollow.

Basically all of those tropes that try to answer the discrepancies found in a children's book to answer why (besides "plot reasons") James and lily were so easily found and killed.
