I've seen some people here on this subreddit compiling lists of their favourite fics and posting them, and I decided to do something similar as I've found such lists to be really helpful when I'm trying to find something new to read.

Most fics and oneshots on it are mostly plot-focused, and my fic preferences may not exactly be for everyone.

This list is still incomplete, and I'm sure to have missed many fics, so please feel free to leave me your own recommendations.

Includes oneshots, multi-chapter and short fics

This is from my 1st page of HP fanfics. Some obviously might not be to your liking. Some have better grammar than others but I generally only take well-written fics (grammatically and punctuation) with some exceptions.

Let me know if you want more.

** Off the top of my head, in no particular order. Both long fics and one-shots, some are more serious than others.

** My fav gen fic is an on-going Remus-centric fic about his time at Hogwarts from first year onwards.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/333775][Forgive Those Who Trespass]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/319257][At Your Service]] are two of my favorite plot-heavy Drarry longfics. They're both mystery fics, though the first one's a lot darker.
