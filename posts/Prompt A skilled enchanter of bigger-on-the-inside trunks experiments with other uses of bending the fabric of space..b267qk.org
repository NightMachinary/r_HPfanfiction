A curse flies in a straight line... but what is truly straight if space is non-euclidean?

Bending space = godlike powers.

  A curse flies in a straight line... but what is truly straight if *the Earth is rotating on an axis whilst circling around the Sun?*
#+end_quote

For a curse to travel in a 'straight line', you have to rationalize that curses are affected by gravity. Or, at the very least, that they travel in the way that you mind /tells you/ they should.

Both of those have humongous consequences which would be interesting to see explored.

**** We've never seen anyone apparate off Earth, so that might not even be possible in space. Even if it is, we don't know how fast you travel when apparating - is it truly instant, or is it slower than light? That doesn't matter on Earth, but it's very significant at astronomical distances.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/1/The-Universe-Is-An-Optimisation-Problem][/The Universe Is An Optimisation Problem/]] by notasentientantcolony, linkffn(12299677), features original world-building related to space-bending, though it doesn't focus on any particular character who uses it. I found the story quite interesting due to its creative world-building, though it isn't complete.

Here's a preview of this story's use of space-bending, from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/3/The-Universe-Is-An-Optimisation-Problem][chapter 3]]:

  Their next stop was Ollivanders, a wand store.

  Ozland and Ollivander passed through rows of dusty boxes stacked too high to be comfortable standing between, and reached the back, whereupon Ollivander opened a door, revealing an endless forest.

  He hadn't expected that.

  "Allow me to explain, Mr Dwimmersmith," Ollivander said, kindly. "Diagon Alley is contained within a pocket, I suppose you could say, of nonlocal space-time -- space-time torn from another 'universe' -- Chief Warlock Albus Dumbledore, the man you came in with, was, in fact, the one who did it -- /wedged/ very delicately inside local space-time, like tearing a hole inside white bread and putting a chunk of cheese inside -- my apologies, Mr Dwimmersmith, I haven't had lunch yet and my mind is naturally drifting towards . . . anyway, now, when you try and create a dimensional expansion /within/ a pocket such as Diagon Alley, there's nothing to expand /into/, per se -- if I were to go through the appropriate ritual right now -- the Ministry regulates that very heavily, by the way, Mr Dwimmersmith, so don't get any ideas -- since the back of this store is /right/ at the edge of the pocket, hence the buzzing noise you're hearing right now, there would just be blank white space. Nothingness. /But/, through careful experimentation -- oh, most of it must have been in the late seventies and early eighties -- we found that if you /leave/ something inside that white space, it acts as a /seed/ in a way, and nobody is really sure how it works. Someone accidentally left a grocery basket in a blankspace once, and it turned into an infinitely-large, self-restocking supermarket, so it wasn't /all/ eldritch abominations -- aha, not that there /were/ any eldritch abominations produced necessarily -- or, I suppose, not that there /weren't/ any eldritch abominations -- but I digress, the records are sealed, and I've said too much already, young man.

The story elaborates on this concept of bent space in the rest of the chapter and in the following chapters.
