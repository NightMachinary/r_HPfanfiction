Are there any stories where Harry's MoD powers allow him to see the dead and the plot involves him doing something about it? Think Odd Thomas, the Dean Koontz novel series and decently good/eh movie, dynamics and activities. He sees a dead person, then pokes around and investigates their death to find any living culprits. If there are also demonic/undead opponents for him to fight, that's good too.

As always, no other filters, any pairing, het or slash or femslash, weird shit accepted, cliches and tropes as you please.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768]] has him using the ring to summon the dead as a medium in Sherlock!verse. Only he can see them. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13978644/chapters/32183310]] has him seeing the dead too. Not a bad read. Not complete.

*** Cool, thanks for the recs! That first one looks interesting. Not sure about the second, the first chapter doesn't really grab me, but I'll give it a go.
