Here's an interesting thought, Dudley would get angry when things didn't go his way because he's a spoiled brat and growing up, his parents gave him everything he ever wanted to keep him happy. Accidental magic typically comes, as we know from canon when children are upset or in danger. Dudley was never upset enough most of his childhood because he wasn't allowed. Then he was emotionally stunted as he got older, hence no accidental magic and no Hogwarts list or letter.


** Lack of accidental magic does not prevent a Hogwarts letter from coming, that is, if he was a wizard, he would have gotten a Hogwarts letter.

***** Was it actually said outright that Dudley couldn't see them? Dudley knows nothing about magic, he could have thought Harry was conjuring the dementors out of thin air. Anyway, it's not an actual theory just a prompt

***** Post-canon answer is that a muggleborn who doesn't exhibit significant enough accidental magic /won't/ be accepted into Hogwarts:

#+begin_quote
  Thus, the very moment that Neville Longbottom was born, the Quill attempted to write his name and was refused by the Book, which snapped shut. Even the midwife who attended Alice Longbottom had failed to notice that Neville managed to shift his blankets more snugly over himself moments after birth, assuming that his father had tucked the baby in more securely. Neville's family persistently missed faint signs of magic in him and not until he was eight years old did either his disappointed great aunts and uncles, or the old stickler of a Book, accept that he was truly a wizard, when he survived a fall that should have killed him.

** I can imagine two ways to go with this prompt.

The easiest one is fairly similar to most "Dudley is a wizard" prompts in that he's never had any accidental magic incidents and doesn't know he's a wizard until he's 11. Most of these I've seen have his magic bound by Dumbledore at the request of the Dursleys when he was a baby. This Dudley usually turns on his Dursleyness and becomes very OOC immediately.

The other way would be to somehow rewrite/reinterpet the reception Hagrid gets in the shack as the Dursleys forbidding Dudley to go to Hogwarts, with the Hagrid reporting that back to Dumbledore without Harry or the Dursleys realizing what Dudley is. Canon proceeds until 5th year, when Harry realizes that Dudley can see the dementors.

Personally I've never had any interest in "X comes to Hogwarts late" stories so I would be more likely to pursue the first option with a canon characterization of Dudley.

I would envision lots of accidental magic from tantrums once he stops getting everything his way. I'd imagine he'd call everyone freaks a lot. He'd slowly warm up to magic over the years, probably have an interest in spells that allow him to be lazy like the summoning charm. The food at Hogwarts would be a big deal for him. Draco would probably bully him a lot for practically being a muggle. It would be interesting to play with the character development. Dudley obviously went through off screen development between being saved from dementors and abandoning privet drive. I think being around Harry in school might see those changes happening sooner or more deeply.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
