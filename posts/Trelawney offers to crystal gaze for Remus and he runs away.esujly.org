It's something she mentions in canon. I know it's not much and most probably he just had to go somewhere. But Remus interacting with Trelawney just amuses me so much.


** Headcanon that in his reading she "saw" her and remus together

*** This headcanon just made my day. Interesting how something can be so amusing when it isn't even written.

** My interpretation was always that he politely declined and Trelawney took it personally and exaggerated it when she told McGonagall about it.
