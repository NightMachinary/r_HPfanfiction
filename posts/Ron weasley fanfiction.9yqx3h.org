  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  In most time travel/redo fics, the characters come from an apocalyptic future. I've always wanted to see one where the character actually loses something by going back, how would they deal with the grief? Ron finds out.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** For best characterisation of Ron, Please read PinkyBrown's ( [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1316097/]] ) stories. I adore Ron there. Especially this.

linkffn (The For and Against List)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3802870/1/The-For-And-Against-List]]

It's Hermione's POV. Still Ron is fantastic here.

*** This is a really good fic, and it's nearly complete. My only complaint is one plot thread that was brought up very suddenly, and it hasn't been touched on since Delphi is being held prisoner by Rodolphus, and is apparently pretty important, but we never see her again. Even now, after Rodolphus's base has been raided and the bad guys captured, we haven't heard or seen anything about VOLDEMORT'S DAUGHTER since her initial, brief appearance

** Here's an oldie but a goodie. Linkffn(the book of Morgan let hey by lavenderbrown) has a Seer!Ron. I found it interesting because it was written before HBP, so there aren't any horcruxes and the entire adventure happens on an entirely different axis. There's a sequel too.

  A sixth-year adventure told from Ron's perspective. RonHermione; HarrySusan. The Trio must stop Voldemort from wiping out Muggles. THIS IS A RE-WRITE. Rated R for language, violence, and sexual situations.
