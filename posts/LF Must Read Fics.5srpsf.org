As the title says, the best (completed) fics which you guys can recommend. Only a few requests

1) No slash (or femslash) for main characters. Side characters is fine. I dont have a problem with it but I dont prefer reading it

2) None of those usual shitty tropes like Dumbledore is cause of all evil, etc. No harcore bashing please

3) Any rating but needs to be complete

4) I dont want a fic to give someone new powers (Harry i.e) but keep the storyline same. I mean, whats even the point of changing if it follows the same old story...

Anything apart from this is fair game.


** Initially I thought it's just another "your favorites" thread, but your criteria makes lots of sense. So here are some of my favorites:

"The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167): The old regime betrayed Harry and his friends after Voldemort's fall, so they decided to fight back, with any means.

"Petrification Proliferation", linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore took the Basilisk a little more seriously than in Books, and what followed was a delight to read.

"Delenda Est", linkffn(5511855): Harry traveled back in time and built a kick-ass team with Bellatrix. This fic is doing a really good job with Bellatrix' characterization.

"Stages of Hope", linkffn(5511855): Dimensional travel and an emotional roller coaster.

"The Dark Lord Never Died", linkffn(11773877): A cunning Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore in 1981 and took control of magical Britain. 20 Years later, Dumbledore was ready to strike back. First, he resurrected Voldemort, who promptly went after the traitor Malfoy; next, he sent his agents to infiltrate Malfoy's Britain. One of his agents, Ron Weasley, met one of Malfoy's enforcers, Wand Leader Hermione.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Right, depends on what you want, here are some recommendations:

- Most Awesome Worldbuilding? I like linkffn(Long Journey Home by Rakeesh) - not finished, but definitely a great work of fiction.
- Best crackfic? Look at linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon), I can also recommend linkffn(Oh God Not Again by Sarah1281)
- Very Well-Written Harry / Riddle story: linkffn(Fire Born by wickedlfairy17)
- A great re-interpretation of canon, with some awesome twists (Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man)
- Nothing written by robst
- Seriously, ignore that stories.

** I always come back to, This Means War by Jeconais, it's comedy and doesn't take itself to seriously but the MMail concept is perfect.

** Here are my favorite LFs:

This one is great if you like Drinny. If not, it's still super fun. Slytherin Squad linkffn(10679026)

If you're a Fred fan: A Certain Shine to it. linkffn(11008756)

I know you said no slash, but this is honestly possibly my favorite fanfic of all time. It's probably not your cup of tea, but I can't make a rec without it. It's a must read if you like Charlie Weasley: Here be Dragons linkffn(6959412)

This one's unfinished but it's a great Lily Luna next gen story. It could still be updated. Whispers of Dead Lords linkffn(11520431)

A really funny and awesome Draco x OC story. I loved it, the OC Jade is hilarious. The Aurseize linkffn(5343638)

This one, I'll be honest I don't remember reading but it's in my favorites and I love Neville so it's probably good. Neville's Lost His Diary! linkffn(1349183)

  COMPLETE. As the unintended Captain of the most despised Auror squad, can Draco Malfoy lead his band of Slytherins through Death Eater attacks and threats from the Ministry? Definitely not. At least, not without the help of his reluctant Lieutenant: Ginny Weasley. Inconveniently, the last person he'd ever ask.
