I have nothing against this pairing. It just seems to be so common, and I am looking for something different this time.


** linkAo3(glass of water by lyin)

Linkffn(the bet by auntleona0)

Linkao3(Pyrenees by draconunquamdormiens)

The last one is just after school, so not Marauder Era in the strictest sense.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  It's 1980. Sirius has Dementor troubles, James has paperwork and a rather short fuse, Marlene and her family are being singled out for extermination, and who in their right minds keeps an uncooked lasagna around for a month?AU of the Runaway AU, so kind of canon-compliant. One-Shot for Ziksua's birthday. Blackinnon

**** So I just skimmed Pyrrenes again, and while I still rec it (and the author's other works) it's part of a whole AU that may be a hair confusing without the background. Still one of the better done Blackinnon stories and short, so maybe worth a read anyway!

Check out Lady Altair and her one-shots, too. She's most famous for Cauterize, but she writes lots of Sirius and Marlene if you like it.

** FloreatCastellum has put this fic on hiatus for very understandable reasons. But even though it's incomplete, it's still a quality Marauder Era fic. She comes up with some interesting ideas of what Remus was doing immediately post-Hogwarts. It likely would have gotten pretty dark and sad had she continued it, but she still lets the Marauders have a lot of fun during the fic too. linkffn(The Colour of Everything)

Another great (but also incomplete) one is linkffn(Against the Moon) The author has said it will not become wolfstar.

** My list of Marauder Era fics that does not include Sirius/Remus pairing, none of these fics is canon compliant:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Granted this Hermione time travel happens near the end of that era, but it's such a great read with some novel ideas.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]], linkffn(4586362): James survived, and together with Sirius and Remus, carried out terrible retributions against their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry time travel to 1975, when he teams up with Bellatrix. But first, he has to teach the unfamiliar potion as a substitute to Slughorn.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/Don-t-Waste-It][Don't Waste It]], linkffn(8669569): Wormtail time travel. He remains in character and saves them all.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Hermione time travel from James Potter's POV. Unlike most other fics of the same genre, she is not paired with anyone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]], linkffn(8581093): Another Hermione time travel to 1981, she gets together with Sirius here. Her presence has some very unexpected consequences though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8641047/1/Rewarded][Rewarded]], linkffn(8641047): Voldemort stunned Lily, killed Harry, and delivered her to Snape. Now what?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Harry time travel to 1970 when he thoroughly impressed Bellatrix by busting a Death Eater raid. Lots of great fight scenes.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
