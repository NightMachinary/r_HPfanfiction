** I will try to only give the more obscure Harry/Marvel crossovers. I, however, suck at knowing what is popular or not.

Chance Encounters - linkffn(8145794)

A Warrior's Calling - linkffn(10812425)

Brilliant Blood - linkffn(8969100)

Yeah, not the greatest list, this is what I have in regards to less popular stories.

** linkao3(Beyond the Veil of Death is Not a Suitable Holiday Destination)

Spellmugwump is a good author and the above fic is humourous. I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for as it was published two years ago but it's not out of the realm for her to update her fics years later.

  Harry knew he was clumsy, yeah, but he didn't think he was fall-through-the-veil-of-death-and-end-up-in-an-alternate-universe-with-superheroes-kind-of-clumsy.
