Hi everyone, I'm trying to find one specific fanfic I read a while back. The premise was that Harry had been shoved backwards in time, and was somehow part vampire or demon (I think the term used was Morigan), and that second nature was just waking up. He met up with his mentor/boss/handler from the future timeline, where Harry was an unspeakable or a specops wizard, and there was a fun bit of bureaucratic drama. Harry knew an ancient vampire and had been associated with him in the future timeline, and that bothered the vampire because he couldn't remember Harry.

I don't think the fic was complete, but I can't find it now. Any help would be appreciated.


** Ugh I read this about a month ago but can't remember the name. I'll have a think and see if I can find it!

#+begin_quote
  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.
