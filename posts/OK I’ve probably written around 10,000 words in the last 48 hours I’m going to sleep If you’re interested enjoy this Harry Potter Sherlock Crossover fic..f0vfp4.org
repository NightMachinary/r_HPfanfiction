This is a bit of self-promotion, Just a disclaimer. And just so your aware the Harry/Hermione Tag is for much later in the story, Harry hasn't even made it to Hogwarts yet.


** Ok, the premise has potential, but I read through the first chapter and it's crying out and begging for a beta reader. I think there was a recent post by someone offering to do that?

** Greatly agree with the other comment about needing a beta. Your summary already has a lot of issues, which is pretty off-putting.

I read your comment on ao3 about wanting to write out as much as possible before editing. Writing large blocks at once is fine, but I really think you'll garner more interest/a bigger audience if you properly edit it before posting it. As it is, many people probably won't read/finish/subscribe to it because of the errors present.
