Hi!

I just thought a better strategy to complete the second task. Conjuring a boat and using the point me charm, wouldn't it be better?

I hate swimming ðŸ˜‚ and even more if it's f February ðŸ˜Œ

  Plot holes. Some are only tiny; but others challenge the Grand Canyon. What does Harry do about the Tr-Wizard Tournament if he decides to think outside the box? And not about winning, but just surviving?

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** Conjure a boat ,point me spell until directly above, conjure a diving bell and go down quickly.

Problem being conjuration is difficult.

The rules for transfiguration are also unclear on how much focus you are required to keep on it if at all.
