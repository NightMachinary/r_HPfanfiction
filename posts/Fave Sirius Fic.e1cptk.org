Let's all celebrate our love of angst king Sirius Black. Leather jackets, cigarettes and firewhiskey. A healthy appreciation for muggle rock and roll and the worst parents in the Harriverse.

Also he's queer. He just is, don't pretend he's not

I'll start us off with two. I was gonna do more but then I lost interest.

The Divine Comedian - One of fanfiction giants in my opinion. Some of my favorite writing I've read in a fanfiction, and I also read real books so you know I know what I'm talking about. Honestly everything he's written that even involves Sirius is perfect. His cannon for what happened to Sirius growing up that is established in They're Hiding Inside Me is my head cannon for him despite having read literally so much Sirius shit over the years. Start with They're Hiding Inside Me and go from there ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12704985/1/They-re-Hiding-Inside-Me]])

MarauderLover7- So this is a tone shift! The big work here is Innocent, which is actually the first in a series of what should 8 and is currently half way through it's fourth. If you're on this subreddit frequently you've probably seen it? Anyway, it's pretty darn good! We get to meet wholesome Sirius. There's still some angst, he still dealt with a lot of trauma stuff but the edges are warn off by adorable child Harry. It's pretty great. A lot people say that Innocent drags plotwise and is too long but I loved it. I wanted cute slice of life where Harry got raised by a loving Sirius and Sirius moved past his trauma and I got it. There was also a lot of fun action/adventuring stuff thrown in that I sorta could have done without. I don't hate that stuff and Remus's time with the werewolves was super memorable, but I don't they were the fics strong point. There were some twists that I didn't love and Sirius is straight for some reason but overall it was a fun read and I recomend it. The sequels are also alright and worth checking out if you liked Innocent but they aren't as focused on Sirius, and I don't really like Harry going through Hogwarts stories (notable exception: the secret language of plants) (Innocent: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent]])

Any evidence to substantiate this or are we just making wild claims with zero evidence? Because in this case- Fred is alive. And FFS I'm tired of links to mobile sites. Personally I like "Dead Sirius"- Sirius returns as a ghost and torments the Order. I particularly like the Longbottoms' battle cry. On a more serious note (I ain't even sorry) "A Marauder's Plan" and "Heart and Soul" have a more mature and serious Sirius.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight. (Light Remus/Sirius.)

*** Lol I the thing about him being queer was clearly tongue in cheek. I literally linked a fic in which we was straight in the post.

But him being queer adds a lot to the character, nothing in the cannon seems to imply that he isn't and he, along side Remus, are queer coded in cannon.

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.
