** Ron/LavenderHonest ship that can carry all the expectations of the relationship without sinking, built from mutual acceptance and very little pressure. It's a glorious cruise ship, slowly drifting towards a bright future, unencumbered by excessive ambition or character clashes. Neither of the pair need to change, they are happy as they are, free to pursue their goals both alone and together, as fancy takes them.

** Probably Draco/Harry or Harry/Tom. Honestly though nowadays I'm not too fussed about ships so long as the context is written well. Pretty much any ship can be valid if its written correctly, or in non-canon circumstances.

** Harry/Daphne. I just have a soft spot for the defrosting ice queen trope. Not only in HP, but also other fandoms. I always imagined that a Slytherin who doesn‘t support Malfoy has to be quite lonely. And I like this „us against the world“ vibe that some fics have, e.g. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9474009/1/Paid-In-Blood]])

  After decades of an empty life and wars that claimed all he ever held dear, the greatest dark lord in living memory and his most loyal servant are finally ready to challenge fate and once again bring down their vengeance upon their enemies. AU, extended universe, Time-Travel, bashing and HAPHNE.

Most of my feelings are probably based in fanon but I feel like her being both loved and ostracized for her veela nature would give her a lot in common with harry hating his fame for similar reasons.

** SSLE is my HP OTP. My username is a homage to it.

I love reading fics about them being friends or in a relationship. Also like reading romance with a bit of angst which this pairing can have a little to a lot of. Currently I'm following this regularly updated fic - linkao3(14046060).

Completed favorite fics are linkffn(Ananke; Come Once Again and Love Me; 6622580; Obscura Nox Anime).

Other pairings I like are Lucius/Narcissa, SSHG, Hermione/interesting male, Lupin/Tonks. I'm pretty open minded when it comes to Harry-centric pairings. There's a lot of interesting and well-written DMHG, and one of my main criteria for those is reconciling the Draco from the books to one who would want to be with Hermione.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.

** Haphne.

Not Ginny (don't like her). Not Hermione (Fandom fucks her over) Not Susan Bones (This turns into a Dumbledore bashing fic)

I mean, my two favourite fics are linkffn(8914135) linkffn(11697407) both of which are Haphne.

I'm not opposed to any fics that are good, no matter what the pairing. (I have a hard time with slash, it ain't my preferance but I'll read it if it's good enough) I mean, pureblood stuff is very interesting save for the pureblood apologism that happens.

It happens too much, ruining otherwise good slytherin/dark harry fics.

That's the only problem with haphne.
