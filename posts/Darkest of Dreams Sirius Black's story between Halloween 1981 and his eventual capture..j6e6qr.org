I've had a plot bunny tumbling around for years based on what happened to Sirius Black from October 31, 1981 to when he was captured and sent to Azkaban. The story is fully written and edited, so there's no need worry about whether or not the story will be completed. It's around 16,000 words at 8 chapters, and with the Prologue published it will be a chapter a day from now on until the rest of the story is published. If you would like to check it out, I've included some more information below:
