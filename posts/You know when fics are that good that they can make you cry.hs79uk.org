:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading someone when I was younger, and I'd love to go back to them again. I only remember the parts that made me cry obviously - so there may be spoilers ahead.

1. It's a Snape/Hermione. Marriage fic? Draco ends up turning over a new leaf but dies right at the end... absolutely bawled when I read Draco died... I think Hermione was knocked out for the final battle and Snape was telling her after the fact?

2. It's a Snape/Hermione fic again... right at the end of the story Snape is waiting to go to trial after the war had at long last finished... they're in the bathroom ....Hermione tries to cheer him up... but um... the ah....plumbing ....doesn't work, Snape rants for a bit. Remember reading it and being absolutely touched by the rant...

3. Final battle fic. Hermione and Snape are in a soul bond or something relationship? There's a prophecy? Hermione is dying and Snape impregnates her to keep her alive... long story... Hermione comes through in the end tho I think...

Any help would be super appreciated

:)


** Snape/Hermione is a pairing out of hell

*** Agree. For some reason I decided to read the post either way, only to return to my previous mindset when I reached "Hermione is dying and Snape impregnates her to keep her alive"

  It did not occur to Harry Potter to wonder why his Snowy Hedwig was so much more affectionate than the other owls. It did not occur to him he would ever need to care. That's why she waited to tell him. (Canon compliant)

**** I love this ship. Don't let anyone shame you. So she is 18 or 19 by seventh year depending on time turner shenanigans. Some people like the redeemable asshole trope and they are the best matched intellectually.

I am personally affronted by Dramione.
