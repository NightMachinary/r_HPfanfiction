I read a story a while ago where a small point was that medicine in the wizarding world had not changed since medieval times. So no Germ theory, or any Biology at all.

I've lost that story, but was wondering if there was any other stories that mentions medicine in the wizarding world.


** I can recall a Bleach story, where the Shinigami didn't pay attention to humans since the days they prayed for sickness to go away. And how Ichigo brought up that this one sick Captain might have this bacteria infection in the lungs, and introduces the Shinigami to modern medicine.

The idea was that Shinigami medicine was great at healing living things, and since bacteria is technically living, they were treating the symptoms while ALSO healing the bacteria. So the infection would just get stronger and stronger, until it's too strong to treat symptoms.

That same concept would definitely fit in well with Harry Potter, although it may be hard since they aren't quite as disconnected from the muggle world.

But no, I can't think of any Harry Potter story involving this. Aside from the Bleach fanfic, I can only recall a Dragon Age Inquisition self-insert that serves as a 'doctor' and teaches stuff like germ theory.

** So this is an interesting thing to deal with. Part of it to decide is what stops magical healing from working?

If Hermione's got smashed by the troll club but survived could her body by totally repaired?

Does magic that's stops magic from healing its effect get classified as dark

Thus Gilderoy could accidental vanish Harry's arm bones, but there exists spells that would leave it unable to be regrown.

How valuable are the options and ingredients to heal things? Does the healer in question have access? How difficult are the spells, what happens if they go wrong?

Linkffn(Wolf Lord) hasn't dealt too deeply with any of this yet, but there is a reason from Hermione's absence and it isn't death. Harry and some others have recently taken hits that aren't instated healed.
