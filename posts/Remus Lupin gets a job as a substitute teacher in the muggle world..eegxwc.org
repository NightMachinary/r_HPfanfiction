He loves teaching, and being a substitute teacher would give him an excuse for not being able to teach for a few day every month, he could come up with a simple explanation, and he could use a glamour charm to cover up the scars so it doesn't scare the muggle kids.


** He's a teacher at a muggle school in chapter one of this. It's a collection of side-stories from a different story, The Boys of Crowhill.

** He has no muggle credentials, assuming schools in Britain have some sort of standards. I guess he could magically fake the paperwork, but he didn't have a muggle education so he wouldn't know the material.

*** He would find it virtually impossible to get substitute teaching work without experience. He would find it hard enough without a PGCE, but without experience he could talk about and provide references for, there's no chance.

**** It would be different if he went to America for a fresh start. Standards are much lower here. All substitutes need is a bachelors degree in any subject, and that wouldn't be hard for a wizard to forge.

Edited to add: and private schools are a whole other story. They set their own standards for who qualifies as a teacher. I'm sure some private school here would take anyone willing to work for minimum wage.
