Basically, something that forces Gringotts to divest from ex-death eaters and not take in certain deposits/give out certain loans (with possibly other reforms)

​

The goblins/Gringotts seem to do a lot. Which puts them in a situation where they have regulatory capture while also being at the whims of their wealthiest depositors (mostly pure-bloods, but I suspect someone like Justin Finch-Fletchly probably is gentry and could bring in significant amounts of cash despite being muggle-born). My headcannon says this ends post-war, but like most things involving mass changes in regulation, this would be complicated and have skullduggery situations.

​

How would this work? How would the economy work? How would they deal with the new-ish MoM and government reforms? How would reforms even pass?


** We don't actually know what Gringotts does, other than providing secure vaults for their clients. They might not even be a bank as we understand the term.

It would spark a rebellion, it would mend internal divisions among British wizards, and it would set stage of their economic liberation from Goblin yoke!

**** I think it would be way more interesting for Elizabeth to revoke the full independence of the ministry of magic, and as part of that action, to force a move to Pounds and off the gold standard embedded in the Galleons, Sickles and Knuts system

​

It is also super interesting to me that there is no equivalent of credit cards for wizards - it implies personal credit is non-existant.

***** I don't think Wizards would take well to that action. HP mind magic is simply too powerful for Muggles to counter.

Here is my take on the Wizarding currency:

A currency's most important function is to facilitate transactions of goods and services. It needs to keep up with productivity, or else risking perpetual deflation and economic depression.

Gold had worked fine for thousands of years during our agrarian age, but failed miserably when mass production began in early 1900s. Today, with all the global labor arbitrage, automation, networking, and declining population growth going on, the deflationary pressure is still increasing. Any country that tries to use gold as its currency will immediately commit economic suicide.

Wizards are magnitudes more productive than Muggles. Now you can see why gold standard is totally a poison to their economy. Maybe it was a grand Goblin conspiracy after all, with the goal to keep Wizarding economy in perpetual depression and preventing them from realizing their full potentials.

But it's not to say that paper currencies are all that great. They are IMHO only a lesser evil than gold. Given Wizards's ability to duplicate things easily, paper currency is definitely not an option for them, and that leads to the next topic: crypto currencies.

In the magical world, they will use magic as opposed to electricity to create new 'money'. For example, if Wizard A is good at enchanting items, he can offer his service on some of kind of exchange or payment network to generate magic credits, which he can use to buy goods and services from others. The price could be determined by perhaps an auction system, where it is regulated by supply and demand. This is of course only an idea, but this system should encourage definitely productivity and favor those who are truly good at magic people needs.

****** 1) This just a smart comment about the nature of gold standard and deflationary pressure 2) I'm not 100% sure about how the Pound x Bank of England actually works. I do know that in the US - a) most of the dollar's M1 count (money supply count) is electronic (and wizards and electronics don't work well together) b) its value is determined by the bond market. Converting the galleon into at least a partially electronic system, with printed Pounds (dollars, other currency) being enchanted against false duplication, you might have a wizard proof system 3) I also wonder if there would be pressure for loosening the Statue of Secrecy by Muggle Borns and the Muggle British Government because of what happened. As part of that, I could see trying to integrate the Pound into magical life as a way of allowing muggle borns and their families to fluidly join the magical word as trade and the people that come with trade is one of the best ways to stop prejudice (the whole background of the wizarding war)

I'm not sure about Great-Britain, but in France (where I live) there's basically no such things as credit cards, either. I mean, yes, there are, but they're this weird occasional thing that only a few people choose use. We pay for most things with /banking/ cards.

How, and why, would she do that? I'm pretty sure quite a few wizards would take that as an act of war. And the last thing we need is another Grindelwald's War, you know?

this notion comes from an unfinished story from SIYE, called Shut and be a Bud Again ( [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127805]] ). QE2 is the titular head of the British government, which apparently gets informed of certain magical things for legal reasons that are left unexplained. This creates open-ended question about the links between the two governments, the history of the Wizenmagot and if parts of the way it works are in parallel to the way parliament works (especially since it's implied that the Malfoys pre-statue of secrecy would have been entitled to seats in parliament [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-malfoy-family]]) . There was a war in Great Britain that involved the Magical government, and if the way that magical government works is similar to the way the British one works, then QE2 is its titular head as well. She'd have the royal prerogative to dissolve the ministry as it stood the day of the war as part of a reform program

1) We know they are involved in curse breaking - clearly, they do things involving money and high-value goods

2) They don't have to function like a local bank that takes in deposits and then lends out money to be a bank. A depositing institution that charges a fee to store deposits (aka charges for a vault) is a kind of bank - and they would be involved with how money moves between accounts. If they have secrecy practices about what is in the accounts (which seems obvious from Bellatrix Lestrange's behavior in DH), then those practices could be reformed to prevent dark objects from being deposited, or to allow government seizure of dark wizard assets as part of forfeiture, or to better track personal loans and private corporation setups to stop nefarious doings

My understanding has always been that Gringotts just invests some of its money in treasure-hunting (hence the curse-breaking) to increase their own wealth.

It's imaginable, but I don't know if the Goblins would agree. It's easy to imagine that "customers have a right to lock up live flayed kittens or whatever in their vaults; what is in a vault is no one's business but theirs" may be as deep-seated a principle of Goblin philosophy/ethics as "an object's maker is fundamentally its true owner".

This is what would make a banking reform story so interesting- on one hand, yes this is true, on the other, Goblins died and the roof of their bank was destroyed because of Voldemort. How they would internally handle banking reform would be dramatic

**** No, we know they hire curse-breakers to rob tombs in Egypt. That doesn't mean they hire those services out - it could be a straight-up treasure-gathering operation.

If all they do is protect and physically transport money, I'd not call them a bank.

I think this is mischaracterizing the relationship between the nonmagical and magical world. Wizards, in the vast majority of cases, simply don't care about the Muggle world. They don't want or need nonmagical goods (Transfiguration exists, and charms can replicate any function), and so they don't want or need the currency used to purchase those goods. I've always imagined that any conversions between the pound and the galleon are essentially just a way of facilitating the assimilation of muggleborns into the magical world.

That in itself isn't super relevant to the main point of your post, but the conclusion one draws from it---the magical economy is almost entirely divorced from the nonmagical world economy---significantly affects how the magical market behaves. The magical world is almost a textbook example of a post-scarcity society, with people able to throw together housing on their own, create additional land when they need it, and make food grow at extreme rates. As such, I'm not convinced that it is affected by the same market forces that drive our own economy, and with money unnecessary for daily life government regulation would have little effect.
