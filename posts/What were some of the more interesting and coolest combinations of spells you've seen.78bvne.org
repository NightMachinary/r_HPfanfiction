** I thought Harry's black butterfly swarm from A Cadmean Victory was pretty cool.

He conjures a large swarm of large butterflies - he uses them because they are small/light and have a large surface area. The swarm circles around him constantly.

The main purpose is as a defense against the Unforgivables. A Killing Curse will stop upon hitting a butterfly, and the Cruciatus Curse requires line of sight, which will be broken up by the swarm.

He can also use it offensively by rapidly transfiguring then banishing a butterfly. He'll transfigure it into, say, a metal spike then send it flying at enemies.

** Rictusempra and Immobulus.

Oh...not that kind of thread.

Not really a /spell/, but linkffn(A Butterfly Effect by SlyGoddess) has Sirius hit a propane tank with a piercing charm behind Peter, and he also hit Peter with a few others. He then snaps Peter's wand. They talk a bit, and Peter throws his wand core at the tank Sirius hit which ignites it, as it is a Firecrab tail.

Always thought that was clever, even if you don't like the rest of the fic I can't recommend that opening more, best Sirius chases down Peter I've ever seen.

** I can't remember what the fic was, but the characters were having a discussion on what constitutes Dark magic.

If you torture someone's family in front of them but cast a Cheering Charm on the watcher, does that make the Cheering Charm Dark magic?

[The whole discussion was about intent, iirc.]

I loved the implications. Makes me think of the Joker.

** I was playing with the thought of writing my own fic, and I thought about a few spells, though I cannot guarantee that someone else had the same or similar idea before. The first is a variation of the avis spell, instead of conjuring birds, it would conjure burning hummingbirds or moths for the obvious uses, then what I would´ve called a witch light spell, that shoots orange orbs that explode in blue flames that burn for a few seconds, after hitting something, alternatively they could just float around to limit your opponents movement. Another idea was runic magic similar to linkffn(to reach without; The Long Game) where ink was charmed to form runes when spilled, to use enchantments or wards in battles, one idea that spun off of it was creating a zone where everything that is conjured will turn into snakes, and if the user is a parselmouth they could use the conjured objects of the enemy against them and as safety precaution the snakes would explode if another parselmouth tries to control them. Now that I think of it two fics I read already combined parseltongue and snake summoning linkffn(A Witch and an Amazon Walk into a Bar; A black comedy). Also transfiguring the floor into acid, or transfiguring acid into stones and cancelling the spell before they hit, linkffn(Dahlia Evans & the Broken Bridge) did something similar. In general enchanting objects for later use is very cool, like turning pebbles into explosives or tattooing runes on your body to use certain spells without wand. The final concept I was thinking about is turning heat into objects, for example creating an iron ball while rapidly decreasing the temperature around it, basically turning energy into matter, also the reverse with explosive results.
