*** It's not that one. That's the one where Harry has a child with Daphne but Daphne keeps that knowledge from him.

The one I am thinking about I am sure they are still going to Hogwarts as students because one of the specific scenes I mentioned with Daphne and Astoria happened on the train.

It also has scenes that have Daphne remember her Childhood, one where Astoria is lost for a while and returned by a fae that looks like a old woman and Daphne was explicitly checking if Astoria is a Changeling.

Are you sure it isn't this one?

  Daphne woke up to the smell of coffee, which was unusual, all things considered. Mostly because she didn't drink coffee.

*** It differs based on your mythos but the popular version is that they're little fairy creatures that steal baby's and then replace themselves as the baby to mess with the parents. The other version that's most popular is that it's one entity of unknown origin that steals children and leaves a messed up copy in place.

**** So what's with Annerb's Changeling?

***** "Changeling" wound up taking on the meaning of a child that is very different from its parents, much like "giant" doesn't literally mean a cannibalistic massive person who lives in the clouds anymore.

Annerb's Ginny is the only one in her family to be Sorted into Slytherin, and for a while she's alienated from her family as a result.

(I'll also note that the fairy tale changelings were people's attempts to explain things like autism and fetal alcohol syndrome. "Fairies stole my baby and left this thing" is what they settled on, so using it in the modern world carries the implication that it's not the 'changeling's' fault that they're so isolated or different, and that they deserve pity or help.)

**** Something about changelings get my goosebumps going full-tilt. In the supernatural/otherworldly, aliens, monsters like pumpkinhead or the things in The Quiet Place, and stuff like the Mothman are all scary to me.

But changelings are on a whole other level just imagining if they were real to me.
