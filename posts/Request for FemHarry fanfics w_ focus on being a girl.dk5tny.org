There was a thread earlier requesting this but a lot of the responses were just like "yeah Harry is a girl, now here's all the reasons I hate Dumbledore and Ron". I just want a story where it's good writing and it focused on her experiences as a girl. (I found 2 of the responses acceptable but they were so short and unfinished so I need more to scratch the itch)\\
Edit: the suggestion by one commenter, To Reach Without, is exactly what I'm looking for, I binge read the entire thing, along with a bunch of others, so if you can suggest more similar to TRW, I would be extremely happy.


** What aspects of her life would count as "experiences as a girl"? I've read some fem!Harry fics, but she was mostly a tomboy in the ones I like, so I'm not sure what sort of fics you want to see.

*** I still hold that linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao) is one of the best fem!Harry stories (Harry turning into girl on his adulthood), and exactly the situations, “Gosh, this is what Hermione was always raving about!” are core of the story. Unfortunately, very nice story is drowned in too heavy deluge of smut.

I really like linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure), which is very much exploration of the female part of the wizarding world (in the style which I, as a very straight guy, appreciate, even though I usually cringe about the long descriptions of the robes gratuitously spread over a story).

**** Your opinion on Becoming Harriet was right on point. It really was good, except I was annoyed at how the author made Harriet a helpless childish girl & (spoiler alert) then did that cliche "just shoot Voldemort" and her bf is the one who did it. Just yikes.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

***** I'm on chapter 11 right now. I don't why, but it feels like there"s too much internal dialogue/describing of whatever. Is it just my cynical critical side or do you feel it too? The story is great, and the way the author deals with Harry/Melantha's emotional side so far really impresses me to no end. But I still feel like there are maybe too many words in this. I find myself skimming quite a bit. Also, I don't how I feel about /fem!/*HarryxSusan*.

****** Maybe I'm giving too much credit to the author here but considering their extreme attention to details in everything else, it's unlikely; See, as someone who can relate to being mentally fucked up, that's exactly how much I internally dialogue with myself. My brain is always going a thousand miles an hour, and I think the author is trying to show that. nothing wrong with skimming those a bit, but I can tell you it's totally worth it.

And yeah I loved how they denoted the moment Harry became Mel by switching pronouns mid-sentence.

MelxSusan is a bit forced, to be honest, but not so much that it prevents enjoying it, and Idk, i kinda appreciate that it's a lot easier to craft a character in Susan that allows the author to do her own plots rather than be stuck with people's pre-conceived notions of other characters, like say Hermione or Ginny.

Honestly though, at this point in fanfic, I recognise that someone who's obsessed enough with the series to write a fanfic is not going to be someone that's not gonna bash some character or not use and flesh out characters that barely saw any screentime in canon bc as much as I love the HP world, JKR sucked ass at fleshing out a lot of the story and the world.

God, I hope this series resumes, it's literally my favourite and I NEED it.
