** Lunulata, Cubozoa, Cassowary, and Atracid after four of the most dangerous animals in Australia (Blue-ringed octopus, Box jellyfish, Cassowary, and Funnel-web spider).

The founders of the school did this to ensure that the students never forget the mundane creatures that they need to watch out for.

Lunulata favours intelligent students, Cubozoa takes the more friendly and community-minded, Cassowary the brave, and Atracid the cunning.

** It's unlikely that there are enough Australians to warrant multiple houses. Maybe a couple dozen per year, and that's assuming there's an unusual number of them, and that New Zealand's wixes go to the same school. Most likely, each year would have a dozen or so students.

*** You did read the part where it accepts students from all over Oceania, right? That includes, in addition to Australia and New Zealand, the island of Papua and a multitude of archipelagos.

**** Oh, sure, but to be honest, that's fucking ridiculous in its own right.

"Yeah, let's take all these kids from many assorted countries and backgrounds and teach them in /English/."

This isn't reminding me of anything from Australian history at all.

** I'm probably wrong, since I don't think I've ever read a story that takes place in a school other than Hogwarts, but I always get the feeling every magical school is basically a carbon copy of Hogwarts...
