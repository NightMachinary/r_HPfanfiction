*** /One/ alien, actually, though a massive one (if we're only counting the sapient ones, of course). And I didn't find him scary... imaginative, yes, but I don't get why people consider Yggdrasil to be "scary". I actually quite liked him and I was totally on Team Yggdrasil when we learned the wizards had tried to take the Main Contient from him.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on!

** Look for a crossover with HP and whatever other fandom featuring aliens you find interesting. HPxAvengers is one. While I haven't read others, I'm sure there are many.
