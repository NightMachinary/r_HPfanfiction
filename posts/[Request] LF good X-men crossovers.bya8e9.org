Edit to clarify: I don't mind romance but I don't want a romance-focused fic. OCs are fine but I don't like OC focused fics. No bashing. Length doesn't matter to me. Can be complete or in progress.


** You're going to need to be more specific about what you consider to be 'good'. Some people don't like OC's or romantic elements or short chapters, etc.

#+begin_quote
  A shell shocked but triumphant Harry Potter decides to leave his world behind for another. Someone should have told him that AUs can be really, really different. HP/ X-Men crossover.

** Here are a couple:

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7404056/1/Mutant-Storm]] - One of the original, and a solid story. RIP Bobmin

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future]] The longest... like EVER. But surprisingly proficient in managing so many people and perspectives.

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12321442/1/Innocence-Lost]] - I will also be somewhat self-promoting and toss my own in there even though it's just getting started, and the X-men piece only includes one thus far.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4161627]] - I am biased to this one because I like the author and they make me laugh.
