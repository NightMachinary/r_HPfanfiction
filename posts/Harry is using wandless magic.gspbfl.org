He asks for a friend and a girl shows up in front of him in his cupboard , her name is magie And she also has different friends she brings with her.. And he builds a city in his mindscape And he is also very logical and all I just can't seem to find it, it has ' Why' in his name.

**** No, I just went to try and search for your fanfic on AO3, and was adding "Wandless Magic" as a tag to the search, and "Inappropriate Use of Wandless Magic" as a tag, and I found it too amusing not to share.

  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.
