It's a quite popular statement in the fanficton that non magical people (usually parents) will never understand what is being a wizard or a witch. But no one has ever shown it.

Sort of more advanced medicine, teleportation and different spells aren't enough to prove such statement. It's similar to computers, cars, airplanes, Internet (Reddit :-): not all of us can explain in details how they work, but we're using them in everyday life without any problems.

Personally I think that difference, for example, between Western and Asian cultures are much bigger that between magical and non-magical Britain.

I think I understand why Rowling implied it -- she didn't want (or just couldn't) to bring Hermione's parents into the story, so it's was just an easy way out. But when it's repeated in fanfiction I think it's lame and demonstrate an author's laziness about world building.

Am I missing something?


** It's more the spirit of the thing; in the Wizarding World "the impossible" is not a thing.

Most wizards have /no idea/ how most advanced magical artifacts work, or how Voldemort or Dumbledore can do what they do, but those are a matter of everyday life. Wizarding life is going out in the street for your morning stroll and suddenly finding that the pavement has turned pink, sentient, and fluffy, and would like to have tea with you. There is no /known/ spell to do that, but a wizard will just... shrug it off. "Oh. Another magical thing. /Someone/ messed about with government property, best to Owl the Ministry..."

This is the root of the "wizards are silly" thing we see so much: wizards are, as a result, extremely gullible, because they live in a world that runs on weird, abstract, highly unpredictable rules. Voldemort's plans make no sense and no one questions it, for instance, but that's just symptomatic of the magical mindset; in a world where tap-dancing while saying some fancy pseudolatin and shaking a bit of wood with a feather encased inside will make it rain frogs, it doesn't /seem/ so far-fetched to propose that the best way to capture Harry Potter is a year-long scheme involving impersonating one of Dumbledore's friends right under his nose for months, tricking an extremely powerful magical artifact known for its impartiality and divination capabilities, and manipulating events to make Harry win a tournament years above his age group in difficulty. And so they just stick to their first idea, because why /shouldn't/ it work? Everything else does.

*In short, it's not that a Muggle would find any one magical thing disorienting, it's that the combined weight of it all is a mindset where the entire world is a wackyland running on nonsensoleum and you should just accept it rather than look at each individual piece of magic as a miracle to be marveled at and analyzed.*

  Voldemort's plans make no sense
#+end_quote

1. Voldemort's top two "plans that don't make sense" occur when he doesn't have a real body, and is desperate as hell. Desperate people will grasp at any straws.

2. The GoF plan is actually rather brilliant (risky, but once again: desperate). Get your agent into Hogwarts by disguising him as a person Dumbledore trusts while keeping said person around to interrogate the shit out of to learn the information necessary to pull off such a thing with said person being widely known as a paranoid coot who used to work for/with the agent's father, giving said agent a decent enough understanding to start off with. Then, slip Harry into a tournament he can't get out of. Make sure he does just well enough to have a decent start at the final task, where it is easy to arrange for Harry to get to the Cup (via Imperious on Krum). Use said Cup to kidnap Harry, take his blood to re-embody Voldemort, kill Harry and send him back using the Portkey on the Cup, making it look like he died winning the Tournament. A tragic end to a promising wizard, keeping Voldemort's return secret. This only fails because of Priori Incantatem.

I never liked the idea of "Voldemort is stupid." We know that great skill with magic is correlated with great intelligence (see Dumbledore calling Voldemort the greatest student Hogwarts has ever seen, Griselda Marchbanks saying Dumbledore did things during his NEWTs that she had never seen, Grindlewald) and Voldemort is (with exception of the love-related old magic he scorns and wand-lore) easily the best wizard (in terms of doing magic) of all time. I mean, shit, it only took Voldemort 33 days in a Dumbledore-free world to seize near absolute power in Wizarding Britain. Hell, in /PS/, Hagrid says that Voldemort was close to winning until he bounces off of that love-related magic he scorns.

Hell, I don't even like the idea of him being called crazy. Sure, we would call splitting your soul via murder and placing soul fragments into objects to preserve your life crazy, but Voldemort is clearly /amoral/^{1}/./

^{1}Amoral as in not subscribing to any moral ideology beyond "might makes right."

**** Fair enough, but the way I'm looking at it, "Voldemort's plan doesn't make sense" doesn't actually translate to "Voldemort is not cunning and formidable". Indeed, I was taking the fact that Voldemort is cunning and formidable /and yet/ his plans are ludicrous as symptomatic of wizards' /general/ mindset that allows a mastermind to think this is an okay plan.

It is a testament to both Voldemort and Crouch Jr.'s unparallelled brilliance that in /spite/ of how convoluted the plan was, it still went off without a hitch until the /Priori Incantatem/ threw a spanner in the works. That they thought of that ludicrous plan is symptomatic of wizarding society as a whole lacking common sense (as also shown in the same book by... most everything about the Triwizard Tournament), /not/ of their personal lack of intelligence.

But there is no denying the plan was /way/ more complicated than it had any need to be. Rather than Confund the /freaking Goblet of Fire/ and take the risk of /attacking Alastor Moody in his own home/, they could, just off the top of my head, have faked a permission slip for Hogsmeade from Vernon Dursley, and then proceeded to ambush Harry on his next Hogsmeade visit. Don't tell me Barty Crouch Jr. and Peter Pettigrew, two extremely intelligent and competent Dark Wizards, working on the orders of an even more brilliant one, couldn't have achieved /that/ with much less fuss than that Goblet gamble.

This how any human lives. He or he just accepts that the things just work without digging into details. Like we use computers, smartphones, cars, etc.

** Magic is at the core of this. Whether they have wands or not, magic is in every part of their lives. If you don't have it you can never truly understand what its like.

There is a line from Knights of the Old Republic II by one of my favorite fictional characters that sort of gives you an idea of what magic is to wizards, and what taking it away would be like (imagine jedi = wizards):

"Yes, and what are they without the Force? Take the greatest Jedi Knight, strip away the Force, and what remains? They rely on it, depend on it, more than they know. Watch as one tries to hold a blaster, as they try to hold a lightsaber, and you will see nothing more than a woman -- or a man. A child."

Its the same thing for wizards. Magic is so inextricably a part of their lives that they practically have no idea how you can function without it. The resident expert on muggles in the Ministry of Magic doesn't know how to light a match or how a tent works. Ron has to brainwash a driving test proctor.

Has it ever occurred to anyone that the reason Hermione spent so little time with her parents was because they couldn't relate to there daughter and her lifestyle? Perhaps this is why very few magicals end up with muggles. Wouldn't that be a one-sided relationship...

Just to drive this home: not once in the entire series does any character in the wizarding world contemplate giving up magic or being part of their world. No one seems to consider going muggle at all. Its who they are.

Also your answer contains nothing about why a muggle could never understand the magical world.

All you have said can be applied to any person (magical or non magical) born and raised in one culture and never known about others.

Personally I think no. Rowling didn't included her parents in the story, because their first reasonable action would be to get their daughter away from the environment where her life s under constant danger and it would had destroyed the plot.

**** I agree with most of what you have said. I admit my view is a somewhat cynical view (not surprising considering who that quote is from), so take that with a grain of salt.

As I see it, the first step to understanding is being able to empathize with a person/culture/nation. You need a point of reference for this, and magic is an utterly alien thing to muggles. In the past, I would say that was probably not as big of an issue. In the modern world though, magic is often treated in a "wink-wink nudge-nudge" sort of manner. It's a trick, or an act. Even if people consciously accept magic is real, unless you have felt it, lived with it, its hard to find a way to relate to that.

I have always wondered about this aspect of magical versus non-magical too: what is it that makes them different, such that they can use magic? The only idea I have been able to come up with is that its not blood, but something about the psychological mindset wizards and witches that they are born with. Perhaps they are more open to the infinite, the arcane, the mystical as it were. Maybe they are people who are born able to accept the inherent contradictory behavior of magic itself (it has rules, except when it doesn't). If a muggle study were conducted, I suspect that they would classify all witches/wizards as having some sort of mental disorder (I'm not saying that is true, but its an interesting idea).

Ironically this might imply that so called purity of blood actually has a kernel of truth, but that its actually about the way a child's mind forms and develops. This may be what allows them to use magic, since magic is not a form of energy that exists within them, and why they cannot tell who possesses the capability until they first perform accidental magic. Indeed, since emotions are so inextricably linked to their magical capabilities at any given time, it suggests that possessing a certain mindset is inherent to the ability to use magic in the first place.

When you think about it, this would explain why some of the most powerful canon wizards are also more than a little loopy to us. Dumbledore is to put it mildly an eccentric old man running a magical boarding school, with questionable ideas about student safety. Voldemort is a narcissist with a god-complex, convinced of his own inherent superiority and invincibility, even though his Horcruxes prove that he does NOT think he was invincible and was in fact more afraid than anyone else. Its also why any wizard/witch with a shred of rational thinking or planning capability seems to be able to utterly outfox entire populations of magical nations.

And yes, Hermione's parent would certainly want to take her out of the world. But she would not want to leave. What they can't understand is that magic is part of her life, and giving it up would, at least in her mind, mean that the Death Eaters won.

TLDR: I suspect wizards/witches have entirely different mental setup to that of muggles, and this by definition makes it hard

***** I think magic is just an ability. Like super-powers, gene X, etc. It doesn't transform you into another being and make you better that people without it.

Nothing in books contradicts it. The wizards and witches there use the modern English and terms, interactions between children are not different from modern teenagers, etc.

Also they *learn* magic. It's not chaotic but follows some strict rules and laws. It also means that magic isn't beyond research and therefore science.

Those who scream "You don't have magics, so you will never understand me" are just rebellious teenagers. Even in this thread no one gave anything concrete to prove that statement.

I think Rowling made her magical world irrational for entertainment purposes only. She wanted it different, so she took mundane things and just twisted it to look unusual.

****** To be honest I agree with your opinion about the "they will never understand me" idea. It does not make a lot of sense using a logical perspective. Its born, I think, from an attempt to try and explain the inconsistencies in canon with why they do not involve Muggles, why the muggle-borns don't just leave, and some rather terrible parental/guardian behavior displayed in canon towards magicals (Dursleys, Grangers, etc.). People are trying to reconcile this.

Thus, the fandom arrives at the conclusion that either magic is so important to people who are able to use it that they could never give it up, or that they are too proud/unwilling/ignorant to try and take the out.

Just my thoughts on the matter.

**** No. Punishment by way of pain is at best a band-aid solution that validates their arguments, and at worst turns them into martyrs and unites the public against the punisher (they may have done x, but that doesn't give you the right to do y).

One can learn much from the Soviets. After Berlin fell, no one knew what happened to Hitlers body. Later on, it was revealed that the Russians had secreted it away, so that followers and revolutionaries (see: neo-nazis) would not be able to use it as a propaganda tool and rallying point for their ideology (kinda what they did with Vladamir Lenin's body too).

The best solution would be to turn them into cultural pariahs, using magical contracts or the authority powers of the Ministry to brand them in a permanent manner, so that no one would ever listen too or even tolerate them in the magical world. The best example I can think of is shown in Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). When Slytherin's descendants tried to attack Britain with the Spanish Armada in 1588, the Ministry responded with the Ultimate Sanction, a contract that magically forces the citizens of Britain to feel undisguised mistrust and outright hatred for anyone descended from their line. This is touted as why Slytherins are so hated by the time of canon.

If you believe, as some do, that the taboo Voldemort casts on his name is in fact a power held by the Ministry (or requiring the authority of the Ministry at least), it does not seem infeasible within canon. One could place a taboo on the last names of the death eaters, so that if anyone with magic uttered there names the ministry would be instantly alerted and punishment would ensue. Like with Voldemort's name, people would begin to automatically fear or even hate the name and what it stands for. And they would teach their children, who never knew the difference.

If you don't believe this would work: in 1935 there were 40+ people living in New York City with the name Adolf. There were 5 by 1950.

Something similar to this, turning their entire world, the only one they know how to live in, against them and their so-called "pureblood," would be the ultimate punishment. No martyrs, no symbols, no remembrance.

****** You are giving the public too much credit I think. The idea that they would be merciless assumes they would consider their actions and punishment. The truth is that after most conflicts people try to forget anything happened and pretend their is not/never was a problem to begin with. Thats the worst thing they can do, but it invariably ends up happening. Why? Because most people just want to get on with their lives and not think about the bigger picture.

Wizards are no different in this regard. Realistically, what would most likely happen is that the people would leave it to their government to deal with the situation, and assume they would handle it adequately (thats pretty much how it is during the entirety of the Harry Potter series). As bad as the wars and attempted pseudo-holocaust were, most people would trust their government to deal with it and try to pick up where they left off. Thats how people are.

In the end, its whoever controls the ministry that will decide this. In their case, Shacklebolt spent time not only fighting but being chased down by both the DE and the Ministry, so he would be more prone to punishing the offenders. Others in positions of power, like Harry, Ron and Hermione, would be equally adamant and would have enough political influence from their fame to push anything through.

Do you know understand why the Nazi government and their crimes were so effectively ground out, while the crimes of Imperial Japan are rarely mentioned or taught to the Japanese? Its because collectively, the Americans, British, French and Soviets agreed to grind the German publics' faces in the crimes that they had committed. The entire German public was forced to watch and view the results of the concentration camps, the mass graves, the experiments, the remnants of Warsaw.

Don't get me wrong: I agree with you that is what you should do and its what I would want them to do. My point was that 1) most people would not follow through with that, just like they often avoided embracing the darker aspects of war and 2) their is not real proof that their ideology has been stamped out, and the way you do that is too not turn them into martyrs. Unless you eliminate all reference and memory of an ideology, eventually it will resurface. Don't give your opponents a pole to hang their flag from, better to burn the flag instead.

** In HBP "The Other Minister" the muggle PM becomes frustrated with the magical ministry's inability to just stop Voldemort because (and I have to paraphrase here) "you're wizards, surely you can just fix it with a wave of your wand" and Fudge (I believe) replies that "the other side has wands too". I think this is a perfect example of muggle/wizard incompatibility: In the muggle world 'magic' is an abstract thing that is limitless. In the wizarding world 'magic' is a given, and they work to test its limits. Magic has consequences, and cannot do everything or anything.

Another example is Hermione's reaction to being made prefect in OotP. She immediately wants to inform her parents, because this is an achievement they will actually recognize and understand. Implied in this is that her other achievements are not understood. They probably understand when she says she placed first in every class, but they cannot understand what she's learned. Her pride at finally mastering something like the Patronus spell means nothing to them, because "magic is just about saying the words and directing the piece of wood, right?" And even if she explains how it works, they won't be able to try it out to fully understand it. She can explain the theory like it's an obvious thing, but they can never relate to how it actually is.

Magic is also scary to muggles, so there are things you wouldn't want to divulge for fear of seeming suspect. Love potions, obliviation, imperius and polyjuice makes it possible to control and manipulate anyone. They have ways to murder without a trace. Even basic pranks in the wizarding world have the potential to be terrifying to muggles, like eating a candy that makes your tongue swell up so much you cannot breathe, suddenly completely at your pranksters mercy. Wizards are scary AF.

Non magical world has similar things like drugs. I would say that the unknown is scary and therefore the beast way of dealing with it is to talk about it, show what's done to prevent of using such things on unsuspecting people (magical and non-magical).

** Think about what a person talks about with on a normal day with the people they know: their job (for adults), their education (for students), recent news and politics, celebrity gossip, sports, music, fashion, travel, etc.

In the wizarding world, every single one of these reference points will be different. Different jobs with different duties and different working procedures, different subjects studied in school, different news, different politicians and political institutions (and even different nations), different celebrities, different sports, different music, different clothes, different transportation.

With all that in mind, I'd turn the question around on you: what part of magical life would a Muggle understand? A Muggle and a wizard have very few shared reference points for all the things people normally discuss. Food and the weather are the only two that are really the same, and even then only if you don't delve too deep (e.g. they share the same food only so long as they discuss eating rather than cooking).

Truly, the only universal I see without anything lost in translation is family and relationships.

*** Everything you've said can be applied to any two people with different cultural backgrounds.

Magic here is just a technical aspect. The one of the major points of the books is that magical world has the same social processes as any other non-magical western society.

I can see how two such people can talk about jobs, duties, politics, business, sports, music, etc.

You mean the job at the magical Ministry, with its politics between what appears to be an Elder council, and their side-business in enchanting custom brooms for the magical sport of Quidditch, all while listening to some band singing about some Goblin.

Maybe you are an absolutely outstanding conversationalist, but my muggle self would not find much common ground in any of that past the initial explanation that would just throw up more and more questions.

** Sharing the world with other living beings that are as intelligent as humans, but are /clearly not human./

Centaurs. Goblins. Merpeople. House elves.

All of these would be a match for a human, so we can for now apply the word "people" to them. Nevertheless, despite being "people", they are not human, and seemingly have no desire to be human. They have their own wants and needs, their own cultures, their own quite rich internal worlds. I think this would blow most Muggles' minds. We're not used to having a non-human counterpart that could actually match us.

Hermione runs into this a bit with S.P.E.W. Her heart is absolutely in the right place - Muggles figured out that keeping other human beings as slaves was wrong a long time ago, and that's her background. However, she doesn't think to /talk/ to the elves, and thus doesn't quite get for a long time that they see their position very differently than she does, from what to a human would be a pretty alien perspective.

** I will never completely understand pregnancy. I am only able to observe and while that grants me knowledge it will bar me from every bit of knowledge that can be only gained by experiencing it.\\
That would be very similar to your proposed question. There will always be a fundamental difference. Not saying that we could not live side by side, afterall men and women have done so since forever, but it will always be a different. I could sit their and watch a woman in labour and contemplate her situation guess at her sensations and feelings and maybe be accurate. I will just never really know.

Everything that is being done with magic or because of magic can be accepted by me. I will just never be able to reach conclusions that can only be reached by doing magic or feeling it. If these conclusions cause life-style things, I would never be able to recreate them on my own and the reason they exist will be strange.

***** Your answer is very similar to "you can never understand what another person feels because you aren't that person".

While technically it's correct, in general it's wrong, because all of us are very similar to each other from the biological standpoint and people of one society are similar from the cultural standpoint.

Psychology wouldn't exist if a person from outsied couldn't observe and find behaviour patterns in different people.

Using your example, while you cannot feel exactly what a pregnant woman feel, using your knowledge (from books about pregnancy) and your empathy you can make assumptions about her feelings to interact her, to help her where she struggles, to comfort her, etc.

** There are some great explanations here, but one of the most glaring things I would think is the following:

Man cannot understand God.

And to muggles, wizards and witches are basically gods. Demigods, if you want. /Reality/ bows to their whims. /Your mind/ bows to their command. The fabric of the universe itself is in league with them, not through convoluted science and difficult theorems, but through their own mind, will and wand.

  Personally I think that difference, for example, between Western and Asian cultures are much bigger that between magical and non-magical Britain.
#+end_quote

Yet Asian people have the same limits as you. They use the same technology, the same science, the same basic reasoning.

Magic - a reality bending force of ultimate power - seems like a bigger separator between those who have it and those who don't.

Where did you get it from?

All seven books show us that wizards and witches are the same people as the rst of us. They live, die, love, hate, have emotions etc.

How does magic make the so much different?

**** They are just like all of us, just with the /teeeensy tiny/ exception that they are literally as powerful as the gods of the greek, norse, roman,... pantheons. And the most powerful amongst the wizards and witches would even punch those guys out of the water.

They die, yes. But for a first, their lifetime /easily/ spans three muggle generations. Second, there are legit methods of prolonging that life and, in theory, even make them immortal. Life and Death for wizards is even different in the spiritual sense, as they are all well aware of the existence of souls and ghosts.

Their emotions are not just internal. Their feelings have actual effect on their surroundings. You don't even have to go to the obscure, talking about convoluted magic like the Love that was apparently needed for Lily's protections, or the true Hate that you need for the Cruciatus. I'm talking simple temper tantrums of toddlers, leading to magic violently, or subtly reacting outwards. Wizards and Witches know, from their day to day experiences, that their feelings, whims and emotions hold true, measureable power.

And then there is the point Achille-Talon brought up. Magic makes the impossible a daily occurence. With any nationality or culture you can at least think that their understanding of the laws of nature are somewhat similar. Wizards couldn't give less of a shit about the laws of nature. They care for the laws of magic, and that means they're thinking in an utterly different basis for their mindset. You cannot overstate how jarring; what an impossible to cross threshold it is, to find yourself confronted with a culture where even such things as /gravity/ are seen different. For wizards that isn't a natural fixture, its just a practical suggestion brought up by nature.

***** If you wish to pray to them, I won't argue with it, it's your choice.

Still even legends about Greek gods are more about human feelings than some aliens from another galaxy.

There're nothing inhuman in both those legends and HP books. We couldn't read them otherwise.

In real each new day a man or a woman does something that was impossible yesterday. This thing is called progress.

Magic vs nature vs science is a meaningless talk, it's more about opinions than actual facts.
