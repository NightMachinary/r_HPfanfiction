Looking for recs for stories with Dark Lady Hermione Granger - or her road to becomming one... or more general Dark or Evil Hermione (I'm not talking just dabbliling, but really dark/evil). May include Dark/Evil HP & RW, but with HG as leader/instigator.

Suggestions (to jog memories):

- Violently champions muggleborns/creatures/house-elves rights
- Violently opposing purebloods or the ministry
- Opposing, competing, or creating an alternative to Voldemort (may include time-travel)
- Ditto, but against Dumbledore, HP, OotP, or MoM
- Taking over for (dead) HP
- Willing to do what HP or Dumbledore wouldn't
- HP, RW, Dumbledore, OotP opposing Hermione
- Rituals - eg. dark, for power, blood magic, sex magic, time-travel, ...
- HG related to Voldemort or Grindevald
- HG side-kick, right hand, or heir of Voldemort
- HG is Riddle/Voldemort's girlfriend, lover, or wife (or Riddle/Voldemort wishes her to be)
- Going above and beyond protecting Harry (eg. from participating in TriWiz) [ADDED]

So any fics that more or less fits this bill?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen) have you read this one? It's a time traveller Harry story in which he comes from an apocalyptic future where almost everyones dead, and Hermione is some sort of super dark lady. She isn't the MC and comes across as quite Mary Sueish but still quite a good story

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** One of my favorites is Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Ruthless Hermione, violently fighting for muggleborn rights and against Voldemort and the Death Eater filled Ministry which acts a lot like 1930s Germany. Definitely does what the Order isn't willing to do, although they later on decide to cooperate more. No dark magic on her side, but who needs that when a metric fuckton of duplicated plastic explosives does the job just as well?

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
