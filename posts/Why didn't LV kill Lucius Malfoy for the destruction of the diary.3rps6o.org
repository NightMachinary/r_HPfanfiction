Lucius gave the diary to Ginny because he knew it would bring about muggleborn-killings within Hogwarts, therefore discrediting Arthur Weasley and getting Dumbledore fired from his position. Did Voldemort tell Lucius that the horcrux!diary would make that happen? Did Lucius even know that it was a horcrux?

And then so why didn't Voldemort kill him for putting the diary in harms way and therefore leading to its destruction? Especially after Lucius's imprisonment, where afterwards he didn't have power or influence. If Voldemort needed the Malfoy Manor to stay in, or the Malfoy riches, he would have strong-armed Narcissa (or Bellatrix would have convinced her). It doesn't seem like Voldemort's character to just let him be, even after some torture.

Also, how do you think Voldemort felt not having the "magical seven" number of horcruxes? Do you think Voldemort was eventually planning to make another?


** Lord Voldemort most likely did not know the Diary had been destroyed.

If Lord Voldemort found out, he probably would have regarded Lucius as too valuable (at the time) since when he was resurrected, he did not have much of a following, and Lucius was a key influence over the Ministry.

Lucius had fucked up before but Lord Voldemort still broke him out of prison. Lucius was probably an example for other Death Eaters of loyalty.

** Lucius knew diddly. Tom might have been notified by Lucius about the dairy no longer being there, or he might not have (Lucius is crafty), but even if he were Lucius probably could have managed to talk Tom down from killing him because he didn't know anything about the diary,

** Lucius didn't know that it was a Horcrux (or even what a Horcrux was). If he had, he probably would have been more careful with it. And, Voldemort had no idea that it had been destroyed.

Realistically, Voldemort should have left instructions that said "In case of emergency: read instructions." Would have saved himself 13 years of disembodiment.

** Lucius didn't know it was a horcrux, and I'm certain he was punished for it, just not with death. Lucious was too valuable with his sway over Fudge to just execute.

He definitely couldn't tell when his horcuxes were destroyed, Nagini was the 7th horcrux he made and Voldemort couldn't tell.

*** And now I have a mental image of Lucius laying on his stomach on his bed chewing on the end of a quill while writing in his diary. Thanks.

** I don't think he felt/noticed when he lost a Horcrux, otherwise he wouldn't have brought Nagini with him to Hogwarts. In the same vain I don't think he ever even knew that his diary was destroyed, so no reason to kill Malfoy.
