****** You know, pushy comments like yours are exactly what ruins things for everyone else.

See, even after saying the fic was abandoned, there's always a chance I could pick it up again. After all, chapter 4 of TOHF was written after a year with no updates.

But now you've called me out on my planning, making some absurd claim that I had no idea where the fic was going, forcing me to defend myself by posting my planning document: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q8ssNpYCKoGIzS6MZySWzZz7g8Kj07anSgdTIUxZhgM/edit?usp=sharing]]

It was really quite a stupid comment, as I have quite a reputation for over-planning. And now that I've posted the plan, that's a 100% guarantee that I'll never write more of the fic.

You do seem to make a habit out of this. It was your entitled attitude in the other thread that started the conversation leading to me having to declare the fic abandoned.

If you attack someone, you must expect them to defend themselves. You don't get to attack someone and then tell them that its their own fault for defending themselves.

I can't take the plan down because it's my defence to your attack.

  But going to a thread asking for Dumbledore-focused recs, recommending your own unfinished fic is just asking for trouble. You even said a while ago that the objective of that story wasn't Dumbledore-related at all, and the story never quite reaches the point where Dumbledore's character is examined. At most, Harry gets his magic and mannerisms.
#+end_quote

There's two separate issues here.

Firstly, whether or not my fic counts as sufficiently about Dumbledore to be recommended in a Dumbledore thread. I think it is. In particular, if you're just interested in Dumbledore, the first chapter of the story can be read as if it is a Dumbledore-centric oneshot. That chapter alone is more exploration of Dumbledore than I've seen anywhere else.

Secondly, there's the fic's incomplete status. I recommend incomplete abandoned fics all the time. Ectomancer, for example, I repeatedly recommend as the best HP fanfiction ever. I don't think a fic being incomplete/abandoned is any barrier to it being worth a read. If you do, fine, that's your preference, but your comment in the other thread implies that your preference has some kind of objective force that everyone else should obey - you were saying I shouldn't recommend my fic just because /you/ prefer complete fics.

#+begin_quote
  You have a reputation for being a wordy idea guy, not a planner, or your plans would be solid and you would finish your fics.
#+end_quote

When I abandoned Return, I posted the plan for the entire fic. When I abandoned Lords of Magic, I posted the 20k word plan for the fic. Both of these are fairly well known, especially the latter.

So I'm a bit confused as to why you think I'm not a planner.

Your assumption that having a plan inoculates fics from abandonment is simply false. Not knowing where a fic is going is the least reason why a fic would get abandoned. Writing is hard work, even with a plan (especially with a plan, perhaps). Fics get abandoned because people lose interest in their idea, or become interested in another idea, or simply don't want to put in the work needed to put words to page.

  Because a good planner makes feasible plans. "I'm going to make everyone immortal by inventing self-replicating nanomachines" sounds cool, but it's a completely useless plan if it's so complicated I'll never manage it. Likewise, your plans are pointless if they never result in a completed fic. Case in point, you said in the past that you didn't have anything left to write about after you made your point (in The One He Feared). A good plan would have that scene at the very end of the story, don't you agree?
#+end_quote

Now you're shifting the goal posts dramatically from "you don't know where the fic is going".

The first thing to understand about plans is that what works on paper does not necessarily work in practice. The issue with TOHF was that the plan looked fine: it was logical and original. The problem was the emotional impact of the events, which could not be predicted until they were actually written. In the abstract, having Voldemort lose and regain his body at the end of the first third sounds fine. I specifically had Voldemort win the duel against Harry to maintain his threat level. But in practice, it turned out that the logic didn't matter. Even though Voldemort won the duel, the emotional impact of Voldemort losing his body was to dramatically diminish his level of threat. And even a hot-fix, deciding to play on that by having the characters subsequently underestimate him, while clever, was insufficient to reverse the /feel/ of Voldemort's temporary defeat.

The failure of TOHF was not the plan. The plan was fine. There was no way that additional planning could have avoided the result. The failure was the entire experimental concept of the fic as a whole. It was an experiment, and sometimes experiments go wrong. You accept it and move on.

Secondly, this whole idea of "feasible plans" is rather nebulous and potentially quite corrosive. For a start, there's no way to tell, before starting a story, if you're going to be able to finish it. The One He Feared, if completed, would probably have come out around 110k words. I've written a fic that long before. And yet this one didn't work out. Abandonment is generally specific to the failures of an individual story, not some function of the writer in general. Further, I don't think people should limit their ambition or creativity out of fear of abandoning the project at a later date. I think it's quite damaging to suggest they do. I'd prefer one abandoned Ectomancer to a hundred one-shots that people limited themselves to because they were only willing to take on "feasible" projects.

************ What you're proposing is super-human. Even top published authors like George Martin and Patrick Rothfuss end up with unpredictable problems in their stories. They have plans, the plans seem feasible, but when they actually write them some unforeseeable thing comes up that requires some massive rewrite or overhaul.

Do you write? I'm getting the feeling that you don't, because I don't think anyone who has tried their hand at writing would be making your argument. Planning in the way you're describing is simply not possible. It turns out writing has at least one thing in common with the military: plans do not survive contact.

You can write the most detailed plan you like, you can look at everything from every angle, and still end up having problems. It's almost certain, in fact.

If nothing else, there's always the high likelihood that your own preferences will change before you finish the story, meaning that ideas you used to love now make you cringe.

************** I think it's extremely likely that Patrick Rothfuss et al have a good number of abandoned projects in their desk drawers. Very few writers achieve success with their first attempt at writing, after all. A writer's first published novel tends to be the result of many years of starting projects, realising the story is flawed, learning from their mistakes, and moving on to a new project.

The difference is in fanfiction it all happens live. The learning process is public and the abandoned projects get read and commented on rather than hidden in desk drawers.

************** Dude, why are you coming on here and talking shit about the authors? Fanfiction is like sex, you can't force it and you aren't supposed to beg, whine, or threaten to get more. You just take what the other person is willing to give and if that isn't enough for you, go read something else. Taure is not your bitch. This is something the authors do for fun and they don't owe you anything.
