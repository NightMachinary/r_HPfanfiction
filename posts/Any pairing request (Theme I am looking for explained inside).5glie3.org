** I've seen the subgenre you're looking for as hurt/comfort fics, though that does usually specify that one character gets injured and that's why they're being comforted.

** Best hurt/comfort I've read is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/852061][Kiss The Joy (Until The Sun Rise)]] which is a beautiful fic where Harry and Draco both seek refuge in the RoR after the war and slowly heal together. Weirdly, it felt very in character even though it was slash - of course they hated eachother at first and the progression was slow and believable. At the end, it wasn't even clear that Harry is attracted to boys, he just needed someone and Draco was there. And the plot device of what/who was "real" was heartbreaking, original and beautifully done. FYI - you have to be logged into Ao3 to read it.
