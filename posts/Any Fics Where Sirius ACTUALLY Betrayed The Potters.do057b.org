Just curious, I know (in theory) one must exist, but I was wondering if there are any fics where YES Sirius Black was Voldemort's right hand and did sell out the Potters to him. It would be interesting I suppose, and dead Pettigrew is optional (maybe he somehow escaped and hid all those years as Scabbers) or whatever. More focused on the idea of Sirius actually being a traitor and a Death Eater.

*** This is a really interesting read. Totally different take on the HP universe. Also a trilogy if I remember correctly. I've read it twice now.

**** This was the only fic I could recall off the top of my head where Sirius was like, "yep, I did it. I'd do it again, too." His motivations are understandable (if not excusable), and he was something of a tragic figure.

There's a lot of tragedy in this series, really interesting world building but it doesn't hesitate to shake things up. Lotta sacred cows get slaughtered.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** It's too early to tell what's going to happen exactly, but The Other Side: Thick and Thin and it's sequel by ChapterEight is heading that way. It has the best Black family portrayal I ever saw and it's extremely well written too.
