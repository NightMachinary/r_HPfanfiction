Matilda Wormwood is obviously a Muggleborn who has learnt to control her accidental magic like Tom Riddle and Lily Evans before reaching the age to start magic school (Ilvermorny in the film and Hogwarts in the book).

or would the Durselys be related to be related to MIss Trunchbull and the wormwoods be more likely to be related to The Evans(in the book its Mr Wormwood who is skinny like Petunia)?

Ether way Matilda's life is similar to what I image The life for A female Magical child of the Durleys if Vernon and Petunia had another child and harry was not droped on there doorstep


** I like the idea of /Matilda/ (and some other Roald Dahl books) existing with the Potterverse, but there isn't really a need for a direct family connection between the Wormwoods and the Dursleys, I think.

*** I've seen a few Matilda crossovers where she is Harry's adopted/step sister. At least I think so.

** No, but I think Trunchbull was Umbridge's Muggle cousin.

** Horrible adoptive family is a very common trope in literature. And I can't imagine all those families across the world being related to each other.

** Man, If I remember Mathilda correctly, her parents are saints compared to the Dursley´s.

*** Not really SAINTS, though I will say they are much better realised characters. With the Dursleys you kind of get the feeling that they don't exist outside being horrible to Harry. The Wormwoods are much more complete characters; they clearly have lives outside their relations to Matilda.

**** I know exaggerated a bit, but at least I got the impression, that they somewhat liked Mathilda, but then again I´ve only seen the movie and barely remember it.

***** The movie is a really good adaptation of the book (though I got a little miffed that they cut my favourite character, Nigel), and Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman are great as the Wormwoods... but perhaps it doesn't quite capture how much the Wormwoods do NOT LIKE Matilda.

While she's generally more neglected than downright abused, and certainly doesn't get locked in a cupboard the way Harry did, she does get her fair share of verbal abuse (in true Roald Dahl-fashion, the Wormwoods can get really creative in thinking up insults and belittling things to call someone), and her father does at one point tear up a library book she borrowed and gleefully tell her that SHE'LL have to pay for it.
