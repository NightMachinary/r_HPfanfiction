Features MoD!Harry, just immortal Harry, necromant Harry. Just Harry and HPcrossovers on different sheets. With summaries, links, completion status, word count and my comment (where possible). And there is a specific column for specifying Harry's MODness, be it just an excuse for a timetravel or seeing/summoning spirits of the dead or being the Death itself. Everything you wanted in your MoD!Harry recs!

There are currently 54 fics for just HP, 8 for HPxNaruto, 1 for HPxLotR, 2 for HPxMarvel, 1 for HPxStar Wars, 1.5 for HPxDragon Age and 2 for HPxMass Effect. You see the problem, right? I'm not a fan of LotR or Marvel or Star Wars or Mass Effect or many other fandoms. But MoD!Harry needs these other fandoms and it means that *MoD!Harry needs you*!

Throw your recommendations at me, either here or comment right in the file. Some fics were left without my comment or MODness status because I either haven't read them or don't remember it in such detail. Those fields are coloured. Please, comment on them to provide the needed info if you know that fic. If a field is not coloured but you find the info lacking, comment on it! I'll be glad to receive your suggestions.

Anyway, welcome on board!

31 May UPD: 73 for just Harry, 10 for Naruto, 4 for LotR, 15 for Marvel, 3 for SW, 10 for others.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and ideas, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

** WIP Linkao3(The Master of Death by Quine) Pairing: Death/Harry time travel

On Harry's MoD!ness: Death is personified in this one and Harry can command him. The wand the stone and the cloak merge with Harry and he can use their powers without a physical hallow. Also Harry is basically immortal because Death can (and will) revive him. Harry is connected/influenced by Death and thus becomes a bit like Death (who is an eldritch monster which takes on a human form from time to time) Harry has basically an aura of death around him if he is pissed and stuff rots around him.

Marvel x HP crossover, Loki/Harry one of my favs. Linkao3(4148136) completed On Harry's MoD!ness: (It's some time since I read it and I hope I get it right) Harry doesn't really age but if he gets killed he gets reincarnated and wakes up in another world every time. Every world has a different Death. Hela in the Marvel!Universe. Harry is really powerful in a way that he can use "Death's magic" but usually he is just your everyday wizard with the Elderwand

#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

** Great collection! Looking forward to reading some of these. One WiP fic I can think of to add is Blood Crest. linkffn(10629488) The author says that Harry will eventually be MoD, but currently he's used necromancy and other dark magic.

Another fic to add is Blindness. linkffn(10937871) For the degree of Harry's MODness, later in the story Harry unites the Hallows and is able to resurrect the dead.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was.

** Oh, cool! Are you looking for fics with more than 1 chapter specifically, or are you including one shots, or are you including only base stories (i.e. only one shots that aren't spinoffs), or just everything? Particularly wondering because Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus has a whole load of spinoffs and in-universe one shots all by itself.

Edit: also, are gen immortal/necromancer Harry fics without a specific mention to MoD status allowed? I can think of a few where he's certainly immortal, but either they don't specify MoD or I can't recall if they do.

#+end_quote

I'm including one-shots. In fact, several one-shots are already there. For example, linkao3(2Spooky).

I'm not including fics where the author clearly wanted to write something big but abandoned the work after only 900 or so words. Or where, for example, MoD!Harry is tagged but we don't ever see it. I don't care if it's planned in the future. The future doesn't count, I'm interested only in the present. If you ever see a fic in this collection which doesn't fit it, then this fic's inclusion was a mistake and it should be commented as such.

​

#+begin_quote
  or are you including only base stories (i.e. only one shots that aren't spinoffs), or just everything? Particularly wondering because Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus
#+end_quote

A good example with Lily. I put the base work in "Just Harry" sheet and "Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds" in "HPxNaruto" sheet. I know that there are many spin-offs in the series, so I advised to go to the series page. It would be unwise to add each one to the collection as there are so many of them. Also, the reader won't understand anything without first reading the base work, anyway.

Another example: Imagine a HP series where each Hogwarts year was a new fic. Imagine that HP becomes MoD in the, say, fourth one. Which fic will I add to the collection? I will add the first one and mention when the whole MoD thing happens.

​

#+begin_quote
  also, are gen immortal/necromancer Harry fics without a specific mention to MoD status allowed?
#+end_quote

I think so. I've already stretched it with Basilisk-born (immortality) and several other works with just necromancy, so... Also, they do not have to be gen. I'm accepting everything as long as it's good. So give me your recs!

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said as he stalked closer. “is you.” He backed Harry up until the cool wall of the common room was brushing against him. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely amused. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro is a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer. “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9290286/1/][Death's Son]] has MoD vibes. He is death's son (obviously), and can control the elements. Harry lives a normal live progressing through canon until middle age, when the muggles found out about the Wizarding world and WW3 started, with nuclear devastation and eventual death of the planet as the end result. He goes back in time to the moment his name comes out of the goblet and ends up joining Voldemort. It's unfinished and probably abandoned, but it seems to be leading to possible Barty/Harry with an end goal of tomarry. Harry also has elemental powers, which he uses to great effect the tasks.

*** Also, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/][Xerosis]] has around the same beginning plot, with Harry living out his life until the muggles declare war on magicals, and when he dies he sees death. This time, death tells him he's the master of death and it can grant him dementor-like powers when he returns to his younger body. Harry allies with Voldemort (it's one-sided Harry/lucious with an end goal of Tomarry) and together they save the magical world. I'm pretty sure it's complete.
