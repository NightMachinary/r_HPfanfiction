As we reach the hotel, the trio and I were catching our breaths. Hoping it was not too late, I pulled out my gun.

“What's the plan, Donny?” asked Hermione.

“I will go inside the hotel and rescue your family and my girlfriend. While I do that, I need you three to start the engine and wait until all of us gets out of the hotel. Everybody gets in the car. Ron, I will need you to drive, ” I said.

“Why me?” asked Ron.

“Because out of the three of you, you are the one who knows how to drive a car. Also, I feel like when we are out of the hotel, there will be hell.” I explained.

“Ok,” replied Ron, kinda astound that he will be driving a car on a street.

“Good,” I said, cocking my pistol and hiding it in my jacket.

As I enter the hotel, it felt like something dark engulf the entire place from its feet. There were a lot of dead bodies on the floor. Women, children, and men were on the floor bleeding out. As I walking through the carnage, I stopped at a coffee stand. I heard what sounds like a little girl crying. I walked around and saw this little girl, around 4 or 5 years old crying. She saw me and got frightened.

“Don't be afraid. You see, I am one of the good guys,” I said taking out a pack of gum from my pocket and offering it to her. Like a scared puppy, the little girl was very cautious at first. “Don't worry, it's just gum,” I said taking the stick out of its wrapper and ripping a piece for me, putting it in my mouth, “you see, nothing bad.” The girl took the other piece of gum and put in her mouth. She is still very distressed and between her chewing and her crying, my heart dropped like glass knowing how her family might have gotten killed.

“I want my mama, I want my papa.” the girl said crying into my arms. I don't know if I should tell her parents are dead or not, but it seems like I don't need to as she understands what happened to them.

“Look kid, I need you to hide here, covering your ears and closing your eyes. I need you to keep them closed until I come back. While you doing just sing a calm lullaby. Can you do that?” I asked the little girl. She nodded at me. “I will come back for you, I just need to deal with some bad people.”

I got up walk towards the stairs. As I got to my floor, I saw dead bodies lying around. I got near my door hoping I was not too late. I heard a voice, almost like a snake demanding to know where were the trio and me. I heard my wife telling the voice to go fuck himself. I, being relieved that I wasn't too late took out my gun and kicked down the door. “Honey... I'm home” I said shooting the gun at one of the death eaters. “Donny!” said Katy. “Ahh, you must be the one they called Donny,” said the voice now revealing to be Lord Voldemort. “And you must be the one that they called Snake Hitler. Don't worry, you will make it to art school next time,” I said sarcastically, “Now let the family and my girlfriend go.”

“Where is the boy?” asked Lord Voldemort.

“He is up your ass and to the left.” I snapped back, having the pistol now him.

“You know if you shoot me, I won't die.” said the dark lord with a smile.

“I am counting on it,” I said shooting the fire extinguisher. Katie and the family ran past me, as I was shooting the other two death eaters. I exit out of the room and ran with the others. I stopped myself once we reached the lobby and ran towards the coffee stand.

“Donny, what the fuck are you doing?” yelled Katie.

“Meet me at the car. There is something I need to do.” I said as ran towards where the girl was. She was singing Hush Little Baby to herself. I walk towards her and gently put my hand on her shoulder. She opened her eyes and I picked her up and ran towards the car. I put the little girl in the car just in time as I see Voldemort running out of the hotel with his death eaters. I got in the back seat.

“Ron, get us the hell out of here!” I yelled. Ron stepped on the gas pedal and we were speeding down the road.

“Donny, why the fuck there is a little girl in the car.” yelled Katie.

“Because I didn't want her killed,” I said as I was reloading my pistol.

“You should have left her in the hotel or at least tell her to run outside,” yelled Katie.

“Look, we will talk about this later,” I said as I saw three black smokes heading towards us, “right now, we have more pressing issues at hand. Like for example, staying alive.” As I said, the three black smokes disappeared and the three death eaters fell on the street.

“Donny, what happened?” asked my girlfriend.

“Their magic has drained out,” Harry said.

“Correct, which means that they now we have the advantage,” I said sitting back down, “Looked, Katie, her parents got killed and if I left her there, then she would have died. I am trying to be a hero. I really am, but it is not simple.”

“Well, did you at least find something good in the library?” asked Katie.

“Yeah, there are four challenges we have to complete in order to reach the fountain. Each pertaining to God and the Lord.” I explained.

“I forgot to mention to you Donny, but read somewhere that the fountain is guarded by a forgotten Native Tribe,” Hermione interjected.

“Well, shit, that is just going to be another problem we going to have to solve when we get there,” I said.

We drove all the way to Pennsylvania, where we rested.

“What happened to you, my lord?” asked a lady in black.

“They got away. That muggle got his little girlfriend and the Weasleys. I tried to chase him down but alas it seemed like my magic failed me.” said Voldemort.

“My lord, I have a plan you might like?” said Lucius with an evil smile.
