does anyone have any fanfics with hagrid acting more like Harry's parental figure?? I've just reread and watched the books/movies and the way hagrid is always worrying over harry is just adorable and I was wondering if there were any fics out there? I've gone thru the harry raised by others tag on ao3 already lol :D


** Seconded. I feel like Hagrid is often overlooked in fic.

  AU. What if Hagrid took Harry instead of leaving him with the Dursleys? What kind of parent would he be? Humorous. Rated T for mild violence. No sex, no slash, no swearing. COMPLETE
