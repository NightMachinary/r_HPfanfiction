I've read a few Dark!Harry fics where he uses various rituals to enhance himself but my favorites are the ones that use blood magic as the practice of carving runes into oneself as a means to improve your body.

For example: "With strength of steel wings", "A second chance at life" and some others that i cant remember right now,

Are there any other fics that use this way of blood magic extensively?

​

Thank you in advance!

** Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path /Temporal Knight

RuneMaster /Tigerman

Both can be found in ff.net

I have really enjoyed the second, it's a light read with humour. It's one of they few fics I've read twice :)

The first... erm... well, it's not my cup of tea. I never managed to read it until the end. You might like it better than me...

Edit: I just noticed the blood magic part. I honestly don't remember. Although I remember reading a fic in which they carved runes onto their bodies. If it rings a bell to anybody - let me know? :D

*** I've read those and enjoyed both of them, though the ending of RuneMaster feels kind of.. I don't know.. Rushed? to me. I'm not really sure how to describe it.

Thank you for the recs!

*** Really? guess I never read far enough, I've read a bit of it but for some reason I never get very far.

Thanks!

**** Arithmancer is great. There's a lot of runes later on, although the first few years are mostly focused on math based spellcrafting. But in 7th year Hermione's making highly complex soul magic rituals using runes.

***** Thanks! Maybe this will motivate me to finally finish it!

​

Edit: I'm 47 chapters in now and I've noticed that I'm getting that feeling of wanting to know what she's going to pull off next and it's motiving me to finish, thank you for recommending it to me.

I have a feeling this fic and its sequels will keep me busy for a while. :D
