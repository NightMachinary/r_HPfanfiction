I'm looking for this fic I read a few years ago and I can't seem to find it anywhere!!

It's au and this is all I remember:

-Harry and Hermione know about magic as kids

-there are fewer and fewer male wizards being born so they take multiple wives

-there's this tingly energy that like pulls young male and female wizards together..?

-I feel like I remember Harry rescuing a woman from a weird torture chamber at some point

-I thiiiink I remember Hermione was 'first wife' and the other girls had a night with Harry without telling her and she was pissed..?

I super know this is vague af but I'd be soso jazzed if anybody knew it!!!


** I am not sure but I sounds like it could be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy]]. At least some portions of the fic meet your requirement like less male wizards. Harry and Hermione together and multiple wives. I hope this is it and if not I wish you good luck finding it.
