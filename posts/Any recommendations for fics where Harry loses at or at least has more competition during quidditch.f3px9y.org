I've just noticed that in a lot of fics (and Canon to an extent) Harry is just the best seeker ever without too much effort. I've seen fics where he can best professional players at like 14. Yeah he has natural talent and Wood pushes the team hard but in all his time playing he only loses once against Cedric due to the dementors attacking.

I know this is kind of a specific and not very important point but I just like it when he is challenged, and even in fics where he is magic or politics wise he still seems to be the best seeker ever from age 11.

The whole him having the best broom around for every game except year 2 is also /interesting/.

Draco beats Harry at quidditch. Harry... over reacts.

*** Over reacts is an understatement. He goes back in time and bangs Malfoy's mom.
