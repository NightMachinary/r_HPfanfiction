By this I mean that in canon, he was one of the most powerful Dark Lords ever, and people were so terrified of his ability and lack of morality that they couldn't even speak his name (well, there was a curse to that, too). And he was regarded as a really serious threat.

Some fanfiction treats him as a petty criminal, and has people saying his name, etc, etc, even though the author didn't change the part of canon where he was a real threat to people.


** Posted this in another thread, but it's relevant.

Good Tom Riddles are so hard to find in fanfic.

Sturgeon's Law is in full force there. 95% of Riddlefics have psychotic maniac Voldemort (though to be fair, that is canon!Voldy, which is also a boring, one-note EVULZ character) or, on the other side, a smirking, palette-swapped fanon alternate of Draco Malfoy.

Hardly any fics show what how brilliant he's supposed to be... Even canon made him look like a complete dumbass.

However, holding the Idiot Ball and acting like a dumbass /is/ part of Voldemort's characterization, based on how he acts in canon. But in canon, he has enough magical feats and inventions to suggest he's not a drooling dunderhead. In many fanfics --- and shipping fanfics are the greatest offender of this --- rarely have enough magic to make up for the Idiot Balls, so the characters feel even stupider than normal to me.

In fanfiction, characters become their fanon representations, with dumb jokey Sirius, Ron who can't talk without spilling food out of his mouth, Potion Queen Ginny, or Luna the nympho seer chick. In fanfiction, when authors want to make the villain a believable threat, fanon Tom Riddle/Voldemort becomes a character with Informed Intelligence. And if there's anything worse than intentional bashing, it's accidental bashing --- where what should be a clever and talented character has as much presence as a flobberworm.

*** I remember a Harry time travel fic where Voldemort's tactics changed shortly after Harry's return and Harry couldn't explain it. It made Voldemort more dangerous and Harry's future knowledge wasn't as useful as he had thought it would be.

Harry himself was the reason that Voldemort changed. Voldemort saw Harry's skill rise inexplicably fast in a such a short time that he had come to the conclusion that Harry had absorbed the horcrux and gained Voldemort's knowledge. So Voldemort adapted himself under that assumption. He learned new things, changed how he operated under the assumption that he would have to defeat someone who was effectively his past self.

*** I have actually been surprised by the amount of good Tom Riddle and Voldemort fanfiction out there. While reading the books and watching the movies I have considered Tom Riddle/Voldemort to be a boring and mostly forgettable villain.

Lately though I have felt my opinion of him really changing for the better because of fanfiction. A lot of my favorite fics happen to feature him as a major character and really made me enjoy reading about him. He is evil, but also quite clever, cunning, manipulative and interesting to read about.

Some examples of where I liked him are linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom), linkffn(Harry potter and the accidental Horcrux), linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus), linkffn(Rectifier by Niger Aquila) and linkao3(Diablerie by oceanbreeze7).

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

** Honestly, I get where you are coming from, but other than the final battle and killing Lily/James, Voldemort isn't really dangerous in canon. Harry escapes the Graveyard after a few seconds of torture and a mock duel, Umbridge is the one who runs the magical genocide and tortures Harry more often, Bellatrix is the one who tortures Hermione and kills Sirius, Malfoy is the one who leads the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and the "power of love" repeatedly defeats Voldemort.

Don't get me wrong, the silly names for Voldemort are stupid and most people wouldn't say his name, but he is not the worst "roadblock" of the series. Harry could have killed him with ease in his camp and figured out what to do with the Horcruxes. Hell, the whole Battle of Hogwarts in canon is just a slugfest of incompetence on both sides. Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange cause more danger for the protagonists than Voldemort does.

That's just patently untrue. Voldemort was one of the most powerful wizards in Britain at the time. Albus Dumbledore was the only one that was able to match up to him in a confrontation, and by the end of OoTP that felt like it wasn't true. Amelia Bones and Emmeline Vance were considered two accomplished witches and he killed them as well. The idea of killing Voldemort in his "camp" is ridiculous.

Voldemort isn't conventionally human. The Horcruxes essentially anchor his soul to the living realm and his body is a sort of magical construct. So a bomb could blow his ass to smithereens (not even going into the nature of magic and how it matches up with muggle weaponry) - but his soul would be anchored to the living. Even if you eliminated all of his horcruxes, his soul would still stick around. Like Hermione was talking about in DH, killing Voldemort is about killing the soul, not killing the body.

You can't find Voldemort's camp. I'm going to assume that we're both referring to Malfoy Manor which is just as protected as Grimmauld Place. It's unplottable (for sure) as well as covered in a wide set of protections. Like Grimmauld, the only way to get in would be at the invitation of someone else. Now, it's even further possible that this invitation would have to be genuine and not coerced. Magic is funny like that.

You are discounting easy solutions, like stabbing him with a basilisk fang from under the invisibility cloak, suicide bombing the camp (I'm sure you could rig something from the potion stores) or getting a gun ("Accio machine gun and ammunition") and gunning him down from under the cloak at point blank range.

When he gets away and recovers enough of his strength, all he has to do is possess a witch or wizard, repeat the ritual they perform in the graveyard, this time with literally anyone who can be called his enemy - and just kill the victim at the end instead of trying to make it a spectacle.

Once he recovers his body, it's only a matter of time before he has followers again - Voldemort can easily gain legions of followers just from the Imperius curse. If all goes according to plan, all he needs to do is to kill HP and others who know of his horcruxes when they go about their normal lives and make those deaths look like accidents.

Voldemort had to be continuously nerfed throughout the series just so HP and the rest could stand a chance at all. A more realistic approach would have them get massacred.

  I've reported your post for targeted harassment against Hellstrike. You're supposed to be some big name here, some community pillar, so act like it. Don't act like a bully. Or is that the real point of you? You think you're so big and cool, with everyone knowing about you and looking to you in this community, that you think you can do whatever you want? Treat people however you want? No. You can't.

  You lay off Hellstrike.

And back on topic, the Taboo curse was never mentioned pre-DH, so we don't know if Voldemort used it back in the first war. However, we shouldn't it put it past the Death Eaters to torture or gruesomely murder people (and their families) if they publicly insulted Voldemort, or even talked about him disrespectfully. That would be enough to make people afraid to mention Voldemort by name, Taboo or not.

****** I don't care. If other people here get to be assholes and cynical pedantic jerks then I'll be one too. That's just how this place is, isn't it? So why shouldn't I just join in? Who gives a shit? Everyone else is doing it and it doesn't ever stop. So fuck it. I'm doing it too, I don't care.

******* No it's not. Dumbledore encouraged people to say the name and even the Order was caught off guard by it. There's nothing that heavily implies that.

******** To be fair, that was after Voldemort's first demise, so it's conceivable that the Taboo could have broken, like the Imperius curses cast by him as well.

********** True, you'd think he'd tell Harry 'oh Voldemort had a spell so that he could find you if you say his name, so if he takes over again don't say the name', but I suppose as Rowling only came up with the idea for the Taboo for the last book, it doesn't have a very satisfying conclusion in-universe.

*** Lord Voldemort was never implied to be a psycho terrorist. He was a dictator, in some sense. Calling him a psycho terrorist just seems so lazy, uninformed, and seems less impactful over all. It is just a less creative version of ‘Moldyshorts'.

The issue with both Tom Riddle /and/ Lord Voldemort is that he suffered due to the author being unable to write a genuine antagonist. Voldemort /had/ to be incompetent so that Harry Potter, the saviour, would win. Tom Riddle was a genius, an implied powerful wizard, and a deceptively charming young man. All of this vanished when Harry Potter came into the scene with his, I do not know, +100 Plot Armour modifier.

First of all, people did fear saying Hitler's name, but that was due to different reasoning than what made everyone afraid to say ‘Voldemort'. You go say Hitler to someone who fought against his forces in World War II or someone who had someone killed by his orders. Adolf Hitler, to this day, still has people who worship him, fear him, and respect him. Genghis Khan, and I assume you mean Ceaser, were a different breed and were before any of our times. It is, arguably, ancient history. Hitler, Mao, and Stalin are all different cases.

I assume if the Taboo Curse was used in the second Wizarding War, I assume it was also used in the first. However, it may not have and people may have feared saying his name because it showed disrespect. If we go by canon, Lord Voldemort had almost won before he was defeated by Harry Potter. That is grounds enough to avoid angering someone who had no qualms about slaughtering an entire family with no remorse.

You do not have to do it, correct. It is /your/ story that you are writing and no one has any grounds to tell you how to write. On the flip side, you have no grounds to tell anyone else how to write.

he's a psychopath, cult leader, and a terrorist. he's also dictatorial. still, 'dictator' seems too mundane a term. umbridge was a dictator. voldemort was an inhuman monster from a fairytale, or at least aspired to be one
