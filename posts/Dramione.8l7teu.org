*** She also has another called hunted that's really good. Or there's a couple by heartofaspen that are really good, like eagle's nest, by it's not complete. Colubrina has some really good ones as well, for slytherin hermione or pureblood hermione. I recently reread presque toujours pur by shayalonnie, which is a good pureblood hermione one. Plus there's some time travel ones I've read too if that's what you like. Dramione is my otp so I've read tons!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11845481/1/The-Brightest-Black][The Brightest Black]] by Enigmaticrose4 is a wonderful fic in my opinion. Hermione ended up being adopted by Sirius. It has an original storyline plus it is completed.

#+begin_quote
  Six months after Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord, Voldemort, someone decided to turn back time and change history where Harry Potter was reduced to nothing more than a myth. Strangely, only Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger, mortal enemies at best, were unaffected by the sudden time shift. Now they must find a way to return to their true timeline as only they know the truth.
