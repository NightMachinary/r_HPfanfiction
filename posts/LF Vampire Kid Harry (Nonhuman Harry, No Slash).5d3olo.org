Basically, I'm looking for fics in which Harry gets turned into a vampire before/early at Hogwarts. Both male and fem!Harry will do as long as it won't (d)evolve into an unreasonable slash fic with mates.

Better yet, romance isn't the main point of the story, but how vampirism affects Harry's life is. Actually, werewolf and any other nonhuman magical being Harry stories are welcomed too as long as they avoid the stupid slash/mate trope that ruins the plot and being a half-breed affects Harry's life in some significant way.

Now that I think about it mutant!demigod!experiment!Harry fits the criteria too, kinda. Crossovers are welcome.

Here are examples of such relatively good stories that sparked my search:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11392098][Sanguine]] linkffn(11392098) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11880089][Little girl]] linkffn(11880089) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11867294][Chimaera]] linkffn(11867294)


** Maybe Twilight crossover, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7277012/1/Fork-It-Over][Fork It Over]]?\\
linkffn(7277012)\\
More in the Twilight universe than HP universe. Harry gets turned when he's a child and they just troll the hell out of the Cullens. Some Cullen bashing. No romance. I don't think there's much emphasis on how life changing it is for Harry. He gets bitten, time skip to when Edward shows up at the Volturi. Personally, I thought this fic was hilarious with some of the pranks they pull but YMMV. Oh, and no Hogwarts. There's some mentions of magicals, but they don't have any major impacts if I recall.

  Regarding Harry Potter, and her ..special diet. A slightly darker universe, people might be a little out of character. (Fem!Harry)

  Vernon Dursley had a chance to rid himself of the Freak, and he took it. As a result, the one who would be a beacon of hope, Gryffindor's Golden Boy, and The-Man-Who-Conquered had his fate irrevocably and horrifically changed. Instead of a champion of the innocents of the Wizarding World, he became something far, far darker and more powerful, something horrifying. MultiXover

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
