If you don't know what that means, it basically was the power of a villain named Grey Boy who put people in a bubble of stopped time. Just do something similar to Voldemort and bob's your uncle.

Or, alternatively, put him in stasis in antarctica or something.


** There's also a couple where he gets obliviated, of everything.

In short the reason is that wizard magic is completely and utterly broken, so if his followers can still see him, they can rescue him. As long as he has his body, he's fine due to the horcrux.

Even removing his memories would only be a temporary measure if any of his followers know about a horcrux and where to find out.

That doesn't mean that it shouldn't be done, just that it's all just temporary in different measures.

** Because if such a state can be forced onto someone, it can be removed. If you don't permanently remove the threat, you're just making your current problems future problems instead. For a recommendation though, check this fic, with Harry adopted by Lockheart:

*** True enough, but it should be noted that the main issue Harry and his friends had for most of the books was that their opposition was fully trained, more experienced and had plenty of time to stack the deck in their favor.

Using an oppening from one of the lucky breaks they occasionally get, temporarily disabling some like that would allow to reduce the pressure on the main cast, let them prepare and implement a superior solution down the line.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!
