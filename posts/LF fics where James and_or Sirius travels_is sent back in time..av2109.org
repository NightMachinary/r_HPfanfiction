We've all seen the stories where Harry/Hermione/Snape travels/is sent back in time from any given point to fix stuff, or to the 70s. I've never seen one with this happening to James or Sirius, so if anybody has seen fics where this is the case, please share them.

Can be a fix-it fic or can have conflict by making it AU to any degree. Preferably no bashing, slash or Snape-wanking (in the lines of "oh, he turned to the Dark because we bulled him" - none of that BS please).

  Sirius Black didn't die when he fell through the Veil, instead he is given a second chance, waking up as his twenty-one year old self, a week before Halloween 1981. Armed with knowledge of the future, Sirius fights to ensure the burden of prophecy doesn't fall on Harry's shoulders... But can he survive the war and keep his friends alive? Completed!
