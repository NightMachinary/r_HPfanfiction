A small Christmas Fremione oneshot!

Dancing, Dreams, and the Beginning of Things (rated T for swearing) Summary: His little brother was really an idiot. When a girl goes to the effort to get you a ticket to her ballet you basically have to go. Not that Fred knew much about the Nutcracker... or the ballet in general. Well, at least George had snuck him a snack, even if it was wrapped in an odd purple and orange wrapper. AU: Retelling of the Nutcracker [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27355219]]

A (not at all awaited) prequel to Caffeine, Strings, and Other Impossible Things (rated E for smut). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27285505/chapters/66664003]]
