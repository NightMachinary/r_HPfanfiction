hi again,

i am looking for a fic where BWL or GWL are summoned to another world/universe to kill voldemort, but is so unimpressed by being kidnapped with no way home, he just leaves and lives his life.....

â€‹

if he fights it should only be because voldemort attacks him personally/new girlfriend he found on his travels or something along the lines, and not because of he being the idiot hero....

** Not quite what you are looking for, but I wrote a oneshot along the same lines in an attempt to subvert the trope. Where manipulative!Dumbledore summons a champion to solve his own problems but gets good!Dumbledore instead.

linkao3(26459503)

I think that linkffn(On a Pale Horse) also fits what you are looking for as well. Very dark and edgy though.

  When Grey!Manipulative!Dumbledore summoned a champion... he wasn't expecting this. Or, Manipulative vs Good Dumbledore.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** There's a fic/series where Harry somehow gets to the Supernatural universe and Sam and he falls in love, something happens and he gets sent through different AU:s and such, until he gets home several centuries after for him. Can't recall the name but I think the author was kirallie. On ao3.

Another similar fic/ sorta series is the Traveller series, can't remember the name there either, but I think the Traveller help make a new and better Burrow for the Weasley's.

** Not specifically what you asked for but:

linkffn(12511998)

Not a summoned Harry, but starts out with Harry not intending to help, but he gets sucked into it anyway. He is rediculusly overpowered though (in a one-man-army-using-only-a-levitation-spell sort of way), and not everybody is into that.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
