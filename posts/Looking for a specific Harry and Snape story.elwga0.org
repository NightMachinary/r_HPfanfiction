:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a story a while ago (I think on AO3 but it might have been fanfiction.net) where Harry is taken from the Dursleys one summer after something happened and people think Harry's to blame. I think it must have been after third year because part of what happens is that Sirius and Molly both tell Harry off (not too angsty, like what an angry parent might do) in letters.

Mainly I remember Snape getting suspicious of Harry's behaviour and trying to figure it out, and it ends up in a stand-off where Harry doesn't eat for several days.

Also Harry works on the roof a couple of times. And that's about all I remember.

Oh there's one scene where Snape encourages Harry to reply to the letters from Molly and Sirius and Harry writes really angry responses and in the end that's actually what Snape wants.

Please help!

#+begin_quote
  Harry is accused of burglary. The Dursleys leave him to rot. Dumbledore sends Snape to remedy the situation. Harry finds himself in the care of an irate Snape. Not slash, gen-fic w/ focus on Sevitus-like relationship. Angst galore. Warnings: some language, mentions of abuse/neglect, alcohol use. Inspired by nnjjj's But He's Going to Kill Me challenge on Potions and Snitches.
