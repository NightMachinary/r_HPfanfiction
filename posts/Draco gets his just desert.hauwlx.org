I'm in the mood for Draco fucking Malfoy getting his ass handed to him for being a gigantic prick. Or him getting humiliated like never before.

Any of the good guys will do. But Ron would be my first preference.


** For Lack of a Bezoar has this. Canon divergence starting w/ Ron's birthday in HBP.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

******* Snape is a great character. He is not a good person at all, and he isn't heroic as J.K Rowling said and not in an anti heroic way. He turned on fascism because he didn't get what he wanted ( a girl who was smart enough to kick his toxic ass out of her life). He's awful. Brave? Yes in his twisted way very much so. He's utterly fascinating. But Snape Stan's want to remove all the compelling parts of his character in their romanticization and the it revisions to his character. Fanfic Snape is boring

****** I mean... Painting Lucius and Draco in a good light is fine /if it matches the tone of the fic/. Either you have them as decent people from the start, or Harry being evil with the narrative being from a Death Eater's point of view. What is not okay, in my opinion at least, is these random changes of heart which basically amount to "Oh I served the Dark Lord but now you're winning so I'll be a good person" or, as I sometimes see happen (and honestly it's the reason I avoid slashfics in the HP fandom), "Harry just fucked me so good I'm gonna betray the Dark Lord who managed to track Karkaroff down effortlessly and will most likely kill me if not for the plot armor"

However, if it's done well, I can see Lucius actually /convincing/ people that he was good all along, if it's done at least 1/3rd before the fic ends and he manages to play the model good guy throughout all of it. He's supposed to be the ideal Slytherin, so spinning that lie could be possible. I've also read a couple of decent fics where he goes to Dumbledore or Harry when Voldemort requests Draco, with Lucius still being a vile asshole but going against his ideals for his family.

Absolutely no hope for Draco tho, if he's anything close to canon.

** Linkffn(An Incomplete Potter Collection by Racke)

This is a series of snippets/plot bunnies. Chapter 9 has 6 snippets. The first one is called "Malfoy's Beat-Down".

The set up isn't great, but it's very brief and gets to the beat down quickly. In the triwizard tournament Harry ends up in some kind of fanon veela/life bond thing with Gabrielle. Neither of them are at all happy about it. Draco tries to start bullying her but Harry isn't having any of it.

** I think it was in (The lie I've lived by jbern) that he decided to bully and humiliate Draco to the point where even the Weasley twins say it's too much.

This, after Draco went and cried to daddy when Penelope Clearwater (muggleborn head girl) gave him detention for calling her a mudblood, or something like that.

To which drama queen Malfor sr responded by blacklisting her from a ministry job like Harvey Weinstein who just got rejected by a young, self-respecting woman.

I remember there was a scene where he embaressed Draco in front of the whole school + Beuaxbatons and Durmstrang and he also 'pranked' him on a daily basis. I'm still longing for a sequel to that fic ):

** Great instant payback in the first few chapters and more for others Money, fame, family name means little to Harry. Great redemption had by some characters because of the influence in early years. Goblin are warriors, raised and trained harry from day 1 and isnt the best in the beginning, but the writing settles nicely much farther in. But some parts are too romance centered for young HarryxHermione. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow]])

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.
