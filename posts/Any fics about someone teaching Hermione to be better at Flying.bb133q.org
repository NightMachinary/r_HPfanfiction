I've always found it cute that Hermione is so unsteady on a broom and seems to dislike flying and gets kind of anxious when the topic comes up.(at least i think its in canon or maybe i've picked it up from fanon...i really need to re-read the series soon haha) Anyway just wondering if there are any fics where someone helps Hermione get better at flying? Can see Harry or Ginny taking on the role best out of the many candiates but will take other characters doing it as well. Story could be friendship based or romantic. oneshot or LF are both fine.

  Ron has a plan. Harry has a secret. Hermione finds a mission. How will their collision at the Burrow over the summer affect the way the trio see each other? Will they learn that not everyone thinks the way you expect them to?

  "Penny for your thoughts?" said a voice in the dark.One minute Remus had been alone in the garden, leaning against the Weasleys' broomstick shed, facing away from the Burrow and that peculiar limbo between Order meeting and wedding preparations. But then he lit up, and the flame briefly illuminated the face of Hermione, now lounging next to him. Remus allowed himself a deep drag before answering, "Life's but a walking shadow." She'd get it.Her frown confirmed that she did. "Macbeth sort of mood?" she asked.Macbeth sort of world, Remus thought.

*** Thank you very much for pointing me in the direction of the TheDivineComedian. I was especially intrigued by linkao3(We Would All Be Happier by TheDivineComedian), which is possibly even better than Tomorrow. I am in the process of writing a novel about post-War Petunia and so I spent a lot of time thinking about her motivation and her way of thinking. I have to admit that the usual explanation “She was just jelaous” seems rather unsatisfactory to me. What kind of person would because of childish jealousy from when she was early teenager abused her dead sisters only child? We are talking about true psychopath and that is not fun. The jealousy was certainly there, but I don't think it was the only problem.

Petunia's conversation with Lupin was not the first case I thought about, but I think it is a way better explanation. What actually Petunia saw from magic? Some ashtrays turned into turtles (or something of that sort; WTH all Transfiguration exercises were so silly?), or some other tiny things which Lilly managed to sneak under the Trace, and then just disasters: her sister killed, she got her nephew on doorsteps, her son got a pig tail (and it had to be surgically removed; where in the world was Department of Magical Catastrophes in that moment?), then he got five feet long tongue, then her sister-in-law blown up (which she may very well hate like a plague; remember, we know nothing about internal thinking of either adult Dursley), again her son almost killed (or something like that) by dementors, living in hiding because of the magical terrorists, and war.

To quote immortal John Cleese “What have magic ever done for us”? Was it really worthy? I can imagine Petunia could at least on some level with somehow good conscience tried to protect Harry from entering this crazy dangerous world (and it is only Dumbledore's fault he never explain to Dursleys what Obscurials are), which promises beauty and gives him only death and torture.

  Petunia's family is already perfect. She does not want to raise the child she found on her doorstep. So Petunia, self-described anti-adventurer, takes little Harry on a long drive in order to find Albus Dumbledore. But what good is a Volvo against the course of fate?
