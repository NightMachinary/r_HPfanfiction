I've recently finished *The Belgariad* series and I'm reading *The Malloreon* series now. So, I'm kind of looking for Harry Potter fics in which there is a much more important prophecy about Harry. maybe he is the long lost king of Magical Britain, the guardian of Britain or the world or something like that.


** Probable going to be downvoted to hell for this.. Linkffn(Harry Potter And The Methods.Of Rationality) has this as a major plot point. Quite relevant in its sequel Linkffn(Significant Digits).

**** It's not for everyone, certainly. I do think it gets more flak than it deserves, eg people getting upset about how it depicts Draco's plans to rape Luna Lovegood when he's older even though Harry is horrified by what he's hearing and wants to tear apart the Wizarding world to put a stop to that kind of thing. But not everyone is going to enjoy it, and that's okay.

It's a thought-provoking read, though.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

** The Prince of Slytherin has another prophecy, and it is so much more ominous than the canon prophecy. It literally starts with the line This is how our world will end (i wouldn't consider it much of a spoiler but if you want to go in pretty much blind I'd definitely skip it).

Linkffn(11191235) [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][AO3 series link]]

A note for if you decide to read this fic: a lot of people (myself included) dislike the prologue, so I'd suggest reading at least the chapter after it before you make a decision on whether to continue or not.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
