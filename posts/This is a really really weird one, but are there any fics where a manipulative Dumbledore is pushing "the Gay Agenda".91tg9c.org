Once I thought of the idea I couldn't get it out of my head and I keep imagining Fudge as Alex Jones whenever I'm reading things now.


** I like this, but for maximum points, he needs to be pushing the gay agenda from his sexually formative years, from 1896-1900, proudly advocating the Order of Chaeronaea and demanding the re-opening of Lyons' Corner House.

** If you have Fudge as Alex Jones then every fic qualifies. It doesn't matter was Dumbledore actually does or says.

** Well, I mean, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12817894/1/Harry-Potter-LGBT-Edition][Harry Potter - LGBT Edition]] is literally this... and honestly I don't think you could do it without making it a crack fic, like this, or some kind of youtube wingnut version of /Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles./

*** Actually I was envisioning it as a side thing to one of those whitewashing of the pureblood fics like Dumbledore's house elf pride parades through the great hall are hurting population growth or something. Would definitely love a crack fic of it though.
