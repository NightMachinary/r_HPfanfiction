Does anyone know any fics where hermione is sirius,james,remus, or lily's sister? I don't have a paring preference.


** The Debt of Time by shayalonnie is superb. It's on both AO3 and ff.net.

You could also check out The Way Home by Miss Grace O'Malley.

I read one where she became Lily's sister but I think it was abandoned... I think it was The Thief of Time by Tink Wolfe but not sure.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner.

  The war was over and Hermione Granger was focused on making the best of the wizarding world. When she's hurled back in time, what will happen with a certain Marauder? (Rated M for later chapters including violence, sexual content, and language) - Now COMPLETE!

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.This story was originally posted to Fanfiction.net in 2015 and is complete. It started off non-betaed, picked up FluffPanda, and then The Dragon and the Rose, Dutchgirl01, and Flyby Commander Shepard. It was a labour of love.

  They thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters are still ruling, using politics instead of hexes. With the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, they must go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power to fix what broke in the past. Nominated for Best James and Best Peter in the 2018 Marauder Medals!
