I'm just super interested in this for some reason. I'd prefer if it's longer, but medium length fics are fine. No creepy student/teacher pairings either please haha.


** "Is this seat occupied?" asked Hermione a bit nervously.

Iris Potter looked Hermione Granger up and down. Hermione felt quite nervous and felt like she was under an X-ray due to the beautiful green eyed girl's gaze.

Iris's gorgeous face held a disgusted expression.

Hermione knew that look. She had been subjected to it many times by Malfoy and his gang simply because of her blood.

"You can't sit here." Iris said coldly. Hermione opened her mouth to defend herself when Iris cut her off again, "That skirt you are wearing totally clashes with your top. I'm not even going to get stated on the scarf. Polka dots? Seriously? Everybody knows they are /so/ last season."

*** Hermione's mind ground to a halt. Iris Potter just told her off because of her clothes; not\\
because of her intelligence and personality, not because of her being a muggleborn but her clothes.

Iris was still looking at her with that disgusted expression. She wanted to snap back at her but held her tongue. She was so lonely at Hogwarts and wanted a friend so badly. Everyone else that she talked to were either jealous because of her intelligence or disliked her because of her parents not being magical but clothes were soo trivial. If it got her a friend then she was more than willing to change her clothes.

"That is what I wanted to talk to you about." Iris quirked a perfectly shaped eyebrow at her. "I wanted to ask you for help with my clothes. You clothes always look so good and your clothes never clash."

Iris stared at her for a few moments before she stood up, took her hand and told her to show her wardrobe as she pulled her towards their dormitory. She had a smile on her face as she followed Iris. As annoying as it would be to listen to someone go on and on about clothes it would be all worth it if she got a friend out of it.

  The three girls stared as Hermione Granger sat down opposite them.

  "Sorry, I don't get it," Daphne said, frowning. "If you're from the Muggle world, why do you have magic?"

  "Oh my god, Daphne," Pansy said, "you can't just ask people why they have magic."

  Victoria looked Hermione up and down. "You can't sit here," she said dismissively. "On Wednesdays we wear wide-brimmed hats."

*** Parvati squinted at the blue-robed Fleur. "She doesn't even go here!"

Lockhart puffed out his chest as he eyed each member of the class, one by one. "I'm not like a regular professor, I'm a cool professor."

I could go on.
