Looking for a fanfic that I read several years ago on FanFiction.net. It was an instant messenger fic kind of like The Original Naked Quidditch Match. Was a super Harry fic and at one point Harry sends a portkey in an attachment to catch Pettigrew. I know at several points throughout the story Harry does things that are supposed to be impossible but since he doesn't know that, he somehow circumvents the rules.

I don't remember much else about the fic, hoping someone here would be able to help me out.


** Fairly certain that it is [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/1__Surprise_Snog/][This Means War by Jeconais]] which features a magic email, and Harry breaking virtually all known rules of magic through the power of sheer, dumb ignorance.

*** That's exactly the one, thanks! Now to see if it stands up to how I remembered it...
