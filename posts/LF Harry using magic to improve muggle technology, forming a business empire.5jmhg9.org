So I was (re)reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] and got really interested in the part where they started talking about using magic to create medicine and create better cars. Unfortunately, the story hasn't gotten to that part, and I have a feeling it'll just be the epilogue when it does get to it. I now have a craving for a story with this idea, and was hoping you guys could help me out.

  When Harry fell through the Veil of Death, that should have been the end of the story. But 40 days later he returned with a power never seen before, and a darkness in him that made both the dark and light fear him. H/HR/LL. Rated M.

** Linkffn(emperor;The Lightsaber by Tellemicus Sundance) the first one is a given epic. The second one is getting one concept from SW and sufficiently translating it in the HP world. Both has lots of action, but Emperor can get a bit dragy at times.

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)
