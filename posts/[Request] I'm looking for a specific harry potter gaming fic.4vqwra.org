** Oh crap I just read this, and I can't find it. It had sequels with titles based on his "rules"... They reminded me of the fight club rules (the first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club lol). This is going to drive me nuts, but I can't find it in my favourites or my bookmarks. I'll keep looking!

Found it! In my review history, and I was right, the last one that's not finished is called Tell No One lol.

I think this may be it. I haven't read it completely, but I recall starting it and it may fit.
