:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I cannot for the life of me remember the name, but there was this fic where Dumbledore threatens the shit out of Malfoy for something or other - invites him in for tea and nibbles and says something along the lines of "That diary was important to your Lord, wasn't it? Also, you're eating his basilisk now. Won't he be pissed. Heh. Don't do the thing I brought you here to threaten you about, 'kay?"

EDIT - Oh wow, I did not intend that title to sound as euphemistic as it did. My bad. :D


** enter the dragon on QQ. It's in the later chapters.
