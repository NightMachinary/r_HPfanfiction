I've read a couple of fanfics by debstheslytherinsnapefan and I really liked how the dark side was actually smart and right. What other fics can you recommend that portray death eaters and voldemort as the better guys? Bonus points if main characters are smart, charismatic, do things under Dumbledore's nose etc.


** More of a crackfic but the short story Fate's Chosen by Luan Mao shows how Harry really screwed things up.

  Harry dies and wakes up in Fate's office. You've heard it before, right? You're expecting a re-do fic, right?
