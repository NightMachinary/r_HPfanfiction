I'm looking for a dark Harry Potter fic that is actually well made. I've seen too many fics in which he was brooding before changing sides just because he was brooding. Or ones where he meets Hermione or Daphne and learns to care about something or about true love. Or where he switches sides because of Dumbledore and nothing deeper than that.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] is of course my favorite in this category.

There are several other dark!Harry I like though:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] features a very brilliant and ruthless Harry. This fic has unfortunately not been updated for a long time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]] has lots of tropes, but is a fun curb stomp fic. This Harry and Ginny pair enjoys torture quite a bit and likes having rough sex after battles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]] is time travel. Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan all became very disturbed people after a brutal war. Once back in time, they unleashed hell on their enemies. Dark humors.

Both Hermione and Ron left Harry during the Horcrux hunt in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]]. He continued a totally brutal war against Voldemort by himself. One of my favorite Harry/Daphne fics.

Harry always made the 'good' choice in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]] is the ultimate bash fic, even usually benign characters such as Amelia Bones, Arthur Weasley, Dora Tonks, Professor Sprout, and Remus Lupin are mercilessly bashed. The ending is very unique though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12118000/1/Wither][Wither]] is Epilogue compliant and very horrible. Harry would do anything to 'preserve' his family.

Allied with Grindelwald in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], Harry was slowly dragged by his friends to the 'dark side'.
