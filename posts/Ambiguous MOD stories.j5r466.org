Basically I want to read stories were Harry somehow becomes the Master of death but there is no avatar of death to tell him what his role consists of.

A lot of authors put an anthropocentric avatar of death in their stories which makes everything less satisfying and mysterious. So I want to read stories were less is more and Harry's role as the master of death is ambiguous, creepy, and mysterious in nature rather than having all the answers. I like it when Harry suddenly stops aging or small mysterious things happen and there is no grandiose revelation for it. He just has to cope with the idea of being an amortal being and the existential horror of it all.

So pls no avatar of death No obnoxious powers that kill the tension and mood of the story Lot's of mystery and maybe even transcendental or existential themes It can be Gothic or Lovecraftian in nature

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable.

  "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.” At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts to assist in the lord's search for the Hallows --- by spying on the heir to the Cloak of Invisibility, James Potter.

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.“I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”“You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to help you?”Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah. You're the only one who can, apparently.”
