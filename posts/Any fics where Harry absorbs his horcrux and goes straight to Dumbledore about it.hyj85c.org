Something happens, Harry merges with/absorbs the horcrux in his head. Harry gains Voldemort's memories and magical skill, but his own personality wins out.

I've seen this sort of thing in a fair few fics. What I haven't seen is Harry going and talking to Dumbledore about it.

Any recommendations?


** can you link the fics where he does absorb the horcrux? that seems like such a cool concept I can't believe I've never read it.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

From memory, this is even fairly close to what OP asked for, in that things are discussed with Dumbledore, but my memory is hazy due to the time involved.

******* So.. From a technical standpoint, it was done by the time Harry woke up. But from a practical standpoint, it's gradual but with spikes in connection in from time to time - particularly times of need.

It took Rand like 2 years over the course of 12 epic fantasy length books to fully merge with his past self.

I don't mind spoilers if you don't mind explaining a bit more - I'm not really interested enough to keep reading as it stands now.

******** Sorry for the late answer, fell asleep and forgot to check reddit afterwards. Here it is (if it's still relevant):

He merges with each subsequent horcrux he encounters, with each giving him more power, but also changing him slightly. The change may or may not be placebo as characters are convinced he is still very much himself, but his behaviour suggests otherwise. It's debatable.

The side-effects of merging are actually immediate too, it's just that not all of them are obvious right away.

He also messes up his own mind slightly by unskillfully using Legilimency, which produces a similar effect to how Rand became incapable of hurting women due to Lews Therin's experiences. Riddle is also a very capable villain and other adults are generally more capable than fifteen-year-olds.

Harry also puts a lot of effort into his interaction with girls and women, which sometimes makes him come across as a bit of a womanizer.

That's about it. If I told you more, I'd be retelling the entire story.

Huh. That's interesting. Somehow I hadn't considered that sort of thing before. I like it. I can only imagine how Voldemort would feel about that, as Harry consumes his soul piece by piece.

One more question. Roughly how far through the fic does Harry become, for lack of a better term, approximately Voldemort-level? If he gets there at all. Half way through? The very end? Etc.

Thanks.

********** Power-wise, I think he at least equals him by the time updates stop, though I'm pretty sure this was never confirmed. In a confrontation somewhere half-way through, it is confirmed the Voldemort is more powerful, but Harry catches up afterwards.

Skill-wise, however, he remains Voldemort's inferior. Though this is also just my opinion.

*** It is a cool concept. It's too bad I don't see it with a decent execution very often. I know that I've ran into several, problem is I didn't like most or find them memorable.

linkffn(What's a Little Death between friends? by kathryn518) - Post-canon. Harry/Tonks. Shortly after Voldemort is killed, Harry goes to walk through the veil of death and Tonks accidentally falls in with him. They end up in the middle of the first war against Voldemort.

Linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart) - I recommend /not/ reading this one, but it's one of the fics that fits that I remember.

There's a few with a vaguely similar concept but don't really fit.

Linkffn(Samsara by Countess Millarca) - Harry doesn't get all of Voldemort's memories and skills, but he becomes far more Voldemort-y.

IIRC, in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Harry is actually basically a clone of Voldemort's soul in Harry's body, the difference being that he was raised by loving parents .

In Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin it seems to be heavily implied that the horcrux is heavily influencing Harry, including giving him some knowledge, but nothing like the entirety of Voldemort's memories.

**** I mean, you can't really expect everything to immediately be different. 99% of the time, events snowball from whatever changes are made - so the beginning will be roughly the same until something actually happens to /change/ things, and some things will still happen because the changes the fanfic makes had near-nothing to do with those events.

Chapter 3 is barely even post-Sorting-Ceremony - barely enough time for the snowball to start rolling.
