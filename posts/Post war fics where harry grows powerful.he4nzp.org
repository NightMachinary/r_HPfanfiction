A lot of fics do the whole leader of the light trope but we never really see him as truly powerful in the magical sense rather than a political or financial. I was hoping for recs where he actively grows his power rather than it being ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù some how No bashing no fem Harry no slash


** First thing that springs to mind is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link), though I'm not sure he counts as ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù despite obtaining certain powers.

  The morning after defeating Voldemort, Harry finds he wants nothing more than to be left alone. However, angry goblins, dementors, and a well-meaning Minister make this impossible, imposing on Harry more responsibilities than he wants... and then some.

** linkffn(Made of Common Clay) is a post-war deconstruction fic, and it has everything - Powerful in terms of Money, Magic /and/ political clout. You might enjoy it.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth. COMPLETE.

It is a little darker than what I was hoping for but it's still a good fic
