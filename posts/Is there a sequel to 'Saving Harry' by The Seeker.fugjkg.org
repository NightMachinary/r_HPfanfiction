I finished reading it just now and I need more.


** Honestly, it's simple. You should have thought of it by now. Just click the author, go onto his profile, and READ to find out if there's a sequel. Usually, they indicate its a sequel by mentioning it, but sometimes you need to just check the summaries.

Edit : BTW, try to identify what you liked the best in that fic, and make a request on it to help scratch that itch.
