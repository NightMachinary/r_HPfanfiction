*** No, the premise is that Harry, being a white male, is sidelined because of it, that the minorities(Muggleborn, not-white, and so on) are in progressive action groups that are so full of themselves, they think they're better than Harry because of their minority status and his 'privileged' status of being a white male that's a pureblood(in their mind, any pureblood makes one a full pureblood, see/google One-drop Rule) makes him obviously wrong about everything because he can't judge anything due to his inherent pureblood bias. Cho, Hermione, Angelina, Dean, or make up some other minority characters in the series then decide to go off thinking their Social Justice ways will win the day only to either win the day(which wouldn't be any good) or get themselves all slaughtered, leaving Harry horrified his friends are dead because of their own political agendas.

This does not mean I agree with Men's Rights Activists or the average conservative asshole. What it means is that I had an idea and it amused me momentarily because I can see every side of an issue even if I have my own viewpoints that are wildly different.

So it's more psychopath vs indoctrinated.

They'll probably need it.

**** The firestorm of mad that would generate, even in a remote corner of the Internet would be horrific. Too bad to even find entertaining.

**** Mostly i was pissed at some woman for saying i couldn't say trump was ractist because i'm a white male but in fact, the story idea is actually fairly amusing of an idea if you try not to preach and just go for the comedic aspects of... i guess reverse racism and reverse sexism?

it would play on the people who use the issue of social justice to then reverse the problem and be the new oppressors.

But sadly ot also falls into the who men rights mindset.

I really should have just had a few drinks and gone to bed or played xbox instead of letting some racist and sexist woman bait me.
