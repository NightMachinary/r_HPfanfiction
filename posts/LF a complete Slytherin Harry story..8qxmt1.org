Romance is a must, and i would like that to be the main change to the AU. So, like no wrong boy who lived or time travel, etc. Just one where in first year he was sorted into Slytherin.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): trope heavy, but nevertheless very entertaining curb stomp fic.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

** The Becoming Alpha series maybe?

linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/6389117/1/]])

Wasn't sure if you cared about parings or not.

It's has three fanfics which go through all seven years.

Edit: Wait, you wanted romance to be the main change, or the Slytherin part to be the main change? If so let me know, I may have a different one without a Ginny pairing.

**** I'm not sure, Dumbledore and Ron are antagonistic to Harry for, in Ron's case until 4th year, and Dumbledore is being his Manipulative self that people seem to always portray him as for most of the story, but I don't really remember if it was that bashy. Plus Dumbledore is kinda worried about Harry being in Slytherin and another possible spoilery reason.
