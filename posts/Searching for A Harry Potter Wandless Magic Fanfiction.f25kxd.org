:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In an attempt to find this fic I've been searching both Google and my own Library extensively. At this point, any help would be appreciated.

- Harry learns magic slowly in his room at the Dursley's.
- He has the initial success with the summoning and banishing charms.
- This turns into a form of telekinesis which is shown later to look like hands floating around him allowing him to grab and manipulate objects.
- On multiple occasions, he goes out to fight death eaters without any adults knowledge.
- I believe it is revealed in a courtroom that he uses wandless magic this way.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

*** Yes the invisible hands beeing shown in a courtroom is from a black comedy :)

**** Yeah, I think that's it. I've been looking some more and I think I'm thinking of 2 different fics at the same time.\\
Ouch.

Edit: Guess I'll need to re-read A Black Comedy. Thanks.
