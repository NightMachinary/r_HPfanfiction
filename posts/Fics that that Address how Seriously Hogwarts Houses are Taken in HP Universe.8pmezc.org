It started to bug me as I got older reading the books. Adults are pushing children to stick to their own house, judge other students, etc based on what a talking hat says. And this carries into adulthood! How many adult characters do we meet where which house they were in isn't mentioned? Not to mention several characters, adult and child, talk about the immense pressure to fit into the 'right' house their family belong to. Hell, over a decade after the 2nd wizarding war of the century Harry Potter's own freaking kid is afraid of being sorted in with the bad slytherins.

And how is it a good idea to separate the purevboods raised with prejudice and extreme ideologies and group them together to self validate each other? And how ambition and cunning are cast as undesirable traits?

Old, I'm probably exaggerating and misremembering some buts but it does bug me and I want a fic that at least discusses it.


** The point and House system is essentially a way of psychologically conditioning the student population of Hogwarts to:

1. Obey the rules, you are rewarded. Break the rules, you lose points, this hurts your house.
2. Do well in class, learn magic, act the way the teacher wants/expects during class, you gain points.
3. Compel students to excel in academic and extracurricular activies (i.e. quidditch, possibly other clubs and organizations) without asking them.
4. Encourage the other members of each house to ostracize anyone who costs them in these activities, hurts their house's image, or loses points for whatever reason. This requires less participation on the teachers part and compels the students as they grow to behave in the way they /think/ everyone else in their house should. This is why so many of them end up gravitating towards each house stereotype.

The gist of this is that the system is much like the modern public school model, i.e. go to class for an hour, bell rings, rotate position, repeat. In the 19th century, this was designed to create factory workers. Hogwarts system is designed to compel good behavior and academic excelling. It has a specific purpose beyond the pale.

Additionally, the point system allows the teachers to manage a student body that outnumbers them more than 50 to 1. They can't give out detention for every transgression, their aren't enough teachers, and corporal punishment is no longer tolerated at Hogwarts since the 1950s.

The system is designed to create obedient citizens, where the population naturally seeks to not appear different from their social group (i.e. Houses) and for the students to discipline one another to compel obedience. They naturally carry these tendencies into the greater world once they leave school.

But that makes sense. Hogwarts was founded before the Ministry, before any form of magical government really. There effectively were no real laws on magicals, with the declarations of kings and feudal lords being irrelevant to even low-skilled wizards/witches. This system /indoctrinates/ graduates into being upstanding citizens and trying to appear normal: if someone commits a crime, the rest of the magical world in Britain will ostracize them and treat them as pariahs. Its rather Orwellian in its nature actually.

*** Additionally, more to the author's point I would like to throw out the fic Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity linkffn(3979062).

Its a good look at how the house issues didn't necessarily disappear overnight once the heroes re-enacted St. Patricks purge of snakes from Ireland (heh heh).

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** I liked how linkffn(Wit of the Raven) dealt with this. Had some policies that organically encouraged students to interact with their peers from other houses.

  Highly AU. Mr. Harry Potter is age eleven, and the possibilities for his future are endless. The magic system of Harry Potter has essentially been turned on its head.

** I like to think that most older students realize that House divisions stop mattering as they get older. They also realize how useless House Points are, but they understand they need to respect it to let the adults have their handle on the student population. Respecting the little rules so they can break the big ones when they need to.

Us vs them is one of the most common ways humans divide themselves, be it over nationality, race, religion, favourite football club, whether or not you like Snape and Malfoy or any other triviality.

#+begin_quote
  to separate the purevboods
#+end_quote

I think this is mostly the result of the other students, especially Muggleborns, hoping to get good at magic or have a good time at the school they will visit for the next 7 years and not having the ambition to be the leader of a government they have only read about if they have even heard of it in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  And how ambition and cunning are cast as undesirable traits?
#+end_quote

Well, the ambition to purge a race isn't really desirable.

** One point to mention is that adults don't really seem to give a shit about the houses. Like maybe they'll mention them to the kids, but it's not like Arthur at work goes "ugh, Shannon in accounting is such a Ravenclaw."

Hagrid makes a reference about Slytherin being bad in book one, but beyond that, the adults recognize it as a silly thing for children. Maybe has some nostalgia attached to it, but that's all
