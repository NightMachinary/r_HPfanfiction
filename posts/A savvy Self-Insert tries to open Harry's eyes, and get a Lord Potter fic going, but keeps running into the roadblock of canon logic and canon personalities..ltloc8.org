******* Mine is that Ron's reaction was the most common, he was obsessed with Romilda for a bit, but that was more humiliating rather than any form of mind-control, he was in control of his actions even while focusing on Romilda and it was extremely obvious to anyone who even bothered to give him the most superficial of looks even if they didn't know him at all, kind of like being very drunk, but not quite blackout levels, you will have decision-making problems but not to the point of trying to rob a bank and those around you will probably not allow you to take any lasting compromise even while laughing at you, and even if you /did/ manage to somehow contract an unwanted responsibility while under it that responsibility would either be considered illegal and thus void (marriage for example), be grounds for *BIG* economic compensations or of exclusive responsibility of the one who gave the person the potion (so manipulative(/coughidiotcough/)!Dumbledore would end up being the one required to provide and care for Harry and Ginny's children on that kind of story without any of them having the slightest chance of accessing Harry's legendary vault of awesomeness and Gold enough to fill up an ocean).

********* Thus the bit about monetary compensations heavy enough that no one would be crazy enough to even try it. I was thinking something along the lines of being completely unable to afford even the barest necessities for the next oh, 20 generations as an example.

Plus we are never really shown what is the true limit of those kinds of contracts. Yes the vow could kill the person who breaks it and the goblet supposedly had some vague but assuredly menacing effects, plus Hermione's DA sheet scarred Edgecomb, but none of them actually /forced/ the person to fulfill them, only caused consequences in case they broke the agreement, Marietta could possibly have been healed later, the goblet was vague to the extreme and the oath seems to take some degree of coherent thought to be agreed upon, it's perfectly possible that the contract can be broken or survived if given enough time and assistance.

Alternatively the ministry could instead force the potion user to take another oath -if those really /have/ to be fulfilled- that turns the first one petty much null. Like, person 1 agrees to give however much money person 2 asks whenever they ask while under the potion, person 2 is then forced by the ministry to take a oath to give back all money person 1 gives them with interest whenever it is solicited, or even just never ask person 1 for money whatsoever.

... I thought I had been clear that my HC is that the potion is unable to actually mind-control someone, only creates a humiliating infatuation and makes the behavior extremely obvious, like, talking over the person to declaim poems of undying love instead of obeying them and not even getting close to sex cause the person would just randomly grab their hand and drag them through the door. The bit about legal repercussions was more of a /okay, that really isn't going to happen even in a million years ‚Äòcause the potion just doesn't work that way, but if it *does/ happen through some unknowable method, well here it is*.

Plus the whole nobility thing is actually just fandom, in cannon we have no reason to believe that nobility would still have any actual power above normal citizens, even Voldemort only tackled on a Lord on his name because of the anagram, Lucius himself was never called a lord for example, he was just rich enough to bribe Fudge.

***** Would have to see specifically how it is in England, but as far as I know there is no money and properties owned by a /house/, they are owned by the members of the family and each one can do whatever they want with their parts. Inheritance would work by both the decision of each person as set on their last Will and Testament if they had made one and the laws of the specific country, mostly the Will would have priority, but certain laws need to be followed depending of the country, F Ex.: in my home country neither the partner nor the children (regardless of being born in or out the wedlock) can be completely cut from the inheritance unless it is in a specific case, such as the children or partner killing the parent, so even if the testament says outright that one of them is not to inherit a part of the spoils (1/2 if I am not mistaken) will still be set aside to be divided by them.

Plus in most countries convicted criminals can still inherit even if they are serving a life-sentence, they just won't have anything to /use/ their inheritance for. If I am not mistaken there is /some/ legal proceeding to be adopted to pass some of their proprieties to their family members to administer, also some set payments to children or spouses though the convicted would have to be consulted about it. Other than that everything the person own is still theirs.

****** The way I understand it, in BMN Families, when the family is established, a central vault is established for the express purpose of maintaining the entire family and the lordship status. Then, each individual gets a personal vault, just like a personal debit card. When a new child is born, they get a trust vault for school and to kickstart their lives when they come of age. When any of the family dies without a designated heir, their assets are folded back into the Family Vault and their Personal Vault is closed.

Property Ownership can be attached to any Vault, such that the deed to Potter Castle or whatever is in the Potter Vault, not James' Personal Vault. A Family Vault would be nearly impossible to break into. A Key, a specific Goblin Fingerscrape Signature, a verbal password, a blood ward keyed to the family, the magical signature of the Lord's or Heir's Ring, a dragon, being down in the deepest part of the Bank, all kinds of wards and curses and traps and stuff. Meanwhile, a personal vault has much less valuable stuff in it, so it's got way fewer protections.

Now, if you say "But Vault 713 didn't have any of that, and it's got arguably the most important object in the world in it." That's because the Goblins either had no idea what they were guarding, or they knew what it was supposed to be and it was a ruse on Flamel's part, so they didn't care about the single ruby in the vault, or it was the real thing and they just couldn't tell. Then you'll say "But what about Hagrid saying 'It's about You-Know-What in Vault You-Know-Which', that was probably just a code phrase or something that Dumbledore set up. Or maybe Flamel did, told Dumbledore that keyphrase, and then told the Goblins to give the person who used it a single ruby from such-and-such vault. I mean, people knew he had the thing practically from right when he made it, and he's super old. If he can't protect the thing, then I don't see how the five-hundred-year younger Dumbledore is going to.

And on the matter of its creation, I think he either did it on accident or he was an Idiot Savant. Like, other Alchemists used it as a euphemism about doing impossible things, like "Let me go whip up a Philosopher's Stone real quick first." or something. Flamel didn't get the sarcasm, thought it was something so laughably easy nobody talked about how it was done, did it on his own to prove he wasn't a worthless Alchemist, told a friend in the community, and instantly went celebrity levels of famous.

Its absolutely massive, and even gets (slightly) into international politics in the magical world. You could PM me if you want some more of my thoughts.

********* Also reading ‚Äúthe international Triwizard tournament‚Äù it is great, I can barely wait for the next chapter with the so waited showdown, and they most certainly managed to strike the perfect balance between the screen-time given to political/economic plot-lines and magical-growth. Though it /did/ bother me who died last chapter, but at least it wasn't just for the shock-value, I can see where it was coming from both in and out of story.

******* Exactly, he was disowned by the family but the family property is entailed on the eldest child - assuming that magical societies are less sexist than muggles and don't specify eldest male heirs.

Of course, that doesn't explain how Sirius was able to leave Grimmauld Place to Harry, instead of it going to the next available heir, who is either Andromeda (if unsexist) or Draco.

So, as I see it, either the entail has run its course - this assumes that magical and muggle law has rules against perpetual trusts OR there was some sort of adoption of Harry by Sirius.

"How can a stupid person can manipulate others?"

"You must make friends with Daphne Greengrass to find out Dumbledore's evil plan"

"Daphne who? Is she a powerful with like Professor Dumbledore ?" He was still new to the magical world, so he doesn't know much about famous figures. She must be a very strong and old like Dumbledore, right?

"She is the ice queen of Slytherin and most beautiful witch in Hogwarts. Same year as you."

"Hat? How can a 12 year old outwit international politician like Dumbledore."

"You're not understanding it Harry. She is heires to most ancient and noble house of...."

"We're here finally" said Harry interrupting the OC conspiracy theories.

"Why infirmary?" OC asked in confusion.

"Madam Pomfrey!" Harry called resident nurse ignoring the Oc.

"What is it now, Mr. Potter"

"It's about him." Answered Harry pointing his finger at OC. "Looks like he inhaled something foul in potions class. He is spouting nonsense like Prof Dumbledore I'd stealing my money, Hermione is betraying my secrets to Dumbledore for books, and wants me to marry multiple girls so I can be safe from Professors manipulations...etc."

"OH God. This is the fourth case this week."

"Fourth?"

"Yes, Mr.Potter. Severus testing a new mind enhancing potion in his lab. I told him to keep his experiments away from school. But he wouldn't listen. Don't worry h"

*** Snape POV

"It works! It works! My twenty-fifth brand new potion! I'm breaking records!" I crowed while gazing down at the shimmering perfection of beauty I had just remade for the twelfth time.

Third Person POV

Harry just so happened to be walking past Snape's Office while heading to prank his classroom and overheard the shout of joy. "Oh, shit. They really are manipulating me."

Just an idea based on what if it already worked, and it worked so well everyone could see through all the spiderwebs of manipulations and crimes going on in the British Wizarding World.
