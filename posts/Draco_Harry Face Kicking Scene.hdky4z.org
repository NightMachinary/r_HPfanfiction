I'm looking for a Draco/Harry fic that contains Draco kicking Harry in the face. It doesn't have to be exactly like cannon (book six). Basically a enemies-to-friends-to-lovers fic between them. I was listening to Draco and the Malfoy's “In Which I Kicked Harry Potter In the Face” and I realized I never read a book that contained that scene between them and well, I need to rectify that ASAP. If you know of a book like this THANKS! I prefer AO3 but fanfiction is doable, and I really rather have it completed as I hate unfinished endings but if you have a good one that isn't finished you can let me know anyway. Again! Thank you!
