Over the past few weeks, I've reread a lot of my favorite fanfic stories and most of them were powerful Harry of some sort, light or dark. And that's just how most of them were, I've had enough of the overpowered characters and fighting Voldemort/Other Dark Lords... I'm hoping to find some cute romantic pairings with some really good tearjerkers, but they don't have to be a sad story or a story with a sad ending.

I've primarily looked into Harry/Ginny pairings, in the post-war period, but I'm open to recommendations for a good romantic story during the wartime and of any pairings as long as they aren't slash romances or super out there romances with like Mcgonnagall and Harry or something like that. Also, just because it can be a tearjerker, doesn't mean it can't be a happy-go-lucky story as well, I just want some recommendations where it wrenches my heart or brings tears to my eyes. I didn't mention it in the title, but the one trope that I can't take are the stupid "soul-bond" relationships where the couple dies for trivial matters.

Lastly, I like a good ending, so I'd like some stories that are completed.

tl;dr - good romance or at least a good romance subplot, has some sort of tearjerker/heart-wrencher, completed, no slash, no soul-bond, prefer more "reasonable" pairings (craziest i'll go is Harry/Bella)

**** These are some old-school fics, written before DH or even HBP were published, so dont be surprised when Ron doesnt seem to be a blithering idiot

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20080604172401/http://www.simonsflower.net/index/just.htm]] Written by one of the first few authors of trio-fics and a co-founder of the new-defunct The Qudditch Pitch, she unfortunately passed away in 2009 and this is an archive of her fics

Canon-compliant, surprisingly and a fic of normally good people making bad decisions and hurting someone when it is all found out

A Partial archive of Triofic.com, where Ao3 managed to capture some of the fics before the site went down.

***** Oh wow thanks so much! But yea, I started reading fanfics way before GoF was even written. It's surprising that there are stories from like 2010 because All I've ever really read were the early written stories cause those are the most likely to be completed. I've found that most stories 2011+ have yet to be finished.

  Did you ever wonder what happened in the 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue of Deathly Hallows? Or what happens afterward? Totally, completely, and eventually H/Hr, but we have a long road to get there! Rated T for language & sexuality.
