Tessa Crowley is writing some of the best Harry/Draco fic out there at the moment, in my opinion, and I was following her "Quantum Flux" story, a follow up to [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1521479?view_full_work=true]["Chaos Theory"]]. I wanted to catch up with Quantum Flux, but it's been pulled from AO3 and FFN.

Does anyone know why? I fished around on her Tumblr but didn't find anything. Rather crushed to be honest!


** You should probably just send her a polite 'ask' on Tumblr. That way, you'll get the most accurate answer. I had no idea she even started a follow-up to Chaos Theory!
