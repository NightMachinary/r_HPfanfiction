** Lucius was preoccupied with Death Eater business and Narcissa was an incredibly reserved parent (likely due to her own upbringing), so after Draco was born Dobby was his primary caretaker. Dobby would feed him, change him, play with him, and tell him stories before bed. So instead of Daddy or Mommy being his first word it was Dobby because that's who he was around the most.

Luckily the first time it happened Narcissa heard it and she forbid Dobby spending any time with Draco beyond feeding and changing him. She started spending more time with him and whispering Father in Draco's ear when Lucius was around, and showing Draco his picture often. Soon enough Draco learned to say Father instead and he forgot about how much Dobby did for him when he was young.

*** “My father will hear about his,” 6 year old Draco Malfoy mumbled as he stared, wide-eyed, into the blinding overhead lights from his spot, strapped to his bed by leather restraints.

“My father will hear about his,” he muttered again, slightly less coherent.

“Good boy, Draco,” Narcissa cooed. “Your father will be most pleased.”

“My father will hear about this,” was all he replied with.

*** ... you said this and in my mind I immediately envisioned...

“Great Harry Potter Sir! Will you possibly h-help Dobby, Harry Potter Sir?” Dobby stuttered with six hats stuff onto his head and wearing a sparkly tutu from that of a muggle child.

“Of course Dobby.” Harry would have been more gracious, if Dobby could have waited until an appropriate hour to call on his assistance, but no, apparently three forty nine am was perfectly appropriate.

“Oh wonder! Oh Great Harry Potter Sir! Dobby is most grateful!” With a swift snap of his fingers a large, pointy, weight fell onto Harry's Queen sized bed, making him shout in alarm as the body - body?! - began to struggle. “Poor Dobby tried to help Old Young Master Draco but, but, Old Young Master Draco wanted no help!” Dobby suddenly wailed.

“You kidnapped Malfoy?!” Sure enough, after yanking the cord for the lamp, the dim glow revealed a very pointy, /very/ prickly, Malfoy who was bound in soft looking scarves with a hat shoved into his mouth and tied over with /another/ scarf. Harry was quick to shove Malfoy to the floor. He was pointy. And a jerk.

“Dobby figures no one could protect poor Old Young Master Draco like The Great Harry Potter!” Dobby cried large tears leaking from his eyes.

“Well, I suppose we could use a Dark Arts expert if were fighting Voldemort.” Harry sighed shaking his head, “Ron is going to be /so/ pleased.” Malfoy made an alarmed muffled sound from the floor. “Don't worry Malfoy. Instead of crucio I prefer a different form of torture. I'll let ‘Mione lecture you until you stop being a dick. Maybe even Mrs. Weasley can bend you over her knee. I'm sure you've never been disciplined.” Harry chuckled. Malfoy yelled louder through his gag. “Put him in Buckbeak's old room,” Harry snickered, “I need a bit of sleep before we head off. Make sure nobody finds him. I want to see the look on Ron's face.”

“Yes, Master Harry Potter Sir! Dobby thanks you!” With a pop they were gone.
