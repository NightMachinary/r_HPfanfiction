***** I'm actually part way through, about 25gb in to it. It's actually way larger than I expected, which is why it's taking me so long, since my download speeds are measured in kB.

** I'm going to have to go looking through HPFF sometime this weekend to try to recall old favorites, since I haven't used the site in a while. But some I liked:

[[https://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=313068][Run]] - Probably my favorite story I've read from the site and one of my favorite HP fics; an adventure afterlife fic post-DH.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=270265][Legend]] - Founders backstory.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=323003][Growth]] - Short oneshot focusing on Merope's pregnancy.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=233193][Hey, Fred]] - Oneshot focusing on George's grief.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]] - Adventure/Friendship fic with Hugo Weasley, Scorpius Malfoy, and Neville Longbottom.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245455][When Luna Met Rolf]] - Post-Hogwarts romance between Luna and Rolf Scamander.

** Aw, this makes me sad. I got my start as a writer putting stuff up on HPFF. I can't specifically remember anything I loved back then, but now I know I'm going to take a minute to try to log in to my old account and salvage what I can.

*** This is their farewell message.

Dear HPFF community: This is a news post I hoped I would never have to make. After 17 years since launching HPFF, we will unfortunately be shutting down our services on April 28th, 2018. We have not been able to raise funding to cover our costs, so the decision has been taken to close down.

This is not a happy moment for us, but please know we did everything we could to keep HPFF a thriving community for users to safely read and write HP stories from all over the world. We are glad that we have always had a great and supportive community that shared our love for Harry Potter, and hope you have enjoyed reading, and writing stories about a young wizard and his friends.

I hope you all keep reading, writing, and enjoying the world of Harry Potter. I know the spirit of HPFF will live on through you all.

With regards, Jay and the team at HarryPotterFanfiction.com on 2018.03.26 - 01:40PM

** [[https://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=141947][Gryffin_Duck]] is a great writer with an Albus Potter series that rings true to canon. They've slowed down on the 7th book, the first six are quite good. I especially like Harry's characterization, very much what I expect an adult Harry to be like.

*** Less than you think. I've been working on archiving some of the HPFF United works using the Wayback Machine Chrome Addon. It is time consuming, so I'm hoping someone can get the archive and upload it elsewhere.
