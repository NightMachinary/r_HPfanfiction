#+begin_quote
  The summer after his godfather's death was the worse in Harry's life for many reasons. An event so horrifying takes place causing him to question if he should even go on, but in the end all it takes is Faith to pull through and find the good in the dark. Based on 'The Unknown Light' by Someryn with her permission. This is about rape and the aftermath. No slash. Ginny is not raped.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

** Linkffn(The Aftermath by Colt01) is mostly deathly hallows where Hermione leaves with Ron during the hunt. The last quarter of the fic or so is head boy Harry taking care of Teddy. There are probably things that fit what you're looking for much better, but in case you're desperate I thought I'd share.

  What if Hermione had accidently Disapparated along with Ron during the hunt while trying to stop him? How would Harry have managed to defeat Voldemort alone? Watch as Harry takes a bold step forward with determination and new allies. This is canon compliant until the scene where Harry and Ron fight in Book 7. Two shot -- COMPLETE

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** is there one where harry transfiggered himself every night to have sex with hedwig? that one was surprisingly beautiful. i always hoped the author would do more other chapters where ron turns into a rat to be with his rat snickers, and mcgondol would be a cat to be with Filcher's cat Mrs. Noress.
