  Harry has an idea of how to break the rules of Transfiguration, and it actually might work. Maybe. Plenty of other things happen too. No slash and no pairings as yet.

*** Is it? I don't think canon says anything about that. Leprechauns can generate gold coins, though they don't last very long.

Obviously, for society to function, you need currency that's hard to duplicate. But that doesn't have to be because gold is impossible to duplicate. It could be something like: valid coins have a goblin spell on them, and it's easy to bespell a till or a coin purse to verify the spell is on the coin. Or it takes a lot of effort to create a coin, so they function as a proof of work, similar to bitcoin.
