Sort of a request/discussion.

Has anyone ever seen either a crossover between the Kingkiller Chronicles and Harry Potter or a fic that takes inspiration from KKC? Would anyone read one?

Sort of building off of [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/noaw0n/any_good_hp_fic_where_the_mcsioc_explores_the/][this post]], I was thinking an OC that took heavily after Kvothe could be quite interesting if stuck in the Harry Potter universe. It would probably mean an AU that resembles a high fantasy novel more than HP normally does, but I think there's a lot of potential.


** Not seen but would 100% read one. There's not enough KKC fic out there! I think the biggest question would be how heavily you fix the setting in HP canon- the magic is so different, I don't know how easy it would be to get wand waving past Kvothe... Unless it were just straight crack fic, in which case still 100% on board. Could you imagine Peeves following Snape around singing Jackass, Jackass on a loop?

*** Yeah, magic would definitely be difficult. I was imagining taking from KKC and making magic in this AU work based on a combination of willpower (so sort of similar to Alar) and an understanding of magical theory. For most wanded subjects I could see this being reasonable within the HP-universe, obviously potions/herbology/astronomy/etc have their own shticks. The biggest thing would be naming---I can think of nothing really analagous that I could pull from in HP, but it seems like too big of a deal to just leave it out.

** I would read one that set Deanna on fire.
