  Turns out, being Master of Death has some unexpected side effects.

*** Very few things ever get that one right. Modern media has never really seemed too keen on Thanatos. Everyone just shrugs and gives the title to Hades, since he's God of Where The Dead Live and all. :)

Thor isn't a storm god either. /shrugs/

**** But Hades is kinda a pushover (ok so maybe he is one of the few nice ppl in a pantheon of assholes) and his subordinate Thanator is pretty busy as it is, flying to and back with souls, so why don't he just talk with this nice boy for him, that's no problem at all, he was about to take Spot for a walk anyway...

***** Omg now just imagine what if such redelegating happened and Harry ended up talking with Persephone (who ofc would help her hubby, /go dear, Spot is so happy to spend some time with you/) , Hels' second half-brother (the one that wasn't eaten), and that weird crocodyle-hippo-dog that mostly growls and wants to eat Voldemorts' heart /NO down boy BAD DOGGO/

******* Tbh it's part lion not part dog but Harry was never very good with all that magizoology details and also it's better for his sanity to think of her as a dog.

He can deal with dogs.

(it's written Ammit or Ammut so you weren't that far off)

****** Well idk about this pjo but there are versions of myth and I choose to follow the one with more badass Kore who choose

(Also wife napping in ancient greece was a bit different than kidnappings now so... No ones gonna sic Centaur Police on Hades *shrugs* Plus affairs of men don't match fates of gods and so on)

**** Honestly the only notable Hades I can think of is in Skin Game. Nice guy though. Had a dog.

Haven't gotten around to Percy Jackson, I kinda assume he'll make an appearance.

***** There are lots out there. I guess notable depends on your generation and interests. :)

He's in Disney's Hercules, Xena Warrior Princess, Hadestown, God of War, etc. A semi-significant portion of my childhood, pre-tween.
