Hey Guys

​

Once more i am looking for some new Fanfics.

This time i am looking for fanfictions that further build on the premise of monsters and evil beings in world of harry potter. The Books and Movies already established that thinks like giants, werewolves and vampires do exist but even more important in my opinion is that the concept of WRAITHS and classic monsters like the CERBERUS do exist.

So if these kinds of beings exist, what about other even worse things? We have legends of demons, the summer and winter fairy courts, Jormungandr, the ice and fire giants, hydras,... endless possibilities on other sometimes WAY WORSE thinks than Voldemort and some deathmunchers....

WHO makes sure that the non magical world doesnt know of these things? who kills the rouge demons and makes sure that legendary beasts like jormungandr and the Wendigo stay asleep? who makes sure that the fairy courts are happy and dont mess with the magical and non-magical populace?

​

i would ask you guys to name some Fanfics where harry (alone or with friends) deals with some of these being. Doesnt matter if it is a crossover Fanfic or not. considering that this thematic is mostly ignored in the classic universe, an AU Fic would be apreciated.

​

here are some of the fics that to a certain degree fulfill what i would like to see

​

linkffn( *Inquisitor Carrow and the Phoenix Fiasco* ) - Carrow (Harry) and his "Inquisition" deal with demons/Chaos Spawns

​

linkffn( *The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries* ) - Harry and Albus killed a demon and now try to reach the elves in *Álfheimr* and on the journey visit places like the location of Osiris, the journy of ra and *Svartálfaheimr* and fight with dwarves and drow against mind flayers.

​

I know that such fanfics will not really have anything to do with the potterverse that we all know and love but that is nor really the point of this request....

​

Have a good one guys !!

​

Edit:

Btw. extra points if harry doesnt only use magical means to deal with the problems, for one we have swords and other medieval weapons that have proven to be effective (see basilisk in the chamber) as well as never weapons, explosives and other shenanigans that i am sure could help in getting to, wounding, killing, counteracting or just containing different kinds of monster and beings


** Linkffn(Lightning Dragon'd Roar) Is a crossover fic, basically he gets on the Internet, reads the Fairy Tail manga and decides to become the lightning dragon slayer, there is also a Devil May Cry plot line.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, Real Magic, & The TWT in a way you have never seen.
