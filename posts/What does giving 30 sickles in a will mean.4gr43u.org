I've seen it in a few fanfictions where 30 sickles is left for someone in a will but all I can understand is that it is an insult of some kind. I've tried googling for further information but I haven't been able to find anything. Is this a Harry Potter thing or something in the real world as well? Thanks in advance.


** Judas was paid [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_pieces_of_silver][thirty pieces of silver]] to betray Jesus and lead the Jewish leadership to seize him. Whenever someone talks about giving another 30 pieces of silver, they're accusing the person of betrayal for personal gain.

*** It always amazes me at what people do and don't know. This isn't meant to be condescending. It makes me realize my upbringing is both universal and unique.

I had just always assumed everyone knew that.

You explained it well and concisely. Thanks.

**** I mean this is about christianity, a quick google search said only 31.50% of the world is christian. There may be non-christians that know this and christians that don't know this. I personally never studied bible nor christianity and had no idea what 30 sickles represented.

To clarify i never took your post as an insult and i was not giving an excuse. I just wanted to explain the size of it. For example a few weeks ago i saw a post about what i ate recently and i tried to find english names of what i ate 2-3 priors to that day. Out of like 15-20 meals none had one. I could send you pics of every food i ate this week and you may not recognize none of them, and anyone in my country can identify every single one of them.

***** I think it's also about making the connection. I knew Judas had been paid 30 pieces of silver, but because I don't tend to link HP and religion, especially not Christianity, I didn't realise the implication. (Also I've never actually seen it used in fic; didn't know it was a thing until this post.)

***** The thirty coins of silver thing is also in (or is referenced in) pop culture semi-often, which is how I learned about it as a kid.

That helps spread it around too.
