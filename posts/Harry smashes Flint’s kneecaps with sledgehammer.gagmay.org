:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I must've read this fic years ago. I remember Harry was in Slytherin and there was alot of house politics drama. So basically, in Slytherin house, you were able to challenge someone to a duel if you felt they had wronged you. So I think Draco was Harry's best friend, but some other Slytherin (Flint?) beat him up to get at Harry. Harry decides to challenge Flint to a duel. In the common room there is a convenient dueling pit since I guess these types of things were common enough..

I remember Harry just turned into full-blown psychopath and transfigured(?) a sledgehammer and smashed Flint's kneecaps. Basically almost killed the guy. The dueling pit is also some big slytherin secret (i.e first rule about the dueling pit is that you don't talk about the dueling pit). So even though harry almost killed a student, he couldnt be expelled bc that would ruin the secret.

So yea, it was definitely one of those trope-y guilty pleasure stories..

****** Not sure what Reddit wants for linking, so no can do. The story is on fanfiction .net though. Easy to find.
