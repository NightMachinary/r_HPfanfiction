A story where the Dursleys raise Harry well, and like their very own but they hide the truth about the wizarding world from him. Because Petunia blames magic and the wizarding world for driving her little sister away and then getting her killed.

So when the Hogwarts letter arrives, like in canon, they run until Hagrid tracks them down. But Petunia stands between Harry and Hagrid and refuses to let her boy go (see title).

Minor possible plot points: Harry is told that his parents died in a car crash (not that they were drunk) and his scar is a remnant, his accidental magic is hand waved away unless it harms people in which case he's grounded, Harry sleeps in the smallest bedroom, Dudley is still a bit of a bully though he doesn't target Harry etc.


** Damn I love this idea. I like helpful dursleys in general, especially if they're still misguided.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

** linkffn(10937871) has something along those lines, for slightly different initial reasons

There's another fic I read a few years back, can't quite remember what it was, also with a similar progression, except that their underlying reason for hating magic and wizards was that the Dudley's baby sister was killed when some DE went on a murder-spree in a shopping center the summer before that Halloween, and their subsequent interaction with the Ministry cleanup squad.

More canonical linkffn(8823783) has fantastic Petunia's line “Magic destroys everything it touches.” is just so well delivered, that I was almost willing to believe her. I guess, there may be part of that canonical: whenever Petunia met magic, it always ended up in catastrophe; or at least that's the way she could see it. Lost sister (twice: figuratively and literally), hurt son, destroyed room, danger of life. There must be some charm (in a muggle meaning of the word) that pushes people to their own destruction. After all, what we've learned in all fairy tales: “When magic looks to wonderful to be true, it usually is, and you will get hurt in the end.”
