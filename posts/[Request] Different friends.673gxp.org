** I think the classic different Harry was linkffn(5142565) and its one of the fics that will go down as having a lot of promise. Don't read if you don't like stupidly OP Harry or complete only. If you want reasonably well written OCs for friends then this is probably the fic for you.

Oh, and of course I'm assuming you've read linkffn(5353809)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** In the Magical Relations series by evansentranced Harry is sorted into Slytherin, so his best friends are all the first year Slytherins plus Anthony Goldstein. Less important friendships (though still present) with Hermione and Neville and....Dudley Dursley. Very well-written series but only complete through first five books so far. Definitely worth a read even if you have ruled out Hermione. The relationship dynamics are very different given the readjustment of friendships, e.g., Harry's BFFs are Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Anthony. linkao3(331625)

  Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. AU.Harry and Dudley's first year at Hogwarts. Highlights include bullying, subversive tactics, new friends, and misplaced magical objects.

** Unfortunately, it's hard to find fic without Hermione sooner or later becoming Harry's friend. Well, at least the decent ones. I will try to go with those where she enters the picture later or plays a minor role. So I will bend rules a little.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329][On the Way to Greatness]] - Harry in Slytherin, mostly with non-Gryffindor friends. Neville, Hermione and Twins sort of join Harry's circle later on, though the story is not focused on them. Long hiatus.

[[http://tinyurl.com/jkc2qeu][Alexandra Potter]] - The first year of Girl-Who-Lived in heavily magical Hogwarts. It focuses on school life and author's variation on magic system. Only the first year complete, but theoretically there is a new version planned. Practically, it's by Taure so it probably won't be ever finished. Hermione is a rival/antagonist of the first year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358][What You Leave Behind]] - Year older Harry who puts more time in studying magic and looking for secrets of the school. Another canon-ish yet original take on magic. Hermione enters picture, later on, Cedric and Cho are Harry's initial friends. Long hiatus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - This fic is still starting up, but has strong (though slow) worldbuilding. It's about non-BWL Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindewald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Temporary (at least I hope so) hiatus. Hermione is here, but is in Slytherin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823][The Art of Self-Fashioning]] - Non-BWL Harry who specialises in transfiguration. I like some of things it does, don't like many others, but all in all, it's interesting read and update often. Neville is the only Gryffindor friend, though Ron and Hermione hang around later but they don't like Harry and Hary doesn't like them.

#+begin_quote
  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
