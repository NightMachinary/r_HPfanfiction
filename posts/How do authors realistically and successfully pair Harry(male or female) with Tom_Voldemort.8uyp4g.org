This is coming from someone who has never read a fic with this pairing. I'm never really comfortable pairing any of the trio with Voldemort and his death eaters, but this really takes the cake for me. Is time-travel the most used trope or is it something else? How is it usually done, and in what do the successful fics do to make the pairing convincing?


** I have never done it, but if I was going to...remember that just because a pairing /exists/ doesn't mean the relationship shown has to be a healthy or happy one. Anything I did with this pairing would get dark very quickly.

There's a lot of scope for obsession and control in this pairing. A LOT. Harry and Voldemort are canonically more tightly intertwined and more closely connected than any other wizards in history, they can see into each other's minds, they can (up to a point) influence each other's minds, they think about each other almost constantly.

Horcrux-possession (sort of like what happened with Ginny, do you remember how completely Tom-in-the-diary was able to own her?) would be an option.

*** There are quite a lot of Tom/Harry fics that focus on obsession and unhealthy relationships. Many fics explore how Tom emotionally manipulates Harry - it's often made very clear that the relationship is an unhealthy one, and the twisted nature of it appeals to a large portion of [[https://ffn.net][ffn.net]] readers, I think.

** linkffn(Again And Again) is a time travel fic which postulates that Tom Riddle was evil but human, and could be redeemed, but splitting his soul turned him into the crazed monster we know as Voldy. Harry repairs his soul and he turns back into Tom, who is horrified by the creature he'd become. also Harry is like 900 years old. Im still not sold on the pairing but I liked the fic overall.

EDIT: jesus, 300k words?? it was like 100k when i read it. i missed a lot apparently lol

*** Going to second this one - I really enjoyed it. It's well-written, has an interesting plot, and the author managed to make the pairing believable.

There's also another that I like that started out as a crack fic and is unrepentantly silly in a lot of ways, which is the only way it works. It's an ongoing fic where Harry and Tom are soulmates who always find each other (lame, but bear with me) throughout multiple reincarnations. Problem is, every time they run into each other, they recognize each other from their first lives as Harry and Tom and all their memories come flooding back. The fic starts when they're finally reincarnated as themselves again (however that works (who cares?)) on their 200th or so life. Cue crazy hijinks from two very old men in young bodies who have no more shits to give and can hardly take anything seriously anymore. I'll try to track down the link.

** As someone who has read waaaaay too much TMR/HP/LV, I was going to write a long write up, but time travel and horcruxes sum it up. All of the good fics are slow burn as there is no good other way to write it without total AU.

Tom Riddle and Voldemort are written as different characters, with the horcruxes taking away Voldemort's ability to love. Harry is written as someone who is sympathetic to this, and forms an odd friendship with Voldemort.

Time travel to Tom Riddle's era just before the Chamber is opened is done so Harry can befriend Tom and acknowledge he isn't Voldemort yet, and a bit of angst and Tom being convinced not to create a horcrux when he finally does open the Chamber cements his change.

The Diary and the Scar are the most used horcruxes. Diary fics normally aren't written to be healthy relationships, but in the rare occasion they are, it's by having Harry get the Diary instead of Ginny. The Scar is written by having Tom change from being exposed to Harry's soul and Harry understands this Tom is a different Tom than Voldemort, even if he did kill his parents. It works with a conversation where Tom's ideals switch from Voldemort's to Harry's, or a heartfelt apology.

And Voldemort pairings are done convincingly by having him reabsorb all his horcruxes (but Harry's, unless the plot demands it), and regains his sanity. He apologizes for his actions and works to fix them. If the author decided to keep Voldemort Voldemort, it's done by having Voldemort's obsession with Harry changed from wanting to kill him to wanting to dominate him, and that turning to lust.

Or Harry is a captive and is forced to be cordial until he realizes he actually does enjoy Voldemort's company, and is deeply conflicted in his emotions. Voldemort finds himself needing Harry (because horcruxes) and starts to change.

**** To follow-up on the other reply, we only see 11 year old Tom Riddle through Dumbledore's memories though and what Dumbledore has gathered. Ignoring the authorial intent that Dumbledore's interpretations of events are correct, it's possible to fan-wank that, say, Dumbledore was biased and although the young Tom Riddle was messed up and not a good person, he wasn't actually a psychopath and could have had a chance at redemption.

** This pairing is my otp. I would recommend reading one of the popular fics of this pairing just to understand it. Probably would be better to read a time travel one cause they tend to be more tame. Actually I recommend doing this for anything that you hate on cause it's cool to be informed. Ron is my favorite character and I generally love the weasleys, but I recently read a fic with weasley bashing and I kinda understood it. Didn't like it. Didn't change my views. But I understood.

*** I usually can't get past the first chapter. I mean, even at age 11 Tom was a sadistic psychopath and leaving him alive is just too much of a risk. Also, any time traveller should take care of Hitler first, since the second world war killed 55 Million in Europe and avoiding that is a lot more important than preventing some magical civil war that killed fewer people than the British Air Raid on Dresden.

** Yes, it is mostly time travel. It's usually "Harry goes back in time and joins Voldy cause Dumbledore was a manipulative git" or "future with Dumbledore is bad but future with Voldy might be better" or "Harry goes back to 1940 to save Tom Riddle cause Dumbledore took one look at him and deemed him lost"

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Shadowed Light) was the first HP/TMR fic I read. It is very well written. My current favorite is linkffn(Full Circle) , quite funny and entertaining this isn't really a HP/LV fic though since these two have been together for like 80 lifetimes

** HP/LV is my OTP, but honestly, most fics don't actually bother to make it especially realistic (not that it has to) and it depends a lot upon the reader's ability to buy into the pairing and accept the setup that, for example: Harry goes back in time and finds young Tom Riddle wasn't really that bad (or at least wasn't as irredeemable as Dumbledore thought); or he goes back in time and for Reasons (purebloods being right, Dumbledore-bashing, etc.) doesn't mind Tom Riddle murdering and torturing people; it was only the horcruxes that made Voldemort genocidally evil - the horcruxes get restored to him and he becomes sane and more moral; Harry is traumatized by war/the Dursleys/betrayal and is as a result more willing to compromise his morals or goes fully evil; Harry is raised differently and so is more morally compromised; or often Harry is straight-up another character with a completely different name and background but it's just understood that vampire!pureblood!Hadrian Peverell is really Harry (this last is weirdly common).

Actually, a major thing, too, is Voldemort being written as having some sort of ideals and goals that are more than just personal power and slaughtering muggles, muggleborns, and anyone who looks at him funny; so with a bit of worldbuilding about how whilst his current means are reprehensible, his goals are understandable, it gives authors a lot of leeway in terms of Harry and Voldemort coming to some sort of compromise on the means towards the ends. Obviously, all that has a lot of overlap with mentor!Voldemort or the sort of thing seen in indy!Harry, or the sorts of gen and het-fic with lots of pureblood culture and politics where it's just accepted that, sure, Harry would love a betrothal contract with Daphne Greengrass and readily accepts that muggleborns really are damaging the wizarding world.

Not to say that it's all completely OoC: in all the above scenarios, a greater or lesser amount of effort will be put in to stick to canon characterizations and do the work to make it convincing within the context of canon -- like in any ship (or scenario, really), at some point most fics just assume that the reader is willing to buy into the ship and are happy to accept some bending of canon and characterization for the sake of the story being told.

Also, yeah, as others have stated, sometimes serious fucked-up manipulation/Stockholm Syndrome/obsession is part of the arsenal used to make Harry accept the relationship and is even part of the appeal...

Well, this got a bit tl;dr, so For some fics that I think are successful at doing the work to make the pairing convincing:

  Post Deathly Hallows - Whilst Harry is a trainee auror, he accidentally gets trapped in an alternative universe where Dumbledore never fell out with Grindelwald and accepted the position of Minister for Magic. Action takes place in 1945. Harry befriends troubled shop assistant and aspiring Dark Lord, Tom Riddle, and they end up falling for each other as they try to stop Dumbledore and Grindelwald from uniting the Deathly Hallows. Hilarity ensues. **The title is not a misspelling! It's just a really bad pun...**A Russian translation can be found here!

  EWE. The war is over, but Voldemort isn't as dead as everyone believes. Harry returns to Hogwarts, expecting a normal school year, but a sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle has other ideas. It seems sometimes the line between good and evil is very blurry and fascination and hate can easily coexist. Features: powerful!Harry, Dark Arts, Slytherin schemes, and very twisted love.

** This is my favorite pairing, and I have read a ridiculous amount of it. As a result, I see tom ridde/voldemort as his fanon character, more than his canon character. And while the fanon one is based off the canon one, the fanon one is more flushed-out, human, and without a anti-slythern prejudice. I think part of the problem with people disliking this pairing is you can't jump head first into it. You have to ease into it. For example, the first fanfic that made me like voldemort as a character was The Darkness Within by Kurinoone. This is not a pairing fic and the Voldemort is still the bad guy to harry. However, voldemort raises harry in this fic, and you get to see voldemort's human moments where he shows affection to harry, albeit in small ways. From there, I slowly eased myself into fanfics that depict riddle more fanon and eventually slash. Now I am able to read the more out there HPLV and HPTR because I already understand Riddle's fanon character without needing extensive introductory chapters slowly easing me from canon Harry and canon voldemort into the fanon pairing, which can vary in quality based off of the author. And if your first fic is by an author who doesn't do a thorough job with this transition (and that doesnt necessarily mean its a bad fic. just not a good first fic. As a well read HPLV, i often find the transition uneccessary and boring)

***********************************

To answer your question specifically:

First of all, in the best fanfics, voldemort never says I love you. He cares about harry deeply and often times this shows if harry is wounded and voldemort cares for him at his bedside. but voldemort is not the i love you type. Same as riddle. They often show a more possessive, obsessive type of unhealthy love. This plays on canon voldemort's obsession with harry (though in an entirely different way). It also is in character seeing voldemort was born from a love potion made due to obsessive love

.........................................................................................................................................................

If it's tom riddle being paired with harry, it usually happens in one of two ways:

- horcrux (usually diary!Riddle) resurrecting himself through harry. He plans on killing harry like ginny in CoS, but discovers that harry's a horcrux. Riddle, being possessive, keeps harry around as a mere possession and perhaps younger mentee to toy with. Slowly falls in obsessive love

- Harry sent back in riddle's time. Riddle is immediately drawn to harry. Usually a combination of the horcrux in harry drawing out to riddle's magic and/or Harry being scared of riddle during riddle's youth before he has moved his scary reputation into the public eye. Harry catches riddle's interest, interest turns obsessive, obsessive turns into Riddle's version of love

................................................................................................

If its a harrymort (voldemort aka Dark Lord), common ways of addressing it are:-voldemort becomes sane through the reabsorption of horcruxes. i have seen multiple fanfics where harry is the initiater to this reabsorption, helping voldemort gain back his sanity

-voldemort discovers harry is a horcrux --> voldemort takes harry away from the light and dumbledore, where he is in danger of being killed for being a horcrux ---> voldemort is possessive (sometimes soul bond through literally being soul mates) ---> slowly lust turns to love. Sort of.

- dumbledore bashing as being manipulative. Voldemort is depicted so bad in canon because the light manipulated harry. Voldemort is the good guy. Harry runs away to him. These tend to be the fics with the more healthy type of love, and not the obsessive unhealthy.

-harry goes back in time after war, to fix things. this time he allies voldemort, due to noncanon postwar events that make the dark side a worthy alliance

- AU voldemort wins dystopia. Often, the low-class harry catches the great voldemort's notice.

** You have to rewrite the story from the ground up to the point where you could basically change on or both names and have them suddenly be unrecognizable because at that point it's a different character for all intents and purposes.

** Other commenters have explored the more common tropes (time travel, horcruxes, etc.) Another common trope is the 'pleasure feedback loop' where Harry and Voldemort get feel-good vibes from touching instead of pain.

Many authors are only comfortable with Harry/Voldemort pairings if Voldemort somehow regains his good looks/sanity in the story. However, a few of my favorite slash fics go the route of keeping Voldemort's more monstrous aspects. There's room for some fascinating interplay when the writer explores the twists and turns of Voldemort's warped psychopathic mind, tempered by the connection to Harry's empathetic conscience. In my opinion, the most successful fics tackle the concepts of trauma and mental growth, and some delve into the complex captive-captor interactions of Stockholm Syndrome.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8988616/1/In-Somno-Veritas][In Somno Veritas]] - Harry begins unintentionally sharing dreams with Voldemort in 6th year due to the horcrux connection. I love this fic because it explores how mentally scarring Voldemort's existence was as a wraith & barely alive homunculus before his resurrection. The original books (and most fics) gloss over that, but this one made me realize just how horrific that must have been. In my opinion, this fic is a realistic exploration of how Harry can slowly begin to empathize with his enemy (in spite of the terrible things he does) when he is forced to acknowledge that Tom Marvolo Riddle is more than just a monster. linkffn(8988616)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172646/1/Butterfly-Heart][Butterfly Heart]] - And now for something completely different! In this AU fic, Tom Marvollo Riddle plays a Hannibal-esque role. Harry is a young auror whose career has been made by his uncanny ability to interpret the crime scenes left by the serial killer 'Voldemort'. However, he is tormented by the fact that whenever he enters the crime scenes he experiences the murder from the killer's point of view. Voldemort's obsession with "the boy who lived" rises to a new level when Harry is forced into mandatory therapy sessions with renowned psychiatrist Tom Marvollo Riddle. linkffn(9172646)

** The best HP/LV or TM fics are either massively AU, dark or timetravel fics. There are some very good fanfictions where it is either an unhealthy relationship or entirely nonconsensual! There are some where Harry is dark (AU), where Voldemort is sane and kind of good (AU) or where the war as such never happened and you have the politician Tom Riddle. Sometimes Harry is not the BWL.

I can't quite remember the name of the story, but my favorite one where Harry was not the BWL. He was a genius and an unspeakable at 15 I think. Voldemort did exist, but not many knew about him. Tom Riddle i think was the undersecretary to the minister and very influential. It was really good and very AU.

Start off with him going to join old Voldemort, finding out what he's been up to and what he's like, and then rebelling. He and Harry become reluctant allies.

Then I introduce a redemption arc along with a slow reconciliation with Harry.

Once the reconciliation is more or less complete, circa 1995, I can start on their romantic relationship.
