How does this sub reddit feel about Sirius and Remus? I know that Remus and Tonks are together, but I feel like Ms. Rowling got it wrong. I feel like Sirius and Remus should have been a couple. Any thoughts?


** I'm pretty sure she got it right... because... you know... she wrote it.

Not really seeing why you think this needs discussing. If your OTP is Remus/Sirius, then read Remus/Sirius.

** I personally don't go for slash fics, but I don't mind if they are a side couple. I understand what you mean by Rowling got it wrong, while I personally love Harry and Ginny together, a lot of people still think it should have been Harry and Hermione. People love to get pissed about off canon stuff as long as you don't mention their personal ships. In my opinion, everyone is entitled to their own imaginings. I honestly never liked Tonks and Lupin together, I thought they were awesome characters by themselves but their whole romance seemed kind of odd. There is some stuff about Sirius and Lupin that doesn't quite work, but if someone finds a way to write it, good for them!

** Remus/Sirius is my OTP, but I can see how Remus and Tonks could work. I just don't choose to read any fanfictions where that couple is a central part of the plot. I'm an unabashed slasher, but Remus/Sirius is the only one I feel really strongly about. I won't read Remus or Sirius with any other guy in a slash fic, such as Snape. As for het, as I said, I can stand Remus/Tonks, but since Sirius was never with anyone in canon I refuse to read any Sirius romantic relationship unless it's with Remus.

I'm not sure how that can happen with people she made up.

** Personally, it's not my preference. If Remus is going to be in a relationship, I prefer it with Snape. Their personalities are outwardly so different, it makes for a great tension between the characters that can really lend to the plot.
