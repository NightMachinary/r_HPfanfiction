Just got my first flame review on my first published fanfic. And I quote:

#+begin_quote
  However, once you revealed yourself as a commie and/or supporter of perverts from LGBT movements, I knew that I had to quickly stop reading your fic.
#+end_quote

I'm somewhat at a loss to know what that's about, since I haven't mentioned LGBT issues for good or ill and I'm pretty sure unkind remarks about the tories, Brexit and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (not all in the same context, I'm not /that/ lunatic) don't qualify for being a red-under-the-bed, but whatever.


** Oh my gosh you've gotten the achievement. A trick I've learned is to copy and paste the flame into the end of your story in the A.N. And then respond civil to them there. Something like “for anyone with shared perspectives-“ and respond very nicely. Your other readers will tear them to shreds for you.

** Well, which fic of yours is that reviewer attacking? Maybe that person confuses yours with someone else's?

If I see this kind of offensive trolls, I will write back a scathing reply, delete the review, and block that person from further following me.

** They've committed the classic blunder!

In Politics, everyone left of me is filthy Communist, and everyone right of me is damned Nazi.

At least, that's how these discussions always seems to shake out.

*** Wait a second...given that the 'war communism' implemented in the USSR, and the fascism implemented by the Nazis, were both extremely authoritarian to the point of totalitarianism (that is to say, advocating complete control by the state), wouldn't that mean that if the Commies are on your left and the Nazis are on your right, that you yourself are way over to the far-right with the neo-Nazis?

**** Where I am, Communism is considered to be the extreme left of the spectrum, and Nazism the extreme right.

Whether that's academically accurate or not, I can't say.

But to answer you question, no - I'm not anywhere near agreeing with anything with 'Nazi' in it.

My other answer would be: Don't read too much into it - it was a joke about how political discussions turn out on the internet.

That's not the way it works.

Communists and Nazis are on opposite sides of the left / right political spectrum.

The political spectrum however isn't only made up of a left / right axis, there is also an upper and lower axis, which would be authoritarian / democratic.

***** *Political spectrum*

A political spectrum is a system to characterize and classify different political positions in relation to one another upon one or more geometric axes that represent independent political dimensions. The expressions political compass and political map are used to refer to the political spectrum as well, especially to popular two-dimensional models of it.Most long-standing spectra include the left--right dimension, which originally referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament after the Revolution (1789--1799), with radicals on the left and aristocrats on the right. While communism and socialism are usually regarded internationally as being on the left, conservatism and fascism are regarded internationally as being on the right. Liberalism can mean different things in different contexts: sometimes on the left (social liberalism), sometimes on the right (classical liberalism).

** Was it an anonymous guest review? That's how you know you've made it, when you're getting troll-y flames from anonymous guest reviewers. I still remembering being so happy when I got one (only one, sadly, and nothing since - maybe bragging about it in my A/N discouraged them...).

*** This one was fully signed in and everything. (Profile is ... interesting. I shall say no more than that.) The only anon review I've had that hasn't been positive was a copy-pasted excerpt from the definition of a particular SM kink. Which, fine, but there are designated places for that sort of thing and the reviews column of an unrelated fanfic isn't one of them. Kooks gonna kook, though, I reckon.
