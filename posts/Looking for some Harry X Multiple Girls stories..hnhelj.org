In the mood for some Harry with a group of girls. I would prefer if Hermione was not one of them.

Extra points if Harry is a powerful badass.

​

Thanks for your help.


** linkffn(Whispers in the Dark) - IMO the best Harry/multi without Hermione\\
linkffn(Harry Potter and the international triwizard tournament) - Honestly, this is still in progress and may not actually be multi, but it definitley looks like that's the plan\\
linkffn(too many dates) - a bit on the crack side, but a good read\\
linkffn(Duel by fantasy1290) - really interesting premise, but a bit out there as it goes on

These include Hermione, but are too good not to mention:\\
linkffn(Soul Scars) - the best Harry/multi and it's not especially close IMO\\
linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) - you did say you preferrred Super!Harry, right? Because this is definitley that\\
linkffn(Harry Potter and the Curse's Cure) - smut\\
linkffn(Harry Potter and the price of being noble) - magic-veela-soul-bond multi

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

** Linkffn(13567404) has Hermione as one of Harry's girls, but it's a recent fic and the author's been updating it up until recently twice a week when she's not on break. Reviews of it are kind of funny to read too, but, as always, don't read them if you don't want spoilers lol

** Does anyone who isn't an INCEL looking for wanking material even like harem stories? I just don't get the obsession with it-and I'm a dude. Maybe it is because I've been married for a few years, but honestly, devoting adequate time to one woman can be a challenge, but a harem? Impossible.

*** I don't really know. I can see a fic that has Harry in a serious relationship with two other people but any more than that sounds exhausting.

I feel like the more romantic partners you introduce, the less characterization each of them gets so the smut becomes much less emotionally engaging for the reader. It's hard enough nailing emotional payoffs without having to develop ones with a bunch of different romantic partners.

That said, I am saying this as an author that is /really/ bad at writing smut, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

**** What you said is completely true. The key to getting a harem trope to work is by writing a polyamorous story. Where all partners, whether it's 3 or 7, are romantically attracted to each other. To write a harem where all these people are devoted to a singular person is just asking for failure. Sometimes it works, but most times it doesn't.

I know it's weird demographically ‘cause I'm a woman and semi-asexual, but harem stories are just my go-to reads for Harry Potter...especially when they have little to no smut (or, at least, the smut doesn't last longer than 3-ish paragraphs)!

  This Story is based on Whitetigerwolves story, but continued by me with his consent.This is a Harry/Multi story. More specifically, Harry Potter/Minerva McGonagall/Poppy Pomfrey/Andromeda Tonks/Amelia Bones. How they came together is inspired by The Curses Cure and Draco's Gift respectively, but I've put my own little twist into it.As I stated this was inspired by two other stories. Basically, Harry is cursed to uncontrollable lust. In those stories, it was Hermione that helped Harry, and, for the most part, involved younger witches. And I got to thinking, what if Draco had been caught by a teacher and the situation brought to the attention of Hogwarts staff? Then I threw in my little twist. That is what Whitetigerwolve did with it i added Harry/Narcissa Malfoy and continued the story from the first chapter onwardsI hope you all enjoy.Nothing but the storyline from chapter 2 onwards belongs to me.
