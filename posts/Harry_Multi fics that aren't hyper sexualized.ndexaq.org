I've noticed that most Harry/Multi fics are so hyper sexualixed that everything about it including lemon scenes are terrible. I'm asexual and I'm not really interested in the lemon. I don't mind them, but really I'm reading it because I like triad/poly relationships. Anyone know a good one?


** I'm promoting myself here, I hope you don't mind. My story doesn't have any lemons in it. I really wanted to try and focus on the characters and their interactions and development as individuals. Some people say a harem (I hate that word) fics are pointless without lemons, but I vehemently disagree.

Too many Harry/multi stories feature a group of women who are carbon copies of each others, I tried to avoid that. Each and every woman, while somehow 'compelled' to seek Harry out, has her own reason for doing so. Also, I did not want to let the plot descend into cheap porn. There is some sensuality, and scenes where the reader knows what will and what did happen.

A point. While Harry finds himself in a relationship with quite a few women, the story is not centered around him 'gathering' a bunch of lovers. It is more of a byproduct of my Harry simply being who he is, and doing what he does. The characters feelings are integral to the conclusion of the story, however.

  A month after Dumbledore's death, Harry is depressed and wallowing in grief at Privet Drive. One night, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Fawkes appears in his room, and whisks him away to a hidden stronghold. There, our hero meets the spirit of Godric Gryffindor, who takes Harry as his apprentice. Harry/Multi. Powerful, not godlike. Intelligent Harry. Ch 2 is NOT missing.

** I've been sort of wanting to write something like this, but I'm pan and write a bi Harry, so it would also be multi-gender. I just totally agree with you that there is a lot of potential outside of orgies lmao

I'll try and remember if there are any Harry triads with less of the lemons. I know there are and I've definitely read them, but finding them is less easy

**** they totally have! I have two pansexual harem fics with Hermione as the mc on the go and one of them has a young, prickly, asexual Severus in it (time travel is a beautiful thing); but I haven't tried with Harry because I didn't want to write Harry orgies, but this idea is really lovely, so I'm going to have a crack at it. Now that I know that at least one panromantic person would read it I have extra encouragement!

They are quite difficult to write outside of hormones because ensemble fics always have so many dynamics running at the same time, but that's also the Beauty of them!

The only fic I can really think of right now that has that kind of thing is the creature fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/485605/chapters/845701][There be Dragons, Harry]]. It's an epically ever-moving-many-threads-complex-worldbuilding-and-weird-creature-stuff fic, and it's m/m/m/m... I can't remember what number they're up to now, and it has a fair amount of smut, but I feel like you can easily skip it and lose none of the stody, and it does have some lovely cuddly moments as well, it's just buried in there somewhere.

Other than that, I can't seem to be able to find the cute triad fics I know I've read, so I'm really sorry!

****** I write under gladheonsleeps on both ffnet and ao3, but neither of the fics I mentioned are anywhere neat ready for publishing yet. As I said they're pretty hard to write, so it's slow going.

There is a fairly light-on-lemons James/Lily/Regulus fic though. They aren't ace or demi, but I didn't go in for gratuitous descriptions in scenes, just sort of referred to the fact that they did it, so you might like the vibe, hopefully? I went big for atmosphere and sweetness on that one linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14263605/chapters/32896794]])

  Lily Evans finds she can't simply sit back and watch Regulus Black get drawn into the depravity and violence of the group calling themselves the 'Death Eaters'. The fact that she keeps thinking about what he would look like as she kissed him awake in the morning was besides the point. ...But while we're on the subject, perhaps having two perfect boyfriends would be even better than one just so long as they don't mind...

** Have you read /Homunculus to the Life/? I don't normally go for triads or polyships, mostly because I rarely find stories that I actually enjoy. I liked this one. It's Ron/Harry/Hermione, post-war. While short and full of angst, given the premise, I liked the rather deft and careful way the author approached their relationship (and that it ended on a more optimistic note). There was some intimacy, iirc, but it wasn't smut. linkao3(27889183)

  In a conversation with Dumbledore's portrait after the battle at Hogwarts, Harry finds out that he is and always has been a homunculus---a substitute body made to carry the Horcrux so that little Harry Potter, who lies asleep as a baby under powerful charms, wouldn't have to. Harry struggles to process the news, the fallout, and the discovery that he might disintegrate at any moment.

** Another self-promotion: linkffn(Elune's Pebble)

It's got a Harry +2 pairing that isn't a central focus, there is sex, but not explicit. (except on the hpfanficarchive version) Mostly it's just Harry learning to lean on others and let them lean on him.

  HP/Warcraft crossover with no knowledge of Warcraft needed. Harry in his 5th year could have used a few friends with actual combat experience. A lot of folks on Azeroth during Cataclysm would have been better off anywhere else. If you think HP cannon needed more Dragons, this is the fic for you! Features HP/HG/? Ship and a Cursed!Dumbledore.

** I get why most people don't like the multi trope. It's unrealistic, and usually a smutfest, and let's face it, its usually written by horny teenagers, and often devoud of anything resembling character progression.

I find, that if you give each person a role to play, a job to do within the plot, you give yourself a better chance of fleshing them out, to a degree. Have them help advancing the plot. Don't just have them them in the story like some kind of vessel for Harry's... release.

Another thing I do in my fic, is I gave every woman I paired with Harry 'a moment' with him, to better understand them, and their motivations, dreams and desires. I suppose each woman fills a certain trope.

And I kind of hoped to have each woman represent a facet of Harry's personality, that he might have repressed to a degree, because of the role he took for himself. And the way he was raised. Kind of like Captain Malcolm Reynolds of the Firefly, in fact.

For example, Narcissa, while a little warmer now, compared with how she was with Lucius, is still a Slytherin through and through, a manipulative b$%ch. She's very intelligent and cunning, and willing to do some... questionable things to get her way, which is the reason why she's Harry's proxy for the Black seat on the Wizengamot.

Bellatrix, while not a completely insane, sadistic murderer anymore, doesn't give a shit about Harry's quest. The only reason she even bothers with it, is because she's utterly in love with Harry, and she loves her sisters, and niece. Getting rid of Riddle is the only thing that will keep her precious people safe. And she's out for revenge, so you better believe she's going to cut loose against her former colleagues!

I felt Tonks's silly, mischievous and playful character would help Harry cope with everything, and draw out his own silly self. That being said, she's not just comic relief, but an actual character, who has recently lost her husband to a Dementor attack. Harry's heart will help her heal, butshe has yet to deal with Remus' death.

Andromeda is a gentle and kind woman, who cares very deeply for people, and has a strong conscience. She lost her husband, but fell for Harry when she saw his true self, and how good he was for her sisters. And he brought them back to her. Harry's also going to have the Black name stand for something better. Despite her kindness, she's still a Black, so you best understand her claws are sharp!

Being a Veela, Fleur understands the loneliness that comes with being TBWL. Most people only see the Veela, while most only see The Boy Who Lived. Of course, Harry being immune to the Allure, makes him irresistible to /Her/ Fleur's Veela, whom she considers to be a separate being, living inside her.

Minerva represents Harry's strict and disciplined side. I have yet to give McG her proper time in the sun. Sure she and Harry have had a moment, but this latest chapter I'm writing should flesh her out a bit more. I wonder how people will react to a completely ruthless Minerva?

And lastly, we have ... well she's a bit of a blank page as of yet. She's very well known in HP, but she's practically an OC, so. I'll flesh her out and It'll happen in this chapter.

While doing this, I still tried to not completely disregard the canon personality of the women involved. The chapter I'm writing now also adresses why the group was drawn together in the first place.

Whew, that was a bit more than I meant to do, but I found I wanted to outline how I tried to tackle the multi trope.

No idea if I succeeded, though.
