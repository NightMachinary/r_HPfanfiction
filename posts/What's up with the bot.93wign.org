It's been down for about 2 days now. I understand that [[/u/tusing]] got a new job which doesn't allow them to work on it anymore, but has anyone else decided that they would undertake maintenance? Where is it currently being hosted from in order to fix it in the first place?

Edit: Went back and actually read Tusing's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8ivkp9/my_contributions_to_the_bot_will_no_longer_be/][post]] and they say that they can't make any open-source contributions, not that they can't work on it at all. My bad. Still curious to see if anyone has decided to work on the current issues in the public release, though.


** I use ficsave.xyz when it's down even though I'm sure everyone here should be aware of it. Just in case tho.
