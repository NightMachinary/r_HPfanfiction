*** Cool premise.

Now Harry is "immortal" as long as other souls die in his place (he can even use them to power spell or ritual that require human sacrifices as long as he knows what type of soul he uses (like it wouldn't do to use a criminal in a ritual requiring a pure soul). He also somehow figures that it's how the Philosopher Stone was first made and why the Flamel never tried to make another (and Dumbledore, discovering this some time in the past, decided to destroy it). With that he plans to make one for (or of) himself (to be able to beat Voldemort or because he's a bit crazy now) but instead of sacrificing innocents he will use Dementors as they stored souls for so long. The Dementor eat the souls without allowing them to pass on but with the Philosopher Stone they will die when they are "used" which is a mercy in Harry's eye. And if he can talk to them he will be able to learn a lot of things from people far in the past (also innocents taken before the time the Dementors were used as prison guard). He may gain some abilities from the souls he has now taken if the said abilities are linked to the soul (like apparently Parseltongue).

EDIT: I made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ceq01y/harry_seeks_to_make_a_philosopher_stone_fma_style/][prompt]] about it.
