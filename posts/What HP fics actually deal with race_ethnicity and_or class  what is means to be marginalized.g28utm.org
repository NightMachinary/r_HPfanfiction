** You would need a Muggle-born main character to do the poor thing because a wizarding family would have to try to struggle. The Weasleys are not really well off, but they can absolutely meet their needs, it's less necessary things that they struggle to buy like toys or brand new stuff when second-hand and hand-me-downs can do it. The Weasleys are also struggling because they have seven children and only one parent receives a paycheque at the end of the week. It could be done with Harry, but as attending Hogwarts is free and students coming from Muggle backgrounds with low revenues receive a fund to buy their supplies and Harry already lives like someone poor at the Dursleys, it wouldn't really change the story, especially once Sirius comes into the frame in PoA.

Classism could be done easily in any AU with 'Noble Houses' but people don't really do it or do it badly so I see where you're coming from. Also, the 'sheer whiteness of Hogwarts & JKR's wizarding world at large' is called realism. The story is set in 1990s Great Britain, not 2020 United States. Do you want to know how much white people made out the country's population? It was more than 90%. People of colour in Great Britain made out as much of the population as Muggle-borns did the wizarding world in the books. Just in Harry's year, you have five students of colour out of forty. That's 12.5% of the cohort, which is more than the percentage of people of colour in the country. By all indications, racism due to one's skin colour and sexism isn't a thing in the wizarding world because you can literally change your skin colour with the Colour-Changing Charm, which is a first-year level charm, and magic is a great equaliser since you don't have to rely on physical strength. Xenophobia seems to be slightly a thing as Fleur seems to be disliked by Molly, Ginny and Hermione slightly because of her 'Frenchness'.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/970896]]

also kind of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11439594/1/Rebuilding]] but it's more just characters learning to understand/accommodate each other, not much actual conflict. some nice OCs.

there are quite a few fics where Hermione is Jewish, black, or both- if you search the tags on AO3 you'll find some good stuff.

there's been a recent trend, kick-started around 2015 through some fanart comics on Tumblr, of portraying Harry as desi (especially Pakistani or Indian) through James. as a desi person i enjoy this very much.
