I'm not exactly sure how it would work but it doesn't really matter if it's time travel or not

** I have several.

linkffn(11983735) *How do you solve a problem like Ginevra?*

It can be a tad confusing at times due to how the author writes, but I really loved it. Very magical, very intense.

linkffn(7190230) *Prejudice and Pride* is a time travel AU. Really liked it and best of all, it's long and complete (so rare for Gin and Tonics).

linkffn(8210840) *Colouring Hearts* is shorter but also complete, also a time travel AU and has a great plot. It's somewhat nonlinear and Tom is very in character.

  She's a darling, she's a demon. Unable to concentrate in Hogwarts, Ginny Weasley is sent to Little Hangleton House to serve an apprenticeship with mysterious, handsome Tom Riddle. Tom's experiments in magic are like nothing Ginny's ever come across, and as she finds herself increasingly drawn to him she has to wonder: what does Tom Riddle want from her? *AU*

  Arrogance and bigotry can be well-founded, but perhaps that is when it is most important to fight through prejudices. Sometimes choices have to be made, even if they go against everything that you stand for. TomxGinny.

  Stopping short of leaving the alleyway, Tom asks, "Have you ever had a Butterbeer?" She has. "No," she says instead. GWTR - a rather different time travel novella. Complete.
