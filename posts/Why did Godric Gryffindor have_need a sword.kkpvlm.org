I just can't think of a good reason other than for decoration or something similar.

What reasons can you come up with?


** Well, he lived a thousand years ago, when there was no Statute of Secrecy, so wizards and muggles freely mixed. Banditry and lawlessness was far more prevalent than it is now, so it would have been good to have multiple means of defending oneself, for redundancy. Perhaps he thought it unsporting to defend himself with magic against a muggle. Maybe it was to do with blending. Magic has always been somewhat frowned upon and treated with suspicion or contempt especially post-christianisation, so although wizards may not have felt the need to hide as much as they did later on in their history, you would do well not to advertise that fact.

It could also have been that Gryffindor may have cast spells through the sword as well.

If we look at the historical context of the 10th century, iron and steel was relatively expensive, so being able to afford a sword to begin with was a status symbol. With how extravagant his sword is, it shows a lot a lot of wealth and therefore power. Thus it also shows that this is someone that you do not want to be messing about with. Sometimes deterrent is half the battle. People are less inclined inclined to attack you if you look powerful. Sure some will try but they will be lesser. People also knew their place in history; a lowly serf or peasant wasn't inclined to question the comings and goings of those in power over them. The law was not on their side, and they would come off far worse if they tried to pull something.

** Spells aren't the end-all, be-all. Try holding a wand forward when someone's close to you. A sword would be better in melee.

Also, for all we know, magic advances. This is actually likely. Perhaps spells were slower then, and not something you just yell 'Reducto!' and cast.

If someone is close enough to you that you can't raise a wand, then you also can't wield a sword effectively.

**** That and I've always wondered if the killing curse has to be aimed at the head or chest. Can you shoot someone with it in the foot and kill them that way?

** There are several fanfic stories dealing the founding of Hogwarts that has Godric and Salazar bearing both wands and swords into battle. Most have them knowing "sword play" prior to knowing magic. Those are usually because they are part of a mundane noble family where males were required to learn swords and warfare.

** Maybe the hilt had present wand's properties which was specific to that sword only (like no area effect rather the spells affected the sword itself).

And besides, swords and all would have been the rage at the time of gryffindor. They do look cool as a primary weapon for non magic people, so a preferred secondary weapon for wizards.

** Magic improves over time in the harry potter verse just like technology. So maybe a thousands years or more ago using a enchanted sword like the sword of Gryffindor was better than the defensive magic of the time.

It could also be that because the magical and muggle worlds were not separate back then Godric was a Knight of some sort and he needed it to blend in among the muggle when he went around looking for Students.

** Wands are cool and all....but sometimes you need to stab or hack something to death. Maybe a dragon, or other such, impervious-ish critters needed a-killin'. Maybe he made the sword magical,like a sharp, deadly, extra-long wand.

Point is, before the advent of firearms, it was always good to have a sword handy.

** I'd say it's for dealing with beasts. We know the sword absorbs everything it comes in contact with, which would be a perfect fit for dealing with beasts. If Godric had a way of casting stuff like shields through it (make it absorb a dusted wand core, maybe?), it would be the perfect way of dealing with creatures that don't really get affected by magic - such as dragons or giants. Which I'd assume ran rampant before the wizards drove them into reserves.
