As in, no characters, perhaps a few locations, but mainly the magic system as well as how wizards are made, the concept of muggleborn, the concept of magic infusing things to make them supernatural, etc.

I've been thinking about writing a Fallout crossover (basically, in 2077 the US and China nuke eachother back into the stone age, and the rest of the world follows suit), that has the protagonist be the only survivor of one of the vault experiments (advertised as shelters, but a rogue splinter of the government used the vaults as labs during the nuclear winter to experiment on people, examples include forcefully mutating them, exposure to radiation, brainwashing through infrasound, etc.), which he or she survived due to the magic.

I don't want to cripple myself by writing about an established character - I'd have to account for their personality, why they are in a vault filled with muggles, how they survived for 200+ years, etc. I also don't want to write some edgy "heh scoffs smirks" character. And some sort of insta-powerful person is stupid.

In essence, I'd like to explore how someone would tame their apparently supernatural powers while not being aware of what they actually are. No looking up how to make a wand ollivander style, but truly experimenting with magic.

To truly enforce this, I'd also get rid of all the wizards, most of the intelligent magical species and a selection of unsapient species, with the rest either making it intact through the war or mutating into crazy forms because of the radiation mixing with magic. Maybe they had seers who noticed that beyond 2077 there was nothing but endless winter, so they all fucked off through a convenient portal, carting all their important possessions, pets and allies with them, leaving the rest to rot and change, and conveniently "forgetting" that muggleborn will still happen.

Everything fits supremely well into the Fallout universe, too, as some /DeepLore/ of those games has random people develop "psychic powers", which they either control or which control them. (for example, there's a kid in one of the games who lives in an underpass and sees the future in the symbolic form of a casino - perfect seer material. There's a few people who can control or communicate with animals, and one of the main bad guys was some sort of unholy amalgam of man, beast and machine that could use pretty extreme telepathy) I'd use these people to symbolize muggleborn who would have been of extraordinary strength, with most other muggleborn simply having longer lives, more luck, etc than other wastelanders. They never train their power to any real capacity, so it doesn't manifest as profusely as before the war.

Anyway. Back to the point. I've seen many people say that they need Harry as a protagonist or they won't read a story, but I'd still like to hear your thoughts on this concept.


** This actually sounds amazing, and I'd personally love to read it.\\
I think a lot of the time, the reason people don't like to read non-harry stories are generally because they're poorly written OCs, often still set in Wizarding Britain in the 90s and can sometimes read like SI fics. I think there was a fic set in Wizarding USA about all OCs that was fairly popular but I don't remember its name.\\
In some fics, especially ones that focus on Harry getting abused or getting serious injuries, they talk about how the magic of a wizard/witch can mutate or change to focus on protecting the person, weakening their magic and spells, but often saving their lives. Maybe you could use something like this to explain how some could survive radiation? or maybe its much more likely for muggleborns to become ghouls than it is for a normal person?\\
Either way, I would definitely check this fic out, it sounds really good, so good luck!

You could be thinking of the /Alexandra Quick/ series.

Despite it's mixed reviews, it's definitely well-written. The characters aren't quite as likeable as the main characters in HP.

** See I think you should just take those couple extra steps and just straight up write this as it's own book. Clearly you've got a really solid idea of what the setting will be, but since it involves 0% of canon characters or history why include it at all?

Make your own mark, write your own thing! ...plus making some kind of profit off your hard work would be nice, no?

** The Alexandra Quick series is the premise in your post title. It takes place in the same universe as Harry Potter, but it's a story about an American witch that begins in 2007. The magic rules are the same, but the world is expanded to include magic from china, japan, and various native cultures. We get to follow an 11-year-old Alexandra much the same as we followed Harry, with resulting mysteries each year that build off each other, but things never seem to work out as well for Alex as they did for Harry.

I think they're great, and I recommend you check them out!

There are already 5 full books, with at least one more coming.

** Unless they're a relative of a canon character, I probably wouldn't read it and even if you set it in Britain, I'm not sure I'd see it as a Harry Potter fanfic without this kind of connection.

That being said... I don't think it's a boring idea. This

sounds *really* interesting.

Maybe you could go a couple of chapters like this before they meet someone's great-great-grandkid or something like that. Or they're Dudley's descendant... or Molly's accountant's cousin's descendant.

(This would be length dependent, of course. If you're writing 200k words... 100k words of naive experimentation before encountering someone who knows what's going on and has tried to make a wand would work, I think.)

The other way to make it more Harry Potter fanficy is if the character ends up living in Grimmauld Place or something like that. I think this sort of location based thinking is both more limiting for you and would lack meaning without someone in the story who understands the significance of where they've ended up.

I'm also... as my username might suggest... a big fan of portals to other realities, pocket universes, digital worlds etc. etc. so the idea that the wizards mostly all left is another Cool Idea as far as I'm concerned. The hypothetical "self-aware" descendant (and my preference would be for one of Harry's but that's me) could work either like Bold (from Farthing Wood) who's travelled back through the portal or, as I think fits your ambitions better, a surviving descendant of someone who refused to go through the portal.

** If you write this, I will definitely read it, it's a really good idea and I'm honestly surprised no one else thought about this.

** The exploration and experimentation with magic has been done before and I found them to be boring. A protagonist inevitably ends up weaker than a 4th year which is boring for the story or skips 5000 years of magical developments which requires too much suspension of disbelief.

For me, Harry Potter is about the magic, the world, and the characters with importance in that order. I can read a story from the perspective of any character and even an OC, so long as it's Harry Potter. I think a story lacking the magic, the world, and the characters would be better off as pure original fiction, or in this case, fallout fanfiction. Just my opinion.

** This honestly sounds more like original work than fanfiction; really neat concept though! I would for sure read it as long as the writing is good :)

** I'd read it, if you did it well and in a way that was interesting and/or fun. I don't think you'd get an overly wide audience though - that whole 'Harry Potter characters only!' thing is quite prevalent here. On the other hand, like werepat says, Alexandra Quick is completely unconnected to any canon characters and that's hella popular, so maybe I'm wrong. I'd definitely give it a go though, and hope you post a self-promotion thread when you get it uploaded. :)
