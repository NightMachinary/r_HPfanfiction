We just had a big thread yesterday about bashing in HP. I know quite a bit of Obi-Wan and Yoda bashing is done in Starwars. How about other fandoms, such as Naruto, Pokemon, Twilight, Percy Jackson, Supernatural, Avengers, Lord of the Rings, and ASOIF/GoT?


** Bashing is an universal phenomenon throughout all fandoms. I can't say much about the regularity of it in other fandoms, though.

** In twilight, pjato, and avengers ff bashing is a pretty common thing. It looks a bit different than hp bashing tho. In hp the biggest bashing is good old proper ron bashing, the extended form being/molly, and from there the rest of the Weasley family. This can take a few different forms, but the most common is the dumbleworship brigade, with rampant bribery and rape via love potion attempts. The-world's-most-idiotic-supergenius manipulative!dumbledore bashing is next, who is supposedly omniscient yet never fails to be surprised when Harry's inevitably discovers his machinations, the extended form being when he is literally an evil worse than voldemort (I recall a scene from a particularly out there fic I read years ago where Dumbledore has snape prepare him a magic bath that he soaks in to create a horcrux, with some very vivid imagery.) When you take hp bashing to its furthest logical conclusion, you get bashing of the entire magical society sans death eaters for betraying Harry and sentencing him unlawfully to Azkaban. WBWL!brother bashing gets an honorable mention, usually with the bashing apple not falling far from the tree.

In twilight, the bashing is usually just an extension of the bashing already in the books (read: every single human except Charlie and Bella), or a rebound effect of the total lack of bashing of any supernatural characters resulting in extreme bashing and character warping. In the first one, it's just a continuation of the script of perfection only achievable by the supernatural, that renders all humans the scum of the earth who have nothing better than to be jealous and petty. In the second one, 90% of the time it's ripping apart edward so bella can be with jasper/jacob/emmet/alice/rosalie, 9% of the time it's all of the vamps getting ripped apart so Bella can be with jacob/Paul/seth/etc. The remaining one percent is Bella saying fuck off to all the supernaturals and getting herself a normal boy.

Pjato really doesn't have a whole lot of bashing, but what is there is 50% Annabeth cheating on Percy so he can ask the gods to kill him, zeus denying it and instead ordering him to be the guardian/protector/caretaker/maid/living sex toy of the hunters of Artemis, falling in love with Thalia, Zoe, or Artemis herself(betrayal from the rest of the camp optional), and 50% is a Tyson complex 2.0 where a new camper shows up who may or may not be a sea spawn (aries is usually the godly parent when it's not poseidon), who proceeds to win over CHB and frame Percy of various crimes against grover/Thalia/stoll brothers/Katie Gardner that causes all his friends and his dad to leave him, then steal Annabeth, sometimes killing Sally and Paul for good measure, causing Percy to leave the camp and almost get himself killed, before being saved and recruited as the chosen leader of a universe defending team by Chaos, the primordial God of chaos. This team may include dead characters such as Zoe, Luke, Bianca, beck, and silena, and/or ancient heros such as Orion or theseus. The bashing in these fics tends to be more forgiving than hp or twilight, in that the bashed characters 'learn their lesson' and are forgiven by Percy, or were being mind controlled the whole time and so not at fault. There's also the occasional poseidon bashing fic where Sally dies when Percy is young, and he ends up on the streets where he is found by hestia/hades/apollo/artemis/etc and taken in by them as a child/champion, and poseidon is a huge dick who refuses to love him for whatever reason.

Incredibly surprising for such a massive and diverse fandom, the only type of bashing I've ever seen in avengers is post civil war fics bashing one side or the other, in defense of one specific character. e.g. Bashing Steve for "treating Tony terribly and betraying their friendship" and bashing Tony for "treating Steve/Bucky terribly and betraying their friendship."

This was probably not what you were looking for but whatever, I'll jump at any chance to rant about fanthropology.

** I've read pretty heavy bashing in Naruto-fanfiction. It's mostly Sasuke, Sakura, Sandaime, Danzo, Kakashi, Minato, Kushina and the Konoha Council.

Bashing in Pokemon is often centered around those stories where Ash is betrayed or blamed for something.

Don't kwow about Twilight

Percy Jackson has many Zeus or Annabeth bashing storie. There are also Olympus as a whole bashing stories too.

I've read Lord of the Rings OC-Character or Tenth Walker stories where mostly only Boromir is bashed.

Star Wars has Obi-Wan and Yoda bashing when a story is Vader-centric.

**** The difficult question is where do you draw the line between bashing and being brutally honest about flaws?

Is every single adult in Hogwarts absolutely incompetent because they missed stuff like the Basilisk, Harry becoming an outcast (in GoF), Snape's behavior, the racially motivated terrorists within their school and so on? Is it bashing to call them out on their failures?

As for Asoiaf, most of the popular stories tend to end up on the opposite side of the spectrum as far as bashing goes. The "bad" characters, or at least Sansa and Dany often end up as Mary Sues, which is really annoying. Rhaegar Targaryen ends up being the hero in the Rebellion stories while there are very few fics where Robert is the good guy. I mean, we have thousands of "Voldemort/The Death Eaters did nothing wrong" fics so it is not too far fetched to expect a decent Robert/Lyanna, right?

** Well, there's practicaly no bashing in the Disney comics fandom, but then it's not really constructed around written fanfiction quite as much... In the /Haunted Mansion/ fandom, there's "bashing" of the 2003 movie, but not of a specific character in it; and there's a neutral character called Leota who is often portrayed as evil in fanfics, but it's not really out of dislike for the character so much as a need for a villain combined with the fact that while not evil in canon, Leota is certainly more evil/ish/ than most other characters. The fans also don't like the character of Constance Hatchaway, but it rarely shows up as what we'd call bashing in fanfiction.

**** Well, there aren't that many fanfictions of note except in French (see perhaps /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9727860/1/Della-s-Secret][Della's Secret]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6512139/1/The-Lost-Tomb-of-Pharaoh-Sedqaduck][The Lost Tomb of Pharaoh Sedqaduck]]/, for two extremely different approaches; both are at least goodish). The fandom is mostly centered around blogs and forums that discuss the official media, and debatably-legal scanlations.

Now for comics, there are of course the wonderful fancomics featuring Gladstone Gander and Magica De Spell created by Sarah Jolley, the amazing artist behind the webcomic /The Property of Hate/. They can be found [[http://modmad.tumblr.com/post/162014503130/duck-doodle-comics-masterpost][here]]. (Again, there's also some good comics in French and Italian but they're not translated.) I'll also drop [[https://elera.deviantart.com/art/Double-Standards-200470669][this]], [[https://elera.deviantart.com/art/Every-Week-With-This-174593272][this]] and [[https://scroogey.deviantart.com/art/A-Mysterious-Threat-Complete-608588245][that]] which are the comic equivalent of one-shots. Oh, and there's /Christmas for Two/ ([[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-1-425973813][page one]], [[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-2-425974338][page two]], [[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-3-425974559][page three]], [[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-4-425974749][page four]], [[https://dermitdemschnauzer.deviantart.com/art/Christmas-for-two-Page-5-425974967][page five]]), which I can't realy spoil but... /read it/.

DeviantArt and tumblr are filled with fan-art, but very little actual /plotting/. [[https://hyaroo.deviantart.com/art/Kazza-s-Disney-Meme-Fethry-Duck-633866933][Here's a nice Fethry thing.]], and all duckfans should check out the blog of [[https://mistermcdee.tumblr.com][mistermcdee]] and the [[https://tedjohansson.deviantart.com/gallery/43687465/Disney-ducks][DeviantArt profile of Ted Johansson]] at least once.

Again aside from things not in English, I think we have it about covered.

** From what I've read in other fandoms, the frequency of bashing increases as plot holes, personality flaws, and pairings that are mutually antagonistic with canon increase. At the same time, bashing decreases in general as age of fandom increases, and as size of fandom decreases. For something like the Worm fandom (which relative to Harry Potter), bashing is not quite rare, but uncommon, especially as the community at SpaceBattles and Sufficient Velocity greatly frown upon such excessive destruction of a character. On the other hand, something like Naruto will have much more bashing, but interestingly enough, not generally to as great of a degree as in Harry Potter.

I chalk up the degree of bashing to age and gender. Bashing people who are obstacles to the MC's harem is mostly done by guys. Bashing of only one character, someone like Ginny, for a Harmony ship, seems done perhaps more by girls. Bashing Ginny and the Weasleys, and perhaps Dumbledore is more by guys.
