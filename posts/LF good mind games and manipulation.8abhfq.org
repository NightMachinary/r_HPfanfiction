I just finished reading The Red Knight by Demon Eyes Laharl and thoroughly enjoyed it. I wonder if there are other fics with mind games and manipulation. Preferably for good reasons but the other is fine too (unless it is for bashing purposes only)

Complete or regularly updated fics are preferred.


** linkffn(Duality) has some of the best light-touch interrogation scenes that I know of.

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass

**** Thanks for the recommendation, but I don't think it's my type of story. There were too many things that broke my immersion within the first few paragraphs of the story like invitation to slytherin common rooms, no one caring that a Gryffindor is there, cigarettes, and an invitation to girl dorms.

There's also the fact that it hasn't been updated for two years and I'm afraid I won't get any resolution.

If you can ease my worries then please do so.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
