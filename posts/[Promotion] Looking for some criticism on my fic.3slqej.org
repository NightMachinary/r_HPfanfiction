Hi! So, I've got four chapters of my fic posted so far and while I've received some pretty nice reviews I'd really like some constructive criticism, maybe something a little more objective. I've been a lurker here for a bit and you all seem to give some lovely feedback and have some great discussions and that's why I finally plucked up the courage to make an account and post my story.

It's a Dramione war-fic, and a little dark and graphic. I've got most everything already planned out for it, and a few more chapters already written and ready to post. I'd just really like to know how it's all coming across.

Thank you, if you do read and help :)
