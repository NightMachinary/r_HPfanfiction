Whenever I talk about it, people seem to consider it ridiculous, as Ginny, at least, seem to dislike Fleur quite a bit in the books. But considering Dramione is very popular, that seems like a weird objection to lodge.

â€‹

Do you know of any good fics of the pairing? Also, how would you prefer to write them moving past their canon issues with each other?

If I were writing such a story, I'd start it after the war. The first step would be for Fleur to acknowledge Ginny's competence and surety. In return, Ginny could compliment Fleur for her own achievements, mentioning how she was secretly pleased to see a witch in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and that Fleur proved she was more than a pretty face.

To move them on as a couple, the easy play would be for something to befall Bill. They could reach out to grieve over it; Bill seemed to be Ginny's favorite brother after all. Perhaps in helping Fleur grieve, Ginny finds herself taking care of Fleur's daughters, who over time come to admire her for being a Quidditch Pro and beautiful without fussing about with decorum and grooming obsessions as their mother's family tends to.

A more subtle arrangement might be one where Bill simply doesn't get in the way of them having a close, even intimate, friendship as he doesn't feel threatened by his sister. An unrelated lover would seem like betrayal of the marriage vows, but not Ginny.

The more I think on it, the more tempted I am to write it.

** The easy, possibly cop out solution, would maybe be that Ginny is acting like an ass towards Phlem because she is jealous.. A. That someone is tying down her favorite brother.. B. That someone happens to be a gorgeous blonde.. Which may or may not be confusing, depending on how much she has figured out her sexuality at this point in time..

  How to move past their canon issues
#+end_quote

The easiest way would be to bond them via trial by fire. The Burrow is attacked and burned to the ground, the Weasleys scatter and run. Ginny and Fleur are separated and have to fight their way through a bunch of Death Eater minions (keep in mind that Ginny would be 15 and unlike at the Ministry, there would be no "take them alive" order).

You could also throw in some ridiculous pureblood law where Harry has to marry all women who owe him life debts, but these are marriages on paper only and he does nothing sexual with them because he is quite happy with his real love. Stuck in those marriages, they realise that they get along quite well. Such a scenario would work well in a "we won the war but nothing changed" scenario, where pureblood bigots still control the Ministry.

As for how to break up Bill and Fleur, just use canon Molly. Either Bill really falls for Tonks (which, coincidentally also gets rid of the Lupin "romance"), have Fleur take offence at that and Bill's lack of defence or a mixture of both.
