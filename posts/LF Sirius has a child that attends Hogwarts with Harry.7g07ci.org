Looking for fics where Sirius has a child that attends Hogwarts with Harry. Don't care if either of them know they are related. Bonus if the fic has Sirius still in Azkaban and/or dies in the DOM and he/she has to live without him.


** linkffn(Blackest of Souls) ItÂ´s not good though, but your mileage might vary.

*** Man, I would have knocked the fuck out of Harry if he used Sectumsempra on me, accident or not. Maybe Carina did; I skimmed most of this story. Too much canon rehash.

On a side note, I have only ever read one Azkaban story where Harry (or fem!Harry) doesn't forgive those who turn against her. I just want to see Harry saying "Fuck you, I'm out" and leaving them to their fate. Or where Dumbledore tries to get Harry involved in those sixth year lessons or something, and he's like "Y'know, I don't really give a fuck."

***** Linkffn(The Ghost of Azkaban)

It's short, fem!Harry, and Jasmine is rather twisted after her Azkaban stay.

  Jasmine Potter is dead. She is gone and I am what remains, The Ghost of Azkaban. A short, dark and dirty story full of angst and horror, infused with a touch of black humour. Inspired by FateRogue's very brilliant 'The Blackest of Souls'.

  She was framed for the murder of her best friend's parents, and her other best friend's brother. They placed her in Azkaban at the age of fifteen, and when they discover her innocence a year later, she's back and not taking anything from anyone. And maybe, just maybe, she'll get the girl she was in love with all along-that is, if she can forgive her.

*** I really wanted to like this story but Acquila really started to grate on me. You know the saying 'when life give you lemons make lemonade" Well Acquila took the lemons and just threw them at Harry. I feel like it ends up becoming a story where Harry's emotions are just stomped on. Please tell me I am not alone in this feeling?
