I'm trying to get Lady Altair's permission to translate her work Cauterize, but unable to contact her. I sent a message more than a year ago at fanfiction.net and one reminder after then, and I have not received a response. In fact, it looks like she never logged in there for years. Does anybody here know a better way to ask her?

In case it matters, I'm talking about a Japanese translation.

I normally make sure to obtain permission before I translate and publish (of course with credit), but in this instance, I forgot asking and proceeded to publish it online. Having realized that, I made it private, and other users cannot read it now unless I explicitly disclose it to them. If I hear she doesn't like the idea of having her work translated, I'll permanently delete my translation from the internet.

Obviously it would be ideal if she says okay, and I'll be able to make it public again. If she already made a general statement on translation somewhere, I think that would work, too, but I don't seem to find one.


** I recommend trying to contact her one last time. FFN reenabled email notifications for PMs a few days ago, so she might finally get it.

But if you don't hear from her, just go for it.

** I personally find that if you did your due diligence (e.g. Trying to contact the author and they didn't respond), you should be able to post it, so long you're giving credit.

This of course is my opinion. My hot take on that as well is that fanfiction authors have absolutely nothing to stand on since they use another authors work to create their own to begin with. Except against people who actually steal stuff word for word of course, which I don't think translating is.

** I have same problem with Northumbrian and Master Spy advenger. I have asked them multiple times (including PMs on FFnet) for permission to publish continuation of their unfinished stories, but I have never got a reply. So, I have acknowledged them as authors of the original work, published my stories, and if they ask for taking them down, I am ready to do it. So far, they haven't contacted me yet (although, I had unfortunate misunderstanding about this with Northumbrian once already before).
