Just to clarify I /don't/ want Snily and I /do/ want a story in which Snape doesn't join the Death Eater. It seems like every story with this plot has Snily


** It took me way too fucking long to figure out Snily was Snape x Lily, I thought Snily was some character or something.

#+begin_quote
  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** They Didn't Know We Were Seeds is the only one I'm currently aware of; both he and Lily are transported back in time, but they (as of this moment anyway, the fic is still in progress) aren't romantically engaged.

*** I stopped reading that after 2 chapters. Lily's behavior after waking up doesn't make much sense considering she just ‘survived' her husband's murder and her own suicide/sacrifice by Voldemort and doesn't know what happened to her only son. Then she gets on the express and sees James and... not a tear? Not a strained expression at seeing her de-aged husband and their friends? Just goes on as if nothing is wrong. Lily's there just to be with OP!Snape and her own time-traveling is just an excuse for him not feeling like a pedophile for pursuing a relationship with a child (and considering at which age each of them died that's still a considerable age difference)

** I don't suppose time traveling Snamione is any better? There's quite a few of those that would fit the bill

*** The ship name that I prefer, which doesn't make you want to tear your eyes out, is ‘Herus'. It is also a more accurate representation of who should be wearing the metaphorical pants in that relationship.
