Are there any fics in where Snape faces some consequences over his behavior against students? He doesn't have to get fired, I will accept Dumbledore getting mad at him or anyone calling him out on his shit. Umbridge firing him would be hilarious.


** Consequence for cause Cambangst has the best instance of Snape losing all his self-righteousness and 'the whole world hates me' angst I've ever seen.

"Why does Harry Potter hate you"

"He blames me for the deaths of his parents"

"Shouldn't he?"

Just two pages of Dumbledore going: "No, no, no. You /did/ do that to her and to yourself. You don't get to blame /me/ for it."

** I believe this happens in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus). He doesn't get fired but he does face consequences.

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

*** I would caution that the scene there is him getting chastised by Dan and Emma Granger, who use their muggle sensibility and basically disregard how important it is to keep him in the castle for the war. However there was a fic where Harry has inherited James' memories and passes the triwiz with the help of the sorting hat, in this fic a minor subplot is Harry turning the whole school against Snape (calling him out as joining the light side because of an infatuation with Lily and a quasi life debt to James as explanation to Dumbledore ) and is more or less successful. As a bonus you get fallout from that and Dumbledore's reaction.

** Any story where Snape gets fired (or at least called out on his bullshit teaching) is really fiddly. It all depends on how you address the fact that Dumbledore knows what's going on and he's allowing it anyway, because he's protecting Snape.

Does Dumbledore continue to protect Snape from scrutiny, or does he have a breaking point? How long does Dumbledore allow Snape to hold his high school grudge?

Snape doesn't get the job without Dumbledore. Full stop.
