(CWL = Child who lived)

Whether it's Neville or a twin of Harry or someone else... Harry simply isn't the one mentioned by the prophecy.

But he's also not dark or broody despite any hardships he may or may not have faced... he doesn't run off and join up with Voldemort at the first opportunity or run around talking about 'filthy muggles' or any non-sense like that. Not saying he can't dislike his family or Neville or Dumbledore or anybody else either... just doesn't go around letting that dislike define him.

Maybe he grows into his own and becomes something bigger and greater than anybody would expect him to be and creates a legend bigger than just "boy-who-lived!"

Preferably also not slash especially with people old enough to be his father or grandfather. Sirus, Remus, Snape, Tom Riddle, etc... I avoid any fic that has such people paired with Harry or even with Fem!Harry.


** I had been toying with an idea of Harry that was several years older than his sibling, the actual Child who lived and had no childhood due to the death of James and Lily.

He was a bit cold and distant, even to his brother but genuinely cared about his wellbeing, he just didn't really know how to deal with this child who for all intents and purposes caused the death of his mother and father.

A pragmatic powerhouse, considered a child genius not seen since Albus Dumbledore but with the stern disposition more like Minerva McGonagall when dealing with his infuriatingly unlucky sibling. Often angry out of worry.

-The doors to the side room exploded inwards silencing any protests and a cold draft caused the torches along the walls to flicker ominously. Charlie gulped as the tall figure of his elder brother stalked in, black robes with blue tie billowing in an unseen, probably magical wind, green eyes almost glowing with restrained fury, lips set in a razor thin line.

"Charlus Fleamont Potter, did or did you not put your damned name inside that fucking cup?" He hissed. It was soft, no louder than a whisper but to Charlie it might as well have been a Nundu's roar. He swallowed loudly and steeled himself, staring the seventh-year Ravenclaw in the eyes he took a deep breath. "No Harry. I did not."

"HE LIES!" Karkarov roared indignantly, "HE IS NOTHING BUT-"

Whatever he'd meant to say next died in his throat as an Ebony wand was pressed into his Adam's apple, tip glowing with arcane power. Harry's eyes remained locked with his brother's as he addressed the scraggly headmaster. "Have a care what you say, Igor Karkarov. Headmaster or not, I will not have a Death Eater tarnish our family name without irrefutable proof."

His shoulders sagged a little and he holstered his wand back inside his sleeve with a sigh. "Damnit Charlie, why is it always you?" He frowned, pulling his brother into a hug.-

It still need a LOT of work but this was a part I wrote for the Goblet of Fire.

I wanted to make it a pairing with Fleur during the fourth year with her moving in with Harry at Grimmauld place during the Order of the Phoenix.
