I've been reading Hermione/non-canon pairing-centric romance fanfics almost nonstop for about three weeks now, and in the most recent one, I've noticed that an incredibly common reason for Hermione ending up with [insert whatever character at the time] is because her relationship with Ron boils down to his expectation for her to become Molly #2 and provide for him/have bunches of babies/be a perfect housewife, and sort of leave behind her independence and forget who she is.

Short of re-reading the entire HP series, I'd like your opinion on this apparent trope in Hermione/non-canon fics. Obviously I'm used to seeing plenty of OOC from nearly every character, as few fics properly (/I'm still holding out for a "Lucius gets amnesia so he's not an asshole to muggle-borns anymore" romance fic/) portray the characters, or they'll exaggerate a character's flaws to make it fit better with their story.

So what do you think, honestly, about the above? Comparing books Ron vs. fics Ron, would he really be so selfish to want her to "get over" being a strong, smart woman in lieu of becoming the doting mother and wife? Would Hermione butt heads with Molly over how to be a proper Weasley woman? I would LOVE for someone to give an in-depth analysis of why it would or wouldn't make sense.


** I don't think there's any evidence that Ron would insist on Hermione becoming a homemaker. I doubt it, since Wizarding World has been egalitarian for much longer than Muggle. I can see Hermione clashing with Molly on this subject, with Ron being caught in between --- which could cause a breakup where both parties are pretty sympathetic.

What I wonder is, are there any fics where they break up and it's largely /Hermione's/ fault, not with cheating or anything like that, but, say, with lack of respect for Ron? For example, Ron goes on a week-long magical wilderness survival and evasion exercise, as a part of his Auror training. He comes home, dead tired, only to discover that Hermione has, in the meantime, picked out and rented an apartment for them to move into, without ever consulting him. (It seems like a very Hermione thing to do.) Now, she gives a hundred rational reasons for why this is an excellent choice and an excellent deal --- and she is right, but the fact that she made an important decision for both, and not for the first time, causes a blow-up.

** We don't know. Molly is not detailed enough for us to really understand her opinion in this matter. And Ron is also not very clear in what he wants in a wife. So we don't know how they will react/ might have reacted in canon.

What we do know however is that Hermione won't settle for being a housewife. So if you are going to break them up and you don't want to bash Ron by making him cheat on her, then this difference of opinion is the closest you can come to a canon-compliant reason for their break-up.

It at least makes sense that Hermione would break up over this, so it's already far more realistic than other reasons you can come up with.

** Ron could go either way, the problem being that he remained fairly two dimensional in the books at times. Actually I am surprised that Ron doesn't get written to become Arthur ver. 2 instead. After all there's whole 'men marry women who remind them of their mothers' and Ron's role model for a loving relationship is that of a henpecked husband who hides from a hypercritical wife and for the woman in his life to be controlling and domineering. Plus if Molly was in charge of her husband's salary, then Ron might be comfortable in a situation where Hermione controls all the income/power in the relationship and lists out every chore she expects him to do before she gets home from work.

*** the theme of men marrying women like their mothers extends to Harry, too.

**** I don't think Lily and Ginny have all that much in common besides being redheads and "feisty".

** This might not answer your question exactly, but I think the reason it's so common is because it's an easy way to highlight the qualities (the intellect, mystery, woobiness, etc.) of the other man, as opposed to a boring, narrow-minded Ron. He exists as a weak foil. And this being fanfiction... don't expect a lot of nuance.

** I find that it's mostly bullshit vilification (as bashing usually is). In fact, while Ron can be a bit indignant about being showed up, it's something he starts to grow out of as his character develops, and he seems to be more in awe of Hermione's talents than anything by the time they actually get together. Whit that in mind it's unlikely, I think.

At least it's not as stupid as /"Ron's got such bad table manners, better shag Draco instead"/.

** Ginny comes to mind, as maybe an obvious reason why this common plot point might not work. Just a thought after I posted. :) I'd still really love an informed opinion on this whole thing.

** The story I am going to mention is not a HG/RW story and I know you aren't looking for recommendations so please feel free to disregard this opinion. However, in the spirit of holding out for a decent Lucius but still having a badass Hermione I'm going to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.nets/8311387/1/][Roundabout Destiny]]. The reason is because as a strong female character, Hermione has lots of influence in this alternative universe. So much so that the characters gravitate toward a different path. I really loved it!

*** I've never honestly read a Hermione/Sirius fic, so I'll happily add it to my ever-expanding list of ones to read. Thank you! :)

**** I also have to recommend this wholeheartedly, with a hope that you'll bump up the importance. It's /excellent/. There is some HG/LM in the beginning, and while it doesn't last, it solidifies into a firm friendship-but-kinda-more, which will make more sense when you get further into it.

***** Worry not! I began a new one this morning that I've been looking toward for ages, and there's another after this one, then I'll happily move onto your recommendation. :) I tend to clear out the 200k-word-range fics in about two days if I'm not working, so they'll be out of they way soon enough.
