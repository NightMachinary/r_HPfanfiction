Basically I want to read a fanfic where Harry gets pushed over the edge and there is instant regret for the offending party. In most fanfics that I read where Harry gets angry it just makes the opposing party taunt him more (Malfoy, Snape etc.). The more dramatic the better (the whole "cloud passing over the sun" kind of thing). Also bonus points if it is in the great hall or somewhere else public. Thank you!


** For Lack of a Bezoar has most of what you're looking for. There isn't instant regret, but Harry gets pushed over the edge and becomes scary for the opposite party.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** It's not an angry Harry story, but the one where angry [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11636560/1/It-s-Always-The-Quiet-Ones][Lovegood goes Lovecraft]] in the dining hall is a favourite.
