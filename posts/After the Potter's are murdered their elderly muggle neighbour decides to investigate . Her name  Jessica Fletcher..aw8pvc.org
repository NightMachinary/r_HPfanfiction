***** She has a lot of fully grown nieces and nephews which probably puts the character in the sixties-seventies range.

** I'll give gold to anyone that makes a decent attempt at this. I think you'll find she probably would have ended up moving in mere days before the killing though. They don't call her 'The Angel Of Death' for nothing and her presence in the area would start causing murders within a few days.

** On a side note, I think a convincing case could be made for Jessica Fletcher being a serial killer. I mean, seriously, she lives in a small town in Maine with a population of 3,500 and comes across 274 killings.

So, in that case, maybe Harry Potter was raised by a serial killer too.

**** At least Poirot was an actual police officer turned private investigator.

That said, your point is not incorrect; in fact, you could make the argument that any non-homicide detective who has a mystery series where they solve a lot of murders may well actually be a serial killer.
