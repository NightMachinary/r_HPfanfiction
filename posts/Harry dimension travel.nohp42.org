** I think these dimensional travels fit your request:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]]: Harry falls through the Veil several years later and joins Sirius in a new dimension. Voldemort is still around there, but has trouble with "that fucker".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]]: Harry falls through the Veil several years later and joins Sirius in a new dimension. They meet a good Tom Riddle and new villains there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12972342/1/A-Step-to-the-Right][A Step to the Right]]: Postwar Harry and Hermione dimensional-time travel to a very different world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]]: Traumatized postwar Harry meets his parents in another universe where their Harry is dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]]: This new dimension is freaking dark and evil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4849382/1/Inverted][Inverted]]: Unspeakables Harry and Ginny swap bodies with their counterparts in another dimension where Tom Riddle is good and Dumbledore evil.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]: Badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a very different universe during the Horcrux hunt. It's a very emotional and sad piece that should meet your request the best

#+begin_quote
  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.
