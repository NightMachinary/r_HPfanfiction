I recall someone being mentioned to have been cursed to only speak in limericks. Another cursed to not be able to put a book down.

Here's a list of curses I think would be more interesting than the average curse:

- Cursed to use just the worst grammar, or drop a word from your sentence
- blood boiling, i.e. you're so mad your blood is figuratively boiling
- Cursed to not stop pooping
- insomnia
- An unhealthy amount of optimism
- color blindness. Double color blindness for those already color blind.
- cursed to never or always feel hunger or thirst
- Butterfingers
- cursed to always get ripped off when haggling
- Dyslexia
- fingernails / toenails grow backwards
- food rots around you sometimes, or your food occasionally goes bad while you're chewing
- people can hear you think
- No one trusts anything you say anymore
- Cowardly decisions seem 1000x more attractive
- You're no longer good at quidditch
- Ordinary items insult you, but only you can hear them
- you only thought you were writing in English. But it's incomprehensible Cthulhu language that really really freaks out everyone else

It just seems like fanfiction authors have fallen in complacency with blood boiling (matter state change, not mood), bone breaking curses, organ rotting, or entrail expelling. Oh oh I saw one interesting take on the entrail expelling curse - dude freaking shat himself. It expelled the contents of his entails, get it? I think. He may have shat his intestines out, I don't know anymore. Either way, I thought it interesting.

I hope you enjoyed my Ted talk on fucking weird curses. I'm pretty tired.


** Most of the curses used by authors are for when in the middle of combat, where the goal is to incapacitate the opponent.

*** A note to add:

Most fanfics are set at hogwarts where cursing another student will get you in big trouble.

** I have to say the “unhealthy amount of optimism” made me laugh. Let me see if I can come up with a few more: singing every word, hiccups, farting a lot, skipping, unable to speak/write in present tense, unable to speak words longer than two syllables...

Maybe I'll add more later.

*** Optimism?

Hermione bit her lip, "Harry, are you sure this is a good idea?"

Harry swivelled his head to give her a strange look. "Hermione, it's Snape's birthday! Even if he doesn't like students, I can't imagine him being mad for us getting him a cake."

Hermione opened her mouth as several emotions passed on her face before closing her mouth without saying a word. The two continued their abrupt journe.y Little did they know they were about to be the second person to bring Snape cake that day.

The first was Luna Lovegood.

** Limerick curse would be pretty difficult to get rid of, as it would mess up the pronunciation of almost all incantations.

** Curses to drive someone slowly insane:

to only ever hear your name slightly mispronounced in the mouths of others

to perceive all objects slightly to the left of where they actually are

to constantly have the sensation of someone looking at you

to believe yourself a legilimens and nobody thinks well of you

to be unable to hear the word 'the' in ordinary conversation

to be unable to hear alarm clocks or anything that chimes the hour

Oh, and the entrails expelling curse? Started out as the Undoing Charm, with which a wizard out hunting can dress a carcass and sort and stack the offal and umbles with a single spell. It becomes the entrails-expelling curse if you use it on a live opponent in a fight and power it with malice (hatred, aggression, reactive fear, emotions like that there).

** Curse to smell your favorite foods but only when you're hungry but unable to eat at that time. Curse to put water in your opponents ears Curse to give someone charley horses at inopportune moments

Reminds me of an idea of a side effect for weasley wizard wheezes love potion: puts real butterflies in your stomach, to be released when they talk to their new crush.
