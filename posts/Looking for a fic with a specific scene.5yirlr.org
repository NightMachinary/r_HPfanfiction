I'm looking for a fic which all I remember of is a duel scene in a muggle neighborhood between Dumbles and Voldy.

The Death Eaters attacked a muggle village, Dumbledore + Aurors and Co. arrived. Some muggle tried and failed to shoot Voldemort, and then he and Dumbledore dueled in, around, and on top of the muggle's blown apart house. Dumbledore got shot by a police officer, and him and Voldemort then apparated and fought in the Department of Mysteries. After being shot, Dumbledore was sent to a squib doctor who lived in the muggle world, and had brain surgery. It might have been one of Blueowl's longer stories, I'm not sure.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.
