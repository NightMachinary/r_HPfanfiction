I just realized that Hufflepuff sounds like a Pokémon name. So have there ever been fanfics that mention this? Perhaps some muggleborns giggling at the name the first time they hear it? Or maybe Helga Hufflepuff is a Pokémon master and Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff were named in honor of her?

On another note, are there any good HP and Pokémon crossovers?

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

** Linkffn(9305868)

(First series done, now just starting on the 5th book)

May i introduce you to the best Harry potter and Pokemon crossovers. It manages to merge both concepts superbly. In many ways it follows the plot of the HP books but is placed in the Pokemon setting. Wizarding britain is turned into the region Avalon, the Death Eaters become Team Nocturne and many characters from the game are ported over
