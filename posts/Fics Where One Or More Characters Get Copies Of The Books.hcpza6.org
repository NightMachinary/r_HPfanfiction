So, one of my favorite fics is the sadly unfinished A Little Light Reading by dullastacks, in which Snape gets a copy of /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/ towards the end of Harry's first year at Hogwarts.

Very recently I learned that there was another such fic, A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel. I...confess that I don't much care for that fic, but still, it's using the same format, which up until now I'd thought was unique to A Little Light Reading. Given that I do have plans to write my own fic using that plot element, I'm looking for links to other such fics, so I can know what's been done before and what to avoid or downplay and such.


** I tried to read such a story, but gave up after a short time, I find the whole concept incredibly boring. I'm sorry that I can't help you there, I'll jump right away if I see only a hint of something like it.

** Here's a fic you have reminded me of that I started ages ago but fell behind waiting for updates. It appears it is finished now so I'm going to go back and read it all now.

  Harry is lost back in time with four people he felt he really should remember...with no memory and only seven books to find out the truth of his life, before it's too late to save his new family. A reading the book series with no actual book usage, for a copy that does contain parts of the book easier to follow along, shoot me your email address and I'll send it along.
