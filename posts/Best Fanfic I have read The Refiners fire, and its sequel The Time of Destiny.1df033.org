Its A/U, Powerful!Harry.

Its does a great job of balancing fluff with angst. Amazing job at showing that everyone isn't perfect. One of the first fanfics (other than Dumbledores Army and the Year of Darkness) that truly made me cry.

It is INSANELY long. 400k words for The Refiners fire (a lot of Author's notes on the top of each chapter) and 600k words for The Time of destiny.

Check it out

** I started rereading this and it really annoys me how childlike the characters are. And thing start to happen unreasonably fast between harry and ginny. While it is definitely a good fic, I would argue its title as 'the best.'

*** To each their own.

I think that it was rushed on purpose. but I can see where that it could be annoying

**** The line is where 'rushed' becomes 'forced.'

The transition between Casey and Ginny happens within the same chapter. Way too fast.

***** I'd have to re-read it. But if the 'refiner's fire' happens in between (which if I remember correctly it does) Harry perceives his relationship with Casey as it happened "five years ago." Also she comforts him, which hastens their relationship.

It's is definitely approaching forced, but I think it stays this side of rushed.

** I've been giving this fic another chance, since I'm out of other options. Gave up on it last time I tried, maybe a year ago, because I found it too fluffy.

If like me, you do not enjoy fluff... there is still a pretty good story underneath it here; skimming helps.

*** It's a great story and I'd definitely recommend reading it but I'll just warn you that there are a fuckton of hospital scenes and it gets a little tedious after a while.
