I recently read linkffn(Moratorium by Darkpetal16), and actually found it quite interesting. I'm wondering if there are more stories like this, with:

- A sane young Riddle in the Diary
- Who actually talks to / works with a "good" guy (probably Harry, but I'd be totally fine with Ginny)

A relationship (like in Moratorium) is okay, slash is acceptable, mpreg isn't. I'm okay with a dark-ish theme, but if the pair isn't /outright/ evil I'd prefer it.

**** I always feel bad recommending this because it usually fills a niche request that would spoil it.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.
