I was reading a post the other day about how Harry Potter has books, movies, and even puppet pals and that got me thinking.

A T.V series.

It wouldn't focus on the main point of the books/movies but it would focus on their lives 'off screen'.

Each season is a different year and it shows what the golden trio and even their year mates do when they aren't putting their lives in danger and being normal-ish humans.

Lovers quarrels, studying for an exam, fights between friends, exploring the castle in first year, crying over due homework. Just stuff normal people do in school.

At this point I just need more Harry Potter content.


** I've thought about this before. But I think the TV series should be set in the Marauder's Era. I think I'd like it to be an interpretation of The Life and Times by Jewel5. linkffn(5200789)

*** Huh, I can see JKR allowing something in the Mauraders Era. Not necessarily along the lines of the linked story but in general. It would leave most of canon untouched and let her try curating scripts for a full season or more of television.

So far she has books (original) and movies (Fantastic Beasts). TV seems like a natural further step, and is something people would probably love, and seems very doable after Game of Thrones and Witcher....and all the other book settings turned into TV.

**** Oh yeah, I just watched the first episode of Witcher. Seems great! And it kind of makes me want a TV series set in the times of Hogwarts founding too (not as much as I would love to see the Marauders), but it would pretty cool to see some destiny-themed story where the four founders start out with their own stories and are eventually brought together. Would be cool to see some fight scene with the basilisk. Or maybe baby basilisk? lol

***** I am waiting on Witcher until I have a few hours in which I can focus on it. But I have heard a lot of good reviews of it.

I never considered Founders' Era....I have read almost no fanfiction for it, admittedly mostly because I have no emotional interest in it to spend the time to try it.

One huge benefit of it might be the ability to bring in all sorts of 'ancient' magic and concepts and traditions and such which have been lost to current magicals.....it could even have themes of deminishment ala Tolkein which would add some darker background theme that could be presented almost subliminally.

Huh, you have my imagination spinning up all sorts of scenarios! I might have to do a dive into Founders' Era fic soon...

**** What if it was set with a (say, 15 year old) Tonks as the main character? That would be old enough to have the Harry Potter world backdrop & some of our familiar supporting cast & lore, while also adding depth to things briefly mentioned in the backdrop, while also avoiding stepping too much on canon's toes and at the same time avoiding the Problem of Pettigrew.

Tonks as a clumsy yet talented person with a unique/rare talent & defined ambition would be a good lead too - she's also halfblood of Pureblood and immediately muggleborn stock for a foot in both worlds vibe, and if we could see her dating other people it would soften her eventual relationship with Remus. Also a soft focus on Andromeda would set us up for welcoming her into Harry's family post-DH. (I think I've convinced myself, I hadn't thought of all of these when I started writing this comment!)

***** I like that for a +'20 years later'+ reboot revival. (Edit - we are already 22 years after the first book, 12 years after the last! So '40 years later'?)

Didn't Rowling say something like she didn't want to touch the original series years again? That might be me taking something totally different she said out of all context....

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** I could be into one focused on those collecting info for and reporting on the resistance radio news in DH. Something which concerns me w TV shows is that is if they don't have a very obvious end-point they will go on too long and ruin themselves so I'd want it to be something somewhat contained like that - war ends, TV show ends, done.

*** I feel like I wouldn't want it to end after the war. Imagine how cool it would be if it continued and went from first year through to seventh year then showed them getting jobs and all the weird stuff young adults do in their spare time.

I know I'm probably getting ahead of myself but it would be so cool to watch them get over the war, study, move, get jobs, go out shopping, weasley weddings, night life.

This is honestly more fantasy than "it could really happen"

*** Hopefully not. It's not that hard, all she'd have to to do is send out a survey to 11-17 year old and ask to what they do during school and the drama that goes on.
