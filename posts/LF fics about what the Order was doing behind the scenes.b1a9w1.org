from the time period after voldemort was resurrected in GoF until the end of the war. especially what Dumbledore told them about Harry and why they had to place all their faith in him. Were the details of the prophecy even common knowledge for all members of the Order?


** Not really prophecy focused, though there is stuff about guarding the prophecy, but this fic is excellent: [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2339&chapno=1]]

** The details of the prophecy weren't known outside of Dumbledore, not with any specificity. They just knew it involved Harry and Voldemort, some kind of information crucial enough Voldemort was risking exposure to obtain.
