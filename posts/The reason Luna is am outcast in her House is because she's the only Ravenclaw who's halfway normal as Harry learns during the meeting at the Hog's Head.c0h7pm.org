** Somehow I'm picturing the whole Ravenclaw house wearing colonial hats and anti-elephant riffles hunting Luna in the forbidden forrest.

Could probably make a decent survival.

I was inspired.

--------------

The people living in Wizard Great Britain are not, by and at large, a curious lot - and that's why, when the Magical Law Enforcement Squad was called in to deal with a disturbance near Ottery St Catchpole, they wrote off Pandora Lovegood's death as due to an "experimental spell backfiring".

She was, after all, a known spellcrafter, and a wee bit touched in the head. She probably forgot to take all the necessary precautions, or maybe got distracted partway: these things, while sad, still happen.

Once little Luna reappeared, after a week, the wizards involved with the investigation decided that there was nothing more to it: her case was open-and-shut.

Something else, though, was opened, and never completely closed.

Pandora, true to her name, unsealed a certain peculiar box: a gift from her husband Xenophilius, who had stumbled across it - literally - during his lifelong search for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. "She will definitely be interested in this", he said to himself, after getting up from his pratfall and noticing that a magical board game what was made him trip.

She was.

"Do not begin unless you inten- oh, Luna, don't touch that, it might be dangerous!"
