** Canonically, no. There's no way to kill the horcrux directly. Remember that what destroys a Horcrux isn't the Killing curse or basilisk venom etc themselves. Rather what destroys a Horcrux is the destruction of its container. With a living container that means death. For example when Harry was injected with basilisk venom in CoS it didn't do anything to the Horcrux because Harry didn't die.

The only way to destroy the Horcrux in Harry's scar is for Harry to die.

Voldemort being the one to cast the spell was part of the key to Harry coming back to life afterwards (in combination with Lily's magic in Voldemort's blood anchoring Harry to life), but not to destroy the Horcrux itself. Death by any means is sufficient for that.

Well, if I recall Deathly Hallows correctly, isn't remorse of the creator a way to destroy a Horcrux? This, to me, suggests that TWO methods of Horcrux destruction were done simultaneously. First is the death of the Living Horcrux. Pretty self-explanatory. The second depends on interpretation. If Voldemort kills his own Living Horcrux, that could be seen as a sign of remorse, and destroy the Horcrux without necessarily harming the Horcrux container. This /probably/ *isn't* enough to allow Harry to live, but it's an interesting thought experiment.

**** Technically remorse isn't a way of destroying a horcrux but rather merging it back with the master soul.

***** Ah. Been awhile since I read it, and my copy is currently in a box in a storage unit...

But wait, isn't a horcrux just a bit of separated soul bound to an object? So merging back with the master soul is a form of destruction, [[https://youtu.be/P2PtoWbNsaI?t=30s][from a certain point of view]]. Still, an interesting little thought experiment.

*** What if Harry becomes undead? Would that suffice? Technically a vampire /is/ dead. So would Harry becoming a vampire kill the horcrux?

** The general consensus is that the container must be destroyed for the Horcrux to be destroyed. This would mean Harry dying. However I have always been curious if harry could die for 5 seconds and then be brought back to life. Think.. your heart stopping and then being shocked back to beating (the muggle way). I am sure in the magical world its possible to briefly die and be brought back as well.

So then... how dead is truly dead? How dead is necessary for the destruction of the Horcrux?.

All interesting questions. But at the end of the day as others have said, you can pretty much go off in a variety of other directions.

For example.. the Horcrux attaches itself to the host, so why would it not be possible to unattach it in some way without killing the host. Or transfer it from one host to another? Or even alter the host in such a way that the Horcrux can no longer survive attached to that particular host. None of these things really break cannon because cannon simply doesnt contain enough information to invalidate them.

*** I doubt medical death is enough for Living Horcrux Destruction. I mean, this is a world that has proof of /souls/.

I'm not sure /what/ definition of dead is used, but probably the one that is capital-D Dead.

*** If I recall correclty, the wording used in canon is that the Horcrux's vessel must be destroyed "beyond repair". If Harry "died" in a way that could allow his heart to be reinnervated, then it wouldn't be beyond repair, so it presumably wouldn't work.

**** Interesting. Ive seen a few where he goes back in time and it automatically erases the Horcrux because for whatever reason it cant travel with him (due to being linked to a particular time, or having the attachment to Voldemort or whatever). But I have never come across one where he AK's himself to kill the Horcrux as a sacrifice for the travel.

Got any good recommendations of stories like that?

*** Harry didn't cast it himself but in Faery Heros linkffn(8233288) he has one of his friends, Luna I think cast it on him.

** You can do whatever you want in your fics, and it'll probably be better foreshadowed than Harry's resurrection.

Bu if you care about canon, it says (Deathly Hallows ch 35):

#+begin_quote
  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
#+end_quote

Which suggests that Voldemort is Harry's horcrux, effectively, and anyone could have cast the Killing Curse on Harry to get the same result.

** In canon, Dumbledore spent a couple years thinking about this issue and decided the only way to remove the soul fragment from Harry was for him to walking up to Voldemort and take a killing curse from him.

I and many readers have problem with this solution:

1. We do not believe Dumbledore is all mighty and all knowing. He was also working alone.

2. Harry was never a properly made Horcrux, he only had a soul fragment latched on to him accidentally. Dumbledore never seemed to take that into consideration canonically.

3. Having Harry walking up to Voldemort seemed quite risky to me. What would happen if Voldemort decided to interrogate Harry just a little? With Harry's lousy occlumency, Voldemort would have easily found out the truth and won.

4. Killing curse was the not only way to kill someone. Voldemort already tried it a few times before and failed, why should we assume he would keep doing that? A sectumsepra across Harry's neck or dropping a heavy rock on his head would certainly kill Harry, blood protection or not.

--------------

As a result, fanfic writers have come up with many solutions:

- Assume the Horcrux was localized in his scar, then use muggle surgery to remove it

- Apply basilisk venom to the scar, and when Harry is 'sufficiently' dead, use Phoenix tear to heal him.

- Stage a fight with Voldemort and get 'accidentally' hit by a killing curse.

- Assume wizards define death as heart stop beating, so use muggle means to stop his heart artificially and revive him with CPR 5-10 minutes later.

- Use a dementor to suck out the soul fragment from the scar.

- Develop or find rituals to exorcise the soul fragment.

- Develop rituals and use Harry's link to Voldemort to attack Voldemort's main soul directly.

- In fics where Voldemort was sensible enough to use a random rock for one of his Horcruxes, Dumbledore's canon Horcrux hunting would be completely screwed. The solution was to trap his soul in an object, and work on Harry's scar without too much pressure.

- In one fic, they did a complete obliviation on Voldemort, didn't bother with Harry's scar.

--------------

Of all the above mentioned fanfic solutions, having Harry fight Voldemort and getting hit by a killing curse is probably the most reasonable one IMO. It doesn't violate canon in any way, it doesn't require more explanations, and it is guaranteed to work. In addition, Harry would have other people protecting him when he woke up again. He wouldn't need a lying Narcissa to save his life.

**** As I said in my comment, some fics assume the soul fragment was localized in the scar, so it could be simply cut out.

It doesn't necessarily represent my interpretation, since I'm just responding to OP's question about alternative means of removing that soul fragment from Harry.

** Well, the canon magic system is just whatever is most convenient for Rowling at the time.

I personally like to think that an AK with the intent of killing Voldemort's soul piece inside Harry would work. I don't think it's canon but i don't care much for the canon magic system, simply because it's unrefined and at times just doesn't make any sense.

It has been a while since i actually read the books and my understanding of the original magic system is probably extremely warped by the sheer amount of fanfiction i've read but IIRC it's never really explained how the Ak works, how exactly it kills and how much intent matters.

I think it's futile to even try to attempt to make sense of it all and just go with your own personal magic system that leans on the basic canon ideas.

** Well, that depends. Someone casting the curse at Harry alone would not /just/ destroy the Horcrux, but also kill Harry. However, when Harry got hit with the curse and "died" he was brought back through because of the whole "love" bs.

Basically, if you get some family member to sacrifice themselves for you... your good! No deaths for you!
