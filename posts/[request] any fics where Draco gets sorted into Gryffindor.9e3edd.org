Only good one I've read where this happens is the innocent series.

I don't have any other criteria beyond no slash.


** The only one I know is Like a Brother by Colubrina. I believe she's taken it down. You can try messaging her and asking for a copy. She asks that people not save or share her stories.

*** I didn't take it down. It's still on FFN. But it's abandoned and I have no intention of completing it, so you might find that frustrating.

** The Dangerverse (first one is called Living with Danger) has Draco sorted into Gryffindor. He's adopted by Remus Lupin & Co from the beginning, though, so it might not be what you are looking for. The first book is also pretty hard to get through, at first, but the author's writing gets better and better as the series goes on. It's one of my favorites, actually!
