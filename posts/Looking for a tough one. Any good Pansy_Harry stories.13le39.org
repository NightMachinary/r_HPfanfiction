I'm currently writing a Pansy/Harry story but always like to read other stories to get a feel between the two. Any suggestions?


** You mean besides [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/][White Knight, Grey Queen]]?

Also, LiraSnape used to have awesome lists of lists. She hasn't updated them in quite a while, but if you haven't been there yet you should check them out. [[http://lira-snape.livejournal.com/4093.html#Pansy]]
