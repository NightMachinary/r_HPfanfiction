I'm interested in how Wizardkind would adapt to an alien world, how they would build up their homes and businesses, the advances in magical 'technology' they would make to aid them in this, like building flying sleds to transport wood they harvest from forests, or how they would use magic to mine ore, smith it into items that they would then enchant and so on. I am aware of the fanfiction Starship Hedwig linkffn(7135971), but I was hoping if there were any more like this?


** linkffn(Browncoat Green-eyes) its a xover, but so oh well done. Its really one of my favorite all time xovers from all universes.
