:END:
I'm looking for a story where Harry escapes from Britain and travels the world. However, in his travels, while he is facing off with dark wizards and other opponents (in disguise), he accidentally continually defeats them without realizing it. Through no purposeful means of his own, he becomes a masked vigilante who is feared and revered for his actions.

Some details from the story to help narrow it down, are:

-he meets a doctor and his much more intelligent sidekick; they possibly travel around in a magical blimp that was basically a flying laboratory where they did research for the doctor

-at one point they are in Egypt---he ran into Bill at some point and they spoke while Bill wasn't aware of who we was

-the wizard who helps him get out of Britain has many brothers who appear where Harry travels and help him out

-Aurors from all over the world are searching for him as this super skilled wizard and from Harry's point of view he is just going along doing his own thing

-unbeknownst to Harry, Death Eaters keep showing up and dying (inadvertently because of something he did) in the most ridiculous ways

-he wore a talisman or something that made him unrecognizable and masked his magic (the Trace)

-definitely on FFN

-pretty sure it takes place right after OOTP

To cap it off, it is a funny, super ridiculous story that I somehow got hooked onto and am trying to track down.


** Linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot)

Definitely this one.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

**** Check the sequel from the same author and there is also an unofficial sequel "Terminal Justice" (unfortunately not complete but almost so it's not too much of a problem) to the latter which is crossover with DC (particularly Justice League Animated Series from early 2000s).

**** Theres actually a whole set of fanfics that follow the same story line of Mr. Black, and a good majority of them are fantastic. Terminal Justice is the best one, in my humble opinion.

**** I don't think I've ever re-read a fic. There's always more to discover. My list of fics to read is over 200 long and growing, not shrinking.
