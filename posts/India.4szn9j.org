  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** I actually have a mini-history of magical India for the Animagus-Verse that I haven't had occasion to use yet. Basically, while the European magical governments have mostly adapted to modern borders thanks to Grindelwald's War, what was once British India is now a loose confederation of a dozen or so pre-colonial kingdoms, colonial-era princely states, and modern Ministries of Magic. Maybe I'll try to work it into /Animagus at War/, since that story will have a much bigger ICW role.

**** Nice! I can't wait for that fic, by the way, How many chapters will The Accidental Animagus have. Oh, yeah, I should ask you, could I audioread The Arithmancer, Lady Archimedes, The Accidental Animagus, and Animagus at War for the HP FanFiction Audiobook Project? Info is in the sidebar.

******* If you don't mind my terrible British accent, I'd be happy to. My only caveat is that I'd like to cut my teeth on a smallish part like Mr. Granger in /The Arithmancer/ until I get a feel for what the time commitment will be. I'll be able to make a better call when you have an official parts list for that story.
