thats it. i just cant find anything atm that isnt crappy, or that feels crappy. im spending hours each night opening and closing tabs and browsing reddit and i just cant find anything.

if prefrences help to narrow it down: i like good aus, abused harry tropes, severitus, slash, time travel, dimension travel, do overs. my favourite fic is probably the second string (i think thats what its called)


** My favourite dimension travel fic:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/552828/chapters/985108][Stunning Shifts by mindcandy]]

#+begin_quote
  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

#+begin_quote
  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

**** No problem! Omg Recnac is so painful. I usually don't like abuse fics but I couldn't put it down. Have you read the alternate sad ending? And The Best Revenge's sequel?

I've thought of a few more fics. If you're okay with crossovers, linkao3(Whispers in Corners) is really good. I didn't even watch Sherlock but really enjoyed it. And linkao3(Master of Death) is incomplete but great. linkao3(At the Crossroads There We'll Meet) is a neat take on time travel/fix its. Since you said you like Severitus I'm not sure if you'd be down for Snarry but this fic is just so good linkao3(The Boy Who Died a Lot).
