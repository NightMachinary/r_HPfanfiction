There was a discussion here a few months ago I think and the main point that I remember was that magic is difficult because most people lack the skill to truly visualize the spells.

Edit: ok I just read what u had written. The main point was imagination. Like if you can't imagine the outcome and visualize what will happen it won't happen.

** Haha thanks to [[/u/XeshTrill][u/XeshTrill]] on the heads up. I've written extensively on this topic -- please find the document here:

[[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gy6FOtx28w3JPDeDBOcch0fpuvTEnNwr]]

I don't think this is the thing you were thinking of - visualisation is not a major part of my theory - but you may be interested nonetheless.

(Document is a WIP but the section on what makes magic difficult is complete.)

*** Good job, but at least by my opinion, some things are taken for truth just because, axiom-style.

EG, "The Trace is unable to track you after you turn 17". There is at least some possibility the Trace is just juridical thing. As in, it /could/ track all mages (in some area) but is tuned somehow to to in only to "younger than". It even is mentioned in the following quote about that way(mage law, no tracking after 17).

Same with AK; why can`t in work/not work depending on emotional state, not age.

The quote you chose for "wizard soesnt have to use wand" from DH24... The line before, there was a question "can you use wand that didnt choose you", so while still ambiguous, it doesnt state "tools other than wands" as strongly.

Et cetera.

**** u/Taure:

#+end_quote

The Trace is on the person and breaks automatically at 17, without any Ministry involvement.

#+end_quote

For the reason described in the document: fake!Moody is sure that /none/ of the class would be capable of casting it in Fourth Year. The only common factor to the entire class is their age. If it was emotional state or skill with magic, probably a few fourth years /would/ be able to cast it.

** Visualization is only one part, and probably more relevant to transfiguration and summoning charms. A big component is understanding the theory behind a certain spell. That's why Hermione was insistent in GoF that if Harry got more acquainted with the theory of it, Summoning Charms should become easier for him.

** There are a lot of things besides visualization I imagine that can hinder success such as; Emotions, Focus, Fatigue, Mentality, but Visualization is probably a big part of it.

** Well thanks everyone. Especially [[/u/taure][u/taure]] , I will read that. However it's not really what I was looking for, as I was searching for a discussion here that put forth imagination as the primary reason for difficulty. Also if there's anything on the way hpmor deals with magic do tell me, because I really enjoyed it.
