Loosely based on Madame Secretary

Ok kinda weird but hear me out

20 years after Voldemort's defeat and 10 years since leaving the Chief Auror's Unit. Harry Potter was content being a teacher of Defense Against The Dark Arts with his wife Ginny, and three kids. That is until his good friend(and minister of magic) Hermione Granger comes in and tells him that the previous Head Of the IMC was found dead in his chambers and she needs a replacement. As a favor to his friend, he takes the job and all that comes with it(including Draco Malloy as his new chief of staff). With Teddy as his new assistant and a staff who don't really like him, Harry now has to juggle international issues and raising a family.


** Honestly it can be whoever you want lol, should I turn this into a one shot or something?
