Doesn't have to be a confounding ward or anything but something that makes the students think Snape is docking useless points instead of the reasonable deductions Snape is actually doing

Maybe set by an angry student a few years back?


** Jared was pissed. His potion was perfect, and Professor Snape had yelled at him because of ONE LITTLE INGREDIENT, and ended up failing him for the entire thing! Jared was a fifth year, and needed all the good grades that he could get. The Ravenclaw hatched a plan. It took him months for his plan to work, but now he had it where he wanted it. It was dark out, and Jared snuck out to the dungeons. He set down his wards that would make Professor Snape speak Gibberish while in his own classroom. Except for one little thing... When Jared had walked into his next potions class, there was something wrong. He was speaking perfect English? Within the next hour, Jared found out where his problem laid. Instead of speaking weirdly, the room made it so when Professor Snape took points, it wasn't for the perfectly logical reasons that he would be taking them for, but for petty reasons. Extremely petty.

**** ? I didn't think that much into it, but I think that Jared would've taken Ancient Runes and Arithmancy*. Maybe, or Maybe not. Jared was just a name to fill a space.

****** Oh, that sounds like fun! I'm on Mobile, so that's my excuse for the poor formating. Apologies for my confusion!

Last year Jared made a poor choice. Arithmancy and Divination (so he could focus on Arithmancy) for his Extracurriculars. Today was his first day in Divination. It was a JOKE of a class. His elder Claws warned him, but Jared and his stubborn self just continued. After realizing that this class would do nothing for him, and these poor half-dead students, he plotted.

It was a week later, and Jared had found something amusing to do. For that entire year, he had charmed the professor to speak a different language each week. French, Spanish, Polish, German, Portuguese, Russian, so on and so forth. She had noticed, and brought the concern up to Minerva. Minerva, who found this amusing and harmless(SCORE!), recommended some helpless charges for the woman. After the Divination Professor gave up (20 weeks and 3 days in), and questioned the Charms professor about it, she suddenly began speaking in Sonnets. Not that she knew how, but she soon learned. And that, boys and girls, is how Professor Trewalney* and the 3rd year Divination Class learned 21 languages and how to form sonnets.
