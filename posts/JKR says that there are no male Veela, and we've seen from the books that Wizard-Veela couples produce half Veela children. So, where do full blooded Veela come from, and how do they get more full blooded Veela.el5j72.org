#+TITLE: JKR says that there are no male Veela, and we've seen from the books that Wizard-Veela couples produce half Veela children. So, where do full blooded Veela come from, and how do they get more full blooded Veela?

*** I suppose, but then Fleur would have to hide her full Veela status (and that of her female children) from the Brittish MoM. They have all those pesky laws about only humans being allowed to carry wands. I feel like Fleur and Bill would have just stayed in France if that were the case.

Also just a note:

There are no "half-veela" or "quarter-veela" in cannon. There is only an assumption by Harry and friends that she is not a full Veela.

*** I wouldn't call the Asari asexual. The mental bonds they use for recreation are not only their version of sex, from all implications it is also highly sexual.

And I certainly wouldn't call a culture where a significant percentage becomes "dancers" asexual. And it is widespread enough for Aethyta to complain about (and be disgraced for holding that opinion).

But I agree on that being the general principle of Veela recreation and even used it in fics.

**** I think they were more referring to the scientific definition of asexual as meaning reproduction without a partner, rather than the social definition.

Asari reproduction is officially (I think) referred to as a form of parthenogenesis. Though parthenogenesis on earth is an asexual process, the Asari version does not produce perfect clones of the mother and does require a partner, so is actually a sexual process.

****** I would say the process is beyond the ability of human biology to explain, sitting somewhere between sexual and asexual reproduction, with aspects of both. But what I was mostly commenting on was what you said about Asari dancers, it doesn't matter if the Asari made nuns look promiscuous and conceived children fully clothed with the smallest amount of skin contact required to initiate a meld, the process would still be sexual as it involves two individuals. Likewise, the entire Asari society could be sex-crazed on a level to the point that lads on holiday in Ibiza look frigid, but if they're capable of essentially cloning themselves to make children, it's still asexual.

** Where are you getting half Veela from in canon? All we know is that Fleur's grandmother, a veela, gave a hair for Fleur's wand. People are been calling her a quarter Veela ever since, but there's really no indication that she a proper Veela, or that her mother isn't.

However we could presume that she isn't, we never see her transform as the Veela at the world cup did. If you're looking for reasons why some Veela children are born true blooded and some aren't than it's not a stretch to think it's just like how some wizards birth squibs. Fleurs mother wasn't a 'proper' Veela, but some of her heritage carries on. Or maybe Veela children make a choice at some point whether they want to be human or not. Maybe if they have sex without being in love they transform. Plenty of inspiration for part creature heritage in popular fantasy.

** My headcanon is that it depends on the time/location of conception. Like there is some magically or astrologically significant event (solstice/equinox or something more complex) where children conceived then are full blooded Veela while at other times are just part Veela.

So if a Veela was with a wizard they might miss that moment so the child might be a witch rather than a full Veela.
