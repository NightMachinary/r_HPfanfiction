** I'm currently reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18224369][My Heart Is A Fist of Barbed Wire]] and it's excellent (in progress) sequel, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22574047][Grass Crown]]. It's a very well-written and well-researched au about a Tom Riddle that grew up with another magical child at the orphanage, their eventual romance, and the aftermath. The fic realistically portrays how a dark lord could love without making Tom ooc or excusing his evil actions, and includes one of the best, most sharply-drawn OCs I've read in this fandom.

** Linkao3(To Be A Magical Boy) is amazing! It showcases Dean and Seamus through the years, their personal lives, and best of all, what happens at Hogwarts in 7th year!!

Also literally anything by Solstice Muse or Windschild.

Linkffn(Stay Standing) and linkffn(Spitfire) are particularly incredible.

** Linkao3(To Be A Magical Boy) follows Dean and Seamus through the years. It's actually amazing, even if not centered on the main characters.

Linkao3(Professor Black by Haunted_Frost) is a really good Regulus lives fic where he becomes potions master instead of Snape.

Linkao3(A shrike (to your sharp and glorious thorn)) Is also a Regulus lives, but sent back in time to hopefully stop Voldy.

I'm on a Regulus lives kick so linkao3(He Comes Out of the Black Lake Quite Mad) is another fantastic one I've read. Oneshot though, and linkao3(As the crow flies) is also quite good, a Professor Regulus sitiation.

Linkao3(Ron Weasley and the Philosopher's Stone) is also a time travel fix it.

Linkao3(Golden Bullets) is just fucking good. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3(Chaos, Imperium, Scientae) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3(stay ahead and stay alive) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3(Back to Back We Face Ourselves) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3(Recipe for Disaster) is a Dudley redemption Drarry romantic comedy that's gold. You will not regret this one.

Linkao3(The Long Way Home) is a George grieving for Fred fic and him trying to find his way after Fred dies.

Linkao3(The Ousting of Umbridge) had Draco redemption! Harry and Draco friendship, and a different way fifth year should go.

Linkao3(A festival of traitors) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3(The Arrangement) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3(Playing Snape's Part) is a oneshot where Ron comes back from summer after something terrible has happened to him.

Linkao3(Dudley Dursley's Most Unexpectedly Fortunate Flower) has Dudley redemption...and his daughter is a witch.

Linkao3(Stand by Me) is an amazing post hogwarts fic in which Ron and Draco have a lot to do with. Draco redemption, Ron and Harry friendship, Ron and Draco friendship.

Linkao3(Just Another Nancy Boy?) Is Dudley redemption in which he is kicked out of his home for being gay. We love Petunia and Vernon.

Linkao3(boy with a scar by dirgewithoutmusic) is incredible. A series of what ifs, with 16 works, each about 8000 words.

Linkao3(Crimson Torment) is a poignant Ron whump fic. Oneshot.

Linkao3(Silhouettes by nauticalparamour) is my last recommendation on Ao3. It's an incredible Theo/Hermione time travel fix it to the 1970s when Voldemort wins in their time.

Hope you enjoy! I hope the fanfiction bot actually gets these links.

  What happens when you rewrite a modern fantasy epic to star the brightest witch of her age? Mayhem, magic, and a girl taking charge of her own story as she grows up in an increasingly volatile world. Through twists of the plot and her wand alike, Hermione endeavors to figure out who she is, and maybe also save the world along the way. After all, life as the Chosen One's best friend is far from easy. Book One: Hermione Granger is eleven years old when she receives a letter telling her that she has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, catapulting her into a realm beyond her wildest imaginings. As she adjusts to her new life, she must learn to navigate the struggles of making friends, fighting evil, and, scariest of all, growing up.
