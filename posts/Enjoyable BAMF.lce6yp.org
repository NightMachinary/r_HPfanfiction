So, yesterday while looking through harry/luna tag on ao3 I've stumbled upon this fic called A Second Coming

linkao3(4426112)

It's full of our favorite tropes: multiple random lordships, Independent Dark Grey Harry, manipulative Dumbles and all. But, for some bizzare reason I've very much enjoyed it. It was so over the top that it somehow worked as a decent fic. But I digress. I'm looking for similar stuff, BAMF Harry, manipulative Dumbles and all that are somehow enjoyable to read. Any recommendations?


** This type of fiction can be fun when it doesn't take itself seriously.

*** Exactly, but sometimes crack is too much. Just tried reading some more tagged BAMF Harry on ao3 but it was either too sirious or too cracky, I'm looking for something in between

**** This is a bit of a tangent, but there is a point on the serious-crack scale where tropes I don't like become enjoyable.

On the too cracky side, there is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9655837/1/Harry-Potter-Becomes-A-Communist]]). It was pretty funny for a couple of chapters, but I lost interest.

For comparison, I typically hate harems, because I can't see that kind of relationship working between actual humans. Dragons? Sure. Multiple women going out with a single man and being 100% ok with it? Not happening. Still, I found linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13491812/1/Twins]]) very entertaining.

  What if Harry Potter had a much more mischievous side, one that was locked away thanks to everyone's favorite manipulative old geezer.It starts at the end of Harry's fourth year, as the shock and stess from the events in the graveyard forces him to enter into a magically induced coma. For twelve hours, he's asleep, the trauma of seeing Cedric die and seeing the ghosts of his parents, not to mention the return of Voldemort, breaks down a thirteen year old magical barrier in Harry's mind, awakening a part of Harry long since thought lost.Suddenly, its chaos. the Boy-Who-Lived vanishes with a magical motorcycle and an ancient snake, the death eaters are being harassed in the worst way (You know, fire and destruction), the Ministry is being its usual cowardly self, and Dumbledore is trying to find how it all went wrong.And then, at the start of 5th year, a very different Harry Potter shows up, with an Agenda in hus mind designed to flip the Wizarding World on its head, and the determination to do it.They never saw him coming.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way!

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.
