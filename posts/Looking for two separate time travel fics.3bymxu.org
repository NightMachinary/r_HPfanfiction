In the first, Harry had married Ginny and became an Auror, et cetera, but he was somehow transported into his body at age five. He ends up rescuing Sirius, who forgot all about him.

In the other one, I think it was Draco who traveled through time, sending memories back to his younger self in dreams. If I recall correctly, his grandfather Abraxas is still alive and he uses Ancient Greek to confirm he is from the future.

Also open to recommendations of things similar to the two. Thanks!


** The second one is probably linkffn(Harry Potter and the Puppet of Time by Calanor).

  Time travel. It's always about Potter. Draco Malfoy doesn't like that fact, but there is no one else who has the power to change the world. Sending his memories to his younger self he hopes to create a better future. Intelligent Grey Draco. No slash.

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange.
