Or were they don't use Written tests they just use something like the Sorting hat to make sure they have the theoretical knowledge were they just put the hat on and it yells out there grade?

Pretty much any stories were the Magical world has a magical solution for everything, were they don't even use the wheel because it to muggle, instead things that would normal use the wheel like the Hogwarts carriages permanently Hover everywhere?

Pretty much were the magical world has a case of Anything you can do I can do better syndrome, were even If the Muggle solution is perfectly usable they will create a magical solution anyway just so they don't have to use the muggle solution.


** In a few fanfics they still use the quill because it imbedues the writers magical essence into the parchment for better control who wrote it, preventing cheating, etc.
