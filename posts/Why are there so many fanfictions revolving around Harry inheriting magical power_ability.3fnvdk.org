There are literally(?) hundreds of fanfictions out there in which Harry finds out that he is secretly the heir of Gryffindor/Merlin/etc or is now the head of the vast pureblood family Black/Potter. Why does this occur so often?

One of the main themes of the entire series is that blood doesn't matter, and that all the pureblood dogma is just blind prejudice. This isn't usually too much of an issue in stories where Harry gains control over the Black/Potter family accounts (these stories usually tend to go down the equally confusing route of assuming that massive magical power can be bought as long as you are rich enough), but in stories in which it turns out Harry is secretly a descendant of, for example, Gryffindor, this revelation is almost always accompanied by an enormous boost in magical ability, usually resulting in Super!Harry.

Why is this a thing at all, let alone such a widespread thing, considering that it flatly contradicts the message of the original books, and actually gives the blood purity argument quite a bit of weight?


** I think there's a fairly widespread disappointment in the fandom over how Harry turned out. At the end of PoA, you could be forgiven for thinking he was on the traditional hero's path, given his achievement with the Patronus and how special it was said to be to cast one so young. GoF reinforced this somewhat, with Harry succeeding in the tasks (albeit without using too much magic) and learning a host of useful, powerful spells beyond their age range for the third task.

But then OotP shat all over the idea of Harry being special. All the spells he learnt for the third task turned out to be a standard part of the OWL curriculum. A number of other students learnt the Patronus with relative ease. Harry sucked at occlumency. His one victory was the DA, where he was teaching 6th and 7th years DADA material that made Harry seem well in advance of the Hogwarts curriculum... until HBP.

In HBP we find out that those 6th and 7th years were just humouring him, as none of them mentioned non-verbal magic once. Non-verbal magic at which Harry sucked. Non-verbal magic which is absolutely essential to winning any real, adult duel. On top of that, Harry's failure at occlumency is not remedied, and salt is rubbed in the wound where it turns out that without occlumency, dueling a legilimens is an exercise in futility. To make matters worse, Harry is repeatedly mentioned as struggling with work throughout HBP, and barely seems to learn a new spell (aside from the HBP's spells) in the entire book. I mean, they spend the entire year learning a single Charm (aguamenti).

So yeah. Given all this, a lot of people were disappointed by Harry's apparently mediocrity (in DH he suddenly pulls new competence out of the hat, but we have no idea where it came from, given he wasn't mentioned as learning any of it).

Inheritance is the easiest, most direct way to change Harry back into a traditional fantasy hero. It's a shitty plot device in all but the most expert executions (where the inheritance and problems which come with it are the major focus of the story, see for example kmfrank's Unlocked Knowledge), but you can understand the motivation.

*** I...I guess I'm the only one pleased with the way Harry turned out.

I liked that he wasn't overpowered and struggled with day to days tasks. He had a prophesy, he had a destiny; he was "The Chosen One" by a painfully slim margin - but he was perfectly normal, mostly average in his school work, short-charged in some departments and completely and totally relatable.

I was and am happy that Harry turned out the way he did. Having him inherit some special powers, having him become overpowered or being able to master spells and magic like some sort of Hogwarts genius would turn his story into so many other typical "hero" has it all, "will win without struggling".

He's not some epic, fantastical warrior with outrageous prowess; he's not some mythical, legendary figure who comes to aid the world when it needs him - he's a totally average young man, trying to survive in a not-so average setting. He doesn't have top marks in school. He's plain in face and form. He's awkward and funny; he's moody and kind; he's loyal and angst ridden. He's courageous - he's stubborn. He's the heir of a prophesy and he vanquishes his enemy with a totally boring, unremarkable spell.

He is your everyday hero and that is where I think, the real magic of his journey lies.

But that's just me.

It is a fantasy - but it is a flawed one. It is a wonderful, fantastical world - with real day to day problems, heartbreaks and failures.

Magic is there - right alongside all the human shortcomings that can never be escaped from, magical being or not.

Harry didn't work hard to make himself exceptional - that isn't his personality, he's not a striving bookworm or someone who truly pushes themselves in most things. He's (like I've said before) an average guy in a not-so-average circumstance...even for a wizard!

But those problems aren't magical ones. They are regular ones, framed by a paper-thin magical world. They are problems MAGIC SHOULD FIX. Or a good reason should be given why it /doesn't/ fix many of those problems. It is mostly magic In Name Only. The problems that come up and are solved, are ones /intentionally divorced from magic./ Including Voldemort.

It isn't a wonderful and fantastical world. It is a world just like ours, only with brooms and cursed teapots. And no logical extension of /what that actually means to people/. These people don't have magical solutions to problems, they just have problems. They just muddle along, when the exciting world outside their windows is full of obvious solutions to daily issues.

Why am I reading about a magical world with problems out of a sitcom if the magical world doesn't even matter? JKR goes out of her way to demagic the magic, making the fantastic mundane to the point that it makes no sense.

Bilbo putting on a magic ring to try and trick a dragon is a /hundred million times/ more magical than anything that happens in /Harry Potter/, because the /magic/ is actively used to solve part of a fantastic /magical/ problem, and as part of the character's life. When we later learn he used the One Ring to escape awkward visits by relatives...well, that's great practical use of magic. Everyone can see themselves doing the same exact thing, it both situations.

Harry /not/ using his magic to try to solve either Voldemort or everyday teenage problems is a slap in the face to every reader everywhere. That's the /first thing/ we'd all try to do. And after we find out we have some power the guy who killed our parents knows not, one that'll help kill him? You better fucking believe we'd be trying to figure out if we're exceptionally good at magical poisons, or magical curses, or magical jump-kicking people from brooms. And magically trying to wrangle our sexually frustrated friends into line. And magically impressing someone to get a date. And having unrealistic magical power fantasies of our own.

Even if we failed, it would be realistic for us to either struggle or try to hide in this situation. And we'd do /both/ using magic. Ironically, for my argument, Harry just getting dragged along while Hermione magically fixes almost literally every problem in book seven was just sad. It felt less like he was average and struggling through, and more like he just didn't care. Why wasn't /he/ using magic to fix these problems? Him just giving up would have been great if that was the direction the books went in. But they didn't. They just left Harry a limp, useless, non-magical everyman lump all of a sudden.

That's why people write powerful Harry stories, with vampires and veela and ancient bloodlines. Because at least Harry now has possible solutions he can use to magically solve problems, including everyday ones, and more magical problems which need solving on top of that.

#+end_quote

I fervently disagree, but that's just opinion. I can't really prove it. Harry pushes himself all the time, when it matters. And Voldemort should fucking matter. He is, in short, a terrible wizard. And that's never acknowledged in text, like it should based on his actions.

But put that aside. What bugs me is, every time I bring up how unexceptional the non-Hermione characters in /Harry Potter/ are, this "they act like average people" thing is used as a counter, like that is a good thing. Some sort of clever characterization on JKR's part.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione aren't living in average times or doing average things. Heroes are people who step up, even when things get tough. Harry isn't average in the first four books. He /constantly/ steps up. This needs to be for a reason, even if that reason is tragic or a personal weakness--otherwise, that attribute is pointless and misleading.

Not stepping up is an option, and makes people much more average. But once someone steps up in a story, it needs to /mean something/. They do what is needed to win, because that's the kind of people they *are*. Or they deal with being average in a harsh situation. Ignoring those conflicting cases entirely isn't good storytelling.

This has nothing to do with studying to power up, or getting swole, or finding ways around British gun laws. It's about human beings in a tough situation holding to a purpose, or /failing to/, and that being told about in a story. Being /continuously/ average and ineffectual in that sort of situation /is a character flaw/, but it isn't played like that in /Harry Potter/.

We're repeatedly asked to feel for Harry (and to some extent Ron) like we would a hero, and there is heroic resolve and similar attributes, but in the end Harry isn't a hero. He's at best a bland Jesus figure. He doesn't /do/ anything to help his fate along, other than just /be/. And the author doesn't acknowledge this.

Harry either should have been a hero, or very much /not/ a hero, and for good reasons clearly explained. Instead of a strong story about someone who is weak working through their flaws, or someone strong sacrificing everything, we got neither. The author choose not to tell either of those stories in the end.

We got a murky morality play, little magical volition from main characters in a magical world, and no satisfying or logical ending. Events just happen to Harry, who wins because he is fated to. Curtain closes, opens again, babies ever after, then the end.

--------------

Let's go back to the basics. The hero's journey is essentially: (possibly average) person (eventually) accepts a call to action, goes to a dark place, and finds something unusual inside themselves (literally or figuratively) that helps them (usually) win in the end.

The first four books promised us an active hero. Harry went through some of these steps, sometimes in lesser ways all through the journey in one book, sometimes partially in larger ways overall. In the last two books, Harry went almost completely limp.

In book six, average bloke Harry wanders aimlessly from one event someone else is in charge of to another. His actions (not his whining) make like nothing in the previous books ever happened or any world events mattered at all, until the very, very end.

In the last book, we got our demagic'd, average bloke Harry and his average mate dragged along by fate and a single swotty friend. And a large number of fans hated that, for good reason. Average isn't a defense for bad storytelling.

The last two Harry Potter books are badly plotted and feature several bad storytelling elements. Those elements are largely what lead people to write more active and dynamic characters in their HP fanfics.

They write those characters badly because they are novice writers who want power fantasy more than balanced characterization, setting, and plot. And yet, people still find those ideas interesting, as shown ITT, because canon let down the characters so badly, even poorly-written power fantasy is appealing in comparison.

***** I've liked the idea that fantastical worlds have the same issues (or similar) as the 'real world'.

It's fascinating to contemplate the idea that even those with literal powers can be and live like the old mundane real world.

Ultimately (for I think the series has many flaws) my issue comes in with the ending. Yeah magic didn't defeat the bad guy for the final time. But it sure did a number on him the first time he 'died'.

It just felt weird that the hero won with all these limitations that ended up being a part of who he was and how he went about things.

I like that Harry won with all these limitations. I think it showed (in this entertaining way) that an average person can rise to the occasion when needed.

Harry's only special because of that prophesy - other than that, he's utterly regular in almost all ways. Without the prophesy, he's be just another face in the wizarding world pretty much.

Harry's flaws and shortcomings are all what make Harry...well, Harry. It is with these and the help he got and his own push in those difficult times that got him through this crisis and made him do what must be done.

Except you forget that Harry knows Voldemort well through his life experiences and lessons with Dumbledore. Voldemort would never believe his enemy who he thinks to be beneath him. He could never even conceive the notion that a coward like Draco Malfoy could beat him to the ownership of the elder wand. Voldemort's fatal flaw is his pride, and his pride wouldn't allow him to believe that his enemy is right, that he is wrong, that there are machinations taking place behind his back that he had no knowledge of, and Harry certainly knows that.

  Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, “I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.”

  The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter's continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.

  “I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”

He isn't admitting an error at all. This is paying lip service to it, in the same vein as "Lord Voldemort is merciful" etc. In this context, his "error" is that he didn't pay personal attention to killing Harry Potter, delegating it to others instead. It seems that he is blaming his DEs for his previous errors more than admitting his own failings.

Voldemort ignoring those whom he thinks beneath him is a flaw Dumbledore expounded on specifically in HBP. It was also shown again in DH when Voldemort left Kreacher in the cave to die, not even thinking for a second that House Elves could do magic he Lord Voldemort couldn't.

**** We're given a classic setup for a hero's tale, and we're told that this specific person is the hero, but he has no heroic qualities for us to appreciate or emulate.

Batman wins through obsessive preparation. Loki gets his way through sly manipulations. Hermione Granger studies her way to victory. Harry Potter relies on destiny and prophecy and having a better broom than most of his competition.

Superman is a hero who wins through innate, unearned abilities, just like Harry. We don't admire him for that, though. We admire him for his tenacity when fighting people who can actually hurt him. If nobody could hurt him, we wouldn't care about him as a hero.

Is there /anything/ we can admire about Harry? Any virtues we can try to emulate? He bumbled along, following orders for the most part, and then, just when all hope seemed lost, he went quietly to his death. I'm impressed by his ability to understand Dumbledore's "I open at the close" hint, and he was pretty composed when he died. But I don't see that much use for solving hopelessly obscure riddles and I'd rather not die in the first place.

I personally feel that Harry did his best in an extraordinary situation, with all his faults, bumbling and the mysterious surrounding things. Not to mention his own personal feelings.

He did his best with what he was given - and sure, it wasn't spectacular, it wasn't done on his own (he received a load of help and backing)...but he still accomplished what he (and others!) wanted him to do, and he got it all wrapped up best he could in the end. Which is saying quite a lot.

It was a team effort and Harry did his part, he took on his share, his burden and came out as the "working class hero" in the end.

  Non-verbal magic which is absolutely essential to winning any real, adult duel.
#+end_quote

Where did you get this from? If by adult duel you mean Dumbledore/Voldemort/maybeSnape level, you're right. But the trio fights and beat and/or escape adult DEs all the time in the series (especially in DH), and they certainly didn't need any non-verbal magic to do it.

I think JKR chose Harry's skill level in dueling so that when he dueled all but the big bads (Voldemort, Snape and maybe Bellatrix), the fight could conceivably go either way. The loss to Snape in HBP was bitter, but that was more Snape pulling awesome dueling skills out of the hat (probably because he had to fill in as the big bad in HBP) than Harry becoming bad at dueling.

Defence and Flying aside, Harry was slightly above average. Exceeds Expectations, but not Outstanding. But I don't really see why that matters. Hermione was good at those, but she never used fancy transfiguations or non-verbal magic in duels either. Outside of duels, it doesn't really matter and has no bearing of Harry's suitability as a hero or a protagonist.

Whenever Harry needed to learn some magic, he always did. The only one he couldn't was Occlumency, but his ability to lose control of his emotions is his character flaw, and has no bearing on his magical ability, or lack thereof.

#+begin_quote
  "...I think Draco would be very gifted in Occlumency, unlike Harry. Harry's problem with it was always that his emotions were too near the surface and that he is in some ways too damaged. But he's also very in touch with his feelings about what's happened to him. He's not repressed, he's quite honest about facing them, and he couldn't suppress them, he couldn't suppress these memories. But I thought of Draco as someone who is very capable of compartmentalising his life and his emotions, and always has done. So he's shut down his pity, enabling him to bully effectively. He's shut down compassion --- how else would you become a Death Eater? So he suppresses virtually all of the good side of himself."

It's usually just there to give Harry bigger guns at the start of the story so he can get to kicking ass faster.

In canon, there are a few magical traits that are passed through bloodlines. The obvious one is Parseltongue, passed by Slytherin through the Gaunts to Riddle. Another is Metamorphmagus abilities, which Teddy Lupin seems to have inherited from his mother. The ability is supposed to be extremely rare, so the odds of it happening by chance for a mother and child would be vanishing low without some element of heritability.

He's extremely talented, and he's the guy Harry has to to against.

Fanfic is all about deviating from canon, so how can Harry beat Voldemort without the Elder Wand backfiring incident? Giving Harry some kind of boost to even the odds is probably what they're doing. a Metamorphmagus!NaturalOcclumens!MoD!Harry also has a "cool" factor attached to it I suppose

He knows love (Voldemort does not), which gives Harry a reason to fight. He does not fear death (not as much as Voldemort does) and the fact that he loves gives him a reason to accept death.

That's one of the big points of the story. You have the almighty Voldemort: cunning, insanely powerful, smart and merciless against 'plain Harry'. David vs Goliath. Making Harry too powerful makes the story unbalanced in my opinion. It devalues the whole 'love and death' plotpoint.

#+begin_quote
  One of the main themes of the entire series is that blood doesn't matter, and that all the pureblood dogma is just blind prejudice.
#+end_quote

That theme is very, very poorly executed, which is one reason these authors are binning it and going full throttle in the other direction. The /Harry Potter/ series is, if about anything like that, about innate /exceptionalism./

Wizards are special because they were born special. They also (usually) have magical children. Their blood /does matter/. The pureblood dogma people maybe just don't understand /magical/ genetics, because they're carrying the sociological idiot ball. /Maybe/. They're even right that, in simplified 1800s-type genetic analysis, marrying muggles should produce more squibs, period. This isn't even shown to be an incorrect view, that muggles are physiologically different or lesser, just that such ideas are /morally/ wrong.

They're just paper Nazis. It is only Draco and his childish name calling that is ever shown up, and only tangentially by Hermione being a successful witch and mostly-moral human being--in contrast to Draco and the blood purists. We don't even get presented with other strong examples of successful muggleborn characters in the books--and no, a dead woman who never did anything but breed successfully before dying isn't strong--so countering this point in that way doesn't seem to have been very important to JKR. Not once are we shown purebloods are incorrect about muggleborn /or wizard-muggle marriage/ being a bad idea, for either genetic or cultural reasons.

Blood (being a wizard) clearly matters, and JKR doesn't care to refute this culturally or genetically, as * /no one in the series marries a muggle./

Think about that for a moment. Then look at some other facts from the series.

- You can't learn to be a wizard, and they treat people who aren't wizards poorly because /they can/. This is never subverted, as even Hermione inflicts magic on non-magicals without their consent just to make her life easier.

- They don't go on a quest in the last book to save the world, as there is no real evidence (in the books) that the "real world" is in any real danger--another thing that angers fanfic authors and fans. The trio are saving the /magical world/ from destruction, and only incidentally saving the muggles that make up the majority of it.

- These people are born this way, yet we're supposed to like them despite their society being an objectively horrible place. It isn't just being a wizard that's like that.

- Parselmouths are "dark" because they are born that way.

- Metamorphmegus are born that way

As are magical creatures like:

- Veela
- Giants
- Merpeople

All are shown as very interesting people. Far more interesting than the trio, or even wizards (as presented). If anything, the series is about a world of people born special, and a boy who finds out he was really special all along /because he was born that way./

Then there's the last two books and their lack of interesting magic. JKR dropped the idea of magic being interesting after the frustrating time she had writing GoF, so she just wrote about relationships and emotions and struggles instead of building her world like in the first three books. So people hate-write fanfic back at her ideas, with added blackjack and hookers.

****** All but two main characters are married by the end with babies. Don't tell me it isn't a story about families, yet muggles are excluded from these family-focused moments.

Of the happily married people shown throughout the series, only Hermione is a muggleborn. We see all of the paired off characters at one time or another, except for Luna's slightly-creepy, cradle-robbing hubby. But no muggles or muggleborn married to magicals /ever/ appear in the story, not Tom's father or Snape's, not actual family moments from Harry's mom either. We only see Hermione's parents for a paragraph. Otherwise, all muggles are victims or monsters, and muggleborn are almost non-existent.

The intersection of the mundane and the magical is the point of modern fantasy. That magic doesn't affect mundane things in /Harry Potter/ was sort of the point of what I was saying. Not sure how you missed that.

--------------

High fantasy is when the elves build a city to last a thousand years, and you're not allowed in. Low fantasy is when the elves burn your village to the ground and you swear revenge on the sword of your father. Modern fantasy is when the elves are magically enslaved to clean your house, and plot your downfall in a bloody magical proletariat revolution.

--------------

In HP, we get shown the thin gap between the magical and everyday world. But as the series continues, we just get a continuation of the separation of magical and mundane that many thought was promised to be subverted. Except it never was. Excuses like "it's a children's book" don't fly, not when /HP/ set the standard for YA fiction for a generation.

It's clear the mundane as contrast to the magical was important to JKR, as she made Harry more and more "normal" as the series went on just to fit this role. Harry isn't allowed to use magic too much, like people such as Hermione and Cedric did, as it would break the thematic contrast between him and the magical world and turn the story into magical people doing magical things all the time. Which wasn't the story JKR wanted to write.

In my opinion, showing more muggles and muggleborn would have done this. A lot of fanfic authors go the other way, by making Harry /more/ magical compared to even the magical world.

Newt was born *1897*. If he had an eldest son, who is Rolf's dad, at the age of 32 (more than *twelve* years later than Lily and James had Harry), that would mean Rolf's dad was born in *1929*. If Rolf's dad had Rolf at the age of 32, Rolf was born in *1961*.

32 is *very generous* as an estimate, especially for that time, but it also accounts for multiple kids.

Luna was born *1981*.

That's a *20 year* age gap. And remember, my estimates are generous in the other direction.

If Luna married (and also had kids, but I'm not doing that calculation) three years after Harry and Co (so she wasn't at the train station for their /second/ kid's first year), then they married when Luna was at least 21 and Rolf was *41*.

There's a couple people in the books who explicitly have "old" parents (Theodore Nott and James Potter), so it's obviously a thing. The Black family tree has some of those, too, actually, including in "that time".

If you are accounting for multiple kids, 32 is not generous at all, especially with, again, the fact that Newt spent some time traveling. My great-grandfather, for example, had six children with a 22 year spread between them, which was not uncommon. If Newt did a similar thing, he would have had to start when he was 10 to have his youngest kid at 32!

******** I defined my terms very carefully, and used industry standard language. Low fantasy doesn't have kids with wands and magical castles where they go to school. Any mundane world inclusions were too little, too late, and too thin to hold low fantasy themes together.

/Game of Thrones/ is classic low fantasy. Magic barely exists, and though it flavors the world, it doesn't thread its way through every aspect of people's lives. A lot of children's fantasy and much of Stephen King's horror is set in low fantasy worlds, where magic exists just to screw with people.

The /Dresden Files/ series is modern /high/ fantasy, as is /Harry Potter./ /Lord of the Rings/ is also high fantasy, even though few spells are ever cast, because the setting is made of dragons and orcs and immortal elves. Big magical things exist and change the way the world works in high fantasy.

Harry exists through 90% of the books in a world where he can do magic. That he usually doesn't isn't the determining factor in the genre. Those suggesting /Harry Potter/ is low fantasy are confused by the fact that JKR didn't actually want to build a magical world, and just borrowed aspects from [[http://io9.com/5683905/everything-harry-potters-been-accused-of-ripping-off][popular culture, TV shows, and children's books]] to make hers. But she did a good job, as they drew people in more than anything else.

(And that borrowing's perfectly fine, BTW, that's what authors /do/--if everyone avoided copying T. H. White, nothing with wizards in it would ever get written.)

Harry went off to learn magic in a magic castle. But then there weren't any major problems solved by magic, and later JKR actively avoided letting her characters and setting use it even when it would make sense. It remains just vague background and flavor to the world much of the time, with last years spells and magic items rarely if ever mattering. But it is there, and in large quantities, so it isn't low fantasy. JKR's avoidance of magic isn't in the setting, it's in the plot.

Because it is a high fantasy setting, people expect magic to matter. And it doesn't in the end. Which disappoints people. That Harry never dealt with his mundane world problems with the help of magic, let alone his epic quest, is one of the major promises people saw being broken from the initial themes.

"Boarding school novel" isn't a main genre, it's a common setting and subgenre, and it isn't why /Harry Potter/ is so popular. It is such a wide hit in large part because of the high fantasy world, and the promise in the first few books of a normal boy learning magic, in a magic castle, in a secret world of magical people. That the last few books weren't about that is sad. The results of fans working through that is fanfic.

No it isn't. That's alternate world settings, which often occur in both low and high fantasy stories. Seeing not just a magical marketplace, but a fully fleshed-out society with dragons, goblins, dwarves, hags, and witches and wizards means you aren't looking at a low fantasy story.

/Harry Potter/ is entirely made up of obvious and prominent magical and fantasy elements, and often very British ones. Most children's books are low fantasy, classic French style fairies-in-the-gardens tales, which is why the /Harry Potter/ series' out-there magic was so shocking.

There is a lot of opinion that goes into this designation, but to be useful at all the terms have to be related closely to the setting elements and how they're used. And /Harry Potter/ takes place in a complete magical world, with it's own society and government. 90% of the books take place in this magical focused environment, and the magic itself still works in the mundane world. It not only isn't a world apart, but it is an alternate version of our world that has always been that way.

Correction- in book 6, it's mentioned that the obliviators are making muggles believe that the destruction in the West Country- roofs ripped off, trees downed, muggles injured severely- is due to a hurricane, and not death eaters and giants attacking things (aka muggle areas). In the movie (canon or not as you will) a bridge in London is destroyed by death eaters- certainly not a wizarding target.

Additionally, Hermione memory charms her parents not (just) to make her life easier, but because she expects the death eaters to attack the families of muggleborns (or at least prominent muggleborns like her), not just muggleborns themselves.

The direct conclusion is not that muggles are in no danger but that they are in no targeted danger, as Voldemort does not seem to want to break the Statute of Secrecy too badly by targeting muggles without some sort of reason. Whether this is because he believes in the Statute or because he isn't ready yet for an international response from breaking it is up to your own headcanon.

I certainly wouldn't say that having an immortal dark lord who thinks muggles and their magical children are scum sitting on a throne in London means that muggle Britain is in no danger at all, even just from senseless, random attacks by individuals.

*** This post is stupid, and not just for the willful blindness and factual errors. I will come those soon, but first :

#+begin_quote
  This isn't even shown to be an incorrect view, that muggles are physiologically different or lesser, just that such ideas are morally wrong.
#+end_quote

But Wizards /are/ physiologically superior. That's like the whole point of magic, it's a special talent. Everything else being equal, someone with a special talent is obviously superior to someone without it. Anything less would be completely unrealistic. I'm not sure why this is puzzling to you.

The point is that just because they are superior, it doesn't mean that they are morally superior, or that their lives mean more than muggles. This is something even you recognize, and it is better that way. Physiologically superiority doesn't mean anything when it comes to value of life.

#+begin_quote
  and only tangentially by Hermione being a successful witch and mostly-moral human being--in contrast to Draco and the blood purists. We don't even get presented with other strong examples of successful muggleborn characters in the books--and no, a dead woman who never did anything but breed successfully before dying isn't strong--so countering this point in that way doesn't seem to have been very important to JKR.
#+end_quote

First off, stop downplaying Hermione. She's the lead female role in the series and the smartest character of her age. More importantly, Lily Potter doesn't matter? I'm sorry, /what/? Lily's willing sacrifice is, like, the focal point of the series. It is the reason Harry lives and it is what started the whole series. Every book, from book one to book seven, had Lily's blood mentioned as important, and in book seven, it is Lily's sacrifice that keep Harry, and consequently the whole wizarding world, free and alive.

Two muggle born witches played a huge role in the Voldemort's defeat. Do you want every character to be muggleborn?

#+begin_quote
  Blood (being a wizard) clearly matters, and JKR doesn't care to refute this culturally or genetically, as * no one in the series marries a muggle.
#+end_quote

Actually Cho does marry a muggle. And the series isn't about muggles, so it doesn't really make sense to include muggles.

#+begin_quote
  They don't go on a quest in the last book to save the world, as there is no real evidence (in the books) that the "real world" is in any real danger--another thing that angers fanfic authors and fans. The trio are saving the magical world from destruction, and only incidentally saving the muggles that make up the majority of it.
#+end_quote

There is an entire chapter in HBP that specifically shows Voldemort's impact on the muggle world through the muggle Prime Minister. At this point I'm even doubting you ever read the book.

#+begin_quote
  “Since they have moved into the open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridge --- he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and ---”
#+end_quote

[..]

#+begin_quote
  “That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably. “Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. “Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries ---”

  “It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed's followers. And . . . and we suspect giant involvement.”

  The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. “What involvement?”
#+end_quote

And then there were the Dementors who were mentioned to wreak havoc in the Muggle World plenty of times. No evidence, none at all.

Of course, seeing that you didn't bother to read HBP, one would think might have paid more attention to DH.

#+begin_quote
  “Listeners, I'd like to invite you now to join us in a minute's silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.”
#+end_quote

[..]

#+begin_quote
  “However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles' knowledge.*I'd like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.”*

  “And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be 'Wizards first'? asked Lee.

  “I'd say that it's one short step from 'Wizards first' to 'Purebloods first,' and then to 'Death Eaters,”' replied Kingsley. *“We're all human, aren't we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.”*
#+end_quote

And thus your first and second points are both invalid.

#+begin_quote
  Parselmouths are "dark" because they are born that way.
#+end_quote

Which is prejudice, and is present in any society, real or magical. Yet Harry subverts this completely. Why the hell did you even mention this?

#+begin_quote
  These people are born this way, yet we're supposed to like them despite *their society being an objectively horrible place*. It isn't just being a wizard that's like that.
#+end_quote

And once again we disagree completely. The Wizarding world has no more prejudice than the real world. Their prejudices are just of a different kind. That is, like, the whole theme of the story, but I'm not going to argue with that any further. JKR has no obligation to appease every single person's or minority group's real or perceived slights, but the entire story has been about overcoming prejudices. If you are willingly blind to every instance of it, and make up "evidence" of your own, then there is nothing that can convince you.

** I agree with the above commenter that part of it stems from disappointment in Harry. I think another part of it is lack of author self-discipline and a deep love of Harry.

It usually involves pouring power on him to make life easier, to overcome conflicts, to finally make everyone respect and admire him as much as he deserves. Sure, it ridiculously unbalances the universe, and becomes Harry drifting through, fixing everything with a god like touch, but that's a feature not a bug.

Because there is a lot of angst in the books, OotP in particular is unrelentingly miserable and I have a hard time re-reading it because of this. It's usually one long telling of "What if everything was okay?".

** There are several ways to become strong individually.

You could simply be unusually strong with no real reason behind it. That's a little unsatisfying and doesn't give much to talk about.

You could be strong by dint of long hours of practice. That's not Harry Potter in canon, the boy who doesn't practice Quidditch any more than his captain schedules, doesn't seem to study any more than anyone else, and is never found practicing spells in unused classrooms.

You could be strong because you're unusually smart, and that lets you learn spells more quickly, remember more of them, and always have the most efficient spell ready to cast. That's Hermione Granger, not Harry Potter.

You could be strong because of special gifts you've inherited. That's about as good as being strong for no reason, except it has an air of grandeur to it and it lets you be strong in specific ways. linkffn(Wizard of the Kaleidoscope) actually gives inherited magic abilities a decent run, as does linkffn(Saving Connor) (though in this, it's unclear whether the abilities come from the family line or are simply a family secret, and it's implied that the abilities are learned).
