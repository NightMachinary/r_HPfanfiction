I can't find it for the life of me.


** I remember a time travel Harry where he acts as a librarian and mentors his younger self. Is that it?

I also vaguely remember one where he learn some martial arts from another one.

Don't think either one he actually left the Dursleys though.

** I believe I know the fic you are hunting for does it involve a letter from the future which is addressed to a solicitor (or some other Potter family friend/retainer)?

Are Harry's bones so weak that they have to spend several weeks(?) vanishing and regrowing pretty much all of them with skele-gro?

Was the letter supposed to be delivered by Kreacher but he explodes(?) before he can complete his mission?

If this sounds familiar to you just know that I am desperately looking for this story as well. I think it was one of the first unfinished fics I ever read. If I find it I will comment again.

  Keith Brackwood was disillusioned with the wizarding world. So he, like many other muggleborns, returned to the muggle world and after taking his A-levels and finishing university he took a position at a small primary school in Little Whinging. He couldn't have foreseen how this decision would influence the fate of the savior of Wizarding Britain. Child Harry fic.

** Is this the fic where a time traveler Harry delays severely abused child!Harry at the library to create a point of divergence so child!Harry publicly faints in front of the Grangers instead of making it back to the empty Dursley house? I remember the Dursleys were on vacation and adult!Harry was pretty sure they were expecting child!Harry to die while they were gone. Child!Harry was taken in by the Grangers instead and the Dursleys were arrested for child abuse when they came back to the UK.

*** This fic is called 30 Minutes That Changed Everything by Radaslab. It involves Harry, Hermione, Luna and Harry's sister (who was hidden away but reunited with him near the beginning of this fic) and all their friends heading off to Japan each summer holidays to complete five years of magical and muggle education in a time compression bubble (that's five years every summer so by the time they get to Hogwarts they already have doctorates and multiple magical masteries.

I love this story despite it's myriad flaws/cliches. I do not mean this ironically, I am being completely serious this is one of my favourite stories. linkffn(5178251)
