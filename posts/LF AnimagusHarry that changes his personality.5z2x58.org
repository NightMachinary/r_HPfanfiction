I'm thinking something along the lines of Harry Mewter { linkffn(4826372) } in which having the animagus form of...well, a Mew from pokemon, changes his personality and he has to deal with these changes. This should be the main focus of the story, the character development of him and the people around him as a result of this change.

  Harry decides he wants to try Animagi, and persuades Hermione to help... this changes them... a lot. Crossover, of sorts, with Pokemon. Mew!Harry. Not as stupid as it sounds.

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.
