*** As a heads up to anyone reading this, the first three chapters are excellent but the fourth chapter features a very jarring change in tense and perspective (e.g. “Harry went to the Great Hall for breakfast” versus “I go to the Great Hall for breakfast”)

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.
