He just wasn't , this is especially prominent in Harry x Voldemort fics , now i dont mind harry x voldemort as pairing , i like it even , but when the author starts going on about voldemort being some kinda victim of his tormentors or something it makes me close the fic 90% of the time , he was an evil motherfucker , if he gets togheter with harry , make harry a evil motherfucker too , it aint that hard


** I mean, he's an orphan born in the 1926 (3 years before the Great Depression, which affected the UK more than the US because of its WWI debts). This is actually one of JK Rowling's historical slipups; most orphanages shut down during this time period or at least stopped accepting infants/young children. Even if you accept that he landed in one of the very few orphanages that didn't, growing up there in the great depression means his very existence would be a struggle. He was certainly a victim of circumstances at the very least.

He's sorted into Slytherin, where most people believed he was a muggleborn. We don't really know how extreme blood purity was in that era, but we do know tensions were very high and as a (presumed) muggleborn Slytherin, he would very likely be targeted or discriminated against. His strong conviction that he /must/ be a halfblood of some kind hints at that theory strongly. A victim to self-hatred and pureblood ideology surely.

During the holidays, he returned to a London now engulfed in war where most orphanages were being evacuated and the children sent off into the country or other parts of the empire. He certainly had to deal with food shortages at the very least. Somewhere along the way he developed his fear of death. From second year on, he was the victim of a muggle war he could not control.

Despite being a prodigy, admired by Slughorn, and headboy, he ended up working in retail as an assistant at Borgin & Burkes after being denied the DADA professorship by Dippet. Why he chose to work in retail we don't really know, but I've seen quite a few fics that argued it was discrimination preventing him from excelling anywhere else (there are no muggleborns in high positions in canon, even when Harry is in school, and he had no real way of proving his half blood status). It's quite possible to argue that he may have victim of prejudice. And anyone working as a sales assistant is automatically a victim of the system.

My point is that any fic centered on his perspective that fails to recognise that his life pushed him in this direction and that he most likely considers /himself/ a victim doesn't do justice to what we know of his character. Tom would not consider himself evil.

I agree, in a lot of Tomarry fics Harry should know better. But from what we know in canon, Harry forgave Snape, Narcissa, and probably Draco. I can see him meeting young Tom, who might still seem redeemable, and seeing why Voldemort turned out the way he did and trying to stop that, which /is/ the setup of most of the tom x harry fics you're talking about.

*** That he worked at Borgin & Burkes in canon is by his own choise, albus mention that everyone was suprised that the genius tom wanted to work at Borgin & Burkes

**** Yeah sure, I'm just saying you could use it as a plot point. Maybe he believed he wouldn't get anywhere within the system as a "muggleborn" and be stuck in a mid-level job his entire career (again, there are no muggleborns in high positions in canon) or believed he could do better than the ministry etc.

Dumbledore probably wouldn't have any real knowledge about Tom at that point in his life though so idk if I'd take Dumbledore's opinion into consideration on this issue, at least if I was writing a fic. I don't think Dumbledore is evil, but he certainly did have a strong bias against Tom, enough so that I can see him overlooking the difficulties Tom might've actually faced when seeking employment. Or maybe as someone who wasn't a blood purist, it was a surprise to him that Tom didn't receive many offers because he assumed wizarding society was better than it was. We can't really know for sure.

**** I kinda meant somewhere along the way something must've escalated it after the dumbledore visit, but you're right that he had the roots of that fear. More hints that the orphanage wasn't the most fun place i guess.

*** Yeah, I'm writing a fem!Riddle fic focused on the diary horcrux, and she's definitely a victim of circumstance. She's not irredeemably awful, but she's definitely not good.

**** Don't get me started on how awful it would be for female!Riddle, especially since her strangeness would be handled so much differently than Tom's.

I'm going to read your fic, but be prepared for super long comments lol

** I dunno. Monsters can be victims too. I've always found that to be one of the most interesting thing about them. It's only when people start to make the monster being a victim mean that they're no longer a monster that a problem arises for me. Voldemort being bullied doesn't make mass-murder okay. Same with Draco and Snape. It explains it, but it shouldn't excuse it.

*** I mean, irl most people, including those most regard as evil, have complex lives too. We all know the stories of Hitler being abused by his father, fighting in wwi and being injured, living in poverty-stricken post-war Germany, failing to get into art school, etc. None of that makes Hitler a good person, but he was a person. Your environment has a major impact on who you are and I like seeing stories that address that, like you said.

** I get unreasonably angry when people try to make Draco sympathetic and I'm actually kinda glad to hear Voldemort gets the same treatment.

I think it's kinda important to understand that truly evil people have shitty things happen to them too. The difference is when faced with a choice, or given a modicum of power, do they do the thing that will make the world better or worse?

If it's well done making Voldemort a woobie can add to rather than detract from the horror of him.

Consider two villains, one who grew up in a horrible orphanage, one who grew up pampered. When each of these people kills someone they know to be a parent, which is commiting the worse evil? The one with the full context of what awaits the kids as a result of their actions, or the thoughtless psycho who assumes the kids will be fine?

** Of course he wasn't...in canon. However, this is fanfiction. It is fanfic writers prerogative to write the characters as they want, because they are explicitly writing a different story than what is canon. Now you are free to not like portraying Voldemort this way, it is your prerogative to due so. And feel free to discuss your thoughts here that's what we're here for, but we're not here to cater every HarryxVoldemort story to your taste. So please in the future, be a bit more diplomatic with your suggestions, so that they are suggestions, and not demands as you have at the end of your post.

**** So they want to make Voldemort a more sympathetic character than in canon. Nothing wrong with that. Maybe they want to write a redemption story or something close to that, and they don't want to write an evil Harry and Voldemort lovers/team up story. Nothing wrong with that either. It's their story, you're free not to read them.

​

Basically you are complaining about something that generally would need to be done. A Voldemort that Harry and the readers cannot somewhat at least sympathize with is a Voldemort that a non-evil Harry probably wouldn't get together with, and would be difficult to believe as readers if he did, thus breaking the all important suspension of disbelief. Not that it couldn't happen, if one is explicitly writing a toxic romance story. But if that's not what's being written, than Voldemort or Harry will need to be changed as a character.

​

Also, you seem to be under the mistaken premise that being a victim justifies being evil, it doesn't. Just because someone has a tragic backstory or has "good" or "noble" reason for doing so, that doesn't make it okay to do the things Voldemort did. So, it people want to make Voldemort an anti-villian, anti-hero, etc. That's their prerogative as the writer of the fic. I've long had an idea for a travel to an alternate timeline fic, where Harry gets with a female Tom Riddle, who was raised by her mother, and thus isn't the evil bastard we all know. Is that story idea bad, just because neither Harry nor Riddle are evil?
