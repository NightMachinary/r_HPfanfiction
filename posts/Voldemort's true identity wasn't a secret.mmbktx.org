Lets look at the facts, Voldemort may have been incognito in the first war but it is abundantly clear by even PS that multiple prominent characters knew Voldemort's identity of Tom Riddle

-Dumbledore (obviously) -Ollivander clearly knows as he discusses the "twin wand to harrys" giving him the scar, hence he knows its Riddles wand ergo he knows riddle is voldemort -Hagrid talks about Voldemort being a member of Slytherin in PS, this is later elaborated on in CoS - the original inner circle of death eaters, abraxas malfoy (?) other slytherin alumni of the mid 40s would have been recruited by riddle before he took his nome de guerre - his former customers / employers at borgin and burkes, it is not unreasonable to assume that riddle would be recognised by these people if a photo of him was ever released (which one must have realistically) and it appears out of character for voldemort to disguise himself when not possessing people, this is admittedly a weaker point than the others - his current inner circle of death eaters, they are after all, invited to Tom Riddle Sr's grave, not something to do if you're attempting to hide your identity

All in all stop writing scenes where you "reveal his real name and blood status" to epicly own voldemort, everyone already knows and dont care, fascists are perfectly capable of doublethink. I do think its reasonable to write his character as intentionally surpressing knowledge of his "filthy muggle fathers name" however so thats a point


** Tom Riddle disappeared as a handsome, older man and returned 10 years later as a red-eyed, ghostlike snake. In that 10 years he'd transitioned to Lord Voldemort. People, at the very least, identified him as such.

The majority of the people you've named have a reason to know who he was and would have known pre-PS. They were connected to him in some form or fashion. I'm sure if asked Fudge, Umbridge, McGongall, Crouch, etc. who Tom Riddle was they'd be lost.

** Voldemort didn't really make an effort to hide his identity or past to those he interacts with. The thing is that his tactic is to spread terror through uncertainty. It's like during his reign in DH. He rarely reveals himself to anyone but his inner circle and usually when he does that person will likely die. So it would make quite a lot of sense that most of the general public wouldn't make the connection between the handsome, charming and polite boy and the darkest lord of the century.

** It has always been very easy to fake your identity in the real world before the internet became popular. Just in 2008, there was even a random German dude that successfully pretended to be a Rockefeller heir! There is speculation that some of the paintings he donated were fakes and are still on display at museums today. There was also a woman in England in the 1930s who lied about her age and nobody knew she was 20 years older than she said until after she died. Including her husband! (She was about 5'2‚Äù so it might not have been as ridiculous as it sounds.)

It is absolutely feasible that someone in the magical world could change their identity without any trouble.

*** There was a case in Turkey where a guy printed a fake diploma and worked for the government as a surgeon for over a decade.

**** Yeah, it can be so easy. Pretty sure there was a plastic surgeon in Miami that was arrested just the other day because she botched someone's rhinoplasty. And it turned out she wasn't certified.

** Certainly not from his Death Eaters. At least not after his second rise. Most of them were at the graveyard where Voldemort says his father is a muggle.

*** Book Riddle mentions hating having the same name as his muggle father, having such an obviously mugglish name would immediately damage his standing with purebloods and put up barriers to his progress, though in all honestly i dont understand how voldemort is better in that case. could also have been a backup plan if being voldemort didnt work out and he needed to go back to being riddle while the heat cooled off him and his activities. but in reality i think that JKR realised that having someones birth name be voldemort was a bit much /even for wizards/

**** Yeah... I think there might have been a small chance Harry not knowing his real name in COS when he notices the name in the award, but the whole wizarding community had to know certainly. Come on, they all went to the same school!
