I really enjoyed Ingenio Ab Artifex where Harry was a vaguely mad artist, so are there any more fics where Harry has some creative side? Doesn't have to be traditional painter-sketcher skills, anything that comes under the banner of 'art' would do. Musical Harry is also acceptable, though if he is that guy who plays Wonderwall at parties at the drop of a hat, please pre-warn. :)

*** Is it worth registering for fanficauthors, do you think? I've heard of the site a few times, but never bothered really to ask much about it.

**** There's a lot of really enjoyable stories on that site that aren't available anywhere else so it's worth the five seconds to register in my opinion. It's basically dead though. It hasn't been any updates on there in like years.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]] is a Drarry fic and kind of takes a while to get into him being actually artistic, but it's very well written and super duper cute.
