Hey everyone, I just want to start off by saying that I absolutely love this subreddit. It has helped me find several stories that have absolutely taken over my life for days at a time. What I propose to do here, is to have everyone in this subreddit either post or PM me a few of their favorite Fics, which I will then combine into one master post. If its receives a good enough response, and I do a good enough job on it, we could hopefully get it posted in the useful links section on the sidebar. I want to see your favorite fics of any type, whether its AU, slash, romance, action, mystery, crossover, oneshot, novel length, anything goes! I want this post to have something for everyone. All I ask is that you post one or two of your favorites(or more- it just makes my job more satisfying!) and state what kind of story it is, seeing as how, no matter how much I would love too, there is no way I'll be able to read all of them. Just basic themes, like when it takes place, ships if it is relevant to the story, and if you are feeling incredibly hard-working or driven, maybe even a tiny synopsis of the plot. I see posts all the time about "What are your guys' favorite fics?" and I feel like if we all band together and make one super mega awesome thread of epicness here, we'll save everyone a lot of time, and plus, this kind of thing might spark quite a few conversations among the redditors here, whether its a healthy debate about ships (keep it civil, you hooligans), or just a massive fangirling/fanboying session about how perfect the Harmony ship is (sorry, had to throw that in somewhere.) Please guys, come out and support! This thread could help you guys find some of the best stories out there, but only if you help everyone else!

(The characters here just seem so... real. They are not perfect, but you love them even more for this. Even though sometimes you'd really like to strangle them).

Something is 'wrong,' with Harry. He's hearing voices. or rather, a voice. Its telling him he's been on the wrong side since the beginning. Harry doesn't believe it. But for how long? Dark!Harry, eventual HP/LV slash. Don't like don't read. Complete with epilogue. Sequel up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion]] HP/HG

Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3151866/1/Unintentionally-Yours]] HP/LV

What if Voldemort has found another way to get what he wants? What if he wants something else now? He proposes a contract to insure peace between the Light and the Dark and of course it involves Harry... HPTR or HPLV slash...

** The fanfics I can recommend, in no particular order

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4380964/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Dungeon-of-Merlin-s-Mist][The Albus Potter Series]] by Vekin87 (link to the first of seven parts) EPIC continuation story about the adventures of Albus Potter and his friends.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4098039/1/Harry-Potter-The-Fifth-Element][Harry Potter and the fifth element]] Sixth year fic. Examines H/Hr in context of his unwanted wealth and fame, and her need for independence. H struggles for magical control over a mysterious, powerful fifth element, receives an inheritance and has a dalliance that ends in disaster.

This is a good story, but so DAMN LONG that I never finished it. (1.2 mio words)

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=7460&chapterid=&agree=1][Love lost. Love found.]] One of my favorite H/Hr stories and by far the best multiverse story I know.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister][Unlike a sister]] Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now, Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language. Unfortunately not finished and not updated since last April.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594634/1/FINDING-HIMSELF][Finding himself]] The-Boy-Who-Almost-Died has to figure out what it means that he didn't. Harry's tumultuous 5th year at Hogwarts is Cedric's 7th and final. Bound together by shared trauma, both boys fall under Ministry suspicion ... Who is Cedric Diggory? Cedric!Lives AU

Finally, two crossovers with Middle-earth:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2899679/1/To-Face-the-Wolf][To face the wolf]]In the Hogwarts dungeons, Snape finds a mysterious, badly wounded stranger. He appears to be bitten by a werewolf. What happened? Timeframe: Prisoner of Azkaban. Crossover with Tolkien's Silmarillion. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6335808/1/The-Wizard-in-the-Shadows][The wizard in the shadows]]After the Second Wizarding War, Harry goes to Middle Earth for a little R&R away from it all. He was told it was peaceful. He was wrong. He then spends four years fighting in the North. When the Ring is discovered, a war for the sake of two worlds begins with Harry at it's centre.

Also, I can recommend "Backwards with purpose", which already has been recommended.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The_Life_and_Times]]

Work in Progress

This is a Marauder Era fanfiction. It is about when James, Sirius and Lupin are at school. Right now it only has 34 chapters and she only updates like once every 6 months but it is still a great read! Story sticks fairly close to what you could have guessed times would be like then based on the original series by JK

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7919030/1/Resistance]]

Complete

This story is about what happens during book 7 while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out hunting horcruxes. It is told from mostly Nevilles point of view. It's pretty much exactly what you would imagine went on while you were reading about what the trio was up to. It starts off at Bill and Fleurs wedding and ends just after the Battle of Hogwarts.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/16/On_the_Way_to_Greatness]]

Work in Progress

This is an alternate universe fanfiction. It's the entire series written as if Harry had been sorted into Slytherin instead, and it's amazing! I actually found that I liked this version of Harry a bit more than the one in the original series. He is just a lot more of a badass and much less of a whiny bitch. Beware though because this fanfiction is 10 chapters shy of being complete. You end after reading one chapter of year six.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4315906/1/Dumbledores_Army_and_the_Year_of_Darkness]]

Complete

This is another version of what happens at Hogwarts during year 7 from Nevilles POV. It is much darker than the fanfiction resistance, but I actually enjoyed the intensity of it. Very good read, it is complete with 25 chapters.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize]]

Complete

This is a completely amazing one shot about Dennis Creevey and other members of the DA and I believe some from the Order of the Phoenix. Basically Dennis takes pictures of the scars left behind from the second war, its beautiful and touching despite being around 1,600 words.
