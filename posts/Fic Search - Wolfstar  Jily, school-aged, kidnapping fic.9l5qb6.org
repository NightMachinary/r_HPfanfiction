This has been driving me crazy for months. I can't remember the name or where it was hosted, but I can give some details:

- Wolfstar & Jily, still in school
- While out to dinner with James' parents (for his birthday maybe?) there is a Death Eater attack and James and Sirius are captured
- Remus and Lily support each other while they are gone
- After they are found, there are scenes in the Hospital Wing as they drink toasts to the various Death Eaters who hurt them while they were in captivity
- While in captivity, Sirius was raped by Lucius - James objects to toasting him, but Sirius argues that the whole point is to include everyone who hurt them
- James overhears Remus and Sirius fooling around and gets mad at Remus for wanting to hurt Sirius by having sex with him - Sirius has to explain to the dorm at large that it doesn't always hurt

Any leads would be much appreciated! If you have no idea and you just want to comment a favorite fic rec regardless, I would take those too :)
