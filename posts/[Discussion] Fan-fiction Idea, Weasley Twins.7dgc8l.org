I am listening to the books again and had a fun thought.

What if George came back to teach Charms at Hogwarts after hearing that a new ghost has been seen on Campus.

Imagine a short story of George and ghost-fred running amuck around the school. What do you think?


** Fred doesn't strike me as the type to become a ghost, but if we make allowances for the premise's sake the story /could/ be very good.

** It's not a fun thought really, I get sad whenever I think about Fred after all this time.

You can give it a shot, though!

** Well, not quite that, but you might enjoy linkffn(seeing ghosts by story please). Starts sad, ends happy. Outsider POV, to start. But it does have a Fred in Hogwarts.

  Fred and George are so inseparable that most people say their names as some kind of a set. Fred&George. Twins, brothers, business partners. Then the War strikes and nothing is ever the same again. Just when George is finally coming to terms with all that has happened, can it be that Fred is back? Or is it just another loose end come back to haunt him?
