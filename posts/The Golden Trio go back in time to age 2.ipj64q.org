They wake up in their childhood beds as tiny toddlers. Harry's parents are still alive. Harry can only say a few words. The Trio still have their Animagus forms from adulthood; Harry is a falcon, Ron is a lion. Hermione's parents are still obliviated, though, so she gets adopted by Mad-Eye Moody (someone startled her and she set them on fire; he admires her CONSTANT VIGILANCE at two years old). Pettigrew gets caught and they all live happily ever after.

It was on AO3, but I forgot to bookmark it and it's not in the last 100 fics I read. Hopefully someone recognizes it.


** That sounds interesting! I hope someone recognises it!
