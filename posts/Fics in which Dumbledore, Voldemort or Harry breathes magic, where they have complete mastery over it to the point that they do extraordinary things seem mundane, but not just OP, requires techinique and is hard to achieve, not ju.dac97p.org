#+TITLE: Fics in which Dumbledore, Voldemort or Harry breathes magic, where they have complete mastery over it to the point that they do extraordinary things seem mundane, but not just OP, requires techinique and is hard to achieve, not just power boosts. I'd like specializations between them. Just no slash.

Please no Dumbledore bashing. NO H/HR !


** Alchemy. True transmutation, not a mere magical shell. An ability, long honed by decades of study, to look at a thing, or a magic, and perfectly understand what it is, where it came from, and what it can become.\\
Albus Dumbledore is a master of alchemy, but more importantly, he is a master of the alchemist's mindset; visualising the flow of magic, shaping the environment to deprive his opponents of the opportunity to use their most powerful spells, bewitching entire battlefields to act according to his whim.

Horcruxes. The gateway to the darkest magic. To store a sliver of soul inside a receptacle and experiment upon it, twisting it into a corrupt shard that can channel the most abominable and destructive of energies, magicks that would horrifically burn a healthy soul.\\
Voldemort has created not one, but six Horcruxes, channelling vile power through each to perform horrible mockeries of traditional rituals; brainwashing innocents and warping animals into heartless fiends, laying curses and carving wounds that never heal, spreading poison across the land, and warping time, fate and fortune itself.

Love. Compassion, courage, adoration. A mighty force for all its intangibility, true love can drive a being to rise and prevail against insurmountable odds, provide determination enough to withstand any bewitchment, from the Dementor's cold to the Imperius's control.\\
Harry Potter's heart is filled with love; despite the Dursleys' neglect, his being swells with unconditional empathy for all those around him. His inclination to benevolence is such that it resonates with the magic around him, answering his kind heart with kindness in turn, hostile curses refusing to do him harm and his own spells flying strong and sure.

A man who fights with learned wisdom, shaping the world with a gentle hand to serve his needs.\\
A monster who fights with sheer power, tearing the world apart with his alien, twisted magic that is so antithetical to life.\\
A boy who fights with only courage, who inspires the world around him with his pure heart to grant him hidden strength and fortune.

** This is somewhat the idea behind linkffn(Mind Arts)

Harry has a natural talent for mental magic that grows over the series but also begins to specialize. He starts by trying to replicate a dementor's decaying effect before branching out in to other areas: trying to control elements like the various magical creatures.

Similarly Dumbledore admits to specializing in magical artifacts, Grindewald mentions conjuration and space manipulation, and Voldemort shows to be a master of rituals by experimenting on Barth Crouch. There's even an OC villain who can control metals.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files
