While I'm waiting for it to update, I'd love to read something similar, either / and / time travel,druid Harry, historic stuff, Lords and ladies (but actual impact not just titles for the sake of titles).

Prefer complete but if its currently being updated then that's cool.


** Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower. The series itself is not finished, but it's comprised of 8 complete parts and all in all over a million words in length. While its not all history, when it does crop up, its pretty damn good and well researched.
