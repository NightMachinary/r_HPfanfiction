I keep encountering these things in story after story so I thought I'd vent about it here. Add on your favorite mistakes!

A person IS a Parselmouth and SPEAKS Parseltongue. In addition, it is 'parsel' and not 'parcel'. It's not a package after all.

A person IS an Occlumens and USES Occlumency. Likewise they are a Legilimens and use Legilimency. The spell is also /Legilimens/. My eye twitches every time someone writes Snape pointing his wand at Harry and shouting 'Occlumens!'

Wary and weary may only be a letter apart but the meanings are very different. I'm so tired (weary!) Of seeing characters written as looking at people /wearily/ when the author is trying to convey suspicion. That would be /warily/.

Banishing is the opposite of summoning. It doesn't make anything disappear! That would be 'vanishing'. Each spell is even detailed in Canon:

- Summon: /Accio/ - Bring an object towards you.
- Banish: /Depulso/ - Push an object away from you.
- Vanish: /Evanesco/ - make an object disappear.

Some people might be thinking of banishing a spirit, but it's an entirely different usage of the word.

One last thing, the American equivalent for snogging is 'making out'. A more general definition would be: 'kissing amorously'. It doesn't mean sex, and it makes zero sense to have a young couple have a "chaste snog" when you mean a gentle peck on the lips.

Thank you for sharing my frustrations and have a lovely day.

If the author has no beta, it's hard for them to see their own errors, they have just stared at it too long and see what they expect to see. Hence, a good edition/beta is worth their weight in gold.

However, I think referring to an unforgivable by it's incantation could result in you having wands pointed at you. How would a listener with their back turned know you're refering to vs casting the curse?

*** Well, to be fair he is ranting on reddit and not in the reviews on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. English isn't my native language either so spelling mistakes don't bother me so much. Anyone can press the wrong key. It happens.

What /does/ bother me though is consistently making the same grammar mistakes over and over again. I can understand once or twice, but more than that and it can get really irritating. The worst I remember was an author that just kept using "you was" instead of "you were". Another one just couldn't figure the difference between than/ then. And then there is the good, old its/ it's debacle. Surely if foreigners can learn to do it then people who literally grew up with the language can do it too.

Authors, MS Word has a very useful function called "Replace". If you make the same mistake over and over again you can use it to fix it all instead of going through the text one by one. Most text editors (and browsers) also have a "Search" function which you can use by hitting Ctrl+F.

BTW What is it with people misspelling Umbridge's name? It's "Dolores" (from latin "[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dolor#Latin][dolor]]") and I've seen so many variations of it like Doloris, Delores, Deloris, etc. I'm fully expecting to see "Delorean" one day.

** It is worth keeping in mind that English isn't native language for many fan fiction writers.

But writers should always try to get a beta to review and help them with story & grammar.

One thing that really annoys me is when people can't get names right. This is sign of not just lacking language skills, but just plain being lazy.

** I know I'm probably going to enrage you by even saying it, but what about when people misuse basic, grade-school-level homophones, homonyms, or homographs? What about grammar? Like mixing up tenses. ("I wish I could have been there"... Ugh) That stuff is not fun to read.

I know, not nearly as specific as yours, but I can't stand errors like that. And yes, call me a grammar freak. It's okay üôÉ

As a (partial) remedy, I suggest the homophonesweakly blog to everyone. Funny, engaging little comics to visually help everyone understand the differences between various homophones, homonyms, and homographs. As for grammar, uh... Well there are various websites for that. Pick your favorite

**** It flows a little oddly because it uses the wrong tense. Besides, I DID say I'm a grammar freak. "I wish I /had/ been there" is the correct way to express a counterfactual wish about the past [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_of_English_verb_forms][Wikipedia]]. Scroll down to the "Expressions of Wish" section

Also, Ignisami brings up a good point. In dialogue, the rules are less strict, mostly because people often don't speak with absolutely perfect grammar. In that case, it works. But otherwise, the alternative I mentioned is the essay to express the same thing
