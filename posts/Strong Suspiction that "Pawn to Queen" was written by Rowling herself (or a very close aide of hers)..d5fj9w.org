** u/TheCuddlyCanons:
#+begin_quote
  It is incomplete. Anybody who has invested their time in so much detail would not just leave such a good piece of work abandoned
#+end_quote

There's so many extremely well written and detailed fics that have been abandoned. Hell, it sometimes seems like all the best ones are abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  It is THE first one to note that Hermione came of age earlier than others because of Time Turner
#+end_quote

But that's never mentioned at all in canon. Plus you have to consider the petrification from the year before that at least somewhat balancing her time turner aging

Goblet of fire included Karkaroff, a known death eater, discussing his dark mark with Snape. Voldemort later mentions a Death Eater who he believes to be gone forever, and Dumbledore tells Snape that 'he knows what he has to do'. The clues are all there

As far as Legilimency goes, the books are sprinkled with the odd reference to Snape somehow appearing to know what people are thinking

I haven't read said fic myself. But why on Earth would Rowling write, and abandon, a fanfiction while she's in the midst of writing another book for the same series? People can sometimes have correct guesses, assumptions, or even just not care about being right and get it right by accident.

*** I would like to point out that your last paragraph isn't entirely a mark against it being written by her (though the rest of your comment rings true). There are a number of authors, both fanfic and real who juggle multiple stories at a time. For all we know JKR had some crazy idea that would never actually sell but wanted to write it and show to the world anyways, though I don't think it is this fic.

*** Also she didn't "come of age" earlier because of the Time Turner, she's just almost a year older than Harry.

** That's just a paraphrase of a quote from Chapter 13 of Philosopher's Stone, when Harry suspects Snape of reading his mind to know he'd found out about the Stone.

I'm pretty sure theorists had guessed Snape's true allegiance ages ago. There are enough hints scattered throughout the books from the beginning.

** Where did you get this idea that people don't abandon good works? Writers are busy, writers decide to direct their talents in different directions, etc. I was following a great story that ended with a note from the author's son saying his father had died, so the story would never be finished.
