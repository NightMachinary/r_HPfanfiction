** Seriously.

I'm not going to go into the moral implications, but isn't it just... boring? Usually Harry ends up /acquiring/ these women with barely any struggle, leads to repetitive smut, leads to a shit ton of useless drama, etc.

Half of the LF on this subreddit involves some kind of plot /but Harem is a bonus/.

Why are their so few stories where a female has a male harem?

*** It's the ultimate male wish fulfillment fantasy. And most authors don't have enough sense of restraint so they write massive harems with Lord!Harry steamrolling the opposition.

The female counterpart to this fantasy wouldn't be a male harem, it would be a super rich and handsome guy falling for an average girl, e.g. Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey.

Except it is. Most fanfic writing is about wish fullfillment. The most basic answers to your questions come down to:

"Why are there so many female-harems?" -- Because a bunch of men are writing male-wish fullfillment, which involves sex with a lot of women.

"Why are there so few male-harems?" -- Because a bunch of women are writing female-wish fullfillment, which does not involve sex with lots of men.

The few male-harem fics out there are likely written by the handful of people who do enjoy the thought of a woman having a harem, or by people exploring trope-subversion. These people are going to be far fewer than the amount of folks writing wish fullfillment

**** look at anime and manga the average shonen romance (boy's comic) is about an average/looser who some how ends up with an harem of beautiful popular girls the average shojo romance is about a average/looser girl who somehow catches the eye of the hottest guy in school and latter (when she is going out with the hot guy) another hot guy falls for her

there are some reverse harems but they are rare and not that popular.

and why do the japs keep regurgitating the same shit season after season? ....

well..

because it sells

so why do people write so many harems? well because people actually like them as simple as that

The way I see it is, one of the main purposes in a successful harem is to produce children. One husband impregnating several wives, is SO much better than one woman only becoming pregnant once a year or so by one husband, when there are multiple husbands who would have to wait.

***** They don't have that fantasy, but most harem stories have a common theme that Harry needs to produce heirs for more than one family name (Potter, Black, Peverell, Gryffindor, etc.) He can take four different wives and have more than one child for each line to rebuild them. If there was a female in that situation, it doesn't matter how many husbands she has, she's only having one baby at a time, so multiple husbands doesn't have a purpose. But again, the fantasy isn't having a bunch of children, the fantasy is having sex with a bunch of women. The needing children is just the excuse to form the harem and have all the sex.

And for fanfiction based on a coming of age story, that's definitely more normal and common than the idea of shipping. How many people meet their one and only in their first relationship? Almost no one. Having a story where the main character that's growing through some of his most formative years have multiple relationships is much more realistic than the other way around.

** I've no proof for this, but I'd hazard a guess that they started becoming more prevalent when the gender of writers in the community shifted to feature more men than in the past.

Essentially, yes, it's wish fulfilment.

To take a slightly darker look at it, it takes characters and a franchise originally written by a woman, with fully realized characters, and reduces the female characters to flat stereotypes pining after Designated Male Hero, just as female characters are often written in media written by men and aimed at men (action movies, etc.) are.

I don't believe I've ever read a harem story centering around a woman or young girl and her ever-increasing collection of husbands or male sex slaves. To be honest I'm not a fan of them, as you can probably tell.

First off.... Harry/Multi does not necessarily mean "Harem". At times it simply means Harry with Multiple partners over the course of a story. It may also mean Harry in a Polygamous relationship. Polygamy does not equal a Harem. That said, i may be splitting hairs on the definitions but just wanted to point that out.

--------------

Now secondly... usually Harem stories are simply based on wish fulfillment and imagination. I wont go into too much detail here because many others have explained this or debated this very reason. Fan fiction is literally BASED around wish fulfillment. People write and read stories that are either based around what they wished would have happened (think, a relationship pairing you would of rather seen than the cannon one), OR use it to explore new ideas and concepts.

--------------

However diving deeper into Harems in general, while it may have some basis in wish fulfillment, there are also Harem stories where the Harem happens because of the world the story is set in.

-- For example, the idea of "spreading your seed" as it were (on the male side). The more women, the more babies to carry a powerful line or lines.

-- Another example is that in the Wizarding world, there is the general sense that they are a bit hung up in the past, where women may have been considered second class citizens. Aka a "Male driven" society. As such, the idea of a Harem becomes more likely to occur.

-- A third example would be that there are simply more witches than wizards (another "implied" component of cannon like the previous men vrs women example). Because wizards fight more, there are fewer wizards, and provided the story enhances this component, than it would make sense for 1 wizard to be with more than 1 witch.

--------------

So there are many reasons why and while its likely based in wish fulfillment at its roots, it goes much deeper than that.

** Aside from various things already mentioned I think Naruto's popularity at the same time as heights of Harry Potters lead to a sort of cross-pollination. Harems are easy in Naruto fanfiction where he can be in multiple places simultaneously, and many Harry Potter writers were inspired to write harems as well.

*** It doesn't /bother/ me, it's just a fetish that I don't understand the appeal of. I tend to be a pretty average guy in terms of taste, so it feels strange that so many people like something that I find /utterly boring/.

I'm not trying to start a witch hunt, I'm trying to see if there's anyone who can explain why they like it.
