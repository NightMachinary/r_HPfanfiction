I always, always, always see stories about how Harry and Hermione are shipped together, and then Ron gets bashed to kingdom come. And then, there are the stories where Harry suddenly realizes that Ron and Hermione have been evil the whole time and pointedly isolates himself from them in the favor of some random, usually OC third party. Or maybe you get a story where he's all good buds with Ron, but Hermione sort of plays third-string in the background because her nose is stuck in a book. Can I have a fic that actually focuses on the friendship and bond that the THREE of them have? Like, y'know, how the original seven books does? Thanks all!


** There's linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow; Three's the Charm by MissCHSparkles) Also, to a lesser extent there's linkffn(A Study in Magic by Books of Change). The Trio friendship isn't the focus in that one, but Harry has a good friendship with Ron and Hermione, plus Neville and an OC.

*** Forging the Sword is my favorite, I just reread it today and I have never found such a well written fanfic.... I just love the friendship and magic exploration.

*** I've just read "Three's the Charm" and like it very much. It's delightfully original in how the three go at changing the timeline, not just with the actions they take, but also with the characterizations of the cast.

I would like some recs for this. In most fanfiction I see very little of Ron and far more of Hermione than than I would like.
